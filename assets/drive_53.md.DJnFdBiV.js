It is the zone of a church accessible by the laity. - A parish is a church territorial unit constituting a division within a diocese. A parish is under the pastoral care and clerical jurisdiction of a parish priest, who might be assisted by one or more curates, and who operates from a parish church. Historically, a parish often covered the same geographical area as a manor (its association with the parish church remaining paramount). - Minor basilica (in plural) is a title given to some Roman Catholic church buildings. According to canon law, no church building can be honoured with the title of basilica unless by apostolic grant or from immemorial custom. Presently, the authorising decree is granted by the Pope through the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments. - The Roman Catholic Diocese of Orlando is a Roman Catholic diocese in Florida. It was established on June 18, 1968. Prior to that the Central Florida area was part of the Diocese of St. Augustine. Today the diocese encompasses nine counties including Orange, Osceola, Seminole, Marion, Lake, Volusia, Brevard, Polk, and Sumter, a total of about . William Borders, the first Bishop of the diocese, claimed in 1969 to Pope Paul VI that the then-active 1917 Code of Canon Law placed newly explored territory under the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the port of departure, making the Diocese of Orlando responsible for the moon following the flight of Apollo 11. If true, the total area of the diocese would be , making it the largest Catholic diocese in existence. In 2010, the diocese contained 81 parishes, 10 missions, and 37 schools. St. James Cathedral serves as the seat of the diocese. Within the diocese are two minor basilicas, Mary, Queen of the Universe Shrine, a basilica which ministers to Catholic tourists, and St. Paul's in Daytona Beach. - The Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments is the congregation of the Roman Curia that handles most affairs relating to liturgical practices of the Latin Church as distinct from the Eastern Catholic Churches and also some technical matters relating to the Sacraments. Its functions were originally exercised by the Sacred Congregation of Rites, set up in January 1588 by Pope Sixtus V. - A pastor is usually an ordained leader of a Christian congregation. When used as an ecclesiastical styling or title, the term may be abbreviated to \\"Pr\\" (singular) or \\"Ps\\" (plural). A pastor also gives advice and counsel to people from the community or congregation. - A parish church (or parochial church) in Christianity is the church which acts as the religious centre of a parish. In many parts of the world, especially in rural areas, the parish church may play a significant role in community activities, often allowing its premises to be used for non-religious community events. The church building reflects this status, and there is considerable variety in the size and style of parish churches. Many villages in Europe have churches that date back to the Middle Ages, but all periods of architecture are represented. - The Basilica of the National Shrine of Mary , Queen of the Universe is a Latin Rite basilica located in Orlando , Florida at 8300 Vineland Avenue . It was built to service the large number of Catholic tourists who visit the attractions in the Greater Orlando area . While it is a 2,000 seat church of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orlando and provides Mass for the faithful , it has also become a regional tourist attraction . In 2009 , it was designated as the 63rd minor basilica in the United States . Since it is not a parish , no regular sacraments are performed , and no weekly bulletins are distributed . The Shrine consists of the main church , the Rosary Garden , the Mother & Child Outdoor Chapel , the Blessed Sacrament Chapel , the Shrine Museum , and a gift shop . - The Latin word basilica (derived from Greek , lit. \\"royal stoa\\", serving as the tribunal chamber of a king) has three distinct applications in modern English. The word was originally used to describe an ancient Roman public building where courts were held, as well as serving other official and public functions. To a large extent these were the town halls of ancient Roman life. The basilica was centrally located in every Roman town, usually adjacent to the main forum. These buildings, an example of which is the Basilica Ulpia, were rectangular, and often had a central nave and aisles, usually with a slightly raised platform and an apse at each of the two ends, adorned with a statue perhaps of the emperor, while the entrances were from the long sides. - The pope (from \\"pappas\\", a child's word for \\"father\\") is the Bishop of Rome and, therefore, the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church. The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \\"binding and loosing\\", naming him as the \\"rock\\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI. - The word diocese is derived from the Greek term \\"\\" meaning \\"administration\\". When now used in an ecclesiastical sense, it refers to a territorial unit of administration. In the Western Church, the district is under the supervision of a bishop (who may have assistant bishops to help him or her) and is divided into parishes under the care of priests; but in the Eastern Church, the word denotes the area under the jurisdiction of a patriarch and the bishops under his jurisdiction administer parishes. This structure of church governance is known as episcopal polity. Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'religion' with 'latin church'. Answer:","response":"The entity that has the relation 'religion' with 'latin church' is the Roman Catholic Church."},{"question":"In this task, you need to provide the parts-of-speech tag of a word present in a sentence specified within curly braces ( '{{ ... }}' ).

Direct pressure on the Taliban had proved unsuccessful. As one NSC staff note put it, \\"Under the Taliban, Afghanistan is not so much a state sponsor of terrorism as it is a state sponsored by terrorists.\\" In early 2000, the United States began a high-level effort to persuade Pakistan to use its influence over the Taliban. In January 2000, Assistant Secretary of State Karl Inderfurth and the State Department's counterterrorism coordinator, Michael Sheehan, met with General Musharraf in Islamabad, dangling before him the possibility of a presidential visit in March as a reward for Pakistani cooperation. Such a visit was coveted by Musharraf, partly as a sign of his government's legitimacy. He told the two envoys that he would meet with Mullah Omar and press him on Bin Laden. They left, however, reporting to Washington that Pakistan was unlikely in fact to do anything,\\" given what it sees as the benefits of Taliban control of Afghanistan.\\" President Clinton was scheduled to travel to India. The State Department felt that he should not visit India without also visiting Pakistan. The Secret Service and the CIA, however, warned in the strongest terms that visiting Pakistan would risk the President's life. Counterterrorism officials also argued that Pakistan had not done enough to merit a presidential visit. But President Clinton insisted on including Pakistan in the itinerary for his trip to South Asia. His one-day stopover on March 25, 2000, was the first time a U.S. president had been there since 1969. At his meeting with Musharraf and others, President Clinton concentrated on tensions between Pakistan and India and the dangers of nuclear proliferation, but also discussed Bin Laden. President Clinton told us that when he pulled Musharraf aside for a brief, one-on-one meeting, he pleaded with the general for help regarding Bin Laden.\\" I offered him the moon when I went to see him, in terms of better relations with the United States, if he'd help us get Bin Laden and deal with another issue or two.\\" The U.S. effort continued.

Counterterrorism officials argued that Pakistan had not done enough to merit a presidential visit. These two reasons were distinct, with the first being concerned with the safety of the President and the second being focused on the lack of action or cooperation from Pakistan on counterterrorism matters.

Article: Until the 1980s, the American homeless population comprised mainly older males. Today, homelessness strikes much younger part of society. In fact, a 25-city survey by the U. S. Conference of Mayors in 1987 found that families with children make up the fastest growing part of the homeless population. Many homeless children gather in inner cities; this transient and frequently frightened student population creates additional problems -- both legal and educational -- for already overburdened urban school administrators and teachers. Estimates of the number of homeless Americans range from 350,000 to three million. Likewise, estimates of the number of homeless school children vary radically. A U.S. Department of Education report, based on state estimates, states that there are 220,000 homeless school-age children, about a third of whom do not attend school on a regular basis, But the National Coalition for the Homeless estimates that there are at least two times as many homeless children, and that less than half of them attend school regularly. One part of the homeless population that is particularly difficult to count consists of the \\"throwaway\\" youths who have been cast of their homes. The Elementary School Center in New York City estimates that there are 1.5 million of them, many of whom are not counted as children because they do not stay in family shelters and tend to live by themselves on the streets. Federal law, the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act of 1987, includes a section that addresses the educational needs of homeless children. The educational provisions of the McKinney Act are based on the belief that all homeless children have the right to a free, appropriate education. Question: The passage mainly deals with _ .

The text mentions how homelessness affects children’s school attendance, the challenges urban school administrators and teachers face due to this transient student population, and addresses the federal law assisting the educational needs of homeless children. Although the passage does provide some estimates on the homeless population, these are given in the context of understanding the magnitude of the educational problem among homeless children, not as the main topic.

Here is a summary of the proposal as spelled out by Greek government officials. Early retirement to be curbed gradually from 2016 to 2025, but exemptions for some specific categories to be maintained, including for arduous professions and mothers with disabilities. A special benefit for some low-income pensioners, amounting to between 57 to 230 euros (64.66 to 260.89) a month to remain but to be replaced from 2020 by new protection framework for low pensions. This is a key point of friction between Greece and its lenders, who wanted it scrapped. Greece to keep three value added tax rates of 23 percent, 13 percent and 6 percent. Electricity and restaurants to be taxed at 13 percent instead of being raised to 23 percent, as lenders had demanded, while medicines to be cut to 6 percent rather than raised to 11 percent as sought by lenders. Officials said lenders were asking for two rates of 11 percent and 23 percent. TAX HIKE FOR HIGH EARNERS Solidarity tax for higher income earners (revenues above 50,000 euros (56,710) to be increased, while lowering the tax for revenues below 30,000 euros. It introduces a solidarity tax of 8 percent on revenues above 500,000 euros. Tax plans to include: a) a special levy of 12 percent on businesses that post a profit of over 500,000 euros; b) Increases in luxury tax on pools, planes, big cars and private boats over 10 meters (33 feet); c) a tax on gambling slot machines (VLTs). Privatisations to impose a minimum amount of investment, a commitment by investors to promote the local economy and a participation of public equity. The transfer of Greece's state equity in Greek telecoms operator to the country's privatisation agency will not be part of the lenders' prior actions. Greece will not privatise its power grid operator (ADMIE) nor its dominant power utility PPC, as requested by creditors. No cuts to public sector wages from levels at end-2014. Cut defence spending by 200 million euros. Primary budget surplus of 1 percent in 2015 and 2 percent in 2016, compared with 3 percent and 4.5 percent agreed to by previous Greek governments. Greece repeated demand for euro zone to lend it money to buy back 27 billion euros of its bonds from European Central Bank - effectively rolling-over the debt on more favourable terms. Greece wants deal to include financing of infrastructure and new technologies through an investment package from the European Commission and the European Investment Bank. According to leaked proposals on Greek websites, Greece also planned to increase pension contributions to cash in 605 million euros this year and 1.56 billion euros next year. Spending cuts and tax revenues would produce budget measures equivalent to 2.69 billion euros or 1.51 percent of GDP this year and 5.2 billion euros or 2.87 percent of GDP in 2016, up from 1.99 billion or 1.1 percent of GDP and 3.58 billion euros or 2 percent of GDP previously.

Solve -51*a + 115 + 220 = -22 for a.","response":"To solve the equation -51*a + 115 + 220 = -22 for a, we will follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms on the left-hand side of the equation. -51*a + 115 + 220 = (-51*a) + (115 + 220) -51*a + 335 = -22 Step 2: Isolate the variable (a) by moving the constants to the right-hand side of the equation. To do this, subtract 335 from both sides of the equation: -51*a + 335 - 335 = -22 - 335 -51*a = -357 Step 3: Solve for a by dividing both sides of the equation by -51.

It is best known for its two uniquely-patterned and colored broods or generations per year, with the spring brood differing significantly from the summer brood. In this passage, we will delve into an extensive and comprehensive examination of the spring brood of the Map Butterfly. The spring brood of Map Butterflies typically emerges between April and June, depending on the climatic conditions of their specific geographic locations. This generation is characterized by their rich orange and brown hues, with intricate patterns on their wings, mimicking dead leaves or tree bark to camouflage themselves from predators. The formation of these unique patterns is attributed to various factors such as environmental cues, hormones, and genetic elements. With a wingspan of approximately 40 to 45 millimeters (1.6 to 1.8 inches), the spring brood features markings that resemble maps, hence the name Map Butterfly. The upperside of the wings displays a vivid orange background, with a series of dark wavy lines, spots, and streaks creating an extraordinary pattern. The underside of their wings has a more subdued coloration, showcasing a brown to grayish background with a series of lighter speckles. The Map Butterfly's spring brood displays sexual dimorphism, which means that the males and females exhibit slight differences in appearance. While males generally have a darker coloring on their wings, females showcase a more vibrant orange hue. Additionally, females also possess broader wings compared to males. The larvae of the spring brood, which are usually green or brown with white and black markings, feed primarily on stinging nettles (Urtica dioica) as their primary food source. However, they have also been known to consume other plants within the Urticaceae family. Powered by this nutritious diet, the caterpillars grow through several stages or instars before transforming into a pupa. The pupal stage, also called the chrysalis, is typically well-camouflaged and blends in with the surrounding vegetation. During the adult butterfly stage, the spring brood of Map Butterflies typically feeds on the nectar of a variety of flowering plants. Favorites include dandelions, wild thyme, and bird's foot trefoil, among others. These butterflies are known for their smooth and gentle flight patterns, frequently taking advantage of the warm sunny spells during spring. Map Butterflies exhibit unique behavior during the spring brood, with their crepuscular nature allowing them to be active during both the early morning and late afternoon hours. This activity pattern helps them evade predation while also providing ample opportunity to search for nectar and mates. In conclusion, the spring brood of the Map Butterfly is an enchanting generation of these remarkable insects. Their striking coloration, intricate patterns, and intriguing behavior make them standout among butterfly species. With their ability to adapt their appearance depending on seasonal factors, the Map Butterfly remains a captivating subject for both researchers and nature enthusiasts alike."},{"question":"Given the below context: The Catacombs of Rome contain most of the surviving Christian art of the Early Christian period, mainly in the form of frescos and sculpted sarcophagi. They show a Christian iconography emerging, initially from Roman popular decorative art, but later borrowing from official imperial and pagan motifs. Initially, Christians avoided iconic images of religious figures, and sarcophagi were decorated with ornaments, Christian symbols like the Chi Rho monogram and, later, narrative religious scenes. The Early Christians' habit, after the end of their persecution, of building churches (most famously St Peter's, Rome) over the burial places of martyrs who had originally been buried discreetly or in a mass grave perhaps led to the most distinctive feature of Christian funerary art, the church monument, or tomb inside a church. The beliefs of many cultures, including Judaism and Hinduism as well as classical paganism, consider the dead ritually impure and avoid mixing temples and cemeteries (though see above for Moche, and below for Islamic culture). In the late Middle Ages, influenced by the Black Death and devotional writers, explicit memento mori imagery of death in the forms of skulls or skeletons, or even decomposing corpses overrun with worms in the transi tomb, became common in northern Europe, and may be found in some funerary art, as well as motifs like the Dance of Death and works like the Ars moriendi, or \\"Art of Dying\\". It took until the Baroque period for such imagery to become popular in Italy, in works like the tomb of Pope Urban VIII by Bernini (1628–1647), where a bronze winged skeleton inscribes the Pope's name on a tablet below his enthroned effigy. As cities became more crowded, bones were sometimes recovered after a period, and placed in ossuaries where they might be arranged for artistic effect, as at the Capuchin Crypt in Rome or the Czech Sedlec Ossuary, which has a chandelier made of skulls and bones. Guess a valid title for it!","response":"A valid title for this context could be: \\"Evolution of Early Christian Funerary Art: From Symbolic Imagery to Memento Mori\\""},{"question":"The father of a North Carolina teen whose mutilated body was found on a suburban Boston street said Tuesday he was struggling with the boy's death amid reports authorities were investigating whether the student might have fallen from an aircraft's wheel well. Anthony Tisdale said he last saw his son Delvonte on Nov. 14 when they did yard work together and the family had pizza for dinner. When the 16-year-old failed to return from school the following day, the family called police. The boy's remains were found last week in Milton, Mass., several days after he was reported missing. Other relatives described the boy as being unhappy in North Carolina and having missed Baltimore, a city he had lived in until he was 13. In Boston, Logan International Airport spokesman Phil Orlandella said investigators requested flight path information and were looking into the \\"remote\\" possibility that Delvonte may have fallen from a plane's landing gear well. Anthony Tisdale said at a news conference Tuesday in Charlotte that investigators haven't told his family anything about an airplane and he has no idea how his son ended up near Boston. The district attorney's office in Norfolk, Mass., said an investigation is ongoing but its statement did not address reports that investigators where checking for a possible fall from a plane. Delvonte Tisdale was a member of the Air Force ROTC program at Charlotte's North Mecklenburg High School. His father said the family had moved from Greensboro to Charlotte in the summer just so the teen could join that program. Tisdale said his son was happy to be in Charlotte and loved high school. \\"Being here such a short time and losing my son is very difficult,\\" Anthony Tisdale said, wiping away tears as he spoke with reporters Tuesday. \\"My son was a hardworking young man, he didn't frequent the streets ... he spent time with his family.\\" The teen's brother told The Associated Press by telephone on Tuesday that the teenager was unhappy in North Carolina and had never wanted to leave Baltimore, where he had lived earlier. \\"He was very strict,\\" Anthony Tisdale Jr., 21, also said of his father. \\"My brother hated it there.\\" \\"My brother just wanted to come home,\\" he said, adding the teen \\"just couldn't take it there.'

He associated with a lot of good folk,\\" the father said. Authorities said Tisdale's body suffered \\"massive trauma,\\" but an autopsy didn't report how he died. Asked about the possibility that Tisdale may have fallen from an aircraft, Ann Davis, a spokeswoman for the Transportation Security Administration, said: \\"I'm not aware of that suggestion.\\" She said the TSA was deferring to law enforcement authorities on the matter. John Hansman, a professor of aeronautics and astronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said there have been cases of people stowing away in the wheel well of commercial airplanes and not surviving. Hansman, who isn't one of the investigators on the case, said there is some \\"limited evidence\\" that could support the theory that Tisdale stowed away in a plane's wheel well and fell out as the aircraft passed over Milton, a community several miles from Logan. He said the area where Tisdale's body was found is under the final approach course for one of that airport's runways, where crew would typically be lowering an aircraft's landing gear. Jim Peters, a spokesman for FAA, did not immediately return a call seeking confirmation. ___ AP reporters Denise Lavoie and Mark Pratt in Boston contributed to the story. ||||| Sponsored Links (Nov. 24) -- Relatives and friends of a North Carolina teenager are struggling to understand how his battered body came to be found in an upscale neighborhood in a Boston suburb, as authorities considered the possibility that he was a stowaway who fell from an airplane.The remains of Delvonte Tisdale, a 16-year-old high school sophomore from Charlotte, N.C., were found last week on the street in Milton, Mass., according to media reports.

In addition, it abolished slavery without a civil war. The bitter and sometimes violent racial tensions that have divided the US are notably absent in Brazil. According to the 2010 census, 6.7% of Brazilians said they were black, compared with 6.2% in 2000, and 43.1% said they were racially mixed, up from 38.5%. In 2010, Elio Ferreira de Araujo, Brazil's minister for racial equality, attributed the increases to growing pride among his country's black and indigenous communities. Question: What is happened in the US that did not happen in Brazil when slavery ended?","response":"When slavery ended in the United States and Brazil, the two nations experienced significantly different outcomes in terms of social and racial dynamics. In the United States, the end of slavery was accompanied by a brutal and violent Civil War, which lasted from 1861 to 1865 and resulted in hundreds of thousands of casualties. The war was fought between the Union (Northern states) and the Confederacy (Southern states), primarily over the issue of slavery and states' rights. The victory of the Union led to the abolition of slavery and the eventual passage of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to the United States Constitution, aimed at granting former slaves civil rights and voting rights. Despite these legal advancements, the process of integrating former slaves into American society was arduous and fraught with challenges. The Reconstruction Era that followed the Civil War (1865-1877) was a period of significant political and social upheaval. Although some progress was made in terms of civil rights for African Americans, the period was marked by widespread racial violence, discrimination, and the rise of groups like the Ku Klux Klan, who terrorized and oppressed Black citizens. This violent backlash eventually led to the end of Reconstruction and the implementation of the Jim Crow laws in the Southern states. These laws enforced racial segregation and disenfranchisement of Black citizens, perpetuating inequality and racial tension for nearly a century before the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s. In contrast, Brazil abolished slavery without a civil war in 1888, through the passage of the Lei Áurea (Golden Law), which was the result of a more gradual and peaceful process. Brazil was the last country in the Americas to abolish slavery, and the transition was facilitated by various factors, including economic pressure and international criticism. Despite this peaceful transition, however, racial inequality persisted in Brazil as the economic system shifted from an agrarian, slave-based economy to an urban, wage-based economy. Former slaves faced limited opportunities for social advancement and were often forced into exploitative labor arrangements. One significant factor that differentiates Brazil from the United States in terms of race relations is the widespread acceptance of miscegenation, or the mixing of races, in Brazil. This has led to a more fluid racial identity in Brazil, where a significant portion of the population identifies as \\"racially mixed.\\" According to the 2010 Brazilian census, 43.1% of Brazilians identified as racially mixed, up from 38.5% in 2000. The Brazilian government has even promoted racial mixing as a way to overcome racial tensions and reduce disparities. This acceptance of miscegenation has contributed to a less polarized society in Brazil, where racial identity is not as strictly defined along binary lines (black and white) as it is in the United States. As a result, Brazil has not experienced the same level of bitter and violent racial tensions that have plagued the United States throughout its history. In 2010, Brazil's Minister for Racial Equality, Elio Ferreira de Araujo, attributed the increases in self-identified black and indigenous populations to growing pride among these communities. In summary, the United States experienced a violent Civil War and subsequent periods of racial violence, segregation, and discrimination following the abolition of slavery, whereas Brazil abolished slavery peacefully and has since developed a social fabric characterized by a more fluid racial identity. While both countries still struggle with racial inequalities, Brazil's acceptance of miscegenation and less binary understanding of racial categories have contributed to notably different social dynamics when compared to the United States."},{"question":"Premise: \\"Did he have to settle for UCLA, Santa Cruz or, God forbid, one of the Cal State campuses?\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"Did he have to go to one of the bad Cal State campuses?\\"?","response":"Step 1: Understand the premise and hypothesis. The premise states that he had to settle for either UCLA, Santa Cruz, or a Cal State campus. The hypothesis questions whether he had to go to one of the \\"bad\\" Cal State campuses. Step 2: Identify the relevant components in the premise. In the premise, there are three possible options for where he had to settle: UCLA, Santa Cruz, and Cal State campuses. Step 3: Consider the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. In the hypothesis, the concern pertains specifically to the \\"bad\\" Cal State campuses. The hypothesis is a more specific version of the premise in the sense that it focuses only on the Cal State campuses and not on UCLA or Santa Cruz. Step 4: Determine if the premise entails the hypothesis. The premise states that he had to settle for one of a few options, including a Cal State campus. If the premise is true, then it is possible that he had to settle for a Cal State campus.

Available choices: (i). yes; (ii). it is not possible to tell; (iii). no;","response":"The given premise is \\"Then if he thrive and I be cast away.\\" In simple modern English, this means, \\"If he succeeds, then I am cast aside.\\" It's a conditional statement, suggesting causality or dependence between his thriving and the speaker being \\"cast away\\" or rejected. This relationship is consequential - in essence, I am cast away as a result of him thriving. Now, let's consider the hypothesis \\"I be cast away whether he thrives or not.\\" This hypothesis signifies that the person being 'cast away' does not depend on whether the other person thrives or not. It is suggesting that 'being cast away' is a constant outcome, irrespective of whether the other person is succeeding or not. Therefore, it seems the premise and hypothesis are confounding each other, as the premise suggests a dependency between two outcomes, whereas the hypothesis argues for the independence of one outcome from the other. Contrasting the hypothesis to the premise, it's clear that the connection and dependency presented in the premise are not reflected in the hypothesis. The hypothesis suggests that the fate of 'I being cast away' is not tethered to the thriving of 'he'. This statement diverges from the initially provided premise. Given these opposing understandings, the correct answer is: (iii). No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise \\"Then if he thrive and I be cast away\\" does not logically lead to or entail the hypothesis \\"I be cast away whether he thrives or not.\\" This is because the premise is dependent on the condition of the other person thriving, whereas the hypothesis suggests being cast aside is an inevitable outcome, irrespective of the other person's success. As such, the premise does not support the hypothesis, hence the answer is 'no.' The statements are different in their nature and suggest different outcomes, meaning the hypothesis does not follow logically from the premise.

The sister of the terror suspect accused of hacking a soldier to death smiled yesterday as she was escorted from her home and got into a police car. Blessing Adebolajo, 32, was led from her property yesterday morning just hours after her brother Michael, 28, was filmed ranting with blood on his hands yards from the body of the murdered soldier in Woolwich. Blessing was carrying a bag full of clothes as she got into an unmarked police vehicle outside her flat in Romford, Essex, at 8.10am. Suspect's sister: Blessing Adebolajo, 32, smiles as she gets into an unmarked police car outside her home in Romford, Essex, yesterday morning. It is understood she was not arrested, but police will undoubtedly want to question her about her brother who neighbours said was seen regularly at the house. A woman purporting to be Adebolajo's sister told the Romford Recorder newspaper yesterday: 'We didn't know he was going to do this.' Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale, 22, have been identified as the men suspected of murdering Drummer Lee Rigby. Blessing - who has also gone by the surname Daniels - lives on the top floor of the property and used to share the home with her terror suspect brother, neighbours told The Times. Graham Wells, 30, claimed that Adebolajo smoked drugs when he was staying there. Led away: Blessing Adebolajo gets into the vehicle yesterday and was taken away. She has not been arrested. 'He liked to smoke a bit of green (marijuana). We played football, a kick-about on the courts. He was a big lad, not the sort of guy you'd want to cross,' he told the newspaper. 'He used to be a normal bloke. he always had a big smile on his face. he'd say \\"All right Wellsy, all right boy, what's happening?\\".' Police also raided a home in Saxilby, Lincolnshire, yesterday which is believed to belong to the terror suspect's father Anthony, 56. In a chilling rant captured on camera the other side of the road from where drummer Lee Rigby, 25, lay dead, the suspect named as Adebolajo declared: 'The only reason we have killed this man today is because Muslims are dying daily by British soldiers.' Search: Police and forensic officers enter the top floor flat in Romford, Essex, where Adebolajo's sister Blessing lives. Neighbours said he used to live at the property. Former schoolfriends of Adebolajo. said yesterday he was a 'bright and witty' boy who came from a devoutly. Christian family. However, he is understood to have converted to Islam. in around 2003. His mother. and father are hard-working Nigerian immigrants from an academic family. in West Africa who settled in London in the early 1980s. Virtually. all the friends on his Facebook page have traditional British names. such as Louise, Kelly, Robert, Craig, Gemma, Lauren and Paul, to name a. few. Among them is Matthew Selt, now a professional snooker player. After the killing: Michael Adebolajo, 28, pictured on Wednesday, once served a jail sentence for violence. Angels of Woolwich: Gemini Donnelly-Martin, 20, and her mother Amanda (right) talk to one of the alleged attackers with blood on his hands. Meanwhile, Ingrid Loyau-Kennett (left) talks to the other suspect, identified as Michael Adebowale. Lee Rigby lies dead in the road. He. was 'just a lovely, lovely guy', in the words of former classmate. Stephen Cavalier – who, as a serving PC in the Metropolitan Police –. could scarcely have followed a different path. Speaking. at his home in Essex yesterday, Mr Cavalier said: 'It seems odd to say. it now, after the events of yesterday, but I remember him as just a. lovely, lovely guy. Search: Police forensic teams check the gutters of the home where Blessing Daniels lives in Romford yesterday. Search: Forensic officers were seen going in and out of the top floor flat in Romford, Essex, throughout the day yesterday. 'I knew Michael at Marshalls Park School in Romford when we were teenagers. He was a good sportsman and just an all-round nice guy.' He said he was no longer close to Adebolajo, who had requested they become 'Facebook friends' a few years ago. 'As soon as I saw the news last night I immediately recognised it was Michael. I was in shock really when I saw him.' Previously: Michael Adebolajo was in a group of Muslim extremists who fought with police outside the Old Bailey in 2006. He had been arguing that he had the right to 'behead those who insult Islam' Terror suspect: Anjem Choudary (right) claimed that this is him pictured with Michael Adebolajo, 28, (circled) at an Islamist demonstration in London in 2007. Throughout the frenzied attack the two killers. shouted ‘Allah Akbar’ – Arabic for ‘God is great’ – then demanded. horrified witnesses film them as they ranted over the crumpled body. The two black men in their 20s, waited. calmly for armed police to arrive before charging at officers. brandishing a rusty revolver, knives and meat cleavers.

Shipments of treasure from the Indies totalled over two million ducats between 1552-53. By 1554, the cash deficit for the year was calculated to be over 4.3 million ducats, even after all tax receipts for the six ensuing years had been pledged and the proceeds spent in advance. Credit at this point began costing the crown 43 percent interest . By 1557 the crown was refusing payment from the Indies since even this was required for payment of the war effort . French finances during the war were mainly financed by the increase in the taille tax, as well as indirect taxes like the gabelle and customs fees. The French monarchy also resorted to heavy borrowings during the war from financiers at rates of 10-16 percent interest. The taille was estimated in collection for 1551 at around six million livres. During the 1550s, Spain had an estimated military manpower of around 150,000 soldiers, whereas France had an estimated manpower of 50,000.

The resolution was proposed by Richard Henry Lee of Virginia, who proposed a three-part resolution which included: a declaration of independence, a call to form foreign alliances, and a plan for a confederation. His exact words were: \\"Resolved: That these United colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent States, that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain is, and ought to be, totally dissolved.\\" The motion was not immediately accepted as there were delegates who preferred reconciliation with Great Britain, rather than a complete separation. This led to heated debates and exchanges over the proposed resolution. However, on June 10th, the congress decided to postpone the decision on the resolution and appointed a committee of five to draft a formal document in case the resolution was approved. The committee composed of five delegates: Thomas Jefferson of Virginia, Benjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania, John Adams of Massachusetts, Robert R. Livingston of New York, and Roger Sherman of Connecticut. Thomas Jefferson was tasked with the duty of drafting the document. The motion for independence was finally passed on July 2nd. The Congress then turned its attention to the Declaration of Independence, which had been drafted by Jefferson. After making a number of changes to Jefferson’s draft, Congress approved the Declaration of Independence on July 4th, 1776. The resolution put forth by Richard Henry Lee led to the birth of a new nation, the United States of America, and marked a turning point in the struggle for freedom from British colonial rule.

For years now, they have carried his name like a battle standard into the ideological trenches. Benedict apparently would like them to knock it off. In private letters published on Thursday by the German newspaper Bild, Benedict, who in retirement has remained studiously quiet through the controversies over Francis’ fitness to lead the church, says that the “anger” expressed by some of his staunchest defenders risks tarnishing his own pontificate. “I can well understand the deep-seated pain that the end of my pontificate caused you and many others. But for some — and it seems to me for you as well — the pain has turned to anger, which no longer just affects the abdication but my person and the entirety of my pontificate,” Benedict wrote in a Nov. 23, 2017, letter to Cardinal Walter Brandmüller of Germany. “In this way the pontificate itself is being devalued and conflated with the sadness about the situation of the church today.” Requests to representatives of Benedict and Cardinal Brandmüller for comment and authentication were not returned early Thursday. Bild provided the letters in their entirety to The Times. ||||| Benedict XVI has reprimanded a German cardinal for criticising his decision to step down, arguing that “anger” about his resignation has devalued his papacy, and is being “melted into the sorrow” about the Church’s problems. The Pope Emeritus made the remarks in recent letters to Cardinal Walter Brandmüller, one of the “dubia” cardinals who has publicly challenged Pope Francis over his family life teaching. At one level, the letters can be read as a rebuke to Pope Francis’ critics, many of whom felt betrayed and angered by Benedict XVI’s decision to resign and have seen the Pope Emeritus as a rallying point for Francis resistance. On the other hand, critics of this Pope are likely to seize on Benedict XVI's use of the word “sorrow” about the Church’s situation as a sign that Francis’ pontificate is going in the wrong direction. The overriding concern from Benedict appears to be that his papacy is being devalued by those using it as a political weapon to undermine Francis. In the correspondence, obtained by German Newspaper “Bild,” the 89-year-old cardinal complained to Benedict that his decision to step down precipitated a crisis in the Church and caused serious harm. But the Pope Emeritus gives him a sharp reply. “I can very well understand the deep-seated pain that the end of my papacy has inflicted on you and many others. However, for some people and – it seems to me – also for you, the pain has turned into an anger that no longer merely concerns my resignation, but increasingly also my person and my papacy as a whole,” Benedict writes. “By this, a papacy itself is now being devalued and melted into the sorrow about the situation in which the Church currently finds itself.” He goes on: “If you know a better way [i.e. resignation] and therefore think that you can judge the one chosen by me, please tell me.” Following his dramatic 2013 decision to resign, Benedict XVI promised to remain “hidden to the world” although he has been publicly embraced by Francis who describes his presence in the Vatican as like having a “wise grandfather living at home”. But many of the Pope Emeritus’ supporters saw him as the standard bearer of orthodoxy and a restorationist movement in Catholicism which the Latin American Pontiff has undermined with his vision of a less doctrinally rigid and more missionary Church serving the poor and marginalised. Divisions between Benedict and Francis are also at the centre of Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò’s explosive allegations against this Pope concerning Archbishop McCarrick’s sexual misconduct with seminarians. In an 11-page testimony released last month, Archbishop Viganò called on Francis to resign for allegedly lifting sanctions against McCarrick imposed by Benedict XVI. Archbishop Viganò, who has yet to produce documentary evidence to back up his claims, was present with Cardinal Brandmüller during a conference in Rome in April where the keynote speaker, US Cardinal Raymond Burke, spoke about the limits of papal power. Cardinals Burke and Brandmüller are among four prelates – two of whom have died – who set out a series of questions, known as “dubia,” to Francis over his family life document “Amoris Laetitia”. Cardinal Burke has said that if the “dubia” are not answered then he could make a public correction of the pontiff. In 2016 Cardinal Brandmüller presented the case against Benedict XVI’s resignation, including his decision to take the title “Pope Emeritus”, something he believed risk causing divisions. The cardinal, the former President of the Pontifical Committee for Historical Sciences from 1998 to 2009, describes as “necessary and urgent” new “legislation that would define and regulate” the status of a former Pope. Those opposed to Benedict XVI’s decision have argued that resigning the papacy de-sacralises, or de-mystifies, the office of the Successor of St Peter. |||||","response":"Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI has chastised a German cardinal, Walter Brandmüller, for criticizing his decision to resign, stating that the anger expressed by his supporters risks devaluing his papacy. In private letters published by German newspaper Bild, Benedict addresses the deep pain and anger his decision has caused some of his staunchest defenders. He reprimands Cardinal Brandmüller for allowing his anger to affect his judgment and actions. The former Pope's concern appears to be that his papacy is being used as a political weapon to undermine his successor, Pope Francis. This is evident in the ongoing controversies surrounding Pope Francis' fitness to lead the Church and allegations that he shielded an abusive American cardinal."},{"question":"This is a great little film, that's very unique, and creative, with some great plot twists and wonderful performances!.

On 27 November at the Korean eastern front, a U.S. 7th Infantry Division Regimental Combat Team (3,000 soldiers) and the U.S. 1st Marine Division (12,000–15,000 marines) were unprepared for the PVA 9th Army Group's three-pronged encirclement tactics at the Battle of Chosin Reservoir, but they managed to escape under Air Force and X Corps support fire—albeit with some 15,000 collective casualties.\\", answer the following question.

How to flip someone over your shoulder Be in a fighting position with this person. Have your hands on their shoulders and their hands on your shoulders. Make sure that your hands are inside.","response":"In order to successfully flip someone over your shoulder, you must follow a series of carefully executed steps to ensure both your safety and your opponent's. Flipping someone over your shoulder, also known as a shoulder throw or an ippon seoi nage in judo, requires proper technique, balance, and timing. Here is a detailed and long explanation of how to perform this move: 1. Establish a proper stance: Begin by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart and knees slightly bent. This will provide you with a stable and strong base to execute the throw. Position one foot slightly in front of the other, with your lead foot pointing toward your opponent's feet and your back foot angled about 45 degrees from your front foot. 2. Get a solid grip: As you already have your hands on your opponent's shoulders and their hands are on your shoulders, make sure you maintain a firm grip. Having your hands inside allows you to maintain control of their arms and body during the throw. 3. Break your opponent's balance: This is a crucial step in performing the throw. You must unbalance your opponent to make it easier to execute the shoulder flip. To do this, shift your weight forward and use your arms to pull your opponent toward you as if you were trying to bring their head down to the level of your shoulder. This will force them to bend at the waist and cause them to lose balance, making it easier to throw them. 4. Step forward with your front foot: Once your opponent is off balance, take a step forward with the foot that is in front, positioning it between their legs. You will want your front foot to be close to your opponent's center of gravity for maximum leverage. 5. Pivot and squat: As you step forward, pivot on your front foot and simultaneously rotate your back foot so your heel comes off the ground. This movement will cause your body to face the same direction as your opponent. Squat down as you pivot, lowering your hips to a level below your opponent's center of gravity. This is an important step to generate the necessary leverage for the throw. 6. Load your opponent on your back: With your hips now lower than your opponent's, pull their upper body across your back using your grip on their shoulders. Make sure their weight is evenly distributed across your shoulder and upper back. 7. Execute the throw: Once your opponent's weight is properly positioned, keep a firm grip on their shoulders, and stand up quickly using your legs to drive the motion. Simultaneously, use your arms to pull and guide your opponent over your shoulder and onto the ground. 8. Maintain control and follow through: As your opponent goes over your shoulder, follow through with the throw by continuing to pull on their shoulders and keeping your grip until they are fully on the ground. This will help to ensure a successful and controlled throw. 9. Safely disengage: Once your opponent has been successfully thrown, quickly disengage and move away to a safe position. This can help prevent any counterattacks or a possible continuation of the confrontation. Remember, it is essential to practice this move under the supervision of a qualified instructor to ensure proper technique and safety. Additionally, communication and cooperation with your training partner are crucial to avoid injury during practice."},{"question":"try our services and we guarantee you won’t be disappointed, just as we have not failed to satisfy a number of other companies and celebrities.

The Dublin-born left-hander had been out of contract with Sussex, for whom he will remain available for part of the 2017 County Championship campaign. Joyce recently returned home and had surgery on an injured knee. He is one of 10 players to agree a central category-A contract with Cricket Ireland in the list released by the governing body on Wednesday. The former England international scored 1,026 Championship runs at an average of 64.12 for Sussex last season, but missed Ireland's one-day matches against Australia and South Africa in September because of injury. Joyce joined Sussex from Middlesex in 2009 and captained the side from July 2012 until the end of the 2015 season. \\"Coming back to play full-time for Ireland and also play in the Inter-Provincial series was a big decision but also quite an easy one in the end,\\" said Joyce, who played 17 one-day internationals for England in 2006 and 2007. \\"Test cricket is the pinnacle for any cricketer. Ireland has a huge opportunity in the next few years to play at the highest level and I want to be part of the team that plays Ireland's first Test match,\\" said Joyce. \\"With Ireland's fixture list growing year on year it makes sense to come back at this stage. \\"Also now that the inter-pros have first-class and list-A status, I wanted to be involved right from the start and lend my experience to that competition. \\"We're at the stage where we need to be more consistent and competitive as an international side and we also require the inter-pros to improve and provide a steady stream of players ready to perform well for Ireland. \\"My focus in the next few years, while I'm still playing, is to help us achieve both of these goals. It's a really exciting time to be an Irish cricketer and I can't wait for the 2017 season to get going.\\" Ireland have ODIs in 2017 against New Zealand, Bangladesh, and West Indies on home soil, as well as playing England at Bristol and Lord's. Cricket Ireland performance director Richard Holdsworth welcomed Joyce's decision to play a full role in the coming season, saying: \\"We are delighted Ed has agreed to return home to play in Ireland's inaugural season of domestic first-class cricket. \\"It has been one of our strategic objectives to bring players back home from England and for Ed to be the first is very appropriate. He has given great service to Sussex as an outstanding batsman and leader, and we are grateful for their support to Ed's Ireland career over those years. \\"Ed will not only be based here in Ireland training with the national squad, but will also help our next generation of international cricketers in a specialist batting and leadership coaching role, working with the Shapoorji Pallonji National Academy and Ireland youth squads as well as mentoring some national performance squad players.\\" There are three newcomers to full contracts in Irish Player of the Year John Anderson, Andrew Balbirnie and Jacob Mulder. Nine others players have agreed category-B contracts - those with other employers, such as county cricketers. New players include Barry McCarthy and Greg Thompson, while Niall O'Brien - no longer playing county cricket - will play his first season of Inter-Provincial cricket, as well as taking on a new specialist wicketkeeping role. Holdsworth continued: \\"Barry McCarthy has had a great start to his international career and fully deserves a contract, whilst Greg Thompson has proven his ability in the T20 format in particular. \\"It is great news for the Inter-Provincial series that Niall will be joining Ed Joyce in our new first-class competition, but also playing a key part in developing our young wicket-keepers in the national pathway.

How does it feel to turn 90 and have attained the status of an icon, a living legend? \\"It feels just like it felt before,\\" Julia Child says with the throaty laugh familiar to millions who cut their culinary teeth on her \\"French Chef\\" television series. The show, along with her seminal book, \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\" (1961), revolutionized the way America cooks and eats. While making light of the difference a day -- or another decade -- makes, Child intends to enjoy her birthday thoroughly. First, there will be all the public observances, including a sold-out dinner Thursday at San Francisco's tony Fifth Floor restaurant, which -- like dinners that night at 19 other venues across the country -- will benefit the scholarship fund of the International Association of Culinary Professionals (which Child co-founded). Friday to Sunday, the action moves to Napa, with both members-only and public events at COPIA: The American Center for Wine, Food and the Arts, of which she is an honorary board member. Aug. 15, her actual birthday, will see her in Maine at an annual gathering of nieces, nephews, their offspring and friends, who for many years have rolled a joined birthday celebration for several members of the group into a jolly reunion.

I’d been having intrusive suicidal thoughts for a while. It was a combination of a bad medication regimen and lots of little stressors—school, work, a car accident, you name it. I took to a very private social media account that only those I was closest to could see. I used that account to rant about my problems. It was my coping mechanism and how I kept myself sane. Somehow just typing it out got it off my chest in ways writing in a journal couldn’t (now, I try to use Quora for this purpose instead). One night in early March I went to a performance that my friends were part of. I went alone. While I was there, I got a series of texts regarding my girlfriend. I knew that what those texts said would cause me an immense amount of stress and sleepless nights. I went onto my social media account. I don’t remember exactly what I posted. It wasn’t specific, but rather something along the lines of “I’m stressed, this is the cherry on top, I honestly don’t know how I’m going to handle this.” Whatever it was, someone who followed that account knew I was at my breaking point. They called an anonymous tip line and reported that they believed I was in danger of killing myself. I got home from the performance at midnight and my dad was in my driveway. I asked him why. He told me he’d been contacted and that someone reported a concern about me. I was admitted to the hospital the next day, and I spent a week an an inpatient psychiatric unit where I received better medication, therapy and coaching on positive coping mechanisms. Whoever called saved me, but in a way I saved my own life that day. What I thought was just another routine post about stress got me the help I so desperately needed.

The decision has come as a surprise to many, as Yeltsin's administration has consistently adopted policies that have involved maintaining a substantial workforce. Yeltsin's decision to implement staff cuts appears to be driven by multiple factors. Firstly, financial concerns have been brought to the forefront due to escalating economic pressures on the Russian government. By downsizing the number of staff members, the administration aims to reduce overall expenses and reallocate resources more effectively. Secondly, Yeltsin is likely attempting to increase the efficiency of his administration. The move to reduce staff numbers may indicate the presence of redundancies, duplicated efforts, and unproductive positions within his ranks. By cutting staff levels, Yeltsin hopes to create a leaner and more agile decision-making process that can respond to the nation's needs more swiftly. In addition to these considerations, Yeltsin's staff cuts may also be intended to set an example for other sectors of the Russian economy. As Russia grapples with the ongoing challenges of transitioning from a centrally planned to a market-based economy, Yeltsin's actions could inspire businesses and industries across the nation to follow suit and make similar changes. Regardless of the motivations behind these staff cuts, the impact on Yeltsin's administration remains to be seen. With many insiders speculating on the potential fallout and discontent amongst affected workers, there is much uncertainty surrounding this decision. As Russia continues to navigate the tumultuous political and economic landscape of the post-Soviet era, only time will tell whether Yeltsin's staff cuts will lead to a more effective government and a stronger national economy."},{"question":"We went to check out the weekly traditional Quebecois music jam ( some dancing happened too in the middle of the musician circle ) last night at Vices et Versa in Little Italy with N and J ( J just flew in from V ) .

This is evident in the unusual orchestration and stage directions Berlioz prepared for his Roméo et Juliette. This piece is actually in seven movements, and calls for an intermission after the fourth movement – the \\"Queen Mab Scherzo\\" – to remove the harps from the stage and bring on the chorus of Capulets for the funeral march that follows. Berlioz biographer D. Kern Holoman observed that, \\"as Berlioz saw it, the work is simply Beethovenian in design, with the narrative elements overlain. Its core approaches a five-movement symphony with the choral finale and, as in the [Symphonie] Fantastique, both a scherzo and a march.... The 'extra' movements are thus the introduction with its potpourri of subsections and the descriptive tomb scene [at the end of the work].\\"Mahler expanded the Beethovenian model for programmatic as well as symphonic reasons in his Second Symphony, the \\"Resurrection\\", the vocal fourth movement, \\"Urlicht\\", bridging the childlike faith of the third movement with the ideological tension Mahler seeks to resolve in the finale. He then abandoned this pattern for his Third Symphony, as two movements for voices and orchestra follow three purely instrumental ones before the finale returns to instruments alone. Like Mahler, Havergal Brian expanded the Beethovenian model, but on a much larger scale and with far larger orchestral and choral forces, in his Symphony No. 1 \\"The Gothic\\". Written between 1919 and 1927, the symphony was inspired by Goethe's Faust and Gothic cathedral architecture. The Brian First is in two parts. The first consists of three instrumental movements; the second, also in three movements and over an hour in length, is a Latin setting of the Te Deum., can you guess it ?

The noise startles both Robert and Cassandra. Cassandra is Jane's sister and Robert is her fiance. Both Robert and Cassandra run out of their own rooms to see what the noise is and Robert catches a glimpse of Cassandra in her night gown which prompts the latter to smile slyly and then rush back to her own room.Mrs. Austen, who was trying to sleep, complains that Jane needs a husband. Rev. Austen, lying next to her, comments that because he has set an example of perfection, Jane can not be satisfied with anything less.

In \\"'Why Not Me?\\" Franken trounces former House Speaker Newt Gingrich to win the election, but after countless scandals, a mental breakdown and a cloning incident, President Franken is forced to resign. Comedian, author and radio host Al Franken can now add \\"senator\\" to his resume. Asked how he came up with the idea for the book, Franken said at the time that a number of people had been encouraging him to run for office. \\"They thought it would be a good idea because I obviously know a lot about politics; I'm comfortable on camera, as you can tell; I've been married once, have two children; very, very good looking. And I told them that I'd be a terrible office-holder, so that was sort of the genesis of this idea,\\" he said. As far-fetched as the plot was, Franken's political aspirations weren't fantasy, and eight months after Election Day, the Democrat will be sworn in as an office-holder, representing Minnesota in the Senate. Soon after, the outspoken comedian and former radio host will take over the desk once occupied by election rival Norm Coleman. For months, Coleman appealed the election results, in which a recount gave Franken a 312-vote lead. But Coleman's case was put to rest last week when Minnesota's Supreme Court ruled in Franken's favor. Franken on the issues ». When Franken is sworn in Tuesday, the title \\"senator\\" will become just the next line on a lengthy and varied résumé that reflects a man who has built up an illustrious yet controversial name for himself. Franken, born in New York in 1951, moved to Minnesota when he was 4 years old. He grew up in a middle-class family and did well in school. Franken attended Harvard University, where he majored in political science. After graduation, Franken teamed up with his home-state pal Tom Davis, and the two started writing for what became known as \\"Saturday Night Live.\\" Franken was also a performer -- playing self-help guru Stuart Smalley and impersonating public figures like Henry Kissinger and the Rev. Pat Robertson -- and over the course of two decades, he took home five Emmys for his work on the show. Post-\\"SNL,\\" Franken dabbled in film and had a successful career as an author, penning several best-sellers, including \\"Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot and Other Observations.\\" Watch CNN's Brianna Keiler report on Franken's plans ». In 2004, Franken made a name for himself as someone well-versed in politics through \\"The Al Franken Show,\\" carried by Air America Radio. During his final show on February 14, 2007, Franken announced his intentions to run for the Senate. But the man who once played Liam the Loose-Boweled Leprechaun wasn't the first unlikely politician to come from Minnesota. Voters there elected former wrestler Jesse Ventura as their governor in 1998. David Schultz, a professor of law at Hamline University in St. Paul, says Franken's win was probably not an affirmation of support for the Democratic candidate but was, for many, a \\"lesser of two evils vote.\\" Third-party candidate Dean Barkley was chipping into Coleman's support, and \\"in addition, Coleman threw all his dirt against Franken early, and by the general election, it was old news.\\" \\"Coleman had little new to campaign on during the general election, and Franken became a better candidate in terms of campaigning during the last two months,\\" he said. In a video posted on his campaign Web site, explaining that he wanted to run, Franken said Minnesotans had \\"a right to be skeptical\\" about whether he was ready to take on such a challenge. Watch more on the Franken factor ». Franken cited late Minnesota Sen. Paul Wellstone as his political hero. Wellstone, who first won election to the Senate in 1990, died in a plane crash shortly before the 2002 election. Going into the race, Coleman was considered one of the more vulnerable Republicans seeking re-election. Although he'd started distancing himself from President Bush, he had been long seen as one of the president's allies. Franken's campaign took off, and he raked in contributions, but his foes were not going to let Coleman go down without a fight. The former comedian's past came back to attack him as anti-Franken ads focused on some of his more controversial lines. The National Republican Senatorial Committee launched a 60-second spot highlighting clips from Franken's SNL days, with an announcer saying, \\"Rape jokes, poor and foul-mouthed anger do not make for good training for the United States Senate.\\" The Minnesota State Republican Party also blasted their challenger for a 2000 Playboy column he wrote called \\"Porn-O-Rama!\\" When the votes were tallied on Election Day, Coleman held a slight edge on Franken, leading with just 206 votes. Under Minnesota law, a recount was in order because the margin of victory was less than .5 percent. The controversial recount, and subsequent court challenges, evoked comparisons to the 2000 Bush-Gore saga. But Franken came out on top in one of the most drawn-out Senate races in Senate history. A day after the Minnesota Supreme Court handed down its unanimous decision in favor of Franken -- and 239 days after the election -- the newly dubbed senator-elect thanked his supporters in an at-times emotional speech on the steps of the state Capitol. \\"It is, of course, technically true that this was Paul's U.S. Senate seat. But I don't think Paul saw it that way,\\" Franken said Wednesday, again paying respects to Wellstone. \\"This seat belongs to the people of Minnesota, and so did Sen. Wellstone, and so will I,\\" he said as he thanked his wife, Franni, supporters, volunteers, campaign staff members and the people of the state he will represent. Now, Franken takes on what could be the most influential role of his life as he joins the Senate, giving Democrats their potentially filibuster-proof 60th vote. Senate Democrats are welcoming their newest with open arms, and although the months-long contest has reached a resolution, it's likely the division over Franken will follow him to Capitol Hill. \\"The arrival of the man from Minnesota will make the Democrats move even more to the left. He will not only be one more vote for the left, but one more loud voice for liberal policies,\\" John Feehery wrote in a commentary for CNN.com. Feehery is a former staffer for former House Speaker Dennis Hastert and other Republicans in Congress. \\"When Franken first started in politics, he did so as the liberal answer to Rush Limbaugh. Imagine if Rush were the 60th vote for Republicans, with George Bush as president. Now, think how Franken will act as the 60th vote for President Obama,\\" he wrote.

The ideal way to describe this low-budget 70's gem is like a shameless copy of Hammer's \\"The Quatermass Xperiment\\" ...only a thousand times filthier! Astronaust Steve West is the only survivor of a disastrous space-mission, but turns out the carrier of a horrible disease that makes him radioactive and ... causes him to melt! In shock after seeing his face in the mirror (can you blame him?), Steve busts out of the hospital, leaving a trail of sticky pus and fallen off body parts behind. Doctor Ted Nelson has to find him urgently, as the disease also set Steve up with an insatiable appetite for human flesh. The premise may sound utterly stupid but this flick is enormously entertaining and contains great make-up effects from the hand of Rick Baker. The melting dude's face looks like a rotting pizza and his heavy breathing makes him sound like Darth Vader! Another big advantage is that William Sachs' screenplay doesn't waste any time on tedious scientific explanations or emotional speeches. The repulsiveness starts right away and lasts until the very last moment of the film.

Emily had a sickly nature. [b]. Christine had a sickly nature.","response":"The sentence could be completed as: \\"Emily took care of Christine while they were ill, because Christine had a sickly nature.\\" Having a sickly nature generally implies a person is often unwell or susceptible to illness. In this case, Christine is described as having a sickly nature. This could perhaps mean that Christine tends to get sick frequently or that she has a chronic medical condition that often makes her weak or ill. Extended periods of illness often require the sick person to be cared for by someone else, especially if the illness drastically affects their daily life or activities. In this context, caring could involve a lot of tasks; it could mean that Emily helped Christine with daily chores that she couldn't carry out herself due to her illness, like cooking, washing, and tidying up. It could also mean Emily took Christine to her doctor's appointments, helped manage her medication, or was just there as moral support, offering companionship and comfort. Caring for a sick person also often involves maintaining their basic hygiene and well-being. However, it's important to realize that Emily's motivation or reasons for looking after Christine aren't entirely clear. She could have been a close friend, a relative, a neighbor, a professional carer, or even a really kind-hearted and selfless person willing to care for others. It could also be that there weren't others who were able to look after Christine. But irrespective of her exact motives, what the sentence makes clear is that Emily was there for Christine while she was ill. She took on the role of a caregiver and helped Christine manage her sickly nature, showing kindness and perhaps also a sense of responsibility towards her."},{"question":"Write a sentence not in English.","response":"Step 1: Choose a language other than English.

Next, the surgeon scrubs the fingertips and interdigital spaces of each hand, ensuring that the nails are free of any dirt, debris, or harmful microorganisms. In addition, the surgeon also washes the wrists and lower arms by taking particular care to scrub all surfaces, including the inside of the elbows and the area just below the surgical gown's cuffs. After completing the handwashing process, the surgeon rinses his hands, wrists, and arms thoroughly under running water, ensuring that any remaining soap or debris is washed away. He allows the water to flow from the fingertips toward the elbows, avoiding touching the water faucet or sink with his clean hands to prevent recontamination. Once the surgeon's hands and forearms are rinsed thoroughly, he gently shakes off excess water and proceeds to dry them using a sterile towel. The towel is often provided in a sterile pack, and the surgeon takes care not to touch anything else other than the towel, to maintain the sterile field. He then dries each hand and arm separately, starting from the fingertips and moving up towards the elbows, ensuring that they are completely dry before putting on sterile gloves. The process of donning sterile gloves is equally important in maintaining surgical hygiene. The surgeon opens the sterile glove package using aseptic technique and carefully picks up the first glove by its folded cuff, taking care not to touch the outer surface of the glove with his bare hands. He slides his hand into the glove, ensuring that the glove fits properly and securely. Next, the surgeon picks up the other glove by inserting the fingers of the first gloved hand under the cuff of the second glove.

If only the script was as shattering as the glass, then \\"The Broken\\" would have been a brilliant film. Now it's sadly just an overlong, derivative and dull movie with only just a handful of remarkable ideas and memorable sequences. Sean Ellis made a very stylish and elegantly photographed movie, but the story is lackluster and the total absence of logic and explanation is really frustrating. I got into a discussion with a friend regarding the basic concept and \\"meaning\\" of the film. He thinks Ellis found inspiration in an old legend claiming that spotting your doppelganger is a foreboding of how you're going to die. Interesting theory, but I'm not familiar with this legend and couldn't find anything on the Internet about this, neither. Personally, I just think \\"The Broken\\" is yet another umpteenth variation on the theme of \\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\\" but without the alien interference. \\"The Broken\\" centers on the American McVey family living in London, and particularly Gina. When a mirror spontaneously breaks during a birthday celebration, this triggers a whole series of mysterious and seemingly supernatural events. Gina spots herself driving by in a car and follows her mirror image to an apartment building. Whilst driving home in a state of mental confusion, she causes a terrible car accident and ends up in the hospital. When dismissed, Gina feels like her whole surrounding is changing. She doesn't recognize her own boyfriend anymore and uncanny fragments of the accident keep flashing before her eyes. Does she suffer from mental traumas invoked by the accident or is there really a supernatural conspiracy happening all around her? Writer/director Sean Ellis definitely invokes feelings of curiosity and suspense in his script, but unfortunately he fails to properly elaborate them. \\"The Broken\\" is a truly atmospheric and stylish effort, but only after just half an hour of film, you come to the painful conclusion it shall just remain a beautiful but empty package. There's a frustratingly high amount of \\"fake\\" suspense in this film. This means building up tension, through ominous music and eerie camera angels, when absolutely nothing has even happened so far. By the time the actually mysteriousness kicks in, these tricks don't have any scary effect on you anymore. Some of my fellow reviewers around here compare the film and particularly Sean Ellis' style with the repertoires of David Lynch, Stanley Kubrick and even Alfred Hitchcock, but that is way, way  WAY too much honor.

He has an elder brother named Rodney (born c. 1961) and had an elder sister named Denise, who died of a heart attack at age 24 in February 1990. Tyson's biological father is listed as \\"Purcell Tyson\\" (who was from Jamaica) on his birth certificate, but the man Tyson had known as his father was Jimmy Kirkpatrick. Kirkpatrick was from Grier Town, North Carolina (a predominantly black neighborhood that was annexed by the city of Charlotte), where he was one of the neighborhood's top baseball players. Tyson made his professional debut as an 18-year-old on March 6, 1985, in Albany, New York. He defeated Hector Mercedes via a first round knockout. He had 15 bouts in his first year as a professional. Fighting frequently, Tyson won 26 of his first 28 fights by KO or TKO; 16 of those came in the first round. The quality of his opponents gradually increased to journeyman fighters and borderline contenders, like James Tillis, David Jaco, Jesse Ferguson, Mitch Green and Marvis Frazier. His win streak attracted media attention and Tyson was billed as the next great heavyweight champion. D'Amato died in November 1985, relatively early into Tyson's professional career, and some speculate that his death was the catalyst to many of the troubles Tyson was to experience as his life and career progressed. Tyson's first nationally televised bout took place on February 16, 1986, at Houston Field House in Troy, New York against journeyman heavyweight Jesse Ferguson. Tyson knocked down Ferguson with an uppercut in the fifth round that broke Ferguson's nose. During the sixth round, Ferguson began to hold and clinch Tyson in an apparent attempt to avoid further punishment. After admonishing Ferguson several times to obey his commands to box, the referee finally stopped the fight near the middle of the sixth round. The fight was initially ruled a win for Tyson by disqualification (DQ) of his opponent. The ruling was \\"adjusted\\" to a win by technical knockout (TKO) after Tyson's corner protested that a DQ win would end Tyson's string of knockout victories, and that a knockout would have been the inevitable result. On November 22, 1986, Tyson was given his first title fight against Trevor Berbick for the World Boxing Council (WBC) heavyweight championship. Tyson won the title by second round TKO, and at the age of 20 years and 4 months became the youngest heavyweight champion in history. Tyson's dominant performance brought many accolades. Donald Saunders wrote: \\"The noble and manly art of boxing can at least cease worrying about its immediate future, now [that] it has discovered a heavyweight champion fit to stand alongside Dempsey, Tunney, Louis, Marciano and Ali.\\" Tyson intimidated fighters with his strength, combined with outstanding hand speed, accuracy, coordination and timing. Tyson also possessed notable defensive abilities, holding his hands high in the Peek-a-Boo style taught by his mentor Cus D'Amato to slip under and weave around his opponent's punches while timing his own. One of Tyson's trademark moves was a right hook to his opponent's body followed by a right uppercut to his opponent's chin. Lorenzo Boyd, Jesse Ferguson and Jose Ribalta were each knocked down by this combination. Who was he fighting?","response":"Michael Gerard Tyson, also known as Mike Tyson, was a famous boxer.

But the dismissal of Fox News’ highest-rated host isn’t going to end the crisis at the network. The toxic culture, fostered for 20 years by former CEO Roger Ailes, is proving far more difficult to remedy. Next week, according to sources, seven black Fox News employees plan to join a racial-discrimination suit filed last month by two colleagues. The original lawsuit alleged that Fox News’ longtime comptroller, Judy Slater, subjected members of Fox’s payroll staff to racial insults for years. (Fox News fired Slater in February after those employees began litigation against the network.) Lawyers representing the payroll employees are demanding that Fox’s accounting director, Tammy Efinger, also be removed from supervising an employee because she allegedly participated in Slater’s racist behavior. In a letter to the network’s lawyers obtained by New York, the attorneys state: “Not once did Ms. Efinger step in or attempt to interfere with Ms. Slater’s outrageous conduct.” The letter adds, instead, “Ms. Efinger chose to laugh or giggle following Ms. Slater’s vitriol.” The letter also includes new allegations of racism in Fox News’ accounting department. According to the plaintiffs’ attorneys, Slater demanded that black female employees hold “arm wrestling matches’” with white female employees in her office, just down the hall from Ailes’s office on the second floor of Fox headquarters. “Forcing a black woman employee to ‘fight’ for the amusement and pleasure of her white superiors is horrifying. This highly offensive and humiliating act is reminiscent of Jim Crow era battle royals,” the letter says, referring to the practice of paying black men to fight blindfolded at carnivals for white spectators’ entertainment. The lawyers argue that Efinger bragged about wanting to “fight” a black employee. The new claims, if true, reveal not just the failures of the legal and HR departments to deal with problematic managers but also just how deep the culture of discrimination and harassment may have run during Ailes’s reign. Reached for comment, an attorney representing the employees, Jeanne Christensen, said, “There will be more complaints forthcoming in the next few days.” A Fox News spokesperson said: “We can’t comment on a lawsuit that we haven’t seen yet.” Bill O’Reilly has made some remarkably sexist comments on the air. ||||| Troubles at Fox News were compounded yet again on Tuesday, with the emergence of new allegations of racial discrimination at the company coming less than a week after the ouster of the network’s star Bill O’Reilly. Eleven current and former Fox News employees filed a class-action lawsuit in New York against the network, accusing it of “abhorrent, intolerable, unlawful and hostile racial discrimination.” The lawsuit, filed in State Supreme Court in the Bronx, expands a complaint filed at the end of March by Tichaona Brown and Tabrese Wright, two black women who worked in the Fox News payroll department. In particular, the suit contends that Judith Slater, the company’s longtime comptroller, engaged in racist behavior and made racist remarks and that senior executives ignored her actions. A third Fox News employee, Monica Douglas, joined the lawsuit earlier this month. Fox News fired Ms. Slater in February. “When it comes to racial discrimination, 21st Century Fox has been operating as if it should be called 18th Century Fox,” the plaintiffs’ lawyers, Douglas H. Wigdor and Jeanne M. Christensen, said in a statement, referring to Fox News’s parent company. “We sincerely hope the filing of this race class action wakes 21st Century Fox from its slumbers and inspires the company to take a conciliatory and appropriate approach to remedy its wrongs.” ||||| Write a summary.","response":"Fox News is facing yet another scandal as seven black employees are reportedly preparing to join a racial-discrimination lawsuit against the network.

Answer:","response":"The missing first step of the given process is: 1. Ingestion and Initial Breakdown of Food and Liquids in the Mouth Here's a comprehensive outline of the entire process, including the missing first step: 1. Ingestion and Initial Breakdown of Food and Liquids in the Mouth: The process starts with the consumption of food and liquids. During this step, the mouth plays an essential role in physically breaking down the food through the process of mastication (chewing). This action of chewing increases the food surface area for enzymes to act upon and turns it into a soft, manageable mass called a bolus. Additionally, the saliva secreted by the salivary glands in the mouth contains digestive enzymes such as amylase, which initiates the breakdown of carbohydrates. 2. Water Enters the Body: Water is essential for various bodily functions, including digestion. It is consumed by drinking or obtained through food and enters the digestive system when swallowed. 3. Food and Water Travel Down the Esophagus: Once ingested, the bolus of food and water is propelled down the esophagus by rhythmic contractions called peristalsis. This process delivers the food and water to the stomach. 4. Bloodstream: Water is absorbed primarily in the small intestine but also in the large intestine. From there, it enters the bloodstream, where it is transported throughout the body to help maintain hydration, electrolyte balance, and participate in various physiological functions. 5. Food and Water Enter the Pancreas: As the semiliquid, partially digested food mixture called chyme moves from the stomach into the small intestine, the pancreas is signaled to secrete digestive enzymes and bicarbonate ions. The bicarbonate ions help neutralize the acidic chyme, while the enzymes (including amylase, protease, and lipase) aid in breaking down carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, respectively. 6. The Pancreas Breaks Down Carbohydrates: Pancreatic amylase further breaks down carbohydrates into simpler sugars, such as maltose, which is later broken down into glucose by enzymes in the small intestine. Glucose can then be absorbed into the bloodstream and used for energy or stored for later use. 7. Helps Digest Other Foods and Liquids: Other pancreatic enzymes, such as protease and lipase, contribute to the breakdown of proteins and fats. Proteins are broken down into smaller units called amino acids, while fats are broken down into glycerol and fatty acids. These nutrients can then be absorbed into the bloodstream for use in growth, repair, and energy production throughout the body.

It arrived with one of the black knobs broken and the plastic lever that locks the adjustable stand broke while I was assembling the light. I used it for an hour and thirty minutes and one of the bulbs blew. Don't expect much and be prepared to buy a lot of exspensive bulbs. The answer is:","response":"The customer is clearly dissatisfied with the product based on the review provided. Although the customer points out a positive aspect in the beginning about the design of the light being nice, the rest of the review is filled with constructive criticism and negative feedback. The customer mentions the low quality of the parts by stating 'cheap plastic nuts for the adjustments'. This is an indication that the customer was expecting more robust or durable materials used in the product's construction. Also, the fact that the product arrived with a broken part shows the customer’s dissatisfaction with the delivery or the packaging process, indicating that it may not be handled with proper care. In addition, the customer faced yet another issue while assembling the product. The review mentions 'the plastic lever that locks the adjustable stand broke while I was assembling the light', showing a dissatisfaction towards the product's build quality and user-friendly aspect. This could also hint that the assembly instructions were not clear, or that the structural design of the product was not up to mark, resulting in breakage during the assembly process. The complain about one of the bulbs blowing out after use for only an hour and thirty minutes clearly indicates dissatisfaction with the product's performance. This suggests the customer expected a longer life for the bulb, the product not meeting the expected reliability standards. Finally, the mention of having to 'be prepared to buy a lot of expensive bulbs' is a strong suggestion of dissatisfaction as it indicates an added future cost burden on the customer. In conclusion, the various issues experienced by the customer, from the arrival of the product with a broken part, to the failure during assembly, through to the poor performance and anticipated high maintenance costs, all point towards dissatisfaction with the product."},{"question":"Q:I know that the answer to the question \\"Where in North America can you find Korean Presbyterians?\\" is in \\"Korean Presbyterian denominations are active in evangelism and many of its missionaries are being sent overseas, being the second biggest missionary sender in the world after the United States.

Those species that seek pest insects are considered beneficial 'biological control agents' and their presence encouraged in biological pest control programs. Nectar feeders such as hummingbirds, sunbirds, lories, and lorikeets amongst others have specially adapted brushy tongues and in many cases bills designed to fit co-adapted flowers. Kiwis and shorebirds with long bills probe for invertebrates; shorebirds' varied bill lengths and feeding methods result in the separation of ecological niches. Loons, diving ducks, penguins and auks pursue their prey underwater, using their wings or feet for propulsion, while aerial predators such as sulids, kingfishers and terns plunge dive after their prey.

The New York Times' Christine Negroni reports that engineers and scientists are questioning whether airplane seats are adequately constructed to protect overweight travelers. Government standards for airplane seat strength -first set more than 60 years ago---require that the seats be made for a passenger weighing 170 pounds(77kg).Today, the average American man weighs nearly 194 pounds(88kg) and the average woman 165 pounds(75kg).Negroni reports: \\"If a heavier person completely fills a seat ,the seat is not likely to behave as intended during a crash,\\"Robert Salzar,the leading scientist at the Center for Applied Biomechanics at the University of Virginia. \\"The energy absorption(,) that is built into the aircraft seat is likely to be overpowered and the passengers will not be protected properly\\". \\"Nor would the injury be limited to that passenger only,\\" Dr. Salzar said. \\"If a seat or a seat belt fails,\\"he said, \\"those people who are seated nearby could be endangered from the uncontrolled movements of the passenger.\\" Most complaints about airplane seats focus on their lack of comfort and high ticket price, and whether overweight passengers should be made to buy two seats.

How the old are often ignored and treated like a bother, which means they end up feeling unappreciated and like their lives are empty.

I enjoy a good art movie but when a movie becomes too self-consciously arty (as in this case) the result is often frustrating. Including shots of a person packing a suitcase slowly that take 5 minutes try to make a point but just end up annoying the audience.

The thought of it brought a sudden spark of concern, a tinge of reality to her whimsical daydream. Step 1: Establish a connection to the main characters and setting To begin the text, I would first need to introduce the protagonists, such as the woman having this daydream and Logan Mackenzie, to build a connection with the readers. I should also set the story in an appropriate location - such as an urban environment where this strong emotional juxtaposition between the dream and reality is emphasized. Step 2: Describe the fantasy To further emphasize the allure of her daydream, I would provide vivid descriptions of the castle, its architecture, the life of luxury she would be experiencing as a princess, and the romance between the two characters. This would help the readers to better understand her longing for this fairy-tale life and her connection with Logan inside their beautiful and perhaps centuries-old castle. Step 3: Contrast the daydream with reality As she continues to get lost in her daydream, I would then abruptly bring her back to reality, highlighting the mundaneness of her current surroundings and the quotidian responsibilities waiting for her. This will show the stark contrast between her daydream and her actual life. Step 4: Introduce the element of conflict The conflict arises when she starts to realize the practical challenges of merging her existing life and profession, her law practice, with the one she desires with Logan. This introduces tension and uncertainty to the story, which would be relatable to readers who also manage the balance between dreams and reality. Step 5: Conclude the scene With the introduction of the elements of conflict and tension, I would end the scene on the note that the woman has to face the reality of her life and contemplate the feasibility of her dreams. This could leave the readers wondering whether she will eventually try to make her dreams come true or decide that it is too risky and remain in her current, more predictable reality. Text completed: Jennifer peered dreamily through the elevator's glass windows, losing herself in fantasies of living in an ancient Scottish castle with Logan Mackenzie. In her daydream, they rode their magnificent horses across the verdant, rolling hills, basking in the sunlight as she imagined herself to be Logan's princess, his queen. The opulent castle, nestled between snow-capped mountains and pristine lakes, offered an idyllic backdrop to their love story; a never-ending tale of passion and devotion. The grandeur of their life together filled Jennifer with a warmth that she hadn't experienced in her mundane city life. Suddenly, the elevator jolted, and the doors creaked open to reveal a sterile, fluorescent-lit hallway. Reality intruded her enchanting reverie, and Jennifer sighed, her heart heavy with longing. As she stepped out, her train of thought inevitably led her to the question of how her bustling law practice would fit into this mesmerizing dream world. The weight of her obligations hung in the air, and she knew she had a decision to make. Would it be possible to combine her existing life and career with the fairy-tale romance that glimmered tantalizingly on the horizon? Or would the fortitude it took to chase her dreams prove to be an insurmountable obstacle on her path to finding true happiness with Logan?"},{"question":"Alien Planet starts out with an interstellar spacecraft named Von Braun , leaving Earth's orbit .

Every year, without fail, I feel a little bit depressed on the First of March. I absolutely love summer. I love the hot weather, the skimpy clothes, the summer fruits and the party seasons. I only have good memories of summer - Christmas time, six weeks holidays when in school then three months off whilst at uni. In my eyes, there is not one bad thing about summer. That is why I hate the First of March. Yes, it is still hot. Yes, my summer fruits are still in season and I can still wear my skimpy clothes, but, in my mind, it means that winter is near. The weather is only going to get colder and my favourite time of the year is official over. In an attempt to lift my end of Summer blues I decided to give myself a bright, cheerful manicure.

As well as the small and large systems, for effective air defence there must be intermediate systems. These may be deployed at regiment-level and consist of platoons of self-propelled anti-aircraft platforms, whether they are self-propelled anti-aircraft guns (SPAAGs), integrated air-defence systems like Tunguska or all-in-one surface-to-air missile platforms like Roland or SA-8 Gecko.","response":"Title: In-Depth Analysis: The Role and Importance of Integrated Air Defence Systems in Modern Armies"},{"question":"How does the sentence end?

In his 21st-century biography, Chernow cites this incident as evidence that Hamilton and Laurens saw the Revolution and the struggle against slavery as inseparable. Hamilton attacked his political opponents as demanding freedom for themselves and refusing to allow it to blacks. In January 1785, Hamilton attended the second meeting of the New York Manumission Society (NYMS). John Jay was president and Hamilton was the first secretary and later became president. Chernow notes how the membership soon included many of Hamilton's friends and associates. Hamilton was a member of the committee of the society that petitioned the legislature to end the slave trade, and that succeeded in passing legislation banning the export of slaves from New York. In the same period, Hamilton felt bound by the rule of law of the time and his law practice facilitated the return of a fugitive slave to Henry Laurens of South Carolina. He opposed the compromise at the 1787 Constitutional Convention by which the federal government could not abolish the slave trade for 20 years, and was disappointed when he lost that argument. Hamilton never supported forced emigration for freed slaves. Horton has argued from this that he would be comfortable with a multiracial society, and that this distinguished him from his contemporaries. In international affairs, he supported Toussaint L'Ouverture's black government in Haiti after the revolt that overthrew French control, as he had supported aid to the slaveowners in 1791--both measures hurt France. Scant evidence has been interpreted by a few to indicate Hamilton may have owned household slaves, as did many wealthy New Yorkers (the evidence for this is indirect; McDonald interprets it as referring to paid employees). Do you have any questions?","response":"Based on your description of Alexander Hamilton's views on slavery and his involvement in the New York Manumission Society, it is evident that Hamilton was an advocate for abolition and was willing to work towards the end of slavery. This is further supported by his support for Toussaint L'Ouverture's black government in Haiti and his opposition to the 1787 Constitutional Convention compromise. However, his actions regarding the return of a fugitive slave to Henry Laurens and the indirect evidence indicating the possible ownership of household slaves suggest that Hamilton might have been conflicted or bound by the societal norms and legal structures of his time. It is important to approach historical figures like Hamilton within the context of their era and to recognize that their understanding of issues and values might have evolved over time. It would be informative to further explore the reasons behind Hamilton's decisions regarding the return of the fugitive slave and possible ownership of household slaves to better understand the complexities and nuances of his views on slavery. In any case, Hamilton's overall contributions to the abolitionist movement and his willingness to challenge the status quo on slavery suggest that he was, to some extent, ahead of his time and working towards a vision of a more just and equitable society."},{"question":"I had to get new keys for our room because my key was bent all crazy .

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: the radicle is also growing and producing the primary root. As it grows downward to form the tap root, lateral roots branch off to all sides, producing the typical dicot tap root system. In monocot seeds (Figure 32.21), the testa and tegmen of the seed coat are fused. As the seed germinates, the primary root emerges, protected by the root-tip covering: the coleorhiza. Next, the primary shoot emerges, protected by the coleoptile: the covering of the shoot tip. Upon exposure to light (i. when the plumule has exited the soil and the protective coleoptile is no longer needed), elongation of the coleoptile ceases and the leaves expand and unfold. At the other end of the embryonic axis, the primary root soon dies, while other, adventitious roots (roots that do not arise from the usual place – i. the root) emerge from the base of the stem.

Mass and weight are closely related. However, the weight of an object can change if the force of gravity changes. On Earth, the force of gravity is the same everywhere. So how does the force of gravity change? It doesnt if you stay on Earth. What if we travel to another planet or moon in our solar system? Look at the photo of astronaut Edwin E. Aldrin Jr. taken by fellow astronaut Neil Armstrong in the Figure. They were the first humans to walk on the moon. An astronaut weighs less on the moon than he would on Earth. This is because the moons gravity is weaker than Earths. The astronauts mass, on the other hand, did not change. He still contained the same amount of matter on the moon as he did on Earth. If the astronaut weighed 175 pounds on Earth, he would have weighed only 29 pounds on the moon. If his mass on Earth was 80 kg, what would his mass have been on the moon? [Figure 3] According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"Who were the first humans to walk on the moon?\\" is \\"Newtons\\"?","response":"The paragraph contains multiple questions and information, but I will first answer the initial question and then clarify the confusion regarding the first humans to walk on the moon. To calculate your weight in newtons given a mass of 50 kg, we need to consider the force of gravity. Weight (in newtons) = Mass (in kg) × Acceleration due to gravity (in m/s²) On Earth, the acceleration due to gravity is approximately 9.81 m/s². Weight = 50 kg × 9.81 m/s² = 490.5 N So, your weight with a mass of 50 kg on Earth would be around 490.5 newtons. Regarding the question \\"Who were the first humans to walk on the moon?\\", the correct answer is \\"Neil Armstrong and Edwin E. Aldrin Jr.\\" (commonly known as Buzz Aldrin).

Jumbo was exported to Jardin des Plantes, a zoo in Paris and then transferred in 1865 to London Zoo in England. Despite public protest, Jumbo was sold to P. T. Barnum, who took him to the United States for exhibition in March 1882. The giant elephant's name has spawned the common word, \\"jumbo\\", meaning large in size. Context: Jumbo died at a railway classification yard in Canada at St. Thomas, Ontario on September 15, 1885. In those days the circus crisscrossed North America by train. St. Thomas was the perfect place for a circus because many rail lines converged in St. Thomas in that day. Jumbo and the other animals had finished their performances for the night and, as they were being led to their box car, a train came roaring down the track. Jumbo was hit and mortally wounded, dying within minutes. Barnum told the story that Tom Thumb, a young circus elephant was walking on the railroad tracks and Jumbo was attempting to lead him to safety. Barnum claimed that the locomotive hit and killed Tom Thumb before it derailed and hit Jumbo. However, other witnesses did not support Barnum's account. According to newspapers, the freight train hit Jumbo directly, killing him, while Tom Thumb suffered a broken leg. Many metallic objects were found in the elephant's stomach, including English pennies, keys, rivets, and a police whistle. Ever the showman, Barnum had portions of his star attraction separated, in order to have multiple sites attracting curious spectators. After touring with Barnum's circus, the skeleton was donated to the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, where it remains. The elephant's heart was sold to Cornell University. Jumbo's hide was stuffed by William J. Critchley and Carl Akeley, both of Ward's Natural Science, who stretched it during the mounting process; the mounted specimen traveled with Barnum's circus for two years. Barnum eventually donated the stuffed Jumbo to Tufts University, where it was displayed at P.T. Barnum Hall there for many years. The hide was destroyed in a fire in April 1975. Ashes from that fire, which are believed to contain the elephant's remains, are kept in a 14-ounce Peter Pan Crunchy Peanut Butter jar in the office of the Tufts athletic director, while his taxidermied tail, removed during earlier renovations, resides in the holdings of the Tufts Digital Collections and Archives. Question: When did this happen?. Whats the answer?","response":"The event you are referring to, Jumbo the Elephant's death, occurred on September 15, 1885, in St. Thomas, Ontario, Canada.

Determine the character played by the star in the HBO drama series \\"Rome.\\" First, we need to identify the Irish film directed by Paddy Breathnach. Paddy Breathnach is an Irish film director who has directed several films, including \\"I Went Down\\" (1997), \\"Blow Dry\\" (2001), and the Academy Award-nominated film \\"Viva\\" (2015).

Now, we need to determine the character Brendan Gleeson played in the HBO drama series \\"Rome\\". While Brendan Gleeson is a versatile and accomplished actor, after thorough research, it appears that he did not have a role in the television show \\"Rome\\". The series, which aired from 2005 to 2007, included actors like Kevin McKidd, Ray Stevenson, and Ciarán Hinds, but not Brendan Gleeson.

Would \\"Fraud is a defense in a civil action for breach of contract or specific performance of a contract .\\" be a reasonable answer? A:","response":"The difference in meaning between fraud and illegal acts is as follows: Fraud refers to a deception made intentionally by an individual or an entity for personal gain or to damage another party. It typically involves misrepresentation, manipulation, or deceit to achieve the desired outcome. Illegal acts, on the other hand, encompass a broader range of activities that are prohibited by law, not necessarily involving deception. These can include crimes such as theft, assault, drug possession, or tax evasion, among others. As for the statement \\"Fraud is a defense in a civil action for breach of contract or specific performance of a contract,\\" it is a reasonable answer under specific circumstances. If a party to a contract commits fraud – for example, by misrepresenting information or making false promises – the victim can use this fraudulent behavior as a defense against a claim for breach of contract or specific performance.

She also asks the court to “bifurcate” their marital status — a process that would mean they could dissolve the marriage and go back to being single before resolving other issues in the divorce. A spokesperson for Jolie told PEOPLE that the aim the filing “is to provide closure to the marriage in a way that clears a path toward the next stage of their lives and allows her and Brad to recommit as devoted co-parents to their children.” RELATED VIDEO: Why Brad Pitt Is ‘Much, Much Happier’ a Year and a Half After Split from Angelina Jolie Pitt’s lawyer, Lance Spiegel, slammed the actress’ filing on Wednesday as “unnecessary” and “a thinly-veiled effort to manipulate media coverage.” Spiegel’s filing affirmed the actor “loaned” Jolie 8 million to help her purchase her current home and has contributed over 1.3 million “in bills for the benefit of [Jolie] and the minor children.” Jolie, 43, and Pitt, 53, met in 2003 and wed in 2014 before they separated in Sept. 2016 citing irreconcilable differences. Custody of their six children — Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 12, and 10-year-old twins Vivienne and Knox — has been an ongoing issue. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","response":"Angelina Jolie's attorney, Samantha Bley DeJean, has released a statement asserting that Jolie has carried the majority of the costs for their six children for the past two years, while ex-husband Brad Pitt has not met his legal obligations to support them. In recent court documents, Pitt stated that he had loaned Jolie 8 million for a house and had paid over 1.3 million in bills for her and the children. However, DeJean argues that the loan was not child support, and that Jolie is requesting Pitt to cover 50% of the children's expenses, which he has not been doing.

Seahawks-49ers next Sunday at CenturyLink Field for a trip to the Super Bowl.— John Boyle (@johnpboyle) January 12, 2014 SF-Seattle: there will be blood…— Andrew Brandt (@adbrandt) January 12, 2014 The 49ers ran the football well. Anquan Boldin was tough to cover all afternoon. Newton eventually got rattled. All these these reasons contributed to the 49ers’ victory, but the Panthers’ approach to the game hampered them from the start. The lack of poise & composure shown by the @Panthers young players has been costly. Too many \\"macho\\" penalties to win a big game.— Bucky Brooks (@BuckyBrooks) January 12, 2014 The 49ers are now getting to Newton on a regular basis. Newton is obviously rattled by the pressure. It eventually resulted in an interception. It's amazing how the #49ers can line up in Nickel personnel and play vanilla defense all night. Superior talent allows them win w/simplicity— Bucky Brooks (@BuckyBrooks) January 12, 2014 If there's anyone in his area code, Cam's eyes are on rush. Panthers not dead yet, but a bad sign.— Travis Haney (@TravHaneyESPN) January 12, 2014 Bad throw by Newton, but also credit pass rush by 49ers. Really collapsing pocket this entire drive.— Smart Football (@smartfootball) January 12, 2014 SF 23, CAR 10: 49ers add three points and kill the clock. San Francisco wasn’t able to find the end zone after driving the football for an extended period of time. But that’s secondary to adding more points while running down the clock. Phil Dawson's 3rd FG in 3 tries pushes #49ers lead to 23-10 with 7:41 left— Cam Inman (@CamInman) January 12, 2014 49ers got the ball with just over 15 minutes left. They will have run nearly half of the time remaining off the clock on this drive.— KC Joyner (@KCJoynerTFS) January 12, 2014 The 49ers handed the ball to RB Frank Gore to finish the game, but the 49ers’ offensive line deserves as much credit as Gore for their ability to control the line of scrimmage. The @49ers use of the Power from \\"22\\" is unbelievable to watch. Big bodies moving all over the place w/a tough, downhill RB attacking seams— Bucky Brooks (@BuckyBrooks) January 12, 2014 Frank Gore rushing … First half: 17. Second half: 67. #49ers— Eric Branch (@Eric_Branch) January 12, 2014 One cue, the 49ers sacked Newton on back-to-back plays. Navorro Bowman got to the quarterback first followed by Ahmad Brooks. The two plays were instrumental in taking points off the board. Those two sacks were basically three points. Panthers went from field goal range to punting.— Michael David Smith (@MichaelDavSmith) January 12, 2014 If the 49ers are going to put the game away, they need to apply more pressure on Newton. Newton is far too comfortable in the pocket. Niners are getting very little pass rush today. Great pass blocking by Carolina.— KC Joyner (@KCJoynerTFS) January 12, 2014 Kaepernick and Newton may be friends, but the 49ers’ quarterback had a little fun impersonating the Panthers’ quarterback after his touchdown run. Kap celebrates as the #49ers extend the lead. #SFvsCAR http://t.co/EEqQGkg3GK— San Francisco 49ers (@49ers) January 12, 2014 SF 20, CAR 10: Anquan Boldin takes over for the 49ers. Kaepernick may have capped the 49ers’ initial drive in the second half with a touchdown run, but it was Boldin who set up the score. The Panthers are having a difficult time covering the veteran receiver. #49ers Anquan Boldin (6 catches, 122) has his fourth 100-yard performance in past 7 postseason games.— Eric Branch (@Eric_Branch) January 12, 2014 Colin Kaepernick: 4th career postseason TD run (5th career postseason game) for 49ers— ESPN Stats & Info (@ESPNStatsInfo) January 12, 2014 The visiting San Francisco 49ers are leading 13-10 headed into halftime of their divisional-playoff game against the Carolina Panthers. Here’s what each team needs to do in the second half. For the 49ers to win: Keep converting on third down The Panthers’ defense is one of the stingiest in the NFL, and for San Francisco to have a chance in this game, it has to sustain drives. In the game’s opening series, San Francisco converted 3-of-4 third-downs. San Francisco was 2 of 13 on third downs against Carolina in first game. The 49ers converted 3 of 4 on first drive today.— Steve Reed (@SteveReedAP) January 12, 2014 One of those was because of a penalty. In the rest of the half, however, San Francisco had a much more difficult time moving the chains on third downs, failing to convert on three chances. The key will be making sure they face third-and-shorts and not third-and-longs. Otherwise, San Francisco will continue to struggle to keep drives moving. Disrupt Cam Newton and bring a pass rush The 49ers had one of the best defenses in the NFL during the regular season, and much of their success was dependant on a disruptive pass rush. In the first half against the Panthers, San Francisco sacked Newton only once. The Panthers’ offensive line gave Newton time to make plays and find his wide receivers. If the 49ers want to hold on to their lead, they will have to bring pressure, but keep Newton in the pocket to throw him off-balance. Outside linebacker Aldon Smith will be key in that objective. He was very quiet in the first half and needs to be more aggressive the rest of the game. For the Panthers to win, they have to: Keep playing with emotion, but rein it in It’s only natural for young players to be emotional come playoff time. That sometimes leads to forced plays. Newton fired his passes with too much velocity and tried to squeeze in several throws during his opening drive. It led to a tipped interception. On defense, Carolina was called for four penalties that extended San Francisco’s first two drives. They resulted in 49ers field goals. The Panthers need to keep bringing that emotion and physical play but not get carried away with it. The second quarter showed how dangerous Carolina can be when it plays comfortable and assertive. Carolina scored 10 points and held the 49ers scoreless. If the Panthers can keep up the physical play, expect much of the same in the second half. Let Cam Newton do what he wants with the offense The Panthers are at their best when Newton is in a rhythm, throwing darts and taking off when he sees an opening. After a shaky start, Newton settled down and led the Panthers offense. Not surprisingly, Newton targeted wide receiver Steve Smith early. Newton is the dynamic play-maker on the offense, but Smith is the veteran leader. His fiery style of play helps give Carolina confidence. In the first half, Smith had four targets, all of which were caught, for 74 yards and one touchdown. Besides the early interception, Newton was effective in the first half, running for 40 yards on seven carries and throwing for 136 yards and a touchdown. Carolina needs to stay aggressive and allow Newton to keep attacking. A few read-option plays showed the Panthers can add wrinkles to keep San Francisco off-balance. Expect more of the same in the second half. SF 13, CAR 10: 49ers awarded touchdown after review. Kaepernick’s accuracy has been highly inconsistent. But as halftime neared, Kaepernick was able to complete multiple passes, including a touchdown throw in the corner of the end zone. Davis’ catch originally wasn’t ruled a touchdown. Review showed Davis dragged both feet, and the call was reversed. Most TDs by a TE in NFL postseason history: T1. Dave Casper 7, T1. Vernon Davis 7. #49ers— Eric Branch (@Eric_Branch) January 12, 2014 CAR 10, SF 6: Panthers settle for a field goal. Newton was clearly in a rhythm. The zone read and options off the play really opened up the 49ers defense and had them on the ropes. The Panthers weren’t able to deliver the knockout blow. They instead settled for a field goal. #Panthers Gano kicks 24 yard FG to go up 10-6 on #49ers— Cam Inman (@CamInman) January 12, 2014 Panthers have run 7 plays inside the 49ers' 8-yard line. Have gained 10 yards.— Joe Person (@josephperson) January 12, 2014 Cam Newton is best player on field right now, option has opened up everything— Jim Corbett (@ByJimCorbett) January 12, 2014 Newton is such a unique talent, it allows the Panthers to do more on offense, particularly when Carolina goes to its zone-read packages. The @Panthers are the only team that can run multiple versions of read-option because Newton's size allows him to run between tackles.— Bucky Brooks (@BuckyBrooks) January 12, 2014 Newton combo of size/speed is unreal. He's 6-5 245. In other words, he's the same size as Michael Strahan…as a QB.— Andrew Siciliano (@AndrewSiciliano) January 12, 2014 CAR 7, SF 6: Newton drops a dime. The Panthers were stuffed at the 1-yard line on fourth down. Yet, the 49ers weren’t able to take advantage of the momentum swing. After a punt return from Ted Ginn to give the Panthers tremendous field position, Panthers WR Steve Smith easily beat the cornerback off the line of scrimmage. And Newton threw a perfectly placed ball 31 yards for the game’s first touchdown. Wow what a throw.. No defense for a perfect throw… Cam's pretty sharp so far 7-8.— Bruce Feldman (@BFeldmanCBS) January 12, 2014 That throw from Newton shouldn't be overlooked. Not that many QBs make it as consistently as him.— Cian Fahey (@Cianaf) January 12, 2014 Steve Smith now has 8 career TD catches in postseason (in 9 games)— ESPN Stats & Info (@ESPNStatsInfo) January 12, 2014 That last TD throw by Cam was a display of Rivera’s expectations: This team believes Newton can handle his 1st truly meaningful NFL moment.— Jeff Darlington (@JeffDarlington) January 12, 2014 SF 6, CAR o: Dawson strikes again Dawson continues to prove he’s one of the most reliable kickers in the game. The 49ers may be setting themselves up for failure by not converting for more points, though. Update: Phil Dawson has made 34 of past 35 FG attempts. Analysis: He's having a better season than David Akers did in 2012. #49ers— Eric Branch (@Eric_Branch) January 12, 2014 FGs are good, but the @49ers needed TDs on those drives to put a ton of pressure on the @Panthers . Need to put up 7's in playoffs to win.— Bucky Brooks (@BuckyBrooks) January 12, 2014 49ers WR Michael Crabtee was injured during the first series of the game, and he’s not been the same since. Crabtree opens up the offense for the 49ers. If he’s hampered or not on the field, it would be a major loss. Michael Crabtree doesn't look quite right. Something wrong with his shoulder— Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) January 12, 2014 Crabtree does not look right. Seems to be dealing with an arm/shoulder injury stemming from that Captain Munnerlyn tackle on opening drive.— Matt Barrows (@mattbarrows) January 12, 2014 The first turnover of the game came on the Panthers’ first offensive series. 49ers LB Patrick Willis rode Panthers TE Greg Olsen wide and was then in perfect position to pluck a poorly thrown ball from Newton out of the air. Back leg throw for Cam Newton…who was forced into a mistake under pressure from Aldon Smith.— Matt Miller (@nfldraftscout) January 12, 2014 That is Patrick Willis' 1st interception since Week 16, 2012 against the Seahawks— ESPN Stats & Info (@ESPNStatsInfo) January 12, 2014 Will Tukuafu is a massive fullback at 293 pounds. The 49ers have really relied on him the last few weeks of the season. Takuafu was injured during the 49ers’ first series of the game. He has been ruled out for the rest of the game. If Tukuafu is out, look for Dixon to take the FB snaps (there will be FB snaps) and maybe DT Ian Williams in short-yardage situations.— Chase Stuart (@fbgchase) January 12, 2014 SF 3, CAR 0: 49ers strike first Kaepernick completed a pair of third down throws. The 49ers benefited from a personal foul. And Phil Dawson remains true. Phil Dawson drills 49-yard FG. He's 6 of 6 in his career in postseason. #49ers 3, Panthers 0.— Eric Branch (@Eric_Branch) January 12, 2014 Late hit on Davis was good call folks. He let up & ball is on the ground. It makes no difference pass was tipped — close, but a foul.— Mike Pereira (@MikePereira) January 12, 2014 The 49ers are moving the football with a little help from a hit on a defenseless receiver. But the Panthers are attempting to set the tone of the game during the initial drive. #Panthers playing very physical in coverage. Kuechly and co. hitting Niners' receivers early and often.— Matt Miller (@nfldraftscout) January 12, 2014 Kaepernick is already playing at a higher level than he did during the team’s previous meeting with the Panthers. The 49ers’ quarterback completed a pair of third down passes. He is breaking out of the pocket and still looking to make plays down field. Like the way Kap kept his eyes downfield on that.

Since the absolute value of 36 is greater than the absolute value of -26, we will end up with a positive number. To find the result, we need to subtract the absolute value of the smaller number (26) from the absolute value of the larger number (36): 36 - 26 = 10 So, the equation becomes: 10 = -2*v Now we want to isolate the variable 'v' on one side of the equation.

He has been active since 1998, first as one of the two lead vocalists of the popular J-pop boy-band KAT-TUN. Since the group's official debut in 2006, they have achieved 14 consecutive number ones (including studio albums) on the Oricon charts. In 2009, Akanishi started his solo career, and since then has released two studio albums (Japonicana, #JustJin), and two mini albums (Test Drive, Mi Amor). After he was made a Johnny's Jr. member in 2000, Akanishi was part of a number of groups like Musical Academy Dancing, J2000 and B.A.D., before being drafted into a six-member unit in 2001 with other juniors Kazuya Kamenashi, Junnosuke Taguchi, Koki Tanaka, Tatsuya Ueda and Yuichi Nakamaru. Though the group was originally meant to only be backup dancers for Koichi Domoto of KinKi Kids, the sextet's unexpected popularity led their agency to allow them to expand into a separate group called KAT-TUN, an acronym formed by the first letter of the members' surnames. Despite the group's popularity (they even released DVDs of their live concerts in 2003 and 2005--a first for Johnny's groups that hadn't debuted), they were not allowed to make their bow until five years later in 2006, to immense success. Much to the Japanese public's surprise, Akanishi announced in a press conference on October 13, 2006, that he was leaving the country to study English abroad for an indefinite amount of time. Despite his absence, KAT-TUN were obliged to continue its activities Akanishi finally returned from Los Angeles in the United States after six months on April 19, 2007. He quickly resumed work by joining his bandmates on their nationwide tour on April 21. Akanishi was also a songwriter for the group, having written songs for KAT-TUN and for himself, including \\"Hesitate\\", \\"Love or Like\\" (from Cartoon KAT-TUN II You), \\"Lovejuice\\" (B-side of the limited edition 2 of \\"Don't U Ever Stop\\"), \\"Care\\" (from Break the Records: By You & For You), and \\"Wonder\\". The song \\"Wonder\\" is a collaboration with R&B artist, Crystal Kay in 2009, and Akanishi also featured in her song \\"Helpless Night\\". He can play the guitar and has composed both music and lyrics for \\"Murasaki (murasaki)\\", \\"ha-ha\\" and \\"Pinky\\". He also collaborated with bandmate Ueda to create the song, \\"Butterfly\\" (from Best of KAT-TUN). At the event of Tokyo Girls Collection on September 5, 2009, Jin appeared as a special guest to promote his new movie, Bandage, and he performed the movie's theme song which marked this as the solo debut under the temporary band unit, LANDS, with Takeshi Kobayashi, the producer of Mr. Children. Kobayashi wrote the lyrics and music of their debut single \\"Bandage\\". It was released on November 25, and debuted at number one on the Oricon charts. In 2010, on January 13, was released the studio album Olympos, which also topped the Oricon charts. On January 19, the band held their only live concert, titled LANDS Last Live. Akanishi had a series of solo concerts, titled \\"You & Jin\\", comprising a total of 32 shows from February 7 to February 28, 2010. The song \\"A Page\\", he co-wrote, composed and arranged, featured at his concerts, was released as part of KAT-TUN's 11th single, \\"Love Yourself (Kimi ga Kirai na Kimi ga Suki)\\", on the 2nd limited edition. On June 19 and 20, Akanishi's solo tour \\"You & Jin\\" had a 3 sold-out show tour in Los Angeles, California. In the last show of his \\"You & Jin\\" concert Akanishi announced a tour in the United States. In July, Akanishi announced that he would permanently leave the band KAT-TUN, becoming a solo artist of Johnny & Associates. On September 16, were released dates for Akanishi's November tour \\"Yellow Gold Tour 3010\\", named after the tour's title song \\"Yellow Gold\\", and the cities included were Chicago, New York City, Houston, Los Angeles and San Francisco. The tour featured songs entirely in English, mostly written and produced by the Akanishi himself.

Its capital and most populous city is Minsk. Over 40% of its is forested. Its strongest economic sectors are service industries and manufacturing. Until the 20th century, different states at various times controlled the lands of modern-day Belarus, including the Principality of Polotsk (11th to 14th centuries), the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth, and the Russian Empire. - Eastern Europe, also known as East Europe, is the eastern part of the European continent. There is no consensus on the precise area it covers, partly because the term has a wide range of geopolitical, geographical, cultural, and socioeconomic connotations. There are \\"almost as many definitions of Eastern Europe as there are scholars of the region\\". A related United Nations paper adds that \\"every assessment of spatial identities is essentially a social and cultural construct\\". - The Sicherheitspolizei, often abbreviated as SiPo, was a term used in Germany for security police. In the Nazi era, it was used to describe the state political and criminal investigation security agencies. It was made up by the combined forces of the Gestapo (secret state police) and the Kripo (criminal police) between 1936 and 1939. As a formal agency, the SiPo was folded into the RSHA in 1939, but the term continued to be used informally until the end of World War II in Europe. - The United Nations (UN) is an intergovernmental organization to promote international co-operation. A replacement for the ineffective League of Nations, the organization was established on 24 October 1945 after World War II in order to prevent another such conflict. At its founding, the UN had 51 member states; there are now 193. The headquarters of the United Nations is in Manhattan, New York City, and experiences extraterritoriality. Further main offices are situated in Geneva, Nairobi, and Vienna. The organization is financed by assessed and voluntary contributions from its member states. Its objectives include maintaining international peace and security, promoting human rights, fostering social and economic development, protecting the environment, and providing humanitarian aid in cases of famine, natural disaster, and armed conflict. - Genocide is intentional action to destroy a people (usually defined as an ethnic, national, racial, or religious group) in whole or in part. The hybrid word \\"genocide\\" is a combination of the Greek word \\"génos\\" (\\"race, people\\") and the Latin suffix \\"-cide\\" (\\"act of killing\\"). The United Nations Genocide Convention defines genocide as \\"acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group\\". - The Gestapo, abbreviation of Geheime Staatspolizei, or the Secret State Police, was the official secret police of Nazi Germany and German-occupied Europe. - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water. - The Soviet Union, officially the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR \\" ) was a socialist state in Eurasia that existed from 1922 to 1991. A union of multiple subnational republics, its government and economy were highly centralized. The Soviet Union was a one-party federation, governed by the Communist Party with Moscow as its capital. - A task force (TF) is a unit or formation established to work on a single defined task or activity. Originally introduced by the United States Navy, the term has now caught on for general usage and is a standard part of NATO terminology. Many non-military organizations now create \\"task forces\\" or task groups for temporary activities that might have once been performed by \\"ad hoc\\" committees. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - Franz Walter Stahlecker ( 10 October 1900 -- 23 March 1942 ) was Commander of the Sicherheitspolizei ( Sipo ) and the Sicherheitsdienst ( SD ) ( German : Befehlshaber der Sipo und des SD ; BdS ) for the Reichskommissariat Ostland in 1941 -- 42 . Stahlecker commanded Einsatzgruppe A , the most murderous of the four Einsatzgruppen ( death squads during the Holocaust ) active in German - occupied Eastern Europe .

Due to Drucker's prominence, the two must first undergo blood and eye tests to verify their aptitude. On the day of Drucker's arrival, Adam finds that his family dog Oliver has died, and Hank offers to fly Drucker instead to allow Adam time to have the pet cloned. After visiting a \\"RePet\\" shop, he remains unconvinced but purchases an animatronic doll, a SimPal, named Cindy. Adam returns home and discovers that not only has Oliver already been cloned, but a purported clone of himself is with his family, along with another SimPal Cindy. Replacement Technologies security agents Marshall, Talia, Vincent and Wiley arrive with the intention on killing Adam. Adam kills Talia and Wiley in the ensuing chase and escapes, but both are later cloned. Adam seeks refuge at Hank's apartment after the police betray him to the agents. A while later, Tripp (whom Adam recognizes from the ski trip) kills Hank and is mortally injured by Adam. Revealed as a religious anti-cloning extremist, Tripp informs Adam that Hank was a clone, since he killed the original one on the mountaintop earlier that day, to be able to kill Drucker, who was also a clone, and there is now a new Drucker clone. Tripp then commits suicide to avoid being captured by Marshall and the others. The agents arrive again and Adam is able to disable Marshall and kill Talia again, and steals her thumb. Adam sneaks into Replacement Technologies with Talia's thumb and finds Dr. Griffin Weir, the scientist behind Drucker's illegal human-cloning technology.

The audio cassette was a format used from the late 1970s through to the 1990s alongside vinyl. - Combat Rock is the fifth studio album by the English rock band The Clash. It was released on 14 May 1982 through CBS Records.

The term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora. A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae,\\" effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term \\"reggae\\" more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, especially the New Orleans R&B practiced by Fats Domino and Allen Toussaint, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as Rudie Blues, then Ska, later Blue Beat, and Rock Steady. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rock steady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument. - The Clash were an English punk rock band that formed in 1976 as part of the original wave of British punk.

Please find below a detailed explanation for my rating: 1. Brevity: The reviewer used only four words in their review ('useful', 'reliable', 'everyday', and a typo in 'everday' which can be corrected as 'everyday'). Therefore, the review is concise but lacks elaboration. A longer, more detailed review would be more informative for potential consumers. 2. Positive Feedback: The review is positive in nature, suggesting that the product is both useful and reliable when used in everyday situations. This information potentially encourages others to consider purchasing the product, as it highlights key benefits related to its practicality and dependability. 3. Mispelling: There is a misspelling in the review ('everday' instead of 'everyday'). While this minor error does not greatly affect the overall understanding of the review, it does reduce the perceived professionalism and attention to detail of the reviewer. 4. Lack of Context: The review lacks context, making it difficult for potential consumers to understand the specific product or service being reviewed. Providing additional details about the product, its features, or how it has been put to use would enhance the clarity and relevance of the review to potential buyers. 5. Subjectivity: A review is ultimately subjective, as it represents the opinion and personal experiences of the user. Consequently, a rating of 3.5 gives room for potential differences in perspective among other users, who may find the product more or less useful and reliable in their own day-to-day lives. In summary, while the review is generally positive, its limited length and lack of context make it challenging to assess the product in question fully.

Presbyterian churches derive their name from the presbyterian form of church government, which is governed by representative assemblies of elders. Many Reformed churches are organized this way, but the word \\"Presbyterian,\\" when capitalized, is often applied uniquely to the churches that trace their roots to the Scottish and English churches that bore that name and English political groups that formed during the English Civil War. Presbyterian theology typically emphasizes the sovereignty of God, the authority of the Scriptures, and the necessity of grace through faith in Christ. Presbyterian church government was ensured in Scotland by the Acts of Union in 1707 which created the kingdom of Great Britain. In fact, most Presbyterians found in England can trace a Scottish connection, and the Presbyterian denomination was also taken to North America mostly by Scots and Scots-Irish immigrants. The Presbyterian denominations in Scotland hold to the theology of John Calvin and his immediate successors, although there are a range of theological views within contemporary Presbyterianism. Local congregations of churches which use presbyterian polity are governed by sessions made up of representatives of the congregation (elders); a conciliar approach which is found at other levels of decision-making (presbytery, synod and general assembly).

Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? Available choices: *no *yes","response":"Choice: *no The two questions presented are not the same. The first question is about the impact of good and evil deeds, while the second question is about dealing with a personal issue of being picked on by a teacher. Let's address each question separately. 1. \\"In good vs. evil, why is it that 'evil' deeds seem to have a much larger impact on the world than the benefits of 'good'?\\" To understand why evil deeds may appear to have a larger impact on the world than good deeds, it's essential first to consider the nature of human psychology and the role of media. Several factors contribute to this seemingly disproportionate coverage and impact of evil events compared to good ones. First, humans have a psychological tendency known as the negativity bias. This means that people are generally more affected by negative experiences than by positive ones. For instance, they are more likely to remember adverse events, pay more attention to them, and take more effort to avoid them. This naturally leads to a greater focus on evil deeds, amplifying their perceived impact on the world. Another factor that contributes to the greater visibility of evil deeds is the nature of the media, which tends to emphasize and sensationalize negative events. News stories about violence, disaster, and misfortune are more likely to draw viewers' attention, leading to higher ratings and revenues for media outlets. This creates a skewed perception of the world, where evil deeds may seem more prevalent and impactful than good ones. Moreover, evil deeds can often cause destruction and harm on a large scale, which can leave a lasting impression on the world. In contrast, good deeds can be less noticeable and may not generate immediate results. However, it's important to keep in mind that the cumulative effect of good deeds can be significant and lead to profound changes in society over time. 2. \\"How do I deal with being picked on by a teacher?\\" Being picked on by a teacher can be a challenging and distressing experience. Here are some steps you can take to help handle the situation and protect yourself: 1. Stay calm and composed: Even though you may feel hurt or angered by the teacher's behavior, reacting impulsively or defensively can escalate the situation. Focus on staying calm and maintaining a composed demeanor. 2. Reflect on the situation: Consider if there is any specific reason for the teacher's behavior. Is there something you can change or improve upon? If not, acknowledge that the issue might be stemming from the teacher and not you. 3. Speak privately with the teacher: If you feel comfortable, approach the teacher privately to discuss the issue. Calmly express how their actions have been affecting you and ask for an explanation or resolution. 4. Document instances of unfair treatment: Keep a written record of any incidents involving the teacher - when, where, and what happened. Collecting this documentation can support your case if you need to bring the issue to school authorities. 5. Seek support: Talk to trusted friends, family members, or a counselor about your experiences. They can provide guidance, support, and possibly help connect you with resources to address the situation. 6. Report the issue to school authorities: If the teacher continues to mistreat you or you feel unsafe, inform school administrators or counselors about the problem. Provide them with clear examples and documentation, and trust them to take appropriate action to remedy the situation."},{"question":"Instructions: In this task, you are given a context paragraph, a question based on that and corresponding answer of a question.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less eggs to sit on happens, how will it affect muscles contracting MORE INTENSELY. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","response":"The perturbation hypothesis involving fewer eggs to sit on does not have a direct effect on the process of muscles contracting more intensely. The process of muscle contractions, as described above, is physiological and based on the brain's instructions to the muscles through electrical signals. However, there might be an indirect effect on muscle contractions if we consider the larger context or the behavior in question. For instance, if an individual (e.g., a bird) needs to sit on fewer eggs, the situation might require the individual to adjust its body position or posture to ensure proper incubation. This adjustment might potentially cause certain muscles to contract more intensely than usual for maintaining balance or the new position. However, these indirect effects would largely depend on the specific context and the organism's response to the altered situation. In most cases, the mere presence of fewer eggs to sit on would not play a significant role in affecting the intensity of muscle contractions."},{"question":"Answer the questions at the end based on the text. A biblical canon or canon of scripture is a set of texts (or \\"books\\") which a particular religious community regards as authoritative scripture. The English word \\"canon\\" comes from the Greek κανών, meaning \\"rule\\" or \\"measuring stick\\". Christians became the first to use the term in reference to scripture, but Eugene Ulrich regards the idea as Jewish. Most of the canons listed below are considered \\"closed\\" (i.e., books cannot be added or removed), reflecting a belief that public revelation has ended and thus some person or persons can gather approved inspired texts into a complete and authoritative canon, which scholar Bruce Metzger defines as \\"an authoritative collection of books\\". In contrast, an \\"open canon\\", which permits the addition of books through the process of continuous revelation, Metzger defines as \\"a collection of authoritative books\\". These canons have developed through debate (canonology) and agreement on the part of the religious authorities of their respective faiths and denominations. Believers consider canonical books as inspired by God or as expressive of the authoritative history of the relationship between God and his people. Some books such as the Jewish-Christian gospels, have been excluded from various canons altogether, but many disputed books—considered non-canonical or even apocryphal by some—are considered to be Biblical apocrypha or Deuterocanonical or fully canonical by others. Differences exist between the Jewish Tanakh and Christian biblical canons, although the Jewish Tanakh did form the basis for the Christian Old Testament, and between the canons of different Christian denominations. The differing criteria and processes of canonization dictate what the various communities regard as inspired scripture. In some cases where varying strata of scriptural inspiration have accumulated, it becomes prudent to discuss texts that only have an elevated status within a particular tradition. This becomes even more complex when considering the open canons of the various Latter Day Saint sects—which one may view as extensions of Christianity (and thus of Judaism)—and the scriptural revelations purportedly given to several leaders over the years within that movement. 1. Where does the English word Canon come from? 2. What have the caonons developed through? 3. How does Bruce Metzger define an Authoritive canon? 4. What does an open cannon permit? 5.

Where does it become prudent to discuss texts that only have an elevated status within a particular tradition? 9. Did the Jewish Tanakh for the basis for the Christian Old Testament? 10. What group became the first to use the term? Numbered answers:","response":"1. The English word \\"Canon\\" comes from the Greek word \\"κανών,\\" which stands for \\"rule\\" or \\"measuring stick.\\" 2. The canons have been developed through debate (a process called canonology) and the agreement of the religious authorities of their respective faiths and denominations. 3. Scholar Bruce Metzger defines an authoritative canon as an \\"authoritative collection of books\\". This usually signifies a \\"closed\\" canon, or in simpler terms, a set text of books that cannot be added to or removed from. 4. An open canon allows the addition of books or texts through the process of continuous revelation. This implies that the canon isn't static but dynamically changes with time based on new revelations. 5. Metzger defines an \\"open canon\\" as a \\"collection of authoritative books\\" where there are no restrictions against adding new books to the collection over time, presumably because the faith continues to receive and affirm new public revelations. 6. Yes, differences do exist between the Jewish Tanakh and Christian biblical canons. The Jewish Tanakh, while forming the basis for the Christian Old Testament, has divergences in terms of what books are included and how they are understood. 7. The Greek word that \\"canon\\" comes from, \\"κανών,\\" is defined as a \\"rule\\" or \\"measuring stick.\\" 8. It becomes prudent to discuss texts that have only an elevated status within a particular tradition when varying strata of scriptural inspiration have accumulated. Therefore, when a specific religious tradition assigns a higher level of authority or inspiration to certain texts, those texts become an important topic of discussion. 9. Yes, the Jewish Tanakh did form the basis for the Christian Old Testament, although differences in the canons of the two religions exist. 10. Christians were the first group recorded to use the term \\"canon\\" in reference to scripture, at least according to the historical understanding presented here. However, the idea of a canon of scriptures is thought by Eugene Ulrich to be originally a Jewish concept."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

Title: Man of the Year Movie plot: The story opens with Tom Dobbs (Robin Williams), a comedian and host of a satirical talk show who is able to tap into people's frustrations with the sharply divided, special-interest driven political climate. During his warm-up act, an audience member suggests that he run for President. At first, Dobbs laughs off the idea, but following a popular groundswell of support, later announces on the air that he will stand as a candidate. Through his efforts, he gets on the ballot in 13 states and participates in one of the national debates with the Democratic Incumbent President Kellogg and Republican U.S. Senator Mills.A parallel plot follows Eleanor (played by Laura Linney), who works at a voting machine company called Delacroy. According to a television commercial in the movie, the entire United States will be using Delacroy voting machines for the presidential election. Shortly before the elections, Eleanor notices an error in the voting system, but the head of the company purposefully ignores her warnings. Initially, Dobbs approaches the campaign seriously - perhaps too seriously, to the chagrin of his staff, especially his manager Jack Menken (Christopher Walken). That turns around the night of the presidential debates, where, fed up with the posturing of the other candidates, he shifts back into comedian mode, managing to keep the audience laughing and make serious points simultaneously. From then on, he resumes his showman persona, thoroughly shaking up the political landscape. Dobbs surges in polls after the debates, but remains in a distant third to Kellogg and Mills.Election Day arrives and polls show Dobbs at 17% with Kellogg and Mills tied in the 40s. Dobbs performs better than expected, although not well enough to be close to either of the two major candidates. Early returns show Kellogg beating Mills everywhere.

The treaty transferred ownership of Puerto Rico from Spain to the United States, marking the beginning of Puerto Rico's relationship with the U.S. as its unincorporated territory. Prior to 1898, Puerto Rico, also known as Boriken or Borinquen by the indigenous Taíno people, was under Spanish control for more than 400 years since its colonization in 1493. During the colonial period, the Spanish instituted a system of governance and cultural influence that shaped Puerto Rico's social and economic development. The Spanish-American War broke out in April 1898, and it was fought between the United States and Spain, mainly over control of Cuba. However, Puerto Rico and the Philippines were also part of the war, as they were also Spanish colonies. After only a few months of fighting, Spain was defeated, and by signing the Treaty of Paris, it ceded Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines to the United States. This marked a significant shift in Puerto Rico's status and its relationship with the U.S. Since then, Puerto Rico has gone through several stages of political and economic development within its relationship with the United States. In 1900, the U.S. Congress passed the Foraker Act, which established a civilian government in Puerto Rico and allowed the U.S. President to appoint a governor and other key officials. The Jones Act of 1917 granted U.S. citizenship to Puerto Ricans, further incorporating them into the United States. In 1950, Congress enacted Public Law 600, leading to the drafting of Puerto Rico's constitution, which was approved in 1952. This act designated Puerto Rico as a Commonwealth, also referred to as an Estado Libre Asociado (Free Associated State), giving it greater autonomy while still maintaining its status as an unincorporated territory of the United States. Under this status, Puerto Ricans elect their own local government, but they do not have voting representation in the U.S. Congress, and they are not permitted to vote in U.S. presidential elections. Today, Puerto Rico’s political status continues to be a subject of debate and various referendums have been held over the years to address this issue. Some Puerto Ricans advocate for statehood, which would grant them full rights and representation in the U.S., while others prefer the idea of independence or simply maintaining the current commonwealth status. Nonetheless, since the signing of the Treaty of Paris in 1898, Puerto Rico has been and continues to be an integral part of the United States."},{"question":"Produce a long descriptive sentence that uses all these words: The Cambridge Blue eatType restaurant; The Cambridge Blue customer rating high","response":"The Cambridge Blue, a renowned eatType restaurant, boasts an impressively high customer rating due to its exquisite cuisine, remarkable atmosphere, and exceptional service, all of which allure food connoisseurs from near and far."},{"question":"For this chain-of-thought reasoning and answer, what was the question?

The website problems gave OPTIONS: - ACA reason to hit back at the Affordable Care Act, known better under the name given to it by the opposition – ‘Obamacare’. - CNN reason to hit back at the Affordable Care Act, known better under the name given to it by the opposition – ‘Obamacare’. - Healthcare.gov reason to hit back at the Affordable Care Act, known better under the name given to it by the opposition – ‘Obamacare’. - Obamacare reason to hit back at the Affordable Care Act, known better under the name given to it by the opposition – ‘Obamacare’. - Republican party reason to hit back at the Affordable Care Act, known better under the name given to it by the opposition – ‘Obamacare’. - Republicans reason to hit back at the Affordable Care Act, known better under the name given to it by the opposition – ‘Obamacare’. - White House reason to hit back at the Affordable Care Act, known better under the name given to it by the opposition – ‘Obamacare’. - Wolf Blitzer reason to hit back at the Affordable Care Act, known better under the name given to it by the opposition – ‘Obamacare’.","response":"The website problems gave the Republican party reason to hit back at the Affordable Care Act, known better under the name given to it by the opposition – ‘Obamacare’. As the opposition party, Republicans have been critical of the Affordable Care Act from the start, arguing that it is a flawed system and an example of government overreach. The website problems experienced by Healthcare.gov provided the perfect opportunity for Republicans to strengthen their argument against the healthcare reform. They pointed out that if the government cannot properly execute the launch of a website, how could it handle the complex task of managing an expansive healthcare system? The administration took these criticisms to heart and focused on fixing the issues with Healthcare.gov. Once the website was repaired and became more efficient, enrollment numbers increased substantially, and the Affordable Care Act was ultimately able to provide health insurance to millions of previously uninsured Americans. However, the initial website problems left a lasting impression on public opinion, leading to increased skepticism about the viability of the program. Despite the government's efforts to repair the damage, the challenge to win over public opinion was intensified and added fuel to the ongoing political battle over Obamacare."},{"question":"Question: \\"What is the difference in the views?\\" Context: \\"Some legal scholars, such as John Baker of LSU, theorize that Madison's initial proposed language—that Congress should make no law regarding the establishment of a \\"national religion\\"—was rejected by the House, in favor of the more general \\"religion\\" in an effort to appease the Anti-Federalists. To both the Anti-Federalists and the Federalists, the very word \\"national\\" was a cause for alarm because of the experience under the British crown. During the debate over the establishment clause, Rep. Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts took issue with Madison's language regarding whether the government was a national or federal government (in which the states retained their individual sovereignty), which Baker suggests compelled Madison to withdraw his language from the debate.\\" Answer: The answer to this question is:","response":"The difference in the views between the Federalists and Anti-Federalists regarding the establishment of a \\"national religion\\" lies in their perception of the central government's power and the preservation of states' individual sovereignty. The Federalists were in favor of a strong central government and believed that specifying a \\"national religion\\" would create a sense of unity among the states. On the other hand, Anti-Federalists were more concerned about preserving states' rights and individual liberties. They feared that the term \\"national\\" in the context of a religion would give too much authority to the central government, potentially leading to a situation similar to their experience under British rule. The debate between these two groups led to the rejection of Madison's initial proposed language and the adoption of the more general term \\"religion,\\" which reflected a compromise that addressed the concerns of both factions."},{"question":"Pro zlého čaroděje, Which language is this?","response":"The provided phrase, \\"Pro zlého čaroděje,\\" is in Czech. The Czech language is a West Slavic language and the official language of the Czech Republic, where it's spoken by nearly the entire population. It is also recognized as a minority language in some neighboring countries. The Czech language has been influenced by Latin and German. It shares similarities with other Slavic languages, particularly its closest relative, Slovak, as well as with Polish. It has a moderately complex system of grammar with cases for nouns and features such as aspect and voice for verbs. The excerpt you have provided, when translated to English, can mean \\"For the evil wizard.\\" The word order is just like in English: \\"pro\\" means for, \\"zlého\\" is an inflected form of the adjective \\"zlý,\\" meaning evil, and \\"čaroděje\\" is an inflected form of the word \\"čaroděj,\\" meaning a wizard. The Czech language is written using a Latin-based script. It includes diacritics (namely the háček and acute accent marks) to denote sounds that do not exist in the original Latin alphabet. For example, in the word \\"čaroděje,\\" the \\"č\\" is pronounced as \\"ch\\" in English. In conclusion, the Czech language is historically rich and fitted with detailed linguistic characteristics. As an official language of the Czech Republic and a recognized minority language in several nearby countries, it serves as a vital means of communication in Central Europe. Understanding full well its grammar system, particularly the use of cases for nouns and diacritics, for accurate pronunciation is key for non-native speakers seeking to learn the language."},{"question":"Given the question: Here's a question: Where do you get a table? Here are possible answers to this question: - demonstration - kitchen - furniture store - hallway - apartment I believe the correct choice is \\"furniture store\\", here's why: The answer is:","response":"\\"Furniture store\\", and here's why: Among the provided options, the most reasonable and direct answer to the question \\"Where do you get a table?\\" is a furniture store. A furniture store is specifically dedicated to selling a wide range of furniture items, including tables, chairs, beds, and other home furnishings. Since their primary purpose is to provide customers with options for purchasing furniture, tables can be found in these stores, available in various styles, sizes, materials, and price ranges, catering to different preferences and requirements. Let's also review the other options and explain why they aren't as suitable: 1. Demonstration: A demonstration typically refers to an explanation or a presentation of a product or service to showcase its features and benefits. While tables may be showcased during demonstrations, it is not the appropriate place to acquire one. Demonstrations are simply meant to educate or display products but are not necessarily a place to purchase items. 2. Kitchen: While a kitchen is a common location in homes and apartments where a table is placed, it is not a place to acquire a table. The kitchen is the room where people prepare and cook food, and a table may be present for dining purposes or providing additional counter space. However, it isn't a place to go shopping for a table. 3. Hallway: A hallway is a corridor or passage connecting different rooms within a building, typically found in homes and offices. It mainly serves as a means of moving from one room to another and is not a place where tables are acquired. Although decorative tables can occasionally be found in hallways, it is not a source for purchasing tables. 4. Apartment: An apartment is a living space, usually consisting of rooms in a multi-story building. It's not a place where people can purchase tables. While an apartment may contain a table or other furniture items for residents' use and comfort, it is not a store or source of supply for tables. In conclusion, a furniture store is the most fitting choice for acquiring a table, as it is a retail establishment that specializes in the sale of furniture for various purposes and spaces, including tables. The other options mentioned, such as demonstrations, kitchens, hallways, and apartments, are either unsuitable or not designed for acquiring tables."},{"question":"Given the question: Information: - Lake Geneva (or ' , sometimes ' ) is a lake on the north side of the Alps, shared between Switzerland and France.

Translate to English","response":"As stated in paragraph 16 above, although the Office of the Coordinator recommended the implementation of minimum operational security standards, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations has not established these guidelines as a principle of action in the missions it leads. The passage above, translated from French to English, discusses the apparent disconnect between the recommendation made by the Office of the Coordinator and the Department of Peacekeeping Operations' actions regarding minimum operational security standards in missions under their jurisdiction. The Office of the Coordinator has suggested that these standards be both adopted and implemented as a core principle to improve the overall functioning and success of peacekeeping missions. Minimum operational security standards are essential in providing a safer and more efficient environment for peacekeeping missions. These standards are meant to ensure the well-being of personnel and the success of the mission by mitigating risks and addressing potential challenges. In this context, it is concerning that the Department of Peacekeeping Operations has not acted upon the recommendations made by the Office of the Coordinator. Inclusion of these minimum operational security standards as a guiding principle within peacekeeping missions can provide several benefits, such as: 1. Protecting personnel: Implementing necessary security measures helps reduce casualties, injuries, and psychological trauma experienced by peacekeeping personnel. 2. Enhancing operational effectiveness: Adhering to security guidelines allows for better planning, communication, and coordination between various mission components, which, in turn, can improve the overall effectiveness of peacekeeping efforts. 3. Maintaining credibility and reputation: By taking necessary precautions to ensure the safety and success of peacekeeping missions, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations can maintain the credibility, trust, and reputability of the United Nations and its peacekeeping mandate. 4. Fostering a culture of security: By embedding these standards within the operating procedures of peacekeeping missions, a culture of security and safety awareness can be cultivated among personnel. This ensures the continuous adaptation and improvement of best practices in the field. Given these potential benefits, it is crucial for the Department of Peacekeeping Operations to reconsider its position and prioritize the adoption and implementation of minimum operational security standards in the missions it leads. Doing so can significantly contribute to the overall effectiveness, safety, and long-term success of peacekeeping operations."},{"question":"Article: Pingyao is one of China's three protected ancient cities (the other two are Xi'an and Jingzhou).

At the end of summer, the bear feasts on berries and small woodland animals. During autumn, it devours acorns and salmon. It gained a fifth of the weight it needed from berries during summer, and during autumn, it gained twice that amount from acorns. Salmon made up half of the remaining weight it had needed to gain. How many pounds did it gain eating small animals? Think carefully first, then make a decision:","response":"Let's break down the bear's weight gain step by step. 1. The bear gains 1/5 (one-fifth) of the 1000 pounds it needs from berries during summer. So, 1/5 * 1000 = 200 pounds. 2. During autumn, the bear gains twice the amount from acorns that it gained from berries. So, 2 * 200 = 400 pounds. 3. Now, let's check how much weight the bear has gained in total so far: 200 (berries) + 400 (acorns) = 600 pounds. 4. The bear still needs to gain 1000 - 600 = 400 pounds. And we know that half of this remaining weight comes from salmon. So, 1/2 * 400 = 200 pounds (from salmon). Now, let's find out how many pounds the bear gained from small animals: To reach the 1000 pound goal, the bear gains: 200 pounds (berries) + 400 pounds (acorns) + 200 pounds (salmon) + X (small animals) = 1000 pounds. So, X = 1000 - (200 + 400 + 200). Thus, X = 1000 - 800 = 200 pounds.

Texas Rural Legal Aid - known for its fearless and sometimes controversial advocacy of the poorest of the poor - last week took over four other corporations serving the legal needs of the indigent in Southwest Texas, including the one in Bexar County. The new 68-county legal aid organization has yet to be named and stretches from El Paso to Corpus Christi, Harlingen to Austin. The leader for the super-sized law firm has big plans. \\"I'm more interested in looking at what we as advocates can do to address the serious problems of poverty than the number of cases we close,\\" said David Hall, the TRLA executive director. In the Rio Grande Valley, Hall's attorneys set up separate groups to assist small-business owners and residents with low-interest loans and legal representation. They also operate a legal arm that assists migrant workers from Texas to Kentucky. Now, Hall said, he wants to make services to the poor more efficient by working with law students who will handle less complicated legal matters, allowing licensed attorneys to take more \\"high impact\\" cases to court. \\"What we need to do is handle cases as efficiently as we can, leveraging the amount of time of the lawyer that goes in there and maximizing the number of people that they can help at one time,\\" Hall said. His plan is to place the 110 attorneys on staff in teams working on specialized legal issues. He wants to expand the law clinic it already has with St. Mary's University Law School to involve students at the University of Texas Law School. The law students at St. Mary's interview potential clients, assist them with filling out legal documents and answer the telephones for the legal hotline, freeing up TRLA lawyers to handle the complicated cases, Hall said. By the end of September, Hall said all the attorneys working with the poor in the 68county area will be placed on the same computer network so they can pass cases to the best available attorneys. Last year, board members on the former Legal Aid of Central Texas and Bexar County Legal Aid resisted the merger, saying that the mergers were done illegally and without the input of board members. They also argued that Hall's litigious style hampered their ability to garner funds from Congress. TRLA generated controversy in 1996, when its attorneys challenged the rights of 800 military personnel to vote in Val Verde County elections by absentee ballot after a former Ku Klux Klan member won a county commissioner post. Brendan Gill, the former executive director of the Bexar County group, said he has since come to see the merger as a positive move for South Texas. \\"I always knew there were good points to merging, just as I knew that there were bad points,\\" Gill said.

Given the question \\"What will Others want to do next?\\", is \\"help aubrey\\" a valid answer? Possible answers: [+] Yes; [+] No; The answer is:","response":"Yes, \\"help Aubrey\\" can be a valid answer to the question \\"What will Others want to do next?\\". This is because, in the context of a riot situation where Aubrey, a police officer, is pushing the crowd back, it is likely that there will be other officers or individuals who may want to support or help Aubrey in controlling the situation. These individuals could be assisting her either by providing additional physical force, by coordinating strategies to handle the situation more effectively, or by simply voicing their support for her actions. The response of others to the situation can be influenced by a variety of factors, such as personal beliefs and values, professional responsibilities, and the safety of people around them. In the case of fellow police officers or law enforcement personnel, it is quite likely that they would want to help Aubrey maintain order, as it falls under their professional duties. However, in a riot situation, there will also be individuals who may not want to help Aubrey and may actively work against her efforts to push the crowd back. Some of them might have a strong belief in the cause of the riot they are participating in, and may continue to resist the authority being imposed by the police officers. Others might simply be seeking to cause chaos and disruption, with no specific political motivation. In any case, the answer \\"help Aubrey\\" is valid as it represents one possible avenue of what others may want to do next in this scenario.

Silence again\\", and what could be the reason behind this specific number? Stream of Consciousness Reasoning: Haikus are a traditional form of Japanese poetry that gained popularity due to their simplicity and elegance in conveying profound messages about nature. A major characteristic of Haikus is their syllable count, which typically follows a 5-7-5 pattern. This means that the first line contains five syllables, the second line seven syllables, and the third line five syllables. The famous Haiku poem by Matsuo Basho, \\"An old silent pond / A frog jumps into the pond— / Splash! Silence again\\" adheres to this structure. When we count the syllables, we find that there are 5 in the first line, 7 in the second line, and 5 in the third line. Adding these numbers together, we get a total of 17 syllables. The reason for choosing this specific number is likely because the 5-7-5 syllable count creates a rhythm that contributes to the poem's tranquil yet impactful nature, embodying the essence of Haiku poetry."},{"question":"Write a title: AP - This Georgia-Auburn game has it all: star quarterbacks, stingy defenses, talented running backs and high stakes.

It is a biography of the politician Enoch Powell. The title is taken from Powell's 1968 Rivers of Blood speech when Powell quoted Virgil's \\"Aeneid\\": \\"As I look ahead, I am filled with foreboding; like the Roman, I seem to see the River Tiber foaming with much blood\\". Sentence: Enoch Powell was a great politician.","response":"As an AI language model, I am unable to provide personal opinions or label individuals as \\"great\\" or \\"not great\\"; however, I can provide information on Enoch Powell's life and career to help you determine whether you consider him to be a great politician or not. Enoch Powell was a British politician, classical scholar, and philologist who lived from 1912 to 1998. He served as a Member of Parliament (MP) for many years, representing the Conservative Party between 1950 and 1974 and the Ulster Unionist Party from 1974 to 1987. He held various positions in government, including Financial Secretary to the Treasury, Minister of Health, and Shadow Secretary of State for Defense. Powell was a controversial figure due to some of his views and speeches, particularly his infamous \\"Rivers of Blood\\" speech in 1968. In this speech, he warned against the consequences of immigration, using emotive language and vivid imagery, such as the reference to the River Tiber foaming with blood, which he quoted from Virgil's \\"Aeneid.\\" The speech generated significant debate and polarized public opinion, with some seeing Powell as a visionary who stood up for British identity, while others regarded him as a racist and harmful influence on British politics. In addition to his political career, Powell made notable contributions to classical scholarship. He was a professor of classical Greek before entering politics and would continue to publish scholarly works throughout his life. This erudition was also reflected in his political speeches, as seen in the \\"Rivers of Blood\\" speech, where he referenced classical texts. Many of Enoch Powell's positions on issues such as domestic politics, social policy, and the economy were well-reasoned and influential. For example, he was an early advocate of free-market economics and monetary policy, which would later become hallmarks of the Conservative Party under Margaret Thatcher. Overall, though, his contributions to British politics and society are still the subject of both praise and criticism. Given this information, the sentence \\"Enoch Powell was a great politician\\" is subjective and depends on individual perspectives and values. While some people may view his political career as influential and important, others might focus on his contentious views and speeches, leading them to disagree with the notion that he was a great politician."},{"question":"Possible tweet sentiments: OPTIONS: - negative - positive Write a tweet that is negative.","response":"Step 1: Identify a topic that will allow for a negative sentiment to be conveyed.

Johnston was born on 23 September 1994 in Dumfries, Scotland, the son of Andrew Johnston and Morag Brannock. He was given the extensive name Andrew Aaron Lewis Patrick Brannock John Grieve Michael Robert Oscar Schmidt Johnston. Johnston's parents separated when he was eight months old, and from that time he lived with his mother and three older siblings in Carlisle, Cumbria, in the north of England, where he attended Trinity School. Johnston tried out for Carlisle Cathedral Choir at the age of six at the recommendation of Kim Harris, a teacher at his primary school. He was auditioned by the choirmaster Jeremy Suter and accepted into the choir at the age of seven. Johnston's mother, who had no previous association with the cathedral, described her feelings of being overwhelmed by emotion at having her boy singing in such a \\"stunning building among those extraordinary voices\\". His mother also described Johnston's busy regimen of practice four times a week and all day Sundays, saying that it took up all of their spare time. However, she said that the cathedral staff became like a family to her son, and that \\"it was such a lovely, safe, close feeling for him\\". Johnston, who attended Trinity School, was subject to abuse and threats from bullies which drove him to contemplate quitting the choir, but he was helped through the ordeal by his choirmaster and the dean and canons of the cathedral.

But it took until the 70th minute for their pressure to bring a second, a close-range Georgios Samaras header. While Cliftonville's hard work avoided the feared rout, it is Celtic who will host Swedes Elfsborg next Wednesday. Elfsborg, who have on-loan Celtic striker Mo Bangura and former Portsmouth forward James Keene in their squad, had earlier completed their own demolition of Daugava. Already 7-1 up from the home leg, they showed they will be a tough hurdle to overcome for Neil Lennon's side, hopeful of matching the £23.5m earned from last season's march to the last 16, winning 4-0 in Latvia. Despite striker Gary Hooper's recovery from a groin strain, Northern Irishman Lennon named an unchanged side from the one that won in his homeland. Last season's top scorer was on the bench even though he has been the subject of a transfer bids from Norwich City and, most recently, QPR. Cliftonville manager Tommy Breslin had voiced his determination not to leave Scotland with a humiliating scoreline and not surprisingly named a more defensive formation, with former Werder Bremen striker Liam Boyce on his own up front. The expected onslaught began with a Samaras shot being beaten away by goalkeeper Conor Devlin. It was clever play by Sweden full-back Mikael Lustig that finally prised open the visiting defence, setting up Anthony Stokes to deliver a cross that was dispatched past Devlin by Nigeria defender Ambrose. Part-timers Cliftonville battled away gallantly and threatened momentarily when Marc Smyth had a close-range effort blocked after a rare corner for the Northern Irish champions, while Ciaran Caldwell fired wide. Media playback is not supported on this device That was a brief respite as Kris Commons and James Forrest threatened a second goal from range, with the latter's effort clipping the top of the crossbar. Celtic's intensity dipped after the break, but Stokes forced a fine fingertip save from Devlin with a clever drive the Irishman steered towards the far corner. Stokes was not so smart when presented with an easier chance after being set up by Scott Brown, the striker curling his shot wide of Devlin and the post. Just as Cliftonville appeared to be tiring, a desperate clearance from Kelvin Wilson prevented a cross presenting Boyce the chance of a surprise tap-in equaliser. Minutes after Hooper came off the bench, Celtic extended their lead when a fine Commons cross found the head of Samaras eight yards from goal. Hooper fired an effort against the base of the post and summer signing Amido Balde headed just wide on his debut from the bench, but Cliftonville managed to restrict Celtic to a two-goal victory.

You might not mean to but you do. One out of three people collects tangible things such as cats, photos and noisy toys. There are among some 40 collections that are being shown at \\"The Museum Of\\"--the first of several new museums which, over the next two years, will exhibit the objects accumulated by unknown collectors. In doing so, they will promote a popular culture of museums, not what museums normally represent. Some of the collections are fairly common--records, model houses. Others are strangely beautiful--branches that have fallen from tree, for example. But they all reveal a lot of things: ask someone what they collect and their answers will tell you who they are. Other on the way include \\"The museum of Collectors\\" and \\"The Museum of Me.\\"These new ones, it is hoped, will build on the success of \\"The Museum Of.\\" The thinkers behind the project want to explore why people collect, and what it means to do so. They hope that visitors who may not have considered themselves collectors will begin to see they, too, collect. Some collectors say they started or stopped making collections at important point: the beginning or end of adolescence--\\"it's a growing-up thing; you stop when you grow up,\\"says one. Other painful times are mentioned, such as the end of a relationship. For time and life can seem so uncontrollable that a steady serial arrangement is comforting. How will the new museums promote a popular culture of museums? A) By collecting more tangible things. B) By showing what ordinary people have collected. C) By correcting what museums normally represent. D) By accumulating 40 collections two years from now. A:","response":"The new museums will promote a popular culture of museums by B) showing what ordinary people have collected. This approach differs from the traditional representation of museums, which often showcase art, artifacts, and items of historical or cultural significance. By focusing on the collections of everyday individuals, these museums aim to make visitors feel more connected and engaged with the concept of collecting itself, as they can relate to the personal stories and motivations behind each collection. The Museum Of, The Museum of Collectors, and The Museum of Me all plan to exhibit the objects accumulated by unknown collectors, revealing insights into their personalities, interests, and life experiences. Through this approach, the museums aim to explore why people collect and what it means to do so. By showcasing collections of common and less conventional items, such as records, model houses, branches from trees, and others, the museums will offer a broader perspective on the diverse and even quirky world of collecting. The thinkers behind these museum projects hope that visitors who may not have considered themselves collectors will start to see that they, too, indeed collect something in their lives. By highlighting the personal significance of collecting during different stages of life, such as adolescence or after the end of a relationship, the museums will provide a more inclusive and relatable perspective on collecting as an activity that a significant portion of the population engages in, intentionally or not. In conclusion, these new museums will promote a popular culture of museums by focusing on showcasing the tangible collections of ordinary people, emphasizing the personal stories behind them, and demonstrating how collecting is a universal aspect of human experience. This approach will not only broaden the appeal of museum culture but also encourage more people to engage with museums and better understand the value and meaning behind the act of collecting."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Process: - Cells obtain glucose and oxygen - The glucose and oxygen create carbon dioxide - The cells release energy - The cells don't have enough oxygen to repeat this - The cells obtain more oxygen from the air - The cells repeat this process. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose not enough carbon dioxide is produced happens, how will it affect LESS oxygen reaching the body. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","response":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests that not enough carbon dioxide is produced in the process. This could have an indirect effect on the process. If not enough carbon dioxide is produced, it may indicate that there is less glucose and oxygen being utilized in cellular respiration. This could potentially lead to an imbalance in the exchange of gases in the body. Since carbon dioxide is one of the primary triggers for the body to take in more oxygen (through increasing the breathing rate), a lower carbon dioxide production might result in the body not feeling the need to breathe as deeply, or as often as it should. This could lead to less oxygen being taken in and transported to the cells for cellular respiration. Overall, the proposed perturbation has an indirect effect on the process, as lower carbon dioxide production could impact the body's ability to obtain oxygen through breathing. This, in turn, might result in less oxygen being available for cells to carry out cellular respiration and release energy, which could disrupt the entire process."},{"question":"Gemmula ambara is a species of sea snail a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Turridae the turrids.

The founder and owner of a large cosmetics company, Janice Starlin (Susan Cabot), is disturbed when her firm's sales begin to drop after it becomes apparent to her customer base that she is aging. Zinthrop has been able to extract enzymes from the royal jelly of the queen wasp that can reverse the aging process. Janice agrees to fund further research, at great cost, provided she can serve as his human subject. Displeased with the slowness of the results, she breaks into the scientist's laboratory after hours and injects herself with extra doses of the formula. Zinthrop becomes aware that some of the test creatures are becoming violent and goes to warn Janice, but before he can reach anyone, he gets into a car accident. He is thus temporarily missing and Janice goes through great trouble to find him, eventually taking over his care. Janice continues her clandestine use of the serum and sheds 20 years in a single weekend, but soon discovers that she is periodically transformed into a murderous, wasp-like creature.

Question: suppose more coal is removed happens, how will it affect MORE damage by acid rain. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","response":"If more coal is removed and subsequently burned, it will lead to an increase in the release of chemicals like sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) into the atmosphere. This is because coal combustion is a significant source of these pollutants. As a result, this perturbation will likely have a significant effect on the damage caused by acid rain. To understand how these additional pollutants will exacerbate the effects of acid rain, let's first discuss the process in further detail: 1. The increased combustion of coal releases higher amounts of SO2 and NOx into the air. These chemicals are primarily produced during the burning of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas. 2. As these substances rise into the high atmosphere, they are transported over long distances by prevailing winds, permitting their widespread dispersal. 3. Eventually, SO2 and NOx react with water vapor and other chemicals present in the atmosphere, such as oxygen and other oxidants, undergoing a series of chemical reactions. 4. These reactions result in the formation of sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and nitric acid (HNO3), which then get incorporated into cloud droplets, fog, or other forms of atmospheric moisture. 5. When precipitation occurs, the acidic compounds mix with rainwater, creating a more acidic rain that falls to the ground. This is referred to as acid rain. Now, let's examine the effects of a higher concentration of acidic rain caused by increased coal combustion: - More damage to ecosystems: Acid rain can alter the acidity levels of soil and water bodies, which in turn adversely affects both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. A higher concentration of acid rain would likely accelerate these harmful effects, harming plant species, acidifying water bodies, and potentially leading to the loss of biodiversity. - Increased damage to human-made structures: Acid rain can cause accelerated corrosion, decay, and erosion of buildings, historical monuments, and infrastructure, such as bridges and roadways. As acid rain becomes more acidic due to increased coal combustion, the rate of damage to these structures is expected to increase. - Negative impacts on human health: Acidic pollutants can cause respiratory issues and other health problems in humans. With higher emissions resulting from increased coal burning, these health risks would become even more pronounced. - Agricultural impact: Acid rain can have detrimental effects on agriculture, as it can lead to soil acidification, reduced soil fertility, and damage to crops. With an increased occurrence and intensity of acid rain, these adverse effects are more likely to be exacerbated. In conclusion, removing and burning more coal will result in the release of more sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere, leading to a greater concentration of acid rain. This perturbation will amplify the existing adverse effects of acid rain on ecosystems, human-made structures, human health, and agriculture."},{"question":"About-face for Heels Rashad McCants wasn #39;t thinking about last year at Kentucky.

Close your mouth and start inhaling through your nose. Breathe deeply Exhale through your nose or mouth. Article:","response":"Title: The Art of Deep Breathing: A Guide to Reaping Its Benefits Introduction: Amidst the hustle and bustle of daily life, many individuals frequently face situations that leave them stressed, anxious, or overwhelmed. While there's no magic pill to ward off these negative emotions, one simple practice has the potential to alleviate some of the adverse effects: deep breathing. By incorporating this technique into your daily routine, it becomes increasingly easier to find balance and maintain mindfulness. In this article, we explore the practice of deep breathing and outline a step-by-step approach to help you master the art of inhalation and exhalation. Step 1: Find Your Comfort Zone The key to effective deep breathing is to be as comfortable as possible. This means selecting a position, either seated or lying down, that allows you to relax and feel at ease. If you're sitting, opt for a chair with ample support for your back and neck. Should you choose to lie down, pick a yoga mat or a soft carpeted area. Step 2: Close Your Mouth Once comfortable, close your mouth to prepare for inhalation through your nose. Keeping your mouth closed during this process helps filter the air entering your lungs and warms it up before it reaches your respiratory system. Moreover, it promotes steady and even breaths which are essential for deep breathing. Step 3: Inhale Through Your Nose Begin by inhaling slowly and deeply through your nostrils. It's important to breathe in a controlled manner for several reasons: first, it allows your body to absorb enough oxygen to fuel your muscles and brain; second, slow inhalation aids in maintaining proper blood gas balance, which is vital for optimal bodily function; lastly, measured breathing promotes relaxation and reduces stress or anxiety. Step 4: Breathe Deeply As you inhale, let your breath fill your diaphragm and expand your rib cage. Breathing deeply ensures that your body can maximize the benefits of oxygen intake. Additionally, it can improve circulation and reduce muscle tension, thereby enhancing overall relaxation. Step 5: Exhale Through Your Nose or Mouth Exhaling is just as important as inhalation in the process of deep breathing. You may choose to exhale through your nose or mouth, depending on your personal preference. The primary goal during exhalation is to release the air slowly and steadily. This step helps rid your body of carbon dioxide, a waste product generated through respiration. Proper exhalation also plays a significant role in stress relief and promotes a sense of tranquility. Conclusion: By following these simple steps and incorporating deep breathing into your daily routine, you're well-equipped to cope with stress and other negative emotions. Beyond the scope of relaxation, the practice of deep breathing fosters greater mental clarity, physical wellbeing, and an improved connection to our environment. So go ahead, take a deep breath, and experience the transformative power of this ancient yet effective relaxation technique."},{"question":"Teacher:In this task you will be given a list of numbers.

He thought about it so often that eventually it didn’t even feel weird any more. Then, one day, he pulled his car over to the side of a bridge. He was ready to jump. Instead, Gethard called his ex-girlfriend, who told him he had to get help immediately, and that if he didn’t by morning, she would call his mother. Gethard had told his parents he was getting help at Rutgers, but once he got home, he told his mom that this was a lie, and that he was extremely depressed all the time. That was 11 years ago. Gethard is now 34, a professional comedian at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater and on television shows like Broad City. He’s one of the relatively lucky ones. That night on the bridge – and later, when he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder – his parents had health insurance that covered him. Now, he is able to pay out of pocket for a therapist of his choosing, though he’s healthy enough that he barely feels the need for their bi-weekly meetings. And in the process of his own recovery, because of the many obstacles to obtaining the most basic level of psychiatric care in the US, he’s become a remote caregiver for other people struggling with their own mental illness. Last year, an anonymous stranger posted on the Tumblr page for a cable access show that Gethard hosts, and said they were suicidal. Gethard responded immediately with more than 6,700 words in which he detailed some of his own darkest moments. In the first six months after the post went online, he could barely keep up with the deluge of emails he received. Now, every few days, he gets a message from other strangers who credit him with helping them. It’s “shocking and heartbreaking”, Gethard says, to see so many people reaching out to him just because of his response to one anonymous person. \\"It just shows how behind-closed-doors so much of this stuff is, and how people are more comfortable reaching out anonymously to a largely unsuccessful comedian, rather than talking to their own parents or friends or doctors,” Gethard told the Guardian. “It was really kind of sad when I realized that.” Gethard’s post is still one of the top results if you search the internet for his name – or for a morbid cocktail of words including “suicide” and “Tumblr”. \\"There are so many places you are supposed to be able to go talk to someone about this stuff, if you're feeling it, but I got so many messages from people who said it was the first time they talked about it with anybody – and it was me.\\" The people who follow the advice Gethard gives them – which is always: talk to someone – are often faced with a number of obstacles in the way of actually getting the most basic type of mental health care: seeing a therapist. While the Affordable Care Act made some small steps towards removing the roadblocks to psychiatric care – and the Obama administration has, more recently, issued new regulations that have also had an impact – it did not fix a chaotic financing system that discourages therapists from accepting insurance and makes it hard for many people to get treatment they need. If the people who reach out to Gethard end up seeking care – and are lucky enough to have insurance – there are still basic hurdles that can discourage an already vulnerable person. “The inefficiency of the American health care system puts a special burden on mentally ill people, because they are less able to cope with the complexity and find the care they need,” says Dr David Spiegel, a professor and associate chair of psychiatry and behavior sciences at Stanford University’s school of medicine. Even the essential first step of looking for a therapist is not as simple as picking and choosing from dozens of insurance company-trusted doctors. Private insurers are known for providing listings of in-network therapists that include mental health clinicians who are, for any number of other reasons, not available to provide treatment in the location at which they’re listed: some have moved, others retired; in rare cases, they’re still on the list even after they’ve died. These so-called “phantom networks” of mental health professionals mean that finding an in-network therapist can involve a process of rejection and confusion that may last for days or even weeks. “If a lot of the psychologists and other mental health professionals leave the network, patients can’t find the care,” says Alan Nessman, senior special counsel at the American Psychological Association. “It saves the company in not only paying lower rates, if people can’t access care, that really saves the company money and is terrible for the mental health consumers.” Psychiatrists are, increasingly, leaving the insurance networks – all of them – and deciding to accept cash only. A December 2013 study showed that 55.3% of psychiatrists take insurance, compared to 88.7% of other doctors. A key part of this trend is the influence insurance companies wield over mental health care, an influence that leads therapists to consider not accepting insurance so they can operate in an environment that offers more money for less hassle. Insurance companies have ultimate power over a clinician’s recommended care plan and perform utilization reviews to determine if the plan is of “medical necessity” to the patient – who, of course, they have never met. “Nowadays, a number of companies recognize that most mental health care takes place within certain parameters, so they may let it go for 10, 20 sessions, then the management kicks in: ‘You know, this person has been seeing you for a while, and we think they need less care now,’” says Nessman. Mental health professionals aren’t just overwhelmed by insurance company intervention; they are, compared to their peers in other medical fields, paid less, too. Where primary care doctors spend an average of 18.53 minutes with a patient, a talk therapy session usually runs 45 minutes to an hour, cutting down the number of patients a therapist has time to see and the amount of money they can make. Also, reimbursement rates tend to be low for mental health services, giving clinicians little incentive to accept insurance over cash payments that are much more expensive for a patient. Therapists who choose to accept insurance must personally file more paperwork and make more verification calls to insurance companies than doctors in other specialities, because therapists operating private practices often work independently and don’t employ office workers. So clerical duties, which are not billed, can take up hours of a clinician’s day. “There’s a lot of people who don’t take insurance because they don’t want the hassle factor,” says Dr Steven S Sharfstein, a former president of the American Psychiatric Association and president of the Sheppard Pratt Health System in Baltimore. With more therapists not accepting insurance, there are fewer options for people who can’t afford to pay out of pocket. There are a lot of people like that. There are also a lot of people who don’t have insurance and can’t afford to pay out of pocket – that’s why the majority of mental health services are publicly funded. But having the money to get help does not guarantee you will be able to find someone to provide it. The Affordable Care Act will give more people access to mental health treatment, but there still won’t be enough clinicians to treat them. More than 77% of US counties have a severe shortage of mental health professionals, according to a 2006 UNC study. Alan Ellis, a researcher on the study, says that demographic shifts in the surveyed counties and the impact of the recession on the workforce could have affected the numbers since the research was conducted. \\"Those factors notwithstanding, we suspect that the overall picture today is similar to what it was in 2006,\\" Ellis says. Stanford University’s Spiegel says if the therapist shortage continues, “there will be more people under-diagnosed and untreated for serious psychiatric disorders that are treatable.” The effect of the shortage of therapists, and of the comparatively low number of therapists who accept insurance, is especially bad simply because of the nature of mental health treatment. Every doctor-patient relationship requires some degree of trust, but people with mental illness can often have some difficulty trusting people, and treatment can require them to open up to a stranger about the most intimate details of their lives. That means finding a therapist with whom they feel comfortable, a difficult task when there are so few to begin with. “You’re talking to the person about yourself, the things that are important to you, the things that make you vulnerable, that you may feel concerned about, that you may feel ashamed about, that you don’t know how to handle – all sorts of things where you might have bad feelings about the things you are talking to the person about,” says Dr Lynn Bufka, a clinical psychologist and APA’s assistant executive director for practice, research and policy. “You need to trust that they are going to keep those ideas supported and safe.” Gethard’s relationship with his first, in-network therapist was more clinical than he wanted, but it was his only option at the time. Gethard was taking medication he called “life changing” and, with therapy, was feeling the best he had in a while, so he accepted a three-month television job in LA. When the job was extended, another success, his therapist told him that he couldn’t prescribe the medication in California and that if Gethard wasn’t coming to see him, he couldn’t help him. Gethard returned to the north-east, told the therapist he didn’t trust him, and asked to be weaned off the medication. Three years later, he had a three-day panic attack. A friend’s father, who worked at a mental health hospital, helped him find a doctor on day three. This time, it was someone he trusted. For the past seven years, he has paid out of pocket for an out-of-network therapist he likes. It costs him about 350 a month and he is grateful that he is lucky enough to be able to afford that. He pays for medication with a prescription insurance plan. \\"I look back on that and think that's really a shame – to hit a breaking point where I knew I needed help and then to finally seek it out only to find it out, in northern New Jersey … There's probably endless numbers of doctors, but because of the healthcare system, I only have a few limited choices and they were with people who made me feel uncomfortable.” That might explain why thousands of people – many of whom admit they’d not heard of him before – turn to Gethard when they’re looking for someone to talk to. To each person who sends him a message, and each fan who approaches him after a show, Gethard says that if they can talk to him, they can talk to a family member, friend or therapist. \\"It's probably the thing I'm most proud of, that I've become someone people turn to for help and that I've taken time to offer it, but it also makes me really sad that I'm someone people turn to,” Gethard says. “Because I'm a very, very low-level comedian that 99.9% of the population has never heard of and when I first put stuff out there it was out of necessity.\\" What is a short summary of the above article?","response":"This story talks about a comedian named Chris Gethard who struggled with mental health issues when he was younger. Now that he is doing better, he wants to help others who are going through a hard time with their emotions. Many people have reached out to Chris to talk about their mental health because they don't know who else to talk to. Sometimes it can be hard to find a therapist or someone to talk to about our mental health because not all of them accept insurance and there are not enough therapists to help everyone who needs it. The health care system in America can be difficult for people with mental health problems to navigate, making it harder for them to get the help they need. But it is important to try and talk to someone you trust about how you're feeling, whether it's a family member, friend, or even a stranger like Chris."},{"question":"The modern Republic of Turkey dates only from 1923, but the history of the land within its borders stretches back to the dawn of humanity. Widespread finds of Stone Age implements in cave excavations show that Anatolia was already inhabited during the Middle of the Palaeolithic period (about 200,000 to 40,000 years ago). By Neolithic times, organized communities had arisen, such as the one at Çatalhöyük, near Konya, Turkey's most important prehistoric site. This town, which flourished between 6500 and 5500 b.c. , had flat-roofed houses of mud and timber decorated with wall-paintings, some of which show patterns that still appear on Anatolian kilims. The advent of the Bronze Age (about 3200 b.c. ), and the spread of city-states ruled by kings, is marked by the appearance of royal tombs containing bronze objects in such places as Troy in the west, and Alacahöyük near Ankara. Around this time the Sumerian civilization living in Mesopotamia (the region between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in present-day Iraq) founded and developed the cuneiform script, the world's oldest form of writing on record. The technique was introduced by Assyrian traders 1,000 years later in­to Anatolia, where it was qui­ck­ly adopted by the indigenous Hatti people, who, at this point, had already reached an ad­­vanced state of civilization. The Hittites: The capital of the Hatti was Kanesh (modern Kültepe, near Kayseri). Cuneiform tablets found here record the arrival in Anatolia of warlike invaders around the second mill­ennium b.c. Their origins remain a my­s­tery (their written language was finally deciphered in 1915), but they came from the direction of the Caucasus moun­tains, spreading destruction and disorder throughout Anatolia. It was two hundred years before they were firmly entrenched in their newly conquered empire. The newcomers were the Hittites, and their domination of Anatolia can be divided into three distinct periods: the Old Kingdom (c. 1600–1450 b.c. ), then the New or Empire Period (c. 1450–1200 b.c. ), and the Late Hittite Period (c.

After studies at the Academy of Fine Arts Karlsruhe in Karlsruhe he went to Munich in 1908 , where he met a number of modernists such as Alexei Jawlensky , Wassily Kandinsky and Gabriele Münter . He became a member of the Munich New Secession in 1913 , with Jawlensky and Paul Klee . After military service in World War I from 1914 to 1918 , the still lifes Kanoldt painted show the influence of Derain and an adaptation of cubist ideas .

This allows the alloying elements to dissolve into the base metal and form a solution. Heating at this temperature also softens the material, making it more workable. 2. Quenching: After the solution treatment, the alloy is rapidly cooled, or quenched, usually by immersing it in water or another liquid. This step creates a supersaturated solid solution by trapping the alloying elements within the base metal. At this stage, the alloy is soft but has the potential to be much stronger after aging. 3. Artificial aging: To harden the alloy immediately, an artificial aging process is carried out. This involves heating the sample to a lower temperature, typically in the range of 100-200°C (212-392°F) for aluminum-based alloys. This process accelerates the precipitation of the alloying elements from the supersaturated solid solution, forming fine precipitates that strengthen the material. 4. Cooling: After the artificial aging process, the alloy is cooled down to room temperature. This final step stabilizes the precipitates within the material and locks in the increased hardness and strength. In summary, to make precipitation hardening alloys harden immediately, the material undergoes solution treatment, quenching, artificial aging, and cooling steps. This combination of processes enables the rapid development of fine precipitates within the material, resulting in immediate hardening."},{"question":"Possible review types: Pick from: A). negative; B). positive;.

Munroe and I am the newly appointed President of Essex County College. In my brief time here, I have been greatly impressed with both the school’s expressed and demonstrated commitment to being an open-access institution committed to providing high quality educational programs and life-long learning activities to a diverse population of students. Proof of this commitment is the fact that we serve students who hail from 59 countries. As many of you may know, Essex County College opened its doors in 1968 in the wake of tremendous upheaval caused, in part, by the lack of opportunities in education, training, and jobs. From that upheaval, Essex County College has provided opportunity and hope to countless dreamers and has birthed many change agents in our society, including educators, community activists, politicians, judges, and Olympians. Our diversity has enriched and enhanced our learning community as it pushes us to collectively and continually wrestle through the very real challenges associated with hearing, honoring and respecting an array of needs, customs, beliefs, orientations, backgrounds and norms. Recently, much attention has been given to the impact of an exchange on a television show between an Essex County College adjunct and the host. The College was immediately inundated with feedback from students, faculty and prospective students and their families expressing frustration, concern and even fear that the views expressed by a College employee (with influence over students) would negatively impact their experience on the campus. I want to address how the College is responding. As the new president, I think it is important for me to make clear and reaffirm the College’s commitment, as a public institution, to maintaining a welcoming environment to all students, from a variety of races, lifestyles, abilities, socio-economic backgrounds, faiths and cultures. I fully believe that institutions of higher learning must provide a safe space for students to explore, discuss and debate, not only academic philosophies, but the harder issues related to living harmoniously and growing together in our communities and as a country. As the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King wrote, “The function of education is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. Intelligence plus character – that is the goal of true education.” The character of this institution mandates that we embrace diversity, inclusion, and unity. Racism cannot be fought with more racism. To continue to effectively fulfill our mission and to continue our legacy of providing opportunity and success, there are principles, which we eagerly embrace. First, Essex County College deeply values free speech and academic freedom. The open exchange of ideas and perspectives gives strength to our institution and provides depth to the education provided to our students. The College also supports and affirms the right of free speech and independent views and expressions of those views for our faculty and staff. We expect and encourage faculty involvement in our community. My administration has a duty to set a strong example of tolerance. Accordingly, free speech and academic freedom must always work in the service of our student body. Another principle we embrace is that of being an open-access institution. Our commitment and responsibility to the health and well-being of our students is paramount. Essex County College actively seeks to create an environment, which is welcoming to people of all backgrounds and abilities. Consistent with this principle, we firmly reject and denounce any conduct that implies that all students are not welcome to participate in, or benefit from, our programs or activities on the basis of their race, color, orientation or national origin. When the administration receives an outpouring of concern regarding our student body, it is our responsibility to investigate those concerns. While the adjunct who expressed her personal views in a very public setting was in no way claiming to represent the views and beliefs of the College, and does not represent the College, her employment with us and potential impact on students required our immediate review into what seemed to have become a very contentious and divisive issue. For the purpose of a fair and immediate review, the adjunct was suspended with full pay, for the remainder of the summer I session which equated to six (6) working days, pending the outcome of a fair and thorough review of the matter. The adjunct addressed the College community at an open forum on June 20th. In consideration of the College’s mission, and the impact that this matter has had on the College’s fulfillment of its mission, we cannot maintain an employment relationship with the adjunct. The College affirms its right to select employees who represent the institution appropriately and are aligned with our mission. As I experience a time of transition and change along with the College and as we anticipate celebrating our 50th anniversary, I believe that it is an important time to emphasize who we are at Essex County College. It is also critical for our community to come together in a new way. To that end, I am excited to announce that the College will be forming and launching “Mosaics – Unity in Diversity”. Mosaics will be a committee charged with finding important and new ways to demonstrate how all of our respective and diverse backgrounds are necessary for the beauty of our community to be complete and appreciated. The committee will be comprised of individuals stepping up from the student body, faculty, alumni, and broader community to celebrate and educate our diversity as we commemorate the 50th Anniversary in 2018. I am also excited to announce that this upcoming fall, we will continue to enhance the educational opportunities at our Newark and West Caldwell campuses by opening a Veterans Center, a state of the art Information Commons, and expanding programs in Cybersecurity, Paralegal studies, and Business Administration. Our commitment to continued growth and our broad diversity will pose challenges as this kind of diversity on all our campuses is not easy. However, I believe that it is necessary. It is necessary because it enables our students to not only thrive academically, but to be prepared to engage in diverse work places and in our very inter-connected world. We are committed to fostering a dynamic learning community where all of our students flourish through learning how to adapt and inter-relate cross-culturally. We invite you to celebrate with Essex County College as we unite, grow and commit to inclusion and openness, and exceeding expectations! ||||| Earlier this month, political commentator Lisa Durden gave a fiery interview with Tucker Carlson on Fox News, defending a Black Lives Matter chapter’s decision to host a Memorial Day event exclusively for black people. “Boo-hoo-hoo,” Lisa Durden, who is also an adjunct professor at Essex County College in Newark, said in the June 6 television appearance. “You white people are angry because you couldn’t use your ‘white privilege’ card to get invited to the Black Lives Matter’s all-black Memorial Day celebration.” In the heated exchange, Carlson responded by calling her “hostile and separatist and crazy.” “You’re demented actually,” he said. “You’re sick and what you’re saying is disgusting and if you were a Nazi I would say the same thing to you.” Durden’s remarks spurred both criticism and praise on social media. But what happened less than 48 hours later prompted an even stronger reaction. On June 8, with about a week left of her summer session of teaching, Durden’s employers at Essex County College suspended her. About two weeks later, Durden was fired from the community college. The college’s president announced the decision in a lengthy statement Friday, days after Durden met with school officials in a community forum. Anthony E. Munroe, Essex County College president, said the administration was “immediately inundated with feedback from students, faculty and prospective students and their families expressing frustration, concern and even fear that the views expressed by a College employee (with influence over students) would negatively impact their experience on the campus.” “In consideration of the College’s mission, and the impact that this matter has had on the College’s fulfillment of its mission, we cannot maintain an employment relationship with the adjunct,” Munroe said in the statement. But Durden said the firing was unjust and baseless. She claimed “there was no due process, there were no facts.” “I was publicly lynched,” Durden said in an interview with The Washington Post. “They didn’t let me finish the class and they disrupted the learning process.” Durden — who began her first semester of teaching at the school in January — was wrapping up the first summer session of classes and was already scheduled for the fall semester. As an adjunct professor, she teaches classes on subjects such as mass communication and popular culture. She said she was given no reason for the suspension, though a human resources representative explained to her verbally that it was in part because she identified her relationship to the college in the interview, Durden said. This was not the case — the show simply identified her as a political commentator. “I had a right to free speech, and I exercised that right,” Durden said. Durden, whose media commentary focuses on issues such as pop culture, race and politics, said she was invited onto “Tucker Carlson Tonight” to discuss the Black Lives Matter event. She did not choose the subject of the conversation, she said. “This particular day was a hard topic,” Durden said. “It was a debate. It was not meant to be something that was an easy conversation.” Any time commentators discuss a controversial topic on television, there will be people who agree and disagree, Durden said. There were many people on social media commending her statements, and yet the university chose to take actions as a result of the negative responses, Durden said. Essex County College is federally designated as a Predominantly Black Institution and a Hispanic Serving Institution. It has a large black student population and its new president, Munroe, is black. “I am that population,” Durden said. “I live in Newark. I was born and raised in Newark.” “I decided to come back to Newark because this is my community,” she added. Lisa Durden is a media commentator from Newark. (Courtesy Lisa Durden). In his statement, Munroe said the college “supports and affirms the right of free speech and independent views and expressions of those views for our faculty and staff.” But he added that it denounces “any conduct that implies that all students are not welcome to participate in, or benefit from, our programs or activities on the basis of their race, color, orientation or national origin.” Durden told The Post that in retrospect, she wishes she would have made clear in her interview on Fox News that when she mentioned “white people” she referred only to the white people who were upset about the Black Lives Matter event. “I will apologize if a person assumed I meant all white people,” Durden said. “I never meant all white people.” “All white people aren’t racist,” she said. Her remarks — in which she compared the Black Lives Matter event to a wedding that excludes children — drew intense backlash on social media. Many commended the college’s decision over the weekend, calling her a “disgusting racist,” “angry racist” and “racist pig.” One conservative writer called her a “Black Supremacist.” Many of these accusations and portrayals feed into existing stereotypes about black women, Durden said. “When you’re an African American woman,” she said, “when you are your personality, you are called an angry black woman.” “Reverse racism,” she added, “doesn’t exist.” The phrase Black Lives Matter first received national attention in summer 2014 and, since then, has become part of conversations on race in America. Here's how the phrase became a movement.

(Associated Press) Serbian police arrested seven men accused of taking part in the slaughter of more than 1,000 Muslims at a warehouse on the outskirts of Srebrenica, a joint team of Serbian and Bosnian prosecutors told the AP. Altogether, more than 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were killed in the eastern Bosnian enclave by the Serbs in 1995 — the only atrocity in Europe to be labeled genocide by the United Nations since World War II. Chief Serbian War Crimes Prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic told the AP that authorities had sought to arrest eight suspects in pre-dawn raids at different locations in Serbia on Wednesday, but that one is on the run. \\"More people have been in our focus, but we have managed to detain seven out of eight suspects so far,\\" Vukcevic said. \\"They are former members of a special brigade of the Bosnian Serb police.\\" Serbia in the past has put on trial men who took a group of prisoners away from Srebrenica to be killed. And in 2011 it arrested Ratko Mladic — the warlord who masterminded the slaughter — and sent him to an international criminal court in The Hague, Netherlands. But Wednesday's arrests are Serbia's first attempt to bring to justice men who got their hands bloody in the killing machine known as the Srebrenica massacre 20 years ago this July. \\"It is important to stress that this is the first time that our prosecutor's office is dealing with the mass killings of civilians and war prisoners in Srebrenica,\\" Bruno Vekaric, the lead Serb prosecutor in the case, told the AP. He said Serbia is approaching a key moment in confronting its past. \\"We have never dealt with a crime of such proportions,\\" said Vekaric, Serbia's deputy War Crimes Prosecutor. \\"It is very important for Serbia to take a clear position toward Srebrenica through a court process.\\" The biggest arrest in the sweep was Nedeljko Milidragovic, the commander dubbed \\"Nedjo the Butcher,\\" who went on to become a successful businessman in Serbia, the AP has learned. The collaboration by prosecutors from former wartime enemies Serbia and Bosnia — supported by the U.N. war crimes tribunal — is the most important case of judicial teamwork helping to heal the festering wounds of the war. The arrests follow a December sweep by the same team of prosecutors of 15 suspects in a separate wartime atrocity: a massacre that followed an abduction from a Bosnian train. Many Serbs still view as heroes their wartime leaders — including Mladic and Bosnian Serb President Radovan Karadzic, who are on trial at the U.N. war crimes tribunal — and believe they were victims of an elaborate Western plot. That makes the current campaign to detain the triggermen deeply sensitive. Serbia's conservative government is allowing the prosecutions to move forward in part because it's eager to join the European Union. That July 1995, Bosnian Serb forces opened the Srebrenica offensive with heavy shelling, ignoring Dutch U.N. peacekeeping troops who were stationed in the town. The Serbs — led by Mladic — marched into the town without meeting any resistance. Women sought shelter at the Dutch base, while men and boys fled into the surrounding woods — to be hunted down by Mladic's forces. The men and boys captured by Milidragovic's men were rounded up and crammed tight into the warehouse with no food or water. There wasn't even enough room for everyone to sit down as they waited in fear. The killings started in the late afternoon. The killers hurled bombs through the windows and fired round after round of automatic gunfire. In the morning, witnesses say, Milidragovic ordered the survivors — up to 100 of them — to come out, promising they would be spared. They were not. Even his troops said they were terrified of the commander. \\"I was afraid to look him in the eyes,\\" one of them said in a deposition. When the Bosnian war ended in a peace deal in 1995, Milidragovic moved to the Serbian capital, Belgrade. He had two children and built a trucking business that transports construction material — prosecutors say his startup capital came from tens of thousands of dollars taken from his victims' pockets. He is now 58. Muriz Sinanovic was among those killed in the warehouse. His wife, Suhra, will never forget his last words before he headed into the forest with thousands of men fleeing Srebrenica. \\"Take good care of my children,\\" Muriz told her as he hugged and kissed Munir, 7, and Emina, 4. In Muriz' trousers, discovered with his remains, investigators found his driver's license and a tobacco box a relative had made for him from cans of U.N. aid. Suhra kept the box, a pinch of tobacco and the cigarette paper inside — enough for a cigarette he never got to smoke. The box still sits on a shelf in her living room in Sarajevo. When the children were small, they would not let visiting friends touch the tobacco box. \\"They said it is a sacred object,\\" Suhra said. Muriz' remains — about half of his body — were found years later in a mass grave. Forensics experts brought the remains to Suhra in a paper bag. They took out a few bones and showed them to her. \\"I did not cry,\\" she said. \\"But I almost broke my fingers, twisting them.\\" ___ Gec and Stojanovic contributed from Belgrade, Serbia.

The seven are among the first to be arrested by Serbia for carrying out the Srebrenica massacre in July 1995, Serbian and Bosnian prosecutors say. Serbia has previously detained men not directly involved in the killings. In 2011, it handed over former Bosnian Serb commander Ratko Mladic to an international court. Mr Mladic, accused of masterminding the massacre, is currently being tried in The Hague. Image caption The massacre at Srebrenica is the only atrocity in Europe to be labelled as genocide by the United Nations since World War Two Image caption Mass burials were held in Bosnia and Herzegovina of victims identified after the massacre The international tribunal at The Hague has already convicted numerous people of genocide in relation to the Srebrenica massacre. But the BBC's Guy Delauney in Belgrade says that Wednesday's arrests mean that for the first time such a case will be heard in Serbia. Our correspondent says that the arrests are the biggest breakthrough since war crimes courts in Serbia and Bosnia began co-operating more than three years ago. About 8,000 Bosnian men and boys were killed in Srebrenica over three days, the worst atrocity on European soil since the Holocaust. The killings took place a few months before the end of the Bosnian war, when 20,000 refugees fled to Srebrenica to escape Serb forces. Image caption Serbian prosecutors are now preparing their cases against the seven people arrested \\"It is important to stress that this is the first time that our prosecutor's office is dealing with the mass killings of civilians and war prisoners in Srebrenica,\\" lead Serb prosecutor Bruno Vekaric told the Associated Press news agency in relation to Wednesday's arrests. Mr Vekaric said that Serbia was approaching a defining moment. \\"We have never dealt with a crime of such proportions,\\" he said. \\"It is very important for Serbia to take a clear position toward Srebrenica through a court process.\\" Among those arrested on Wednesday was Nedeljko Milidragovic, a former commander in the ethnic-Serb police known as \\"Nedjo the Butcher\\", who had since become a successful businessman in Serbia, AP reported. Mr Milidragovic is already facing genocide charges in Bosnia, but had been able to live freely in Serbia because of the lack of an extradition treaty. The agreement between the Serbian and Bosnian courts means he - and the others - are now likely face the same charges in Belgrade. Wednesday's arrests follow moves by Bosnia and Serbia in December to arrest 15 men suspected of a 1993 atrocity in which 19 people were hauled off a train and killed. Serbian police arrested five suspects, while 10 were arrested in Bosnia. Proceeding against war crimes suspects can be difficult for the Serb authorities, correspondents say. Many Serbs still regard wartime leaders such as Mr Mladic and former Bosnian Serb President Radovan Karadzic - who is also on trial in The Hague - as war heroes who are victims of Western scheming. However, Serbia's government is thought to be pushing the prosecutions process forward in part because it wants to join the European Union.

BELGRADE Serbia arrested eight men on Wednesday suspected of taking part in the 1995 Srebrenica massacre in Bosnia, the first such detentions in the ex-Yugoslav republic of accused gunmen in Europe's worst atrocity since World War Two. The men, arrested in several locations across Serbia, are accused of killing more than 1,000 Muslim Bosniaks at a warehouse just outside Srebrenica, some of more than 8,000 Muslim men and boys killed in the area after it fell to Bosnian Serb forces in July 1995. \\"This is the first such case involving people directly suspected of taking part in the Srebrenica massacre,\\" Bruno Vekaric, Serbia's deputy war crimes prosecutor, told Reuters. A United Nations court has ruled that the Srebrenica massacre, carried out over the course of several days after the fall of the U.N. 'safe haven', amounted to genocide. Bosnia's prosecutor's office welcomed the arrests, saying the operation had been coordinated between the two countries. July will mark the 20th anniversary of the massacre. Nearly 90 percent of the victims have been exhumed from mass graves and identified through DNA analysis. \\"It seems Serbia has finally woken up to the crimes in Srebrenica,\\" said Suhra Sinanovic, whose husband Muriz perished in the warehouse. His remains were found in two separate graves, evidence of how Bosnian Serb forces tried to conceal the crime. The men will most likely stand trial in Serbia, not at the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in The Hague, where more high-profile leaders were tried. The accused are former members of a Bosnian Serb interior ministry unit, including unit commander Nedeljko Milidragovic, known as 'Nedjo the Butcher', an official involved in the investigation said. \\"SUMMARILY EXECUTED\\" \\"He and others are suspected of bringing some 15 busloads of men from a prison camp in Srebrenica to Kravica, where they were summarily executed,\\" the official said. \\"They were first shot and then hand grenades were thrown.\\" Around 100,000 people, the large majority of them Muslim Bosniaks, died in Bosnia's 1992-95 war during the collapse of socialist Yugoslavia. Serbia arrested Bosnian Serb political leader Radovan Karadzic in 2008 and his military commander Ratko Mladic in 2011, helping to unblock its ongoing bid to the European Union. Both are currently standing trial in The Hague for war crimes that include responsibility for Srebrenica, but Wednesday's arrests marked the first time Serbia has gone after those who did the actual killing. In 2007, a Serbian court convicted four Serbian paramilitary soldiers who videotaped their killing of six Bosniak youths around the same time as Srebrenica in southeast Bosnia, but the court at the time said there was no evidence to directly link the two events. \\"The Scorpions case is separate from Srebrenica both in time and distance,\\" said Vekaric.

To find out how many percent of people were not Pacific Islander, we subtract the Pacific Islander population percentage from the total population percentage. This is because the total population percentage is considered 100%. So, 100% (representing total population) - 0.2% (representing Pacific Islander population) = 99.8% Therefore, 99.8% of the people were not Pacific Islander.

Trump held firm on asserting the United States is disadvantaged when it comes to trade with its European allies. “The other leaders presented their numbers and Trump presented his,” a G-7 official who spoke on condition of anonymity told the Reuters news agency. “As expected he did not budge. This is probably not because he does not understand, but because of domestic reasons.” At a bilateral meeting later with the summit's host, Justin Trudeau, the U.S. president joked that the Canadian prime minister had agreed to “cut all tariffs.” Despite the two leaders exchanging criticism of each other’s trade policies the previous day, Trump described the cross-border relationship as very good, stating “we’re actually working on cutting tariffs and making it all very fair for both countries. And we’ve made a lot of progress today. We’ll see how it all works out.” In a subsequent sit-down meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, Trump said “the United States has had a very big trade deficit for many years with the European Union and we are working it out. And Emmanuel’s been very helpful in that regard.” Macron responded that he had a “very direct and open discussion” with Trump and \\"there is a critical path that is a way to progress all together.” Canada’s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, confirms she met on Friday with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to discuss the tariffs and the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). She said Canada, however, will not change its mind about the U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs which she termed “illegal.” Trump imposed the tariffs on the grounds that weak domestic industries could affect U.S. national security. America’s closest allies, Canada, Mexico and the European Union, are introducing retaliatory tariffs. According to the above context, answer the following question. How long did the G-7 summit last?

She needs to make an overskirt and two petticoats. Each skirt uses a rectangle of material that measures 12 feet by 4 feet. She also needs to make a bodice that uses 2 square feet of material for the shirt and 5 square feet of fabric for each of the sleeves. If the material she uses costs 3 per square foot, how much does she spend on the material in total? Let's answer step by step:","response":"Step 1: Calculate the amount of material needed for overskirt and petticoats. For each skirt, the material's required area is 12 feet * 4 feet. As she needs to make an overskirt and two petticoats, the total number of skirts needed is 3. So, 12 feet * 4 feet * 3 skirts = 144 square feet. Step 2: Calculate the amount of material needed for the bodice. For bodice, 2 square feet of material is needed for the shirt and 5 square feet of material is needed for each of the two sleeves. So, 2 square feet (shirt) + 5 square feet (sleeve 1) + 5 square feet (sleeve 2) = 12 square feet. Step 3: Calculate the total material needed for the costume. Total material needed = Material for skirts + Material for bodice. 144 square feet (skirts) + 12 square feet (bodice) = 156 square feet. Step 4: Calculate the total cost of material. The material costs 3 per square foot. Total cost of material = 156 square feet * 3/square foot = 468. Jenna would spend a total of 468 on the material for her costume in Oliver Twist."},{"question":"What happens next? How to use rose water for beautiful skin Use rose water as a cleanser for your face. Since rose water hydrates and moisturizes the skin and has anti-bacterial properties, it makes a great natural cleanser for your face. It can even replace your current facial cleanser.","response":"Rose water offers a myriad of benefits for your skin due to its natural, soothing, and healing properties. By incorporating rose water into your skincare routine, you can improve your complexion and exude a radiant, healthy glow. To use rose water effectively for beautiful skin, follow these steps and tips: 1. Choosing the right rose water: Ensure that you purchase pure, natural, and alcohol-free rose water to reap its full benefits. Check the ingredients list to verify its authenticity and avoid using products containing harmful chemicals. 2. Cleanse your face with rose water: To use rose water as a cleanser, pour a small amount onto a cotton pad or a soft, clean cloth.

Let the mask sit for 15-20 minutes before rinsing it off with lukewarm water. 6. Mix rose water with your skincare products: Give your current skincare products a rejuvenating boost by adding a few drops of rose water. You can mix rose water with your moisturizer, serums, and even your makeup, such as liquid foundations or BB creams. This addition will provide extra hydration and a soothing effect on your skin. 7. Rose water for sunburns and skin irritations: If you have sunburned or irritated skin, apply a few drops of cooled rose water directly to the affected area or soak a cotton pad with rose water and place it on the area. Leave it on for a few minutes to relieve any pain or itching. Consistency is key to achieving optimal results from using rose water in your skincare routine. It is essential to continue these practices regularly to maintain and improve your skin's overall health and appearance. As with any new skincare products, be sure to do a patch test before applying rose water to your face to ensure you do not have any adverse reactions."},{"question":"Solve 1635348 - 223148 = -15350*g for g.","response":"Alright, let's solve the equation step by step!

Answer the question: Sasha increases the frequency of a wave. This wave now has more or less energy? Answer:","response":"When Sasha increases the frequency of a wave, the wave now has more energy. The frequency of a wave is directly proportional to its energy. This is a principle that holds true whether we're discussing sound waves, electromagnetic waves (like light), or other types of waves. To understand why, we must delve into the wave theory and where this notion of more frequency equals more energy comes from. Waves, simply put, are disturbances or fluctuations that transport energy from one spot to another without transferring matter. They are characterized by several parameters, including their amplitude (the height of the wave), wavelength (the distance between successive wave peaks), speed (how fast the wave propagates), and frequency (how many wave cycles pass a particular point in a given time period - often measured in Hertz, or cycles per second). The energy of a wave is directly related to its frequency, according to the Planck-Einstein relation. The Planck-Einstein relation is a fundamental principle in quantum mechanics, and it states that the energy of a photon (a particle representing a quantum of light or other electromagnetic radiation) is proportional to its frequency. In this equation, the energy (E) is equal to the frequency (f) multiplied by Planck's constant (h): E = hf. Moreover, the frequency of a wave is inversely proportional to its wavelength. That is, as frequency increases, wavelength decreases, and vice versa. This relationship is expressed by the equation c = λf, where c is the speed of light, λ is the wavelength, and f is the frequency. So, if Sasha increases the frequency of a wave, she effectively decreases its wavelength, which in turn - according to the Planck-Einstein relation - results in an increase in the wave's energy. Therefore, a wave with a higher frequency (like gamma rays) will have more energy than a wave with a lower frequency (like radio waves). It's also important to note that wave energy is also related to amplitude, but in the context of your question, the focus is purely on the frequency, so whenever the frequency of a wave is increased, its energy is also increased, regardless of the amplitude. In conclusion, by increasing the frequency of a wave, Sasha would be increasing its energy, according to the principles of wave theory and quantum mechanics. This underscores the principle that higher-frequency waves carry more energy."},{"question":"Write an article using the following points: Keith Herring abused crew, smashed TV, broke phone and urinated in cell.

Peggy believes it is a prank until she discovers his mutilated corpse. Peggy screams and tries to reach the beach but a monstrous figure attacks her and drags onto the sand. The humanoid creature tears off her swimsuit and rapes her. That night, two more teenagers are camping on the same beach.

Context: I don’t know how this rates as “shocking”, I guess it might depend on the culture in which you live, but, it is at the least “repulsive” or disgusting. There was a huge corporation in which I had a contract with. I was called in, to help them uncover what they considered “a very serious series of incidents”. Their own “in house” attempts were fruitless. It turned out, they had an over-sized engineering department, and that it had been announced that this would be scaled back due to completion of contracts. Someone though, within the engineering department, was sabotaging the continued work, slowing the completion. I was to go undercover, posing as a visiting engineer from a distant plant, and find out who the perpetrator/s were, as they wished to file legal action. So, this is at the corporate headquarters, in the late 1980’s. These people were making 6 figure incomes easily. That being said, you kind of expect a bit more of a dignified behavior here than you would with a construction laborer or dishwasher. I completed my job in four days, giving them the evidence and name of the lone individual respsonsible for the sabotage. What exactly was he doing? He carried rubber gloves in his back pocket, and he would periodically use the restroom, and remove his feces from the toilet and smear it all over the walls, covering as much surface as he could. He would also visit restrooms in different departments and do the same. This would cause the unionized individuals, who only had that restroom to use in their area, to walk off their work stations.

However, the language used in the review could be interpreted as leaning towards a more negative stance. The phrases \\"paper-thin\\" and \\"decidedly unoriginal\\" imply that the review might not be particularly favorable because they suggest that the story lacks depth and originality. In the context of a film review, a \\"paper-thin\\" story typically means that the plot is shallow, underdeveloped, or lacks intricacy. This might indicate that the reviewer did not find the storyline engaging or emotionally immersive. A \\"decidedly unoriginal\\" story implies that the plot is derivative and lacking fresh ideas or a unique approach. While these descriptions may point toward a negative opinion of the movie, it is crucial to consider that the review, as presented, only speaks to one aspect of the film: its story. A movie often entails multiple other elements that contribute to the overall viewing experience, such as acting, cinematography, sound design, and pacing, among others. Without additional information, it is difficult to definitively label the review as positive or negative. However, based on the language used to describe the story, the opinion seems to be more negative than positive when it comes to the movie's storyline. It should be noted that the viewer's perspective on the film as a whole could be influenced by factors not mentioned in this specific review snippet."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: What would be the ★-rating of this review (★ being the lowest and ★★★★★ being the highest)? \\"Mj Eetoo برنامج مفيد جداا للنظام وجميل\\" Answer:","response":"In order to determine the star rating of this review, I'll go through the following steps: 1.

Given the context: How would you describe Addison? Choose from: (A). professionally fulfilled. (B). short on money. (C). hardworking. The answer is:","response":"(A). professionally fulfilled. Addison can be described as professionally fulfilled, given the context provided. The information states that Addison made a good living as a surgeon at the hospital, which implies a high level of success and satisfaction in their career. The field of surgery is known to be demanding, and those who achieve success and earn a good income are usually skilled, talented, and dedicated professionals. A good living typically suggests that they are earning a comfortable income, allowing them to meet their financial needs and likely enjoy some luxuries or comforts. Additionally, a surgeon's work directly impacts people's lives and health, which can bring a deep level of personal fulfillment and sense of purpose to their profession. Although hard work (C) could be inferred to be part of Addison's personality, the context provided doesn't explicitly mention their work ethic. Therefore, we can't be certain that this is the most accurate description.

To provide a more detailed response, let's dive into the meaning and context of the phrase. The Western Balkan countries, comprising Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia, and Serbia, have faced issues related to smuggling and irregular migration. These countries recognize the importance of cooperation, and have engaged in efforts to share resources and information in an attempt to shut down smuggling routes. This cooperation is often facilitated by regional organizations, local authorities, and international partners such as the European Union. The phrase \\"Țările din Balcanii de Vest cooperează în domeniul controlului frontierelor pentru a închide rutele de contrabandă\\" emphasizes the importance of working together as a region to tackle the challenges of border control and the illegal movement of goods and people. Cooperation can involve sharing intelligence, conducting joint operations, and implementing policies to effectively manage borders and address criminal activity taking place along them. In recent years, Western Balkan countries have made progress in enhancing border security and combating smuggling through a combination of domestic reforms, regional cooperation mechanisms, and international partnerships. This progress has led to improvements in the overall security environment, but ongoing challenges remain. Continued cooperation, capacity-building, and political commitment among the Western Balkan countries will be essential for achieving long-term success in addressing smuggling and other border-related threats."},{"question":"Read this article and answer this question Coming off a tough road win against the Rams, the Saints went to Raymond James Stadium for a Week 11 duel against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

For comparison, Melissa McCarthy's last major film Bridesmaids (though it was in a supporting role) opened at 26.2 million, in 2,918 theaters. With an opening like this, big things are surely expected from Seth Gordon's R-rated comedy which has already surpassed its 35 million production budget. Though Bateman and Gordon had a successful run with Horrible Bosses after a 28.3 million opening weekend in July 2011, Bateman hasn't had this kind of luck with most of his starring roles. Universal's The Change-Up (with Ryan Reynolds) opened at 13.5 million in August 2011 and went on to gross only 37.1 million domestically, on a 52 million production budget. Jonathan Levine's Warm Bodies took second place for its second weekend with 11.5 million, bringing its domestic total to 36.7 million. This breaks Levine's record, beating the lifetime domestic gross of his last feature, the cancer dramedy 50/50 with Seth Rogen and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, which brought in 35 million.

Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","response":"Organizing game pieces can be accomplished in various ways, depending on the specific game, the pieces involved, the storage options available, and personal preferences. Below are two different methods of organizing game pieces, each with its advantages and disadvantages. Ultimately, the better approach should be based on the specific needs and context of the individuals involved in organizing and playing the game. Method 1: Categorizing by Game Element This method entails organizing game pieces according to the particular element or role they play within the game. This can include grouping pieces by type, color, use, or other categories relevant to the game's mechanics, objectives, or theme. For example, in a game like Monopoly, you could group all the property cards together, all the money by denomination, the tokens, the houses, and the hotels. Advantages: - Easy to locate specific pieces: When playing, it's convenient to have all the same types of pieces together, as you can quickly locate and distribute the pieces needed for gameplay. - Simplifies setup & cleanup: This method simplifies the setup and cleanup process, as each category of pieces has its designated area, making it easy to prepare the game and pack it away afterward. - Reduces confusion: Keeping the same types of pieces together helps players avoid confusion, especially during gameplay when quick decisions need to be made. Disadvantages: - May be challenging with complex games: For games with numerous types of pieces or complex categories, this method may become time-consuming or challenging to maintain. - Storage solutions may differ: Based on the game's storage design, this method might require additional containers or labels to accommodate the game elements' categorization. Method 2: Categorizing by Player This method involves organizing game pieces according to the player they belong to, generally by color or other distinguishing features, so each player has their set of game pieces. An example for this method would be a game like Risk, where each player has an army represented by different color tokens. Advantages: - Personal organization: Players can manage and organize their pieces throughout gameplay more easily, fostering a sense of responsibility and personal control. - Quicker setup: With each player's pieces stored together, setting up the game can be quicker, as players can access their pieces when needed during the game's initial setup. - Encourages engagement: Players feel more involved and engaged since they focus on the pieces that directly correspond to their gameplay. Disadvantages: - Not applicable to all games: This method doesn't apply well to games where pieces are shared or not specific to individual players. - Possible storage limitations: Some games may not have storage solutions readily available to separate pieces by player, requiring additional resources. Ultimately, both methods have advantages and disadvantages, and the most efficient way to organize game pieces for a particular game will depend on that game's unique characteristics, storage options, and player preferences. In some cases, a hybrid approach that combines elements of both methods might be the best solution. Evaluate the game at hand and consider the players' needs and preferences to settle on the most effective organization method."},{"question":"Who is they in the following sentence? The security patrol searched the land for survivors, but they were not interested in saving them.","response":"In the given sentence, \\"they\\" refers to the security patrol. Here's the step-by-step analysis: 1. Identify the main subject: \\"The security patrol\\" is the main subject of the sentence. 2. Look for actions or intentions attributed to the main subject: \\"searched the land for survivors\\" and \\"not interested in saving them\\" are two actions or intentions attributed to the security patrol. 3. Determine which actions or intentions are most relevant to the pronoun: \\"not interested in saving them\\" involves a pronoun (\\"them\\") and is directly connected to the earlier action of searching for survivors. 4. Make the connection: Since both actions or intentions are attributed to the same subject (the security patrol), it's reasonable to conclude that \\"they\\" refers to the security patrol. Therefore, \\"they\\" in the sentence refers to the security patrol, meaning they were searching for survivors but were not interested in saving them."},{"question":"Given a premise, an initial context, an original ending, and a new ending, the task is to generate the counterfactual context that is aligned with the new ending.

Variation in plumage also allows for the identification of birds, particularly between species. Visual communication among birds may also involve ritualised displays, which have developed from non-signalling actions such as preening, the adjustments of feather position, pecking, or other behaviour. These displays may signal aggression or submission or may contribute to the formation of pair-bonds. The most elaborate displays occur during courtship, where \\"dances\\" are often formed from complex combinations of many possible component movements; males' breeding success may depend on the quality of such displays.\\" Answer: A:","response":"A bird who is preening might be involuntarily communicating various messages through its actions and appearance. Preening involves the cleaning and maintenance of feathers, which is an essential aspect of a bird's health and survival. Step 1: Analyzing the context In the given context, it is mentioned that birds use plumage to convey social status, display breeding conditions, or make threatening displays. Visual communication in birds may also include ritualized displays that have developed from non-signaling actions such as preening. Step 2: Identifying possible messages Based on the context, a bird who is preening might be involuntarily communicating the following messages: 1. Display of health and physical condition: Preening ensures that the feathers are clean and well-arranged. This involuntary communication might signal to other birds that the preening individual is healthy and well-groomed. 2. Social status: By meticulously preening its feathers, a bird may inadvertently communicate its position in the social hierarchy. A well-groomed appearance may suggest dominance or high social standing. 3. Sexual availability: In some sexually selected species, a bird who is preening might be showcasing its breeding condition to potential mates. This behavior could attract the attention of the opposite sex and lead to courtship interactions. 4. Submission or aggression: Preening may be followed by other displays like feather fluffing or pecking, indicating submission or aggression towards other birds in the vicinity. Although not intentionally signaling these emotions, the preening act may trigger such behavior in response to perceived threats or challenges. Step 3: Formulating the answer A bird who is preening might be involuntarily communicating its health and physical condition, social status, sexual availability, or submission/aggression to other birds in the vicinity. These signals may play a role in attracting potential mates or responding to perceived threats and challenges."},{"question":"On a scale of 1-5 (with 1 being least favorable and 5 being most favorable), how would you rate this review? \\"Better than What'sapp\\" A:","response":"3"},{"question":"Write an article based on this \\"Click the red circle at the top-left corner of a window to close it.

Legislatures abolished primogeniture and entails, resulting in more widely distributed land holdings. This was a contrast to the general aristocratic pattern in which only the eldest child, usually a man, inherited the estate, which had the effect of keeping large estates intact from generation to generation. In America, in contrast, landed elites were less likely to pass on fortunes to a single child by the action of primogeniture, which meant that as time went by, large estates became broken up within a few generations which, in turn, made the children more equal overall. It was not always a negative development, according to Joshua Kaplan's interpretation of Tocqueville, since bonds of affection and shared experience between children often replaced the more formal relation between the eldest child and the siblings, characteristic of the previous aristocratic pattern. Overall, in the new democracies, hereditary fortunes became exceedingly difficult to secure and more people were forced to struggle for their own living. This rapidly democratizing society, as Tocqueville understood it, had a population devoted to \\"middling\\" values which wanted to amass, through hard work, vast fortunes. In Tocqueville's mind, this explained why America was so different from Europe. In Europe, he claimed, nobody cared about making money. The lower classes had no hope of gaining more than minimal wealth, while the upper classes found it crass, vulgar, and unbecoming of their sort to care about something as unseemly as money; many were virtually guaranteed wealth and took it for granted. At the same time in America, workers would see people fashioned in exquisite attire and merely proclaim that through hard work they too would soon possess the fortune necessary to enjoy such luxuries. Despite maintaining with Aristotle, Montesquieu, and others that the balance of property determined the balance of power, Tocqueville argued that, as America showed, equitable property holdings did not ensure the rule of the best men. In fact, it did quite the opposite. The widespread, relatively equitable property ownership which distinguished America and determined its mores and values also explained why the American masses held elites in such contempt. Choose from options: Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"They could make money via hard work versus in europe no one cared about making money\\" correctly answer the question \\"How were the American lower class's views of wealth and fine possessions different from those of the European lower class?\\"?

The response \\"They could make money via hard work versus in Europe no one cared about making money\\" correctly answers the question \\"How were the American lower class's views of wealth and fine possessions different from those of the European lower class?\\". According to Tocqueville's observations, the American lower class believed that through hard work, they could acquire wealth and fine possessions, while the European lower class had no hope of gaining more than minimal wealth and did not care about making money. The belief in hard work and the opportunity for upward mobility distinguished the American lower class from their European counterparts."},{"question":"Rate the similarity of the following two sentences on a scale from 0 to 5, where 0 is \\"no meaning overlap\\" and 5 is \\"means the same thing\\"?

A devestated Clara commits suicide.Unfortunately for the Wilherns, Clara's mother happens to be a witch. To avenge her daughter, the old woman curses the wealthy Wilherns, promising that the next girl born into the family will have the face of a pig, until she is accepted and loved by \\"one of her own kind.\\" For generations, only sons were born to Wilherns, and the curse was nearly forgotten.

The transmission of Zen from India to China occurred when the Indian monk Bodhidharma traveled to China in the late 5th or early 6th century. His teachings evolved and merged with Chinese thought, forming the basis of Chán Buddhism. Later, Chán Buddhism was transmitted to Korea and Japan, where it is known as Seon and Zen, respectively. In essence, Zen is a form of Buddhism that focuses on direct spiritual breakthroughs to truth rather than relying heavily on scriptures. While it values the teachings found in Buddhist texts, Zen emphasizes personal experiences, meditation, and moment-to-moment awareness. This transmission of ideas through the adaptation of words from different languages highlights the international and fluid nature of Buddhist thought."},{"question":"Write a sentence about the following things: leave, moss, rock","response":"When you go outside and play, you might find a nice rock with soft green moss on it, under a big tree where the leaves fall down."},{"question":"Q:Earlier this week, @naval (CEO and co-founder of AngelList) asked a question on Twitter: \\"The challenge of the next decade is not Artificial Intelligence, but Human Intelligence.

At the time in the West Midlands lots of industry was being automated and moved out to Asia, so lots of Midlanders were out of jobs and looking to retrain. This required, by definition, retaining the workforce as knowledge workers. OpenAdvantage was funded by the UK government and the University of Central England, had a decent war chest, and was founded by Scott Thompon and Paul Cooper (the latter of which I met when he heckled me at a talk I gave at a Linux User Group once. 🙂 ) So, I went along to their launch event and wrote a piece about them. Shortly after, Paul and Scott invited me back over to the office and offered me a job there as an open source consultant. I took the role, and this is where I cut my teeth on a lot of open source, community, and working with businesses. We had crazy targets to hit each month, so we ended up working with and training hundreds of organizations and individuals across a wide range of areas, and covering a wide berth of open source...

Keep a journal with you at all times and write in it whenever you feel stressed. In your journal, jot down: What caused the stress (if you're unsure, take an educated guess). How you felt/feel, either physically or emotionally. How you responded to the stress immediately. What you did in order to make the stress go away. Being in a stressful situation can make you feel like you're alone on an island. Luckily, you're not. Sharing your thoughts and feelings with other people, whether they are friends, family, co-workers, or acquaintances, can make you feel like a burden has been lifted from your shoulders. Sharing your thoughts may make you feel vulnerable, but vulnerability can be a good thing. It helps you open up, which can make you feel more honest and less closed up. When your body is running low on fuel, or is only running on the wrong kind of fuel, it's hard to muster up energy to fight stress. During this time, stress can seem particularly frightening and be particularly exhausting. Therefore, it's important to get a healthy diet of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, fiber, and healthy fats. Here are the foods you should generally try to avoid in order to reduce the effects of stress: High-fat foods. Foods high in trans and saturated fats, like butter, certain cheeses, and fast foods, can sap our energy while increasing our risk of heart attack. Not a good way to fight stress. Simple carbohydrates. Carbs like white bread, white rice, and baked goods (cakes, muffins, etc.) are processed quickly by the body and stored as fat. Better to stick with complex carbohydrates instead — foods like whole wheat bread and pasta, as well as brown rice. Sugar. Sugars are simple carbs which enter and leave the body quickly, meaning they give us a quick jolt and then cause us to crash. This crashing can contribute to a sense of anxiety or stress. Caffeine. We supplement much of our diet with caffeine from coffee, tea, soda, and energy drinks. Like sugar, caffeine can cause us to crash if the body experiences a sudden drop-off. Having too much caffeine can also impair the body's natural sleep cycle. Stress and inadequate sleep can form a vicious cycle. On the one hand, a survey said that 2/3 of subjects associated their sleep problems with stress. On the other hand, another study found that for each hour of sleep you lose during the night, your risk of stress increases 14%. In other words, stress causes sleeplessness, and lack of sleep causes stress. It's okay to reward yourself when you manage to do something stressful. This gives us an incentive to work through difficult situations in order to do what we know is right. But don't rely on incentives in order to get you through stressful times. It can be unhealthy to always need an incentive. Sometimes you buckle down and do something because you want to do it or you know you should do it. Actively solicit the advice of others and entertain their ideas. You never know when another perspective will really hit home. Asking for help may mean putting aside your ego, but it's worth it. People are generally keen on lending a helping hand. (It makes them feel good about themselves.) Learn take advantage of that largesse. In some cases, chronic stress takes hold and doesn't let go. It can lead to anxiety and depression, which spawn a host of other problems. These need to be dealt with promptly in order to make sure stress levels don't hit an unbearable level. If you feel like your stress is causing you to undergo significant lifestyle changes or is keeping you from doing things you would otherwise do, seek out the help of a professional. If you feel like your stress is causing you to self-medicate with drugs and/or alcohol, seek out the help of a professional. What is a summary of what this article is about?","response":"This article talks about how we can deal with stress in a healthy way. One way is to write about our stress in a journal, which helps us understand our feelings better and how we can handle stress. It also says that talking to friends and family about our stress can make us feel better. Eating healthy foods can give us energy to fight stress, while avoiding high-fat foods, simple carbs, sugar, and too much caffeine. Getting enough sleep is important too since stress can cause lack of sleep, and not sleeping enough can make us more stressed. Sometimes we need to ask for help from others or see a professional if our stress is causing big problems in our life."},{"question":"Question: Given the following passage \\"China's first imperial dynasty was the Qin dynasty (221–206 BC). The Qin unified the Chinese Warring States by conquest, but their empire became unstable after the death of the first emperor Qin Shi Huangdi. Within four years, the dynasty's authority had collapsed in the face of rebellion. Two former rebel leaders, Xiang Yu (d. 202 BC) of Chu and Liu Bang (d. 195 BC) of Han, engaged in a war to decide who would become hegemon of China, which had fissured into 18 kingdoms, each claiming allegiance to either Xiang Yu or Liu Bang. Although Xiang Yu proved to be a capable commander, Liu Bang defeated him at Battle of Gaixia (202 BC), in modern-day Anhui. Liu Bang assumed the title \\"emperor\\" (huangdi) at the urging of his followers and is known posthumously as Emperor Gaozu (r. 202–195 BC).

Action: In both sentences, the woman is involved in the action of \\"cutting.\\" This demonstrates similarity in the type of activity being performed. 3. Object: Here lies the main distinction between the two sentences. In Sentence 1, the object being cut is \\"some flowers,\\" while in Sentence 2, the object is \\"broccoli.\\" These two objects are different in nature - flowers are typically cut for their aesthetic value or to be displayed, while broccoli is cut for consumption as a vegetable. Considering these points, the two sentences share similarities in their subject and the action performed but differ significantly in the object involved. Therefore, on a scale of 0 to 5, with 0 being \\"no meaning overlap\\" and 5 being \\"means the same thing,\\" I would rate the similarity between Sentence 1 and Sentence 2 as a 2.

Brentford have reached the FA Cup quarter-finals four times, the last occasion being in the 1988-89 season when they were beaten 4-0 by reigning Division One champions Liverpool at Anfield. Martin Allen guided the Bees to FA Cup fifth-round appearances in 2005 and 2006 where they lost to Premier League sides Southampton, after a replay, and Charlton Athletic. This is the first season in six since that Brentford have got beyond the third round - and in all but one of the other seasons, they have not even got that far. Chelsea and Brentford have only met once before in the FA Cup, with the Blues winning the tie in 1950 by a 1-0 scoreline. The Bees beat a Premier League team on their last appearance in the fourth round, overcoming bottom of the table Sunderland 2-1 in 2006. Charlton 3-1 Brentford A Reds side with John Barnes, Peter Beardsley, Steve McMahon, Ronnie Whelan and Ray Houghton at the peak of their powers ultimately cruised to a 4-0 win at Anfield, But Perryman's Bees, then, like now, a side in the third tier of English football, had their opportunities early on and he was proud of the way his team handled themselves and the occasion. \\"I think Richard Cadette had two good chances,\\" said Perryman, who skippered Spurs to their FA Cup wins over Manchester City and QPR in 1981 and 1982. \\"Of course I am a bit biased, and maybe a quarter or a half-chance becomes three quarters of a chance - but we could easily have gone ahead. \\"I always thought the first goal was so vital. Liverpool were a great side but I felt they could be vulnerable early on and could be slow starters. \\"We had the first chance early on but didn't take it, and although we didn't live with them in the end, we didn't go there to defend and gave it a really good go.\\" Giving it a good go is exactly what Perryman feels Uwe Rosler's League One promotion hopefuls need to do against an under-pressure Chelsea side who have struggled for consistency since making a blistering start to the season. And while, like that day at Anfield, the odds are stacked heavily in the top-flight side's favour for the first competitive west London derby between the two sides since 1950, Perryman says any FA Cup underdog must be full of belief. \\"Don't tell me you can't get a slip in the box and a lucky break. It's possible,\\" said the Spurs legend, who also won two Uefa Cups and the League Cup twice during his time at White Hart Lane. \\"The longer the smaller team are level, the better their chance - and it only takes a defensive error or a great delivery from a set-piece. \\"There will be a great atmosphere at Griffin Park and that probably lifts the smaller team more than the big team because Chelsea will be used to it. \\"There are no mugs in the lower divisions now. They are all fit, they will have a spring in their step and they can cause an upset.\\" Perryman was Bees boss for three and-a-half years from 1987, and he believes that cup run - which involved seven games just to reach the quarter-finals - did wonders for their belief. Brentford are not an up-and-under, blowing-the-bugle type team. But actually that will probably suit Chelsea more A squad featuring Andy Sinton, Tony Parks, Neil Smillie, Keith Jones, Gary Blissett and Cadette had to win two replays and beat three higher-division clubs in Manchester City (who won promotion to the old Division One that season), Blackburn Rovers and Walsall to set up their dream tie at Anfield. It did come at a cost though. \\"Unfortunately, playing all those games hampered our league progress a bit that season,\\" Perryman said. \\"We were in a good position for promotion and it didn't quite happen. You get involved in so many games there has to be a focus taken away. \\"But I think it was the prelude to getting promoted under Phil Holder in 1992. That Cup run gave the team such confidence that we could be on the same pitch as the big boys. It was a wonderful experience. \\"Sinton got sold on the back of that game [to QPR]. He was obviously a good player but showed he could handle it with the big boys.\\" Brentford are currently third in League One, where they have only lost four times all season. Their defeat by Tranmere Rovers last Saturday was their first at Griffin Park since August and up front they have Clayton Donaldson, who has scored 19 goals in all competitions so far this term. But Chelsea legend Ron Harris, who played 795 games for the Blues before taking up a player-coach role with Brentford in 1980, cannot see an upset despite being impressed with the Bees when he saw them beat Southend to tee up the Chelsea tie. Chelsea were beaten 4-0 by Barnsley in the FA Cup third round in the 1988-89 season but went on to win the old Division Two title. The Blues reached their first FA Cup final in 24 years in 1994 but were brushed aside 4-0 at Wembley by a Manchester United side who clinched the double with that emphatic victory. Chelsea won the 1997 FA Cup final, their first major trophy in 27 years and their second FA Cup success. Since then they have won the competition five further times, in 2000, 2007, 2009, 2010 and 2012. They have won the FA Cup in four of the last six seasons, and have appeared in six of the 13 finals this century. Chelsea v Manchester United 1994 FA Cup final \\"They looked a half-decent side,\\" Harris told BBC Sport. \\"Rosler has got them playing some decent football. \\"Brentford are not an up-and-under, blowing-the-bugle type team and they played it around pretty well. But actually that will probably suit Chelsea more. \\"It's a fantastic tie for Brentford. You get upsets every year but I just cannot see it in this game. \\"Brentford would have to play out of their skin to beat Chelsea and Chelsea would have to play very poorly.\\" Notts County coach Colin Lee, a former Chelsea and Bees player, has been impressed with League One rivals Brentford this season, but cannot see an upset despite the turmoil at Stamford Bridge and the supporters' anger at Rafael Benitez's appointment as manager. \\"Chelsea will put out a very strong team. Brentford deserve that but I think Chelsea will have too much for them,\\" he said. Lee joined Brentford from the Blues in 1987 and combined playing duties with a first foray into management as a youth team coach. And although he was not involved in the game at Anfield, he was still on the playing staff and fondly recalls his spell with the Bees and the excitement that Cup run created. Ron Harris, Micky Droy, Keith Jones, Tommy Baldwin, Colin Lee, Steve Sidwell, Joe Allon, Graham Wilkins, Peter Borota and Stewart Houston. \\"It's a great club,\\" Lee said. \\"I had a fantastic couple of years there. They were good times and good people and some of those people are still involved. \\"The fans will remember this game for a long time. The Liverpool game created a real buzz and the local element will add that extra buzz this time. \\"It will be fantastic for the whole area.

What more can you want?\\" Listen to live commentary of Sunday's FA Cup tie between Brentford v Chelsea from BBC London 94.9 (UK only).","response":"In this article, Steve Perryman, former Brentford manager and two-time FA Cup winner, praises the Bradford team and speaks about their past performances against Premier League teams. He also discusses the first season in six that Brentford has gotten beyond the third round, highlighting their previous FA Cup accomplishments. Perryman believes that facing strong teams in the earlier rounds of the competition has helped boost the players' confidence and had a positive impact on their future league performances. He also talks about the importance of belief in such matches, mentioning that an underdog team must be confident in their abilities and seize any opportunities that come their way. The article goes on to discuss Chelsea and Brentford's previous matches in the FA Cup, with the last meeting between the two teams resulting in a 1-0 victory for Chelsea in 1950. Perryman shares his thoughts on what Uwe Rosler's League One promotion contenders need to do against Chelsea, emphasizing the importance of taking advantage of defensive errors or set-pieces. He also comments on the strong atmosphere at Griffin Park and how it could play a vital role in lifting the spirits of the smaller team. Finally, Perryman speaks about his time as Bees' manager from 1987 to 1990, reflecting on the team's memorable cup run during his tenure. He believes that the experience of facing top-tier clubs in the FA Cup has greatly contributed to the confidence and self-belief of the team, ultimately translating into better league performances and eventually promotion to higher divisions."},{"question":"Premise: Two people are organizing a large amount of food outside along a busy street.

To order presentation-ready copies for distribution to your colleagues, clients or customers, use the Order Reprints tool at the bottom of any article or visit www.djreprints.com ||||| By Paul Cruickshank CNN Terrorism Analyst There may be a link between what sources tell CNN is evidence of final-stage planning for an attack against U.S and Western interests by al Qaeda's affiliate in Yemen and the reported recent appointment of the affiliate's leader as the new general manager of the global al Qaeda network. Seth Jones, a senior analyst at the Rand Corporation, told CNN's Barbara Starr on Friday that there are indications that Nasir al Wuhayshi, the Yemeni leader of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), had recently been appointed into the role by al Qaeda leader Ayman al Zawahiri. The appointment would effectively thrust Wuhayshi, a Yemeni national, into the No. 2 position in the global al Qaeda terrorist network, a position previously held by the Libyan Abu Yahya al Libi before his death in a drone strike in Pakistan in June 2012. It would also provide a broader foundation to al Qaeda's top leadership at a time when the center of gravity of the group has shifted from the Afghanistan-Pakistan region to the Arab world. And it would potentially allow the group to retap fund-raising opportunities for the group in Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries where Wuhayshi is more popular than Zawahiri, al Qaeda's less charismatic and sometimes divisive Egyptian leader. Wuhayshi's appointment would almost certainly have required back-and-forth communication between the AQAP and al Qaeda Central. Given al Qaeda's past track record, that would most likely have involved couriers traveling back and forth between Yemen and Pakistan, where Zawahiri is presumed to be hiding. This would have given Wuhayshi plenty of opportunity to inform Zawahiri of any plan in the works to hit American targets in the region. This possible foreknowledge in turn may explain Zawahiri's impassioned plea in a message posted on jihadist websites earlier this week for followers to hit American targets in the Middle East and beyond. A high-profile attack orchestrated by Wuhayshi would cement the Yemeni's new position in the al Qaeda hierarchy. \\"What I'm told by sources is - take all this together: you have got the naming of the chief from al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, you have got the video [from Zawahiri], plus you have got the intelligence, all of this comes together in the last couple of weeks that leads them to take this extraordinary step of closing 21 embassies,\\" CNN National Security Analyst Fran Townsend said on CNN's \\"AC360\\" on Friday. A U.S. global travel alert remained in place Saturday amid fears that al Qaeda may launch attacks in the Middle East, North Africa and beyond in coming weeks. The threat prompted the United States to announce that nearly two dozen embassies and consulates will be closed on Sunday, including in Yemen, which was a focus of concern. The Next bin Laden? Nasir al Wuhaysi who is known by his fighters as \\"Abu Basir,\\" has a long pedigree in the global jihadist movement despite only being 36 years old. He is seen within jihadist circles as somebody with the credibility and charisma to one day fill Osama bin Laden's shoes as al Qaeda's paramount leader. Wuhayshi was bin Laden's private secretary during the time al Qaeda was based in Taliban-run Afghanistan and, according to former al Qaeda insiders, he rarely left his side. After the U.S. military offensive to topple the Taliban, Wuhayshi fled to Iran, where he was arrested and eventually extradited to Yemen in 2003. He was subsequently imprisoned in a high security jail in Sana'a with several other al Qaeda operatives who had been arrested in a crackdown on the group in Yemen after 9/11. But in February 2006, Wuhayshi and several other al Qaeda operatives escaped from the prison by digging a tunnel. Over the next several years Wuhayshi and the other escapees rebuilt al Qaeda's operations in the country and began launching attacks on Yemeni security services and foreign tourists. In September 2008, Wuhayshi orchestrated a sophisticated multi-phase attack on the U.S. embassy in Sana'a involving gunmen with rocket propelled grenades and suicide bombers in cars packed with explosive. Although the attackers failed to breach the embassy perimeter, six Yemeni guards and four civilians were killed in the attack. The following summer, Wuhayshi authorized an attempt to kill Saudi Arabia's then head of counter-terrorism, Mohammed bin Nayef. The plan was engineered by AQAP's ingenious chief bomb-maker Ibrahim al Asiri, who planted a bomb inside the rectum of his own brother. The operative gained an audience with the Saudi prince by pretending to defect and duly set off the bomb. But Nayef survived the attack. Although nearly all AQAP's attacks have been directed against targets in Yemen, Wuhayshi made clear he supported bin Laden's campaign of attacks against the United States. In late 2009, he green-lighted a plan by al Asiri and the American terrorist cleric Anwar al Awlaki to destroy a U.S. bound plane. On Christmas Day 2009, the Nigerian militant they recruited into the plot - Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab - came close to blowing up an airliner coming into Detroit with an explosive device hidden in his underwear. Bin Laden, determined to once again strike the United States, signaled his approval in correspondence sent to Wuhayshi. In August 2010, the Saudi sent a message from Abbottabad praising Wuhayshi for his \\"qualified and capable\\" leadership of the group and urging him to remain in his position. Two more thwarted plots against U.S bound aviation followed: an attempt to blow cargo planes coming into the United States with bombs hidden inside printer cartridges in October 2010 and a plot involving an even more sophisticated underwear device built by al Asiri, which was thwarted by a British-Saudi double agent in April 2012. In September 2012, three Yemeni AQAP operatives took part in the terrorist attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi several sources told CNN. It is not clear whether they were dispatched by Wuhayshi to take part in the attack or happened to be in the city and joined in. Despite green-lighting plots against the United States homeland, Wuhayshi never made them the group's priority. He only seconded a small number of operatives - perhaps a dozen - to AQAP's external operations outfit run by al Asiri and Awlaki. Wuhayshi wants Islamic rule in Yemen Wuhayshi's overriding focus, according to a former group insider, has been toppling the government in Sana'a and creating an Islamic state in Yemen. In 2011, Wuhayshi's group took advantage of political turmoil in Sana'a to capture large areas of Yemen's southern tribal areas. He enlisted the support of some tribal factions by renaming the group \\"Ansar al Shariah\\" and casting its mission as one of restoring Islamic rule to the country. Letters discovered in the Abbottabad compound revealed bin Laden had initially argued against the push to capture territory in Yemen fearing, rightly as it turned out, the group would not be strong enough to hold onto it, but Wuhayshi proceeded anyway. Bin Laden's opposition eventually softened. Wuhayshi himself set up his headquarters in the town of Jaar in Yemen's southern tribal areas. For 16 months, al Qaeda effectively governed the area, taking on responsibility for electricity, water and other utilities, but also inflicting brutal medieval justice on those it judged to have broken Islamic law. Wuhayshi was the commander at the heart of it all and his rule over territory in the heart of the Arab world further enhanced his reputation in jihadist circles worldwide. According to former group insiders - in much the same way as bin Laden - he was extremely popular with rank and file al Qaeda fighters. He projected the same softly-spoken humble air as his mentor. In spring 2012, the Yemeni military launched a major offensive which eventually drove al Qaeda out of several towns of the tribal areas of Yemen. But most of the group's leadership, including Wuhayshi, fled into the countryside and regrouped. In recent months, the group has been responsible for a rising number of bombings against Yemeni security services. Is a revenge factor at work? This week's terror threat warning may signal Wuhayshi has decided to attach greater priority to hitting U.S. and Western interests, which would be a worrying scenario for U.S. counter-terrorism officials because of the group's still significant capabilities, access to resources and expertise. Al Qaeda affiliates throughout the Middle East also have a new recruiting tool because of rising anger among the group's supporters because of what they perceive to be a U.S.-backed military coup in Egypt. Wuhayshi's appointment as al Qaeda's de facto No. 2 will increase the pressure on him to show results in targeting U.S. interests in the Middle East. Letters discovered from Abbottabad indicated that his boss Zawahiri disagreed with bin Laden over the relative priority that should be given to attacking the U.S. homeland. According to the Washington Post, the correspondence indicated the Egyptian believed launching attacks against the U.S. interests in the Middle East was a more effective way of removing U.S. support for secular regimes in the region. Wuhayshi likely also has several other motivations for ordering a strike now on U.S. interests. In recent months U.S. drone strikes have killed several senior AQAP, including Said al Shehri, Wuhayshi's deputy last winter, and the group has signaled it wants revenge. A successful high-profile attack may also re-energize the group after the setbacks of losing control of territory in Yemen's tribal areas last year. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","response":"There is evidence of final-stage planning for an attack against U.S and Western interests by al Qaeda's affiliate in Yemen, which may be linked to the reported recent appointment of the affiliate's leader, Nasir al Wuhayshi, as the new general manager of the global al Qaeda network.

They'd been busy with work and taking care of their kids, and this was their much-needed break. Little did they know that their relaxing trip would soon turn into a chilling, unforgettable tragedy. As they eagerly set off on their journey, Amrita's parents came across a local boy who warned them about a dangerous path that had been destroyed by a recent storm. Heeding the boy's advice, they decided to steer clear of the perilous route and take a detour on their way to the nearby village. They thanked the boy for looking out for them and continued on their way, grateful for the stranger's kindness. At the same time, Amrita was wandering around the area, taking in the beauty of the surrounding countryside. She was startled when she was suddenly stopped by a teenager, who was driving a young woman named Athidhi to her hostel. Athidhi was an introverted girl who was always keen on making new friends, and she seized the opportunity to make Amrita's acquaintance. The two girls immediately hit it off and chatted away as the teenager drove them toward the hostel. The girls' happy chatter was suddenly interrupted by the loud noise of a gunshot ringing through the air. Nearby witnesses hurried to the source of the sound and froze in horror as they saw Amrita's parents, lifeless on the ground, and Athidhi standing firmly with a gun in her hand. Panic-stricken, Athidhi protested her innocence, arguing that she had just found the weapon lying next to the bodies of Amrita's parents. While Amrita was devastated by her unexpected loss, she believed in her newfound friend and chose to stand by her side. Without much choice left, the two girls decided to work together in seeking out the real murderer, who they believed was a psychopath stalking the village unnoticed. Embarking on a perilous journey to bring justice to Amrita's parents, the duo began their search for the psychopath, determined to uncover the truth. Along the way, the village girl and the hostel resident encountered several obstacles and threats, coming face-to-face with danger at every turn. However, they never strayed from their mission, despite the escalating stakes and the suspicion that weighed heavily upon them. As they delved deeper into the dark corners of the village, the two girls unravelled a web of conspiracy and corruption that had been festering for years. As the truth began to emerge, they found themselves tangled within a sinister network of intrigue and terror, horrified by the reality that the seemingly peaceful village hid a murderous secret. Despite the odds stacked against them, Athidhi and Amrita grew more courageous and resourceful, driven by an unwavering desire to avenge the deaths of Amrita's parents. The two girls forged an unbreakable bond, with Amrita providing sensitivity and empathy, while Athidhi offered her determination and steeliness. As they finally closed in on the psychopath murderer, they not only found redemption and justice but also discovered the strength of an unbreakable friendship, built amidst adversity and grief. The ordeal they faced had made them inseparable, and together, they had chased the darkness away from a village that had long been engulfed in fear. The story of Athidhi and Amrita continued to be passed down through the generations, inspiring the villagers to remain vigilant and stand united against the shadows that threatened to engulf their lives."},{"question":"Q:Question: what does the royal family do I found the following answer on Google: Members of the Royal Family belong to, either by birth or marriage, the House of Windsor , since 1917, when George V changed the name of the royal house from Saxe-Coburg and Gotha .

How long will B alone take to do it? Options: (A) 8hours (B) 6hours (C) 14hours (D) 12hours (E) 5hours Think first, then make a decision. Some random thoughts:","response":"Let's break down the given information and solve step-by-step. 1. A can do the work in 6 hours. 2. B and C together can do the work in 4 hours. 3. A and C together can do the work in 3 hours. We can create equations using the concept of work rate. The work rate of a person is the reciprocal of the time it takes to complete the task. For example, if A takes 6 hours to complete the work, the work rate of A will be 1/6. Step 1: Assign work rates to the individuals. A's work rate = 1/6 B and C's combined work rate = 1/4 A and C's combined work rate = 1/3 Step 2: Create an equation to find B's work rate Since we know that A and C together have a work rate of 1/3 and A's work rate is 1/6, we can find C's work rate as follows: C's work rate = (A and C's combined work rate) - A's work rate C's work rate = (1/3) - (1/6) C's work rate = 1/6 Step 3: Find B's work rate Now, we can use B and C's combined work rate (1/4) to find B's work rate as follows: B's work rate = (B and C's combined work rate) - C's work rate B's work rate = (1/4) - (1/6) Step 4: Solve the equation for B's work rate To solve the equation, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions. Common denominator = 12 B's work rate = (3/12) - (2/12) B's work rate = 1/12 Step 5: Find the time it takes for B to complete the work Since the work rate is the reciprocal of the time it takes to complete the work, the time for B to complete the work can be found as follows: Time for B to complete work = 1 / (B's work rate) Time for B to complete work = 1 / (1/12) Time for B to complete work = 12 hours Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 12 hours."},{"question":"Samantha bought a crate of 30 eggs for 5. If she decides to sell each egg for 20 cents, how many eggs will she have left by the time she recovers her capital from the sales? Let's be accurate as possible.","response":"To determine how many eggs Samantha will have left after she recovers her capital, we'll first need to calculate how many eggs she needs to sell. First, let's find out how much Samantha needs to earn from each egg to recover her 5 investment: 5 (investment) / 30 eggs = 0.1667 per egg (approximately) Now, she wants to sell each egg for 0.20. We'll subtract the amount she needs to earn from each egg to break even: 0.20 (selling price) - 0.1667 (break-even price) = 0.0333 profit per egg (approximately) Now, let's find out how many eggs she needs to sell to recover her 5 investment: 5 (investment) / 0.0333 (profit per egg) = 150 eggs However, this number is larger than the 30 eggs she has in the crate. Since she only has 30 eggs, she will eventually sell all of them out, and we need to find out how much money she will have earned after selling all 30 eggs at 0.20 each: 30 eggs * 0.20 = 6 Samantha will have earned 6 from selling all 30 eggs, which is 1 more than her initial investment. To sum up, Samantha will not have any eggs left after selling all 30 eggs, and she will have successfully recovered her capital, which was 1 less than the total earnings (6)."},{"question":"How do I become a more interesting person?

Find the loan term. Calculate your interest. Establish your total repayment.\\"","response":"Title: Understanding Your Loan: Calculating Total Repayment, Loan Terms, and Interest Introduction: Loans have become an essential part of our lives today – especially considering the rise of major financial decisions such as financing a car, paying for education, and purchasing a house. In seeking a loan, it is crucial to understand the terminologies involved, how to compute the interest, and most importantly, how to establish your total repayment. By doing so, you'll be better-equipped to ensure you have chosen the most cost-effective loan available and significantly reduce your chances of being burdened by excessive debt. In this article, we will explore how you can determine your loan's total amount, identify the loan term, calculate interest, and ultimately establish your total repayment. 1. Determine the Total Amount of Your Loan: The initial step to understanding your loan is to determine the total amount you're borrowing. This amount reflects the principal, which is the original sum borrowed. Keep in mind that lenders may also charge a variety of fees and costs that relate to the loan—such as origination fees, processing fees, and insurance fees. Ensure to ask your lender about these charges and factor them into the total loan amount. Having a comprehensive understanding of the amount you're borrowing sets a strong foundation for accurately determining the loan term, interest, and total repayment costs. 2. Find the Loan Term: After determining the total loan amount, it's time to identify the loan term, which refers to the duration of time given to fully repay the borrowed amount. The loan term length can directly affect your interest rates and monthly payments—typically, a longer loan term results in lower monthly payments but higher overall interest rates (and vice versa for short-term loans). Loan terms can range from short-term (months to a few years) to long-term (usually 15 to 30 years). The most appropriate loan term depends on your financial situation, goals, and capability to afford monthly payments. It is critical to balance the term in a manner that allows you to comfortably make payments while also avoiding excessive interest rates. 3. Calculate Your Interest: Interest is the cost of borrowing money, expressed as a percentage of the loan amount. There are two types of interest rates: fixed and variable. Fixed rates remain constant throughout the loan term, while variable rates may fluctuate according to the market or decisions made by the lender. To calculate the interest on a loan, you'll need three key components: the interest rate, the principal, and the loan term. You can use the following formula for calculating interest: Interest = Principal x Interest Rate x Loan Term Make sure to divide the annual interest rate by the number of payments per year (usually 12 for monthly payments) before calculating the interest. Remember to convert the loan term into the number of payments as well. When comparing loan offers, explore the various interest rates and evaluate how these rates impact the total cost of the loan. Be sure to also consider the various loan terms and decide which option best aligns with your financial situation. 4. Establish Your Total Repayment: Finally, after determining the loan amount, loan term, and interest, you can establish your total repayment. The total repayment is the entire amount you will pay the lender by the end of the loan's term, consisting of principal, interest, and any other fees or charges. To calculate your total repayment, add the interest you have calculated to the principal amount: Total Repayment = Principal + Interest Keep in mind also that loan repayments are a combination of principal and interest payments. As you make payments, your balance reduces, and you begin paying less interest while paying more towards the principal. This structure is known as an amortizing loan. Conclusion: Understanding your loan and its terms is essential in making an informed financial decision. By carefully scrutinizing loan offers, calculating interest, and identifying the best possible loan term for your financial situation, you can save money while still achieving your borrowing goals. Total repayment should factor in all costs, helping you choose an affordable and suitable loan plan according to your needs. Stay vigilant, informed, and diligent—and you will be well-equipped to navigate the world of loans successfully."},{"question":"Please answer a question about the following article about Dissolution of the Soviet Union: On April 6, 1990, the Lviv City Council voted to return St. George Cathedral to the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church.

Darwin discusses contemporary opinions on the origins of different breeds under cultivation to argue that many have been produced from common ancestors by selective breeding. As an illustration of artificial selection, he describes fancy pigeon breeding, noting that \\"[t]he diversity of the breeds is something astonishing\\", yet all were descended from one species of rock pigeon. Darwin saw two distinct kinds of variation: (1) rare abrupt changes he called \\"sports\\" or \\"monstrosities\\" (example: ancon sheep with short legs), and (2) ubiquitous small differences (example: slightly shorter or longer bill of pigeons). Both types of hereditary changes can be used by breeders. However, for Darwin the small changes were most important in evolution.\\" Answer: The answer is:","response":"Artificial selection, also referred to as selective breeding, is a helpful driver of evolution. This process has played a significant role in shaping the diversity and adaptability of various species, both in the animal and plant kingdoms. Charles Darwin's observations in Chapter I of \\"On the Origin of Species\\" provide important context and support for this claim, as he discusses animal husbandry, plant breeding, and the remarkable diversity among breeds, despite their shared origins. Through careful manipulation and breeding practices, humans have been able to guide the evolutionary paths of various species, enabling the development of specific traits and characteristics that are deemed desirable or advantageous. One of the prime examples Darwin used to illustrate artificial selection is the breeding of fancy pigeons. Darwin noted the astonishing variety of breeds, all of which descended from a single species of rock pigeon. This diversity was made possible through generations of strategic breeding, selecting individual pigeons with desired traits, such as size, color, and feather type, and breeding them together to produce offspring with those specific characteristics. Over time, these cumulative changes have created numerous distinct breeds, demonstrating the power of artificial selection as a driver of evolution. In his observations, Darwin identified two types of hereditary changes that could result from breeding: (1) rare, abrupt changes, which he referred to as \\"sports\\" or \\"monstrosities,\\" and (2) ubiquitous small differences. An example of the first category is the ancon sheep, which exhibits short legs due to a rare genetic mutation. While the breeding of such animals can produce distinct and noticeable changes, Darwin believed that the small, incremental variations were most significant in shaping evolution. These small differences, such as slight variations in the shape or size of a pigeon's bill, can provide the foundation for more significant changes over generations of selective breeding. As desirable traits are identified and passed down, gradual alterations accumulate to produce more pronounced differences between breeds. Over time, these differences can become so great that new species may emerge. Artificial selection has not only allowed humans to guide the evolution of domesticated species but has also shed light on the broader mechanisms of evolution. By observing how targeted breeding can enhance specific traits and give rise to new breeds, we gain insight into how natural selection works in the wild. In nature, similar processes occur as organisms with advantageous traits are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on their genes to future generations. In conclusion, artificial selection is a helpful driver of evolution as it allows humans to direct the development and diversification of various species. Through selective breeding, we are able to produce desired traits and characteristics in both animals and plants. This process provides an invaluable insight into the workings of natural selection and evolution, demonstrating that even small, incremental changes can have a profound cumulative effect over time."},{"question":"Continue writing the next sentence in this paragraph: How to cope in school Get good quality, budget clothes.

A. motel B. comfort C. hostel D. theater E. camp ground The best answer is A:","response":"An outdoors man seeking accommodations is most likely looking to go to E. camp ground. An outdoors man is an individual who enjoys spending time in nature and participating in outdoor activities such as hiking, camping, fishing, and hunting. While accommodations can vary for these enthusiasts, a camp ground would best cater to their interests and preferences. Option A, a motel, is a type of lodging establishment that typically offers basic amenities and may not be located in natural settings, making it less appealing for someone who enjoys the outdoors. Motels often serve as stopover points for long road trips and might not provide the desired nature experience. Option B, comfort, is not a specific type of accommodation, but rather an abstract term that can refer to an individual's overall level of physical and emotional well-being. While comfort is important for any type of accommodation, it does not specify a particular place. Option C, a hostel, is a budget accommodation option which usually provides shared living spaces such as dormitories and communal facilities. Although hostels can be found in various locations, including some close to nature destinations, they are more common in urban centers and cater to budget or solo travelers.

No; The question \\"what building inside central park?\\" seeks to identify a specific building or structure located inside Central Park, which resides in New York City. The provided response, \\"The park initially opened in 1857, on of city-owned land (it is 843 acres today),\\" serves as an insightful detail regarding the history and size of Central Park, but it does not answer the original question directly. Instead, a more informative response could entail: Central Park, an iconic urban park in New York City, is home to several notable buildings and structures. One such building is Belvedere Castle, a Gothic and Romanesque style structure designed by Calvert Vaux in 1869. The castle originally functioned as a charming architectural focal point but has since been repurposed to serve as a visitor center and weather monitoring station for the National Weather Service. Other buildings within Central Park include the Central Park Dairy, a historical Victorian-style building designed by Vaux and Frederick Law Olmsted that once provided fresh milk for children in the late 19th century; the Loeb Boathouse, a picturesque boathouse with a restaurant and boat rentals overlooking the tranquil waters of the Central Park Lake; and the iconic Central Park Conservatory Garden, containing a landscape comprising French, Italian, and English styles. Restoring and maintaining these remarkable landmarks within Central Park's sprawling boundary of 843 acres today showcases the park's lineage as a beloved public space that initially opened in 1857. Consequently, Central Park continues to facilitate a vibrant fusion of natural beauty, architecture, and recreation for local residents and tourists alike."},{"question":"Question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: French surgeons have performed what they said on Wednesday was the world's first partial face transplant--- giving a new nose, chin and lips to a woman attacked by a dog. Specialists from two French hospitals carried out the operation on a 38-year-old woman on Sunday in the northern city of Amiens by taking the face from a brain-dead woman, who had hanged herself just hours before the operation. Her family agreed on the operation. \\"The patient is in an excellent state and the transplant looks normal,\\" the hospitals said in a brief statement after waiting three days to announce the pioneering surgery. The woman had been left without a nose and lips after the dog attacked her last May, and was unable to talk or chew properly. Such injuries are \\"extremely difficult, if not impossible\\" to repair using normal surgical techniques, the statement said. The statement did not say what the woman would look like when she had fully recovered, but medical experts said she was unlikely to _ the woman who had been the source of her new face. The operation was led by Jean-Michel Dubernard, a specialist from a hospital in Lyon who has also carried out hand transplants, Skin transplants have long been used to treat burns and other injuries, but operations around the mouth and nose have been considered very difficult because of the area's high sensitivity to foreign tissue. Teams in France, the United States and Britain had been developing techniques to make face transplants a reality There was a short-term risk for the patient if blood vessels became blocked, a medium-term danger of her body rejecting the new skin and a long-term possibility that the drugs used could cause cancers. Experts say that although such medical advances should be celebrated, the transplant had thrown up moral and ethical issues. Little is known about the psychological effect of the transplant.

Sentence A, \\"he couldn't sleep at night after drinking tea,\\" makes sense because tea contains caffeine, which is a stimulant and can make it difficult for some people to fall asleep at night. However, sentence B states, \\"he couldn't sleep at morning after drinking tea,\\" which goes against common sense because people generally do not sleep in the morning, as it is the time when they start their day.

If we break down the statements: 1. A quartet is performing inside. This statement specifies that a group of four musicians is performing inside a venue or location. 2. Musicians are playing outside. This statement informs us that there are musicians performing in an outdoor setting. Based on the information given, we cannot definitively conclude that the premise \\"A quartet is performing inside\\" is true or false. There could be several different scenarios at play, such as: Scenario 1: A quartet is performing inside a venue, and there are also musicians performing outside. In this case, both statements are true and can coexist. Scenario 2: No quartet is performing inside, but musicians are playing outside. In this scenario, the premise \\"A quartet is performing inside\\" would be false. Scenario 3: A quartet is performing inside a venue, and there are no musicians playing outside. Here, the premise \\"A quartet is performing inside\\" would be true; however, the statement \\"Musicians are playing outside\\" would be false.

Koala: This word is significant as it refers to the subject of the sentence, which is the focal point of the statement. The koala, a marsupial native to Australia, is known for its distinct appearance and for primarily feeding on eucalyptus leaves. By mentioning a koala, it sets the context for the rest of the sentence. 2. Eating: This verb is essential as it describes the action performed by the subject. The act of eating indicates that the koala is consuming food, providing a mental image and conveying information about the creature's behavior. It tells us what the koala is doing and suggests that the scene involves the koala's mealtime or nourishment. 3. Tree: The last significant word serves as the location setting for the sentence. As koalas typically reside and eat in trees, this word places the action and subject in their natural habitat. It also helps the reader visualize the scene better and understand where and how the described event occurs. In conclusion, the most salient words in the sentence \\"koala eating on a tree\\" are \\"koala,\\" \\"eating,\\" and \\"tree\\" because these words provide critical information about the subject, the action being performed, and the location where the event is taking place.

Eastland believes that the founders of affirmative action did not anticipate how the benefits of affirmative action would go to those who did not need it, mostly middle class minorities. Additionally, she argues that affirmative action carries with it a stigma that can create feelings of self-doubt and entitlement in minorities. Eastland believes that affirmative action is a great risk that only sometimes pays off, and that without it we would be able to compete more freely with one another. Libertarian economist Thomas Sowell identified what he says are negative results of affirmative action in his book, Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study. Sowell writes that affirmative action policies encourage non-preferred groups to designate themselves as members of preferred groups [i.e., primary beneficiaries of affirmative action] to take advantage of group preference policies; that they tend to benefit primarily the most fortunate among the preferred group (e.g., upper and middle class blacks), often to the detriment of the least fortunate among the non-preferred groups (e.g., poor white or Asian); that they reduce the incentives of both the preferred and non-preferred to perform at their best – the former because doing so is unnecessary and the latter because it can prove futile – thereby resulting in net losses for society as a whole; and that they engender animosity toward preferred groups as well.:115–147\\" Answer: The answer to this question is:","response":"According to Thomas Sowell in his book, \\"Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study,\\" there are several groups that he identifies as losing out from affirmative action: 1. Non-preferred groups: Sowell argues that affirmative action policies may encourage individuals from non-preferred groups to designate themselves as members of preferred groups to take advantage of the policies. This means that individuals who may not initially benefit from affirmative action may attempt to be recognized as part of a preferred group to gain access to the benefits, thereby potentially undermining the policy's aim. 2. Least fortunate among non-preferred groups: Sowell claims that affirmative action tends to primarily benefit the most fortunate among the preferred group (for example, upper and middle-class minorities) often to the detriment of the least fortunate among the non-preferred groups (for example, poor white or Asian individuals). This suggests that affirmative action may unintentionally exacerbate existing inequalities between different segments of the population. 3. Incentives to perform at one's best: According to Sowell, affirmative action reduces the incentives for both preferred and non-preferred groups to perform at their best. For the preferred group, they may feel that their achievement is not crucial as they already have support from affirmative action policies. On the other hand, non-preferred groups might feel that their efforts go unrewarded due to affirmative action favoring other groups, which can lead to underperformance or disengagement. 4. Society as a whole: Sowell asserts that the overall result of these issues is a net loss for society, as it may lead to decreased productivity, reduced efficiency, and potential backlash against the policy. 5. Animosity toward preferred groups: Lastly, Sowell suggests that affirmative action can engender animosity toward preferred groups from those who perceive themselves as unfairly disadvantaged by the policies. This can result in increased tension and divisiveness between different groups in society. In summary, Thomas Sowell argues that affirmative action can have negative consequences for non-preferred groups, the least fortunate among non-preferred groups, overall societal productivity, and can create animosity toward preferred groups. These claims emphasize the potential unintended consequences of affirmative action policies and should be considered alongside arguments supporting their use for remedying past discrimination and promoting diversity."},{"question":"Title: My I am Legend Disk Makes a Nice Drink Coaster Review: Boring, cheesy, riddled with plot holes and leaps of logic, atrociously bad CGI, and poorly written.

In October, MacDonald introduced Thomson to Dr. James MacCallum. A frequent visitor to the Ontario Society of Artists' (OSA) exhibitions, MacCallum was admitted to the Arts and Letters Club in January 1912. There, he met artists such as John William Beatty, Arthur Heming, MacDonald and Harris. MacCallum eventually persuaded Thomson to leave Rous and Mann and start a painting career. In October 1913, MacCallum introduced Thomson to A. Y. Jackson, later a founder of the Group of Seven. MacCallum recognized Thomson's and Jackson's talents and offered to cover their expenses for one year if they committed themselves to painting full time. MacCallum and Jackson both encouraged Thomson to \\"take up painting seriously, [but] he showed no enthusiasm. The chances of earning a livelihood by it did not appear to him promising. He was sensitive and independent, and feared he might become an object of patronage.\\" MacCallum wrote that when he first saw Thomson's sketches, he recognized their \\"truthfulness, their feeling and their sympathy with the grim fascinating northland ... they made me feel that the North had gripped Thomson as it had gripped me since I was eleven when I first sailed and paddled through its silent places.\\" He described Thomson's paintings as \\"dark, muddy in colour, tight and not wanting in technical defects\\".

The transition into the second paragraph talks about the fascinating and humorous elements of the movie, notably the meeting with the Grim Reaper and playing classic games. In the third paragraph, the reviewer again confirms his/her positive sentiments stating the reason why they preferred the sequel.

While such markets can be abusively manipulated with consequent adverse price and reliability impact to consumers, generally competitive production of electrical energy leads to worthwhile improvements in efficiency. However, transmission and distribution are harder problems since returns on investment are not as easy to find. Paragraph: Sweden and Norway had taken two different approaches in dealing with their electric power suppliers. Sweden has broken up large companies into many smaller companies. But Norway kept the handful of large electric power suppliers they had intact, and didn't take initiative to increase their numbers. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would companies in Sweden find return on investment harder or easier? Answer:","response":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, it can be inferred that companies in Sweden might find return on investment harder in the transmission and distribution sectors of the electric power market. This is because Sweden has broken up large companies into many smaller ones, potentially leading to increased competition and a more challenging environment for these smaller companies to secure substantial returns on investment, particularly in the transmission and distribution areas where returns are not as easy to find. On the other hand, the competitive production of electrical energy may lead to improvements in efficiency, which could partially offset the difficulty in achieving returns on investment. However, it is important to note that several factors can influence the ease or difficulty of return on investment and a comprehensive analysis would be needed to determine the overall situation for Swedish companies."},{"question":"Via Culinaria in Salzburg, Austria Navigation Content Activities in Austria Please remove spaces between words.","response":"ViaCulinaria in Salzburg, Austria is an exceptional culinary journey that showcases the region's rich and diverse gastronomy through various activities and experiences.

Although Powell was intimidated by Lennon's attitude and appearance, she heard that he was obsessed with the French actress Brigitte Bardot, so she dyed her hair blonde. Lennon asked her out, but when she said that she was engaged, he screamed out, \\"I didn't ask you to fuckin' marry me, did I?\\" She often accompanied him to Quarrymen gigs and travelled to Hamburg with McCartney's girlfriend to visit him. Lennon was jealous by nature and eventually grew possessive, often terrifying Powell with his anger and physical violence. Lennon later said that until he met Ono, he had never questioned his chauvinistic attitude toward women. He said that the Beatles song \\"Getting Better\\" told his own story, \\"I used to be cruel to my woman, and physically – any woman. I was a hitter. I couldn't express myself and I hit. I fought men and I hit women. That is why I am always on about peace.\\"Recalling his July 1962 reaction when he learned that Cynthia was pregnant, Lennon said, \\"There's only one thing for it Cyn.

His marriage began just as Beatlemania was taking off across the UK. He performed on the evening of his wedding day and would continue to do so almost daily from then on. Epstein feared that fans would be alienated by the idea of a married Beatle, and he asked the Lennons to keep their marriage secret.

Translate this to English?","response":"The statement in English is: \\"Bacteria are released into the soil when tumors are wet or when the tissue of old tumors disintegrates.\\" Bacteria are microscopic, single-celled organisms that can be found almost everywhere. In a natural context, bacteria are usually harmless and can even be beneficial. They play an essential role in breaking down organic matter and recycling nutrients. In the case mentioned in the sentence you provided, it's likely referring to plant tumors rather than human ones (as context of soil and disease in plants). There are many types of bacteria that can cause diseases or conditions in plants, much like human pathogens. Agrobacterium for instance, is a soil bacterium that can cause tumors or galls to form on many plants. When a plant tumor is wet, it provides the perfect conditions for the bacteria to grow and reproduce. Once these conditions are met, the bacteria can be released into the surrounding soil where they can survive, multiply and be ready to infect the next host plant. If tissue from an old tumor disintegrates, the bacteria contained within can be similarly released. This disintegration could occur through various processes such as decomposition, where bacteria and other microorganisms break down the tissue, or through physical processes like soil erosion. In both cases, bacteria being introduced to new environments like the soil provides opportunities for them to find new hosts and continue their lifecycle. The process of bacteria release and dispersion is a natural one and plays a crucial role in ecosystems, although it can also contribute to disease spread, depending on the type of bacteria involved. It's also important to note that not all bacteria are harmful. Many types serve vital purposes in soil, helping to process nutrients and maintain soil health. Just as in other ecosystems, balance is key in the soil microbiome. Too many harmful bacteria can cause problems, such as diseases in plants, but a diverse mix of microorganisms can help keep the soil healthy and fertile, supporting plant growth."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Process: - Rain falls on wood - The rain seeps into the wood surface - It permeates the wood - When rain evaporates it leaves the wood - It takes the finish of the wood with it - The wood begins to lose it's luster - It begins to look bad - It has pieces of paint missing from the rain - It gets worse when it rains - It eventually will have no paint left. Question: suppose more rain seeps into wood happens, how will it affect more luster stays. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","response":"The process described involves rain falling on wood and seeping into its surface. As the wood absorbs the rainwater, the finish of the wood starts to deteriorate. When the rain evaporates, the finish of the wood is further damaged, leading to a loss of luster. Over time, continuous exposure to rain continues to strip the wood of its paint and luster, eventually resulting in a completely faded and unattractive appearance. Suppose more rain seeps into the wood. This increased absorption of rainwater will have a more significant effect on the luster that remains on the wood. The elevated moisture content in the wood will quicken the process of the paint and finish being stripped off, causing the luster to fade more rapidly. The rate at which the wood's appearance degrades will likewise increase, leading to more significant damage and even possibly compromising the structural integrity of the wood, depending on the extent of water absorption and the type of wood. As a result of more rain seeping into the wood, the supposed perturbation will have a greater influence on the second effect mentioned, which is the loss of luster. The increase in rain absorption will exacerbate the fading process and accelerate the diminishing quality of the wood's surface. In conclusion, the increased absorption of rainwater by wood will yield a more substantial effect on the luster and overall appearance of the wood. The additional rainwater will quicken the process of paint and finish deterioration, resulting in a faster loss of luster and a worsening of the wood's appearance. The supposed perturbation will, therefore, have a more prominent influence on the second effect mentioned."},{"question":"Question: I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose animals eat the mushrooms happens, how will it affect LESS waste being removed from the body. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","response":"The perturbation hypothesis presented here involves animals consuming mushrooms, which may potentially affect the waste removal process in the body. To determine if this perturbation has a direct or indirect effect on the waste removal process, let's first recap the process and then consider the potential impact of mushroom consumption. The waste removal process in the body, particularly in the kidneys, can be summarized as follows: 1. Fluids and waste enter the kidneys from the bloodstream. 2. A filtering process within the kidneys (glomerular filtration) permits certain waste products and fluids to pass into nephrons, the tiny functional units of the kidney. 3. Larger molecules, such as proteins, are usually prevented from passing through due to their size. 4. As the waste products and fluids pass along the nephron, necessary electrolytes, glucose, amino acids, and water are reabsorbed back into the bloodstream through a process called tubular reabsorption. 5. Unwanted waste products are concentrated and converted into urine through a process called tubular secretion. 6. Urine, containing the waste products for removal, is excreted from the body through the urinary system. Now, let's consider the potential impact of mushroom consumption on this waste removal process. The effects of mushroom consumption would largely depend on the type of mushroom consumed. If the mushrooms consumed are toxic or contain harmful compounds, there may be additional or altered waste products that need to be filtered from the bloodstream and removed by the kidneys. This could put additional strain on the filtering process and could potentially affect the efficiency of waste removal, leading to less waste being removed from the body. However, if the mushrooms consumed are non-toxic and safe for consumption, they should not directly impact the waste removal process mentioned above. The natural breakdown of the mushrooms in the digestive system would generate waste products; however, these should be similar to the waste generated by other types of food and should not necessarily cause less waste to be removed from the body. In conclusion, the effect of the perturbation (mushroom consumption) on the waste removal process depends on the type of mushroom consumed. Toxic or harmful mushrooms could potentially impact waste removal efficiency, potentially leading to less waste being removed from the body. In contrast, non-toxic mushrooms should not pose a direct or indirect impact on the process of waste removal within the kidneys."},{"question":"M: I slipped on the stairs and fell down.

Three species of mangrove trees exist in the region: red (Rhizophora mangle), black (Avicennia germinans), and white (Laguncularia racemosa), although all are from different families. All have the same characteristics: they are tolerant of salt, brackish, and fresh water; they grow in oxygen-poor soil; and they can survive drastic water-level changes. Black and white mangroves excrete salt from under their leaves, and red mangroves filter the salinity of sea water. All species are integral to coastline protection during severe storms. Red mangroves, for example, have far-reaching roots that trap sediments. The trees not only stabilize coastlines, but add land as more sand and decaying vegetation is trapped in the root systems. All three mangroves also absorb the energy of waves and storm surges. The estuaries act as fisheries for fry and nurseries for crustaceans. Shrimp, oysters, crabs, whelks, cockles, and snails thrive in these waters, as do primordial horseshoe crabs (Limulus polyphemus). The region supports a 59 million-a-year Tortugas pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus duorarum) industry, and a 22 million-a-year stone crab (Menippe mercenaria) industry. Between 80 and 90 percent of species that are harvested commercially in Florida are born or spend time in the shallow waters near the Everglades. Oysters and mangroves work in tandem to build up the coastline. The sand around the coastline has minute white particles of quartz and fine shells. When currents are right, oysters grow in colonies or beds, and deposit their shells, reinforcing the bed. Mangrove seeds, called propagules, are full embryos and float in water until they reach a favorable location and take root, often on oyster beds. They shed skin and litter, ensuring other trees will not compete for space and nutrients.Mangroves also serve as excellent rookeries for birds. Wading birds, such as roseate spoonbills (Platalea ajaja), egrets, and tricolored herons (Egretta tricolor) use the mangroves as a nursery, due to the proximity of food sources...

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more substances rise into the high atmosphere happens, how will it affect more substances rise into the high atmosphere. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","response":"The perturbation hypothesis you've provided suggests that if more substances, such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen, rise into the high atmosphere, how would it affect the process and does this perturbation have any direct or indirect effect? To answer this question, let's first break down the process of acidic rain formation and then discuss the consequences of the hypothesized increase in substances rising into the high atmosphere. Process of Acidic Rain Formation: 1. Emission of pollutants: Chemicals like sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) are released into the air, mainly from human activities such as burning fossil fuels, industrial processes, and vehicle emissions. 2. Rising pollutants: These substances rise into the high atmosphere, where they are dispersed over large areas due to wind and other atmospheric processes. 3. Chemical reactions: In the high atmosphere, these pollutants react with water and oxygen, as well as other substances present in the atmosphere, forming acidic compounds such as sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and nitric acid (HNO3). 4. Formation of acidic rain: When these acidic compounds mix with rainwater, they create a more acidic rain with increased hydrogen ion (H+) content. Suppose the perturbation hypothesis comes true, and more substances like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides rise into the high atmosphere. In that case, we can expect the following consequences: 1. Increased chemical reactions: With more substances present in the high atmosphere, the rate of chemical reactions leading to the formation of acidic compounds would likely increase. 2. Higher acid content in rain: As more acidic compounds are formed, the rain will have a higher acid content, leading to more acidic rainwater. 3. Worsened air quality: An increased quantity of atmospheric pollutants can lead to deteriorating air quality, posing health risks for humans and animals. Exposure to high levels of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides can cause respiratory problems, aggravate existing heart and lung conditions, and lead to higher rates of related illnesses. 4. More extensive environmental damage: Acidic rain can have several negative effects on the environment. It can leach essential nutrients from the soil, affecting agriculture and plant growth. Moreover, it can harm aquatic ecosystems by increasing the acidity of water bodies, causing harm to fish and other aquatic organisms. The increased acidity can also accelerate the corrosion of buildings, monuments, and other infrastructure. 5. Climate change implications: Additional chemicals in the high atmosphere could also have implications for the Earth's climate, particularly if greenhouse gases are among the additional substances. An increase in greenhouse gases would lead to more heat being trapped in the atmosphere, exacerbating global warming and climate change. In conclusion, the proposed perturbation of having more substances rising into the high atmosphere, particularly sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, would indeed have significant direct and indirect effects on the acidic rain formation process. The consequences could include worsened air quality, more extensive environmental damage, and potential implications for climate change. Efforts to reduce emissions of these pollutants are essential in mitigating these negative effects and protecting the environment and human health."},{"question":"Tracy knew Jan was thirsty and told her to take the lemonade.

A. yes B. no Does \\"This resulted in an exodus of civilians from Egyptian cities along the Suez Canal's western bank.\\" correctly answer the question of Who would get to attack Israel from Lebanon?","response":"The statement \\"This resulted in an exodus of civilians from Egyptian cities along the Suez Canal's western bank\\" does not correctly answer the question of Who would get to attack Israel from Lebanon. The statement is unrelated to the topic at hand, as it discusses the movement of civilians in Egypt in connection to the Suez Canal, whereas the question is about a party or group attacking Israel from Lebanon. Let's provide a comprehensive response to the question: Lebanon is a country that shares a border with Israel to the north and has experienced multiple conflicts throughout history, often involving Israel and various militant groups. Given the context of the initial question, we can infer it's seeking information about groups or parties that would carry out attacks on Israel from Lebanese territory. Multiple entities might be involved or have been involved in attacking Israel from Lebanon. Some of them are: 1. Hezbollah: Hezbollah is a Lebanese Shiite political party and militant group that was established in the early 1980s. This organization is considered the most powerful non-state actor in the region and one of Israel's primary enemies. Hezbollah has been responsible for many high-profile attacks against Israel, including rocket assaults and cross-border incidents. It derives its support from Iran and Syria, and its military wing is considerably well-armed and highly trained. 2. Palestinian militant groups: Various Palestinian armed factions have operated from Lebanon, particularly during the Lebanese Civil War, which took place between 1975 and 1990. These factions, which included the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), were involved in attacks targeting Israel from southern Lebanon. Palestinian militant organizations, like Hamas and the Islamic Jihad, have also been accused of operating from Lebanon to mount attacks on Israel. 3. Lebanese Nationalists: Throughout history, certain Lebanese nationalist factions that were opposed to Israeli occupation or perceived Israeli aggression have also executed attacks targeting Israel. An example is the Lebanese National Resistance Front, which was active during the early 1980s and collaborated with other groups like Hezbollah and various Palestinian factions to combat Israeli military presence in Lebanon. It is important to note that the current official position of Lebanon does not involve attacking Israel, and the Lebanese Armed Forces are generally committed to maintaining peace and stability along the border region with Israel. However, this delicate balance is often threatened by ongoing tensions between Israel and Lebanese non-state actors like Hezbollah. In conclusion, the entities that would likely carry out attacks on Israel from Lebanon include Hezbollah, Palestinian militant groups, and historically, certain Lebanese nationalist factions. Current circumstances on the ground may change, and various actors may be influenced by regional dynamics, but these groups have been the primary parties involved in attacks on Israel from Lebanese territory in recent history."},{"question":"Coming off their last-second win over the Dolphins, the Texans continued their home stand with a Week 7 interconference duel with the winless Detroit Lions.

A soccer referee who was fatally punched by a player during a recreational game in suburban Detroit did not expect the attack, one of the player's teammates testified on Wednesday. Dr. Jamal Saleh testified during a probable-cause hearing for Bassel Saad, who is charged with second-degree murder in the death of referee John Bieniewicz. The 44-year-old referee 'did not see the punch coming,' said Saleh, who played for Saad's team during the over-30 men's league game at Mies Park in Livonia on June 29. Bieniewicz, a dialysis technician at a local hospital, had a wife and two sons. Defendant Bassel Saad sobs during a probable-cause hearing on Wednesday afternoon in Livonia, Michigan. Saad is charged with second-degree murder in the death of soccer referee John Bieniewicz. John Bieniewicz (pictured), who was punched in the head on June 29 while refereeing an adult-league soccer match in the Detroit-area, died on July 1. Two players from the opposing team also testified that Saad knocked Bieniewicz to the turf with one punch after the referee indicated he planned to eject Saad from the game. The punch, which Saleh said landed around the head and neck area, caused Bieniewicz to 'fall back without any control of his body.' Saleh said he rushed toward Bieniewicz, who was on his back grasping a yellow card in one hand and a red card in the other. In soccer, a yellow card is held aloft by the referee to caution a player following a foul or other misconduct. A red card is shown by the referee when a player is being thrown out of the game. Two yellow cards given in the same game equal a red card. Witness Scott Herkes, left, demonstrates with defense attorney Ali Hammoud how he said Bassel Saad punched soccer referee John Bieniewicz, during a court hearing on Wednesday in Livonia, Michigan. In this case, the players testified that Saad had been issued a yellow card following a foul in the first half, and Bieniewicz was giving him a second yellow for being verbally abusive. That's when he was struck, the three players said. A skirmish erupted between players following the attack. Saleh said he quickly checked on Bieniewicz and the referee initially was not breathing but had a pulse. Saleh said he performed CPR and told the unconscious Bieniewicz: 'Wake up, buddy. You're going to be OK.' Player Scott Herkes testified that Saad removed his jersey and left the field with another man as Bieniewicz was being tended to. Herkes said he followed the men into the parking lot and took down the license plate number of the vehicle in which they left. Prosecutors showed a photograph in which Saad appeared to be making an obscene gesture while seated in the vehicle. A man who was punched in the head on June 29 while refereeing an adult-league soccer match in the Detroit-area has died. John Bieniewicz, who was attacked on Sunday at a park in Livonia, Michigan died at Detroit Receiving Hospital on Tuesday, said hospital spokesman Alton Gunn. Saad, a 36-year-old auto mechanic from Dearborn, had been charged with assault with intent to do great bodily harm before Bieniewicz died on July 1. That charge was formally dropped, and prosecutors issued the murder charge. The probable-cause hearing in Livonia District Court, which will determine whether to send the case to trial, resumed today. It ended with Judge Kathleen McCann denying prosecutors' motion to bring up an alleged 2005 incident in which Saad is said to have been involved in an altercation with another player at a soccer game. Defense lawyer Ali Hammoud said his client's past has nothing to do with this case, and prosecutors' interest in bringing it up shows that 'their case is extremely weak on second-degree murder.' Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","response":"A soccer referee named John was working at a game when a player named Bassel got angry and punched him very hard.

We have the equation: u + 248 = -17*u + 68 Now, we want to find out what number 'u' is. We must bring all the 'u' related numbers together and then bring all the regular numbers together. Step 1: Let's add 17*u to both sides of the equation to bring all the 'u' related stuff together: u + 17*u + 248 = -17*u + 17*u + 68 This simplifies to: 18*u + 248 = 68 Step 2: Now, we want to bring all the regular numbers together. Let's subtract 248 from both sides of the equation: 18*u + 248 - 248 = 68 - 248 This simplifies to: 18*u = -180 Step 3: Finally, we will divide by 18 on both sides to find out what number 'u' is: 18*u / 18 = -180 / 18 This simplifies to: u = -10 So, like a detective, we've solved the puzzle, and have found that 'u' is -10."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Keith designs car seats. He noticed that some other car seats didn't have any padding. He marked it as case A. On the other hand, most of the seats he designed had padding. He marked it as case B. Keith needed to know pros and cons of both designs. Would case B take less or more time for the force to act than case A? Answer:","response":"In Keith's observations, he labeled two types of car seat designs: Case A: Car seats without padding Case B: Car seats with padding To determine if Case B (car seats with padding) would take less or more time for the force to act than Case A (car seats without padding), we need to understand the role of padding in a car seat. Padding in car seats serves several purposes: 1. Comfort: Provides a comfortable seating surface for the occupant. 2. Shock absorption: Reduces the impact of forces acting on the occupant during incidents such as accidents or sudden stops. 3. Force distribution: Spreads the forces acting on the occupant's body over a larger area, reducing localized pressure and potential injuries. Now, let us analyze the time it takes for the force to act on both types of car seats during an impact: In Case A (car seats without padding), the force from the impact will be transferred to the occupant more directly and rapidly since there's no cushioning to act as a barrier. This means that in an impact, forces will act on the occupant quicker in case A compared to case B. In Case B (car seats with padding), the padding provides an additional layer that can absorb and redistribute the force from the impact. This will take more time as the force must first compress the padding before reaching the occupant. Therefore, the time for the force to act on the occupant in Case B is longer than in Case A. In conclusion, Case B (car seats with padding) would take more time for the force to act on the occupant than Case A (car seats without padding). This extra time can contribute to a reduced risk of injuries sustained during impacts, providing increased safety and comfort for the user."},{"question":"Background: Clinton Richard Dawkins (born 26 March 1941) is an English ethologist, evolutionary biologist, and author. He is an emeritus fellow of New College, Oxford, and was the University of Oxford's Professor for Public Understanding of Science from 1995 until 2008. Dawkins first came to prominence with his 1976 book The Selfish Gene, which popularised the gene-centred view of evolution and introduced the term, meme. With his book The Extended Phenotype (1982), he introduced into evolutionary biology the influential concept that the phenotypic effects of a gene are not necessarily limited to an organism's body, but can stretch far into the environment. Context: In his book, The Selfish Gene, Dawkins coined the word meme (the behavioural equivalent of a gene) as a way to encourage readers to think about how Darwinian principles might be extended beyond the realm of genes. It was intended as an extension of his \\"replicators\\" argument, but it took on a life of its own in the hands of other authors, such as Daniel Dennett and Susan Blackmore. These popularisations then led to the emergence of memetics, a field from which Dawkins has distanced himself. Dawkins's meme refers to any cultural entity that an observer might consider a replicator of a certain idea or set of ideas. He hypothesised that people could view many cultural entities as capable of such replication, generally through communication and contact with humans, who have evolved as efficient (although not perfect) copiers of information and behaviour. Because memes are not always copied perfectly, they might become refined, combined, or otherwise modified with other ideas; this results in new memes, which may themselves prove more or less efficient replicators than their predecessors, thus providing a framework for a hypothesis of cultural evolution based on memes, a notion that is analogous to the theory of biological evolution based on genes. Although Dawkins invented the term meme, he has not claimed that the idea was entirely novel, and there have been other expressions for similar ideas in the past. For instance, John Laurent has suggested that the term may have derived from the work of the little-known German biologist Richard Semon. In 1904, Semon published Die Mneme (which appeared in English in 1924 as The Mneme). This book discusses the cultural transmission of experiences, with insights parallel to those of Dawkins. Laurent also found the term, mneme, used in Maurice Maeterlinck's The Life of the White Ant (1926), and has highlighted the similarities to Dawkins's concept. James Gleick describes Dawkins's concept of the meme as \\"his most famous memorable invention, far more influential than his selfish genes or his later proselytising against religiosity\\". Question: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article? Answer:","response":"Yes, there are some interesting aspects about this article. First, the idea of a \\"meme\\" has become very popular in today's internet culture as funny images or ideas that spread quickly across social media. It's fascinating that Dawkins, a biologist, was the one who introduced this concept, which later evolved into something different than what he originally intended. Second, the fact that Dawkins's work on meme has similarities with the work of earlier scientists like Richard Semon and Maurice Maeterlinck shows how ideas can evolve and be shaped by different thinkers over time, just like how memes themselves can change as they spread through culture. Lastly, it's interesting to learn that Dawkins has distanced himself from the field of memetics, which was inspired by his own work. This shows that sometimes, a single concept introduced by a person can have a life of its own and grow in many different ways beyond the original intention of its creator."},{"question":"Given the question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context.

Is There is no substantive evidence which suggests parenting or early childhood experiences play a role when it comes to sexual orientation. a good answer to this question? Available choices: (a). yes. (b). no.","response":"(b). No. Although the statement \\"There is no substantive evidence which suggests parenting or early childhood experiences play a role when it comes to sexual orientation\\" is partially true, it does not encompass the extensive research conducted on sexual orientation. A more detailed and long answer would address various aspects of research on sexual orientation, which include biological, genetic, and environmental factors. Let's explore them further: 1. Biological factors: Numerous studies have investigated the role of biological factors in determining sexual orientation. These factors include prenatal hormone exposure, brain structure differences, and finger length ratios. Some research has demonstrated that men with more older brothers have a higher chance of being gay, which is attributed to the maternal immune response theory. This suggests that repeated exposure to male-specific proteins during pregnancies may cause an immune reaction in the mother that affects the developing male fetus, subsequently influencing sexual orientation. 2. Genetic factors: Twin and family studies have aimed to uncover possible genetic influences on sexual orientation. A study published in 2018 found that genetic factors account for about 25-30% of the variation in sexual orientation. Furthermore, researchers have identified several genomic regions associated with same-sex sexual behavior. While it's clear that genetics play a role, they don't solely determine sexual orientation. 3. Environmental factors: There is some evidence to suggest that environmental factors play a role in determining sexual orientation, although the research on this aspect is sparse and often controversial. Some studies have proposed that different hormone levels in the womb influence sexual orientation, but results have been inconsistent and conclusive links have not been established. Early life experiences, such as upbringing, childhood abuse, or other environmental factors, have also been investigated. However, these studies do not provide conclusive evidence for environmental factors determining sexual orientation. Sexual orientation is likely to be a result of complex interplay between numerous factors, including genetic, hormonal, and environmental. Further research is necessary to unravel the precise mechanisms involved in determining one's sexual orientation. To provide a comprehensive response, the answer should emphasize that parenting and early childhood experiences alone are not responsible for determining sexual orientation, but rather that it is a combination of factors that contribute to sexual orientation development."},{"question":"Question: Which animal is observed in the plot?

Movie title: The Fox and the Child Context: A young girl of about 10 years lives in a farm house in the Jura mountains in eastern France. One day in autumn, when she rides her bicycle to school through the forest, she observes a hunting fox. Of course, the fox escapes, but the girl yearns to meet the animal again. She spends most of her free time in the forests trying to find the fox during the following months, but she doesn't meet the fox again until winter comes. During the winter, she follows the fox's tracks far across the fields. Suddenly she compares her hand to the size of the tracks near to those she is following and discovers they are relatively fresh wolf tracks; she is alarmed as a wolf pack begins howling near her. She runs away panicked, falls and hurts her ankle. The ankle heals very slowly, so that she has to stay at home during the winter reading a book about foxes and other animals of the forest. When spring arrives, the girl is looking for fox holes and waits for the fox. The fox has young babies and moves holes because of her observations; therefore the girl decides to observe the fox from a greater distance. She finds the fox again and tries to get the animal accustomed to her. She feeds it with meat. Later she can even touch the fox and is led to the new den. Finally, the fox arrives at her house and she lets it inside, wanting to show it her bedroom. But the fox becomes distressed at not being able to find a way out and escapes by smashing through her brittle plate glass window, causing the glass to shatter. The fox is hurt badly, but survives and the girl learns that she cannot keep wild animals as pets at home as they are unpredictable and may break more things such as fragile glass windows. Years later she tells the whole story to her son, as seen at the end of the film.

In response, the UK has become a militarized police state as British government forces round up and detain immigrants. Theo Faron, a former activist turned cynical bureaucrat, is kidnapped by the Fishes, a militant immigrants' rights group. They are led by Theo's estranged wife, Julian Taylor, from whom he separated after their son Dylan's death during a 2008 flu pandemic. Julian offers Theo money to acquire transit papers for a young refugee named Kee, which Theo obtains from his cousin Nigel, a government minister who runs a state-sponsored collection of salvaged art from around the world. The transit papers require that the bearer must be accompanied, so Theo agrees to escort Kee in exchange for a large sum.

Steve Huey of AllMusic wrote that Thriller refined the strengths of Off the Wall; the dance and rock tracks were more aggressive, while the pop tunes and ballads were softer and more soulful. Its tracks included the ballads \\"The Lady in My Life\\", \\"Human Nature\\", and \\"The Girl Is Mine\\", the funk pieces \\"Billie Jean\\" and \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\", and the disco set \\"Baby Be Mine\\" and \\"P.Y.T.

The album's title track suggested to the critic a parallel between Jackson and Stevie Wonder's \\"oddball\\" music personas: \\"Since childhood his main contact with the real world has been on stage and in bed.\\" With Thriller, Christopher Connelly of Rolling Stone commented that Jackson developed his long association with the subliminal theme of paranoia and darker imagery.

In \\"Billie Jean\\", Jackson depicts an obsessive fan who alleges he has fathered her child, and in \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\" he argues against gossip and the media. \\"Beat It\\" decried gang violence in a homage to West Side Story, and was Jackson's first successful rock cross-over piece, according to Huey. He also observed that the title track \\"Thriller\\" began Jackson's interest with the theme of the supernatural, a topic he revisited in subsequent years.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","response":"The perturbation hypothesis, in the context of hibernation, is not directly related to the processes that occur in a star's life cycle. Hibernation typically refers to a state of inactivity and metabolic depression in animals, allowing them to conserve energy during unfavorable conditions. However, the concept of a star's core being affected by a hypothetical form of hibernation or perturbation could be discussed in a broader sense. If we assume a hypothetical scenario where a star goes through a \\"hibernation\\" phase, meaning a temporary state of decreased nuclear reactions and energy production within the core, the potential effects on the core could be complex. In such a scenario, the decreased energy production would result in reduced outward pressure to support the weight of the star's outer layers. Consequently, the layers of hydrogen would press down on the core more forcefully than usual, causing the core to contract further. This increased pressure in the core would cause gravity to strengthen, which could hasten the core contraction process. If the perturbation or \\"hibernation\\" were to cease, and the star resumed its normal rate of energy production, the increased gravity and contracted core might result in a more rapid burning of nuclear fuel, potentially shortening the star's overall life cycle. In summary, while the concept of a star undergoing \\"hibernation\\" or a temporary perturbation is not directly supported by current scientific understanding, such a hypothetical scenario could have an indirect effect on the process of the core contraction. These effects could include an increased contraction rate and stronger gravity, possibly impacting the star's overall life cycle."},{"question":"Kevin Delaney said: \\"Of the 14 elected, two gave us manifestos, that for me gives us a fatally flawed election. \\"Without a manifesto how do we know what our politicians stand for?

The two bus companies involved in the collision, TopView Sightseeing Tours and Big Bus Tours, are among the many operators that provide hop-on, hop-off services for tourists, each offering multiple routes and attractions throughout New York City. Both companies have safety procedures and protocols in place, as well as highly trained drivers, to ensure the wellbeing of their passengers and people in the surrounding area. In response to the incident, the New York Police Department (NYPD) and the city's Department of Transportation launched a joint investigation to determine the cause of the collision and assess whether any safety regulations and procedures had been violated by the bus operators. As part of the investigation, the authorities collected evidence from the crash site, reviewed CCTV footage, and interviewed the drivers, passengers, and eyewitnesses to paint a clearer picture of the events leading up to the accident. The preliminary findings of the investigation point towards a possible mechanical failure in one of the buses, as well as human error on the part of the drivers. In light of this incident, city officials reaffirmed their commitment to reviewing and strengthening safety measures for the tour bus industry, including more frequent vehicle inspections, stricter licensing requirements for drivers, and stronger collaboration between tour operators and city agencies to ensure the safe navigation of city streets. In the meantime, both tour bus companies expressed their deep regret over the accident and extended their sympathy and support to the injured victims. They emphasized their dedication to ensuring the safety and well-being of their passengers and promised to work closely with the authorities to prevent such incidents from happening in the future. The overall impact of this accident has also raised questions about the need for better management of tourist activities in crowded urban areas like Times Square. City officials are now considering various new measures, such as implementing designated bus lanes, restricting pedestrian traffic during peak hours, and increasing police presence to improve the overall safety and orderliness in the area. As a result of the accident and the subsequent investigation, both locals and tourists alike are reminded of the importance of remaining vigilant and taking necessary precautions to ensure their own safety in busy, crowded environments.

French investigator now suggests the snow plough crossed the runway and then mysteriously reversed back into the jet's path. Francois Hollande leads mourners at funeral service in central Paris. Article:","response":"Title: A Tragic Incident: Remembering Christophe de Margerie and the Fateful Moscow Plane Crash On October 20, 2014, the world was shocked by the appalling news of Christophe de Margerie’s untimely death. A stalwart in the global oil industry, de Margerie faded into the eternal realm when his private jet tragically crashed into a snow plough at Moscow's Vnukovo airport. This article embarks on a journey to unpack the circumstances surrounding one of the most unfortunate incidents in aviation history. Christophe de Margerie, the charismatic and jovial CEO of Total, France's biggest oil company, had been on a business trip to Moscow. This well-respected figure's life was cut short when his departing jet collided with a snow plough. Initial reports suggested that heavy fog and icy conditions had played a significant role in the crash, but as we delve deeper into the incident, new revelations have gradually come to light. An inquiry by French investigators into the deplorable incident has revealed a perplexing twist to the tale. According to investigators, the snow plough allegedly crossed the runway, then enigmatically reversed back into the airplane's path. This intervention has brought about a wave of speculations and theories. If the snow plough had crossed the runway entirely and had moved on, as every other vehicle operating during the hours of flight operations would have, the unfortunate collision might well have been averted. The abruptness of de Margerie's passing has left a void in the global oil industry that is challenging to fill. He was admired by many for his unfiltered comments and daring perspectives, even at a time when most dared not to speak. Therefore, his absence is not just a loss for the energy sector but indeed, a loss for the world. In the aftermath of de Margerie’s tragic death, French President Francois Hollande led mourners at the funeral service held in central Paris. Many high-profile personalities, colleagues, friends, and family of Christophe de Margerie came together to bid a tearful adieu to a man who might be gone but will indeed never be forgotten. This tragic incident is a stark reminder of how life can be unpredictably fleeting. It also underscores the critical importance of stringent safety measures in aviation. As the investigations continue, we can only hope for a clear understanding of the circumstances surrounding de Margerie's untimely death and hope that similar incidents can be prevented in the future. The sudden loss of Christophe de Margerie has left an indelible mark on many hearts worldwide. His legacy will continue to live on, and his contributions to the energy sector will continue to be an inspiration for many upcoming aspirants in the industry. As those left behind continue to navigate this loss, they carry the memory of a man whose impact reached far beyond the boardroom."},{"question":"Q: Context: The Cori cycle (also known as the Lactic acid cycle), named after its discoverers, Carl Ferdinand Cori and Gerty Cori, refers to the metabolic pathway in which lactate produced by anaerobic glycolysis in the muscles moves to the liver and is converted to glucose, which then returns to the muscles and is metabolized back to lactate.

The planet's rotation has always wobbled slightly, and over time this movement has caused the North Pole to shift very slightly over time. But researchers now believe global warming could be drastically increasing this shift. Since 2005, the North Pole has shifted by 1.2 metres in an easterly direction. By using Nasa satellite data, researchers from Texas have discovered that 90 per of this shift has been caused by climate change, including the melting of the Greenland ice sheet, pictured, as well as the melting of mountain glaciers. The Chandler wobble is a wobbling motion that happens as the Earth rotates on its axis. It works in a similar way to how a. spinning top wobbles as it slows down. The effect was discovered by American. astronomer Seth Carlo Chandler in 1891. He found that the poles can 'wander' by approximately 20ft to 30ft over a period of 433 days before. settling. The wobble causes the latitude. position of the geographic poles to change over this 14-month period. and this means star charts have to be updated regularly to reflect new. reference points for the geographic poles. In 2005, the North Pole began to move suddenly in an easterly direction. Using Nasa satellite data, University of Texas researchers found that climate change, and in particular melting ice sheets, was to blame. Using the data, scientists also predicted that as as sea levels continued to rise, the shift would also carry on. Lead researcher Jianli Chen said that ‘ice melting and sea level change can explain 90 per cent of the shift’ and that ‘the driving force for the sudden change is climate change.’ Since 1899, the North Pole has been moving south by an average of 10cm a year along a 70-degree west longitudinal line. Between 1982 and 2005, the pole drifted 6cm a year in a south-easterly direction towards northern Labrador in Canada. In. 2005, this drift abruptly changed and the North Pole began moving to. the east, towards Greenland. Since that time it has shifted position by. around 1.2 metres. Chen. and colleagues studied changes in the Earth’s gravity during this time. period using Nasa’s Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite images. They were able to work out exactly how Earth’s mass had moved and changed during this time and found it was caused due to the melting of the ice sheets in Greenland and the. Antarctic, which has in turn caused sea levels to rise. Chen’s team hope that the discovery will provide scientists with a new way to measure the extent of ice sheet melting by tracing the movements of the pole. Greenland's ice sheet is said to be melting at a rate of 250. gigatonnes each year. Antarctica is losing 180 gigatonnes of ice every. year, and melting mountain glaciers adds a further 194 gigatonnes. These shifts in the Earth’s surface were found to ‘correlate perfectly’ with the changes in the position of the pole. To understand why this sudden change occurred, researchers studied changes in the Earth's gravity using Nasa's GRACE satellite images, pictured. They studied changes in the Earth's mass caused by melting ice sheets and found they 'correlated perfectly' with the changes in the position of the pole. According to previous research, this. shift is also caused by changes in the Earth’s mass that have been occurring. since the last ice age, affected by what’s called the. Chandler wobble. The Chandler wobble is a wobbling motion that happens as the Earth rotates on its axis. It. works in a similar way to how a spinning top wobbles as it slows down,. and this causes the alignment of the Earth’s poles to vary in position. as the planet spins. The. wobble was discovered by American astronomer Seth Carlo Chandler in. 1891 and the poles can 'wander' up to approximately 20ft to 30ft off. course over a period of 433 days, before settling. The. wobble causes the latitude position of the geographic poles to circle. during this 14-month period and this means star charts have to be. updated regularly to reflect new reference points for the geographic. poles. Chen presented the findings at the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco.","response":"1. Scientists claim climate change is responsible for Earth's poles drifting. 2.

That's why a large group of mechanical engineers (centered at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, but with partners at other universities and companies) are hard at work in an effort to replace batteries with a tiny engine that runs on fuel. Imagine a battery-free life! When the fuel runs out in your mobile phone, you just fill up and go. The engine---about the size of a ten-cent coin---starts with a combustion chamber that burns hydrogen. Its tiny parts are etched onto silicon wafers in the same manner that computer parts are etched onto integrated circuits . The first engine is made up of five wafers. And since these wafers could be produced in much the same way as computer chips, they could probably be produced quite cheaply. But the _ in all this nice detail is efficiency. Tiny engine parts don't always behave like the bigger parts of the first engine. Something between the parts can slow down the works, according to Columbia University Professor LucFrechette, one of the engine's designers. Extreme heat from the combustion chamber is also a problem, often leaking to other parts of the engine. The scientists' goal is to create an engine that will operate 10 times better than batteries operate. Frechette says that a complete system, with all parts in place and working, will be set up in the next couple of years, but commercial models aren't likely until at least the end of the next ten years. According to the passage, the title suggests that _ . A) batteries should be greatly improved B) petrol will be used instead of batteries C) the time of batteries will be gone forever D) pollution problems caused by batteries must be solved Answer:","response":"C) the time of batteries will be gone forever"},{"question":"Question: What is Agnes Hurley's nickname? Answer the above question based on the context below: Agnes Hurley is a disillusioned housewife, married to Bronx cabdriver Tom Hurley. She wants something better for her daughter, Jane. When Jane announces her engagement to Ralph Halloran, Aggie sees this as an opportunity to have a romantic elaborate wedding, with caterers and all the trimmings, like she never had because they could never afford it. However, the daughter does not want it because it is causing awkward conflicts with her family and friends, and her father has been saving that money for many years to purchase a taxi medallion and become self-employed. The film deals with the ensuing money troubles and conflicts within the family, which also involve Uncle Jack Conlon and most of the neighborhood. It is not until the end of the film that the mother realizes that it is the happiness of her family, rather than the expensive ceremony, that is most important, as they go off to watch their daughter get married at their church in the new taxi.

Speaking to Daily Mail Online about the upcoming release of her new music video for fashion label Grace MMXIII, in which she showcases her impressive vocal talents alongside those of Oscar-nominated composer J. Ralph, the 35-year-old explained that it was only after reading about Lena's own struggles with endometriosis in her book Not That Kind of Girl, that she felt able to open up about her own fertility issues. 'Lena Dunham was a big factor in my speaking out,' she said. Making moves: Jaime King, 35, lends her vocals to a breathtaking new music video for fashion label Grace MMXIII's latest campaign. Expecting: Jaime announced earlier this month that she is expecting her second child with husband Kyle Newman, after revealing last year that she had suffered five miscarriages before conceiving her son James. 'As a dear friend who spoke out in her book about endometriosis, she helped give me the courage to ponder what kind of impact I wanted to make on this world. And I thought, \\"Hey, you have a big platform to help other women and couples.\\" 'I know it's not a sexy topic, I know that it's extremely private and vulnerable, but at the same time I went through years of silent suffering because no one speaks about these things or the symptoms and effects of endometriosis.' Jaime, who earlier this month revealed that she is expecting her second child with husband Kyle Newman, added that she hopes her decision to speak out about her fertility struggles will help her fans to see past the perceived perfection of her 'Hollywood life'. People think I live a picture perfect life, and it started to upset me that I could possibly, in some way be presenting a curated, false idea of what my life is to my fans and to the world,' she said. 'Because that's false, it's a lie. In Hollywood we put out this totally unrealistic idea of a glamorous life because that's a part of the illusion that the public and system wants to see. A way to escape. 'However, why can we not do both? Be beautiful and inspiring yet be honest and support others on their journeys. If one more person can feel supported - then I will sacrifice any level of vanity and privacy for that. 'I will sacrifice anything to help educate and bring awareness to something so common, yet so oddly taboo. Because it shouldn't be. It's not about infertility per se - it's about the disease of PCOS and endometriosis and the prevention and care of that.' When it comes to setting an example for other mothers-to-be, Jaime, who is currently starring as restaurant owner Lemon Breeland in hit CW series Hart of Dixie alongside former OC star Rachel Bilson, could not be a better role model. While already balancing her TV role with her family life at home with her beloved husband and son, who is now 16 months old, the actress is also busy throwing her heart and soul into her music career - and confessed that she has no plans to slow down any time soon. Lean on me: Expectant mother Jaime revealed that she was given the courage to speak out about her own struggles with PCOS after reading about her friend Lena Dunham's own diagnosis in her book. Natural talent: Jaime explained that she has no plans to slow down on the work front, despite her pregnancy, noting that 'working always makes a pregnant woman happy' 'Working always makes a pregnant woman happy,' she said. 'Well, at least an insanely creative woman such as myself.' Thankfully, Jaime has plenty of creative projects to keep her occupied. As well as appearing in the soon-to-be launched video campaign for Grace MMXIII, the little black dress brand founded by Jens Grede and Erik Torstensson of Frame Denim, Jaime is also working on her own album with her Grace MMXIII video collaborator J. Ralph, which, she teased, will be available soon. But music is in no way a new focus for Jaime, who revealed that she has been 'working on music and writing poetry and songs for friends' for as long as she can remember. She has also worked on her fair share of music videos in the past, both in front of and behind the cameras. In 2012, Jaime starred in the video for Lana Del Ray's hit single Summertime Sadness, which was directed by her husband Kyle, with whom she has also co-directed a number of music videos in the past. But when it came to pursuing a singing career in her own right, under her own name, Jaime credits her close friend - and global singing sensation - Taylor Swift with giving her the inspiration that she needed to 'put her work out there'. 'Taylor was really the biggest catalyst for me to put my work out there, she lit a fire under me when she read my writing and her brilliance is unparalleled,' she said. 'She is fearless and incredibly brave, always authentic yet capable of reaching people on such a universal scale - it's very powerful.' And while she is finally ready to put her own music out there in the spotlight, Jaime explained that she still plans to remain a strong support to her friends, whom she describes as being 'the greats in their industry'. Number one fan: Jaime describes herself as a 'cheerleader' for her friends, such as Lena (L) and singer Taylor Swift (R), who she believes are 'greats' in their industries. Family ties: Jaime hopes that her struggles with PCOS will help her fans to see beyond the perceived perfection of her 'Hollywood life' and help them to find the strength to overcome their own issues. Surprise! The Hart of Dixie star announced her pregnancy with this adorable Instagram snap of her son James, who is now 16 months old. Reaching out: Jaime posted a heartfelt message to her fans on Twitter, thanking them for their continued support. 'I have an interesting dynamic with my friends because many of them are the greats in their industry,' she said. 'I have always been there to support their artistry because music has the capacity to reach people globally and truly change the planet by connecting us through song. I find by supporting someone like Taylor, or any friend who has that reach, is very important because I am deeply passionate about artists that have a voice and use it to change things for the better. 'I love being a cheerleader behind-the-scenes because in my industry I'm always front and center.' In her new music video for Grace MMXIII, however, the expectant mother happily takes center stage, showcasing her beautifully raw singing voice, as well as a number of seductive dance moves, in the dynamic and visually breathtaking clip. 'The only nerve-wracking part [about the video] is that my vocals are a live track with no auto tune, no bells and whistles, purely my voice which is the same with J. Ralph,' she said of the filming process. 'He is a visionary artist and carefully selected very rare and beautiful microphones that would naturally lend themselves to our particular style. 'For me, to sing and write, to have a band with J. Ralph is just another form of my expression as an artist. What we make musically is very poetic and dramatic which is how I've always sang - more like an old school jazz singer, not a popstar. 'I really just love every medium of art. And I want people to love it of course, to move them deeply. As a performer my goal is to always make people feel less alone in the world. To feel connected. 'But I will leave it to my friends to dominate the music industry.'

This is because flowers are the main source of nectar and pollen, which bees collect to make honey and feed their colonies. Flowers have evolved various shapes, colors, and scents to attract bees and other pollinators, as these insects help with the pollination process, enabling plants to reproduce. However, bees may also interact with other options you've mentioned like (A) plant life, (D) plants, (F) plant stems, (G) shrub leaves, and (H) bushes, because they are often part of the overall plant where the flowers are located.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Sue Fleming's suitcase opens by accident, dropping her clothes from a double-decker bus onto Norman Winthrop. She retrieves her belongings and enters the New York City bus terminal. Intrigued, he follows her and returns a garter belt she overlooked. Steve Borden, the man she is involved with, calls her on the phone (though he is also in the terminal) and tells her to buy a ticket to San Francisco. Afterward, she sees him with another woman. They board the bus too. Norman, who is supposed to go to San Francisco by train, decides to travel by bus instead. Murphy has orders from Norman's father to keep him away from women. To Murphy's satisfaction, Sue rebuffs Norman's initial attempts to become better acquainted. May gives all her money to a friend, but manages to charm the bus driver, various relief drivers and Willy, a talkative, know-it-all passenger, into letting her ride for free. When the bus stops in Poughkeepsie, Steve and Nita Borden prove to be con artists, selling bibles at inflated prices to those who have lost loved ones recently, claiming they were specially ordered by the deceased. Nita, suspecting what is going on, later chats with Sue and introduces her husband, Steve. A disgusted Sue breaks up with Steve. She then makes a date with the persistent Norman at Niagara Falls. While Norman is getting ready, Murphy steals his clothes, but Norman goes with Sue to see the Falls wearing a raincoat provided by the tour company. When a tour employee demands the raincoat, Norman is shown to have only a bath towel on underneath. Norman arranges a candle-lit dinner for two in Chicago, but Murphy invites all the other passengers. When the bus later has engine trouble, the passengers go to a nearby carnival, where Norman challenges Sue to a bow and arrow contest; the prize, if he wins, is a kiss, but she proves to be a much better shot.

While it is true that cooking does cause chemical changes in food and a loss of some nutrients, it is a clear case of being alert and not alarmed. Every time we cook food, there is some degree of nutrient loss. Exposing food to heat, oxygen or light alters the nutrients found in food. It is not all bad news though because cooking food also has its advantages. Cooking food can increase its digestibility, meaning you will get more nutrients out of it. And even though there may be less of some nutrients from cooking, it is swings and roundabouts as the availability of certain phytonutrients increases. And of course, let’s not forget that heating food kills some of the nasty microbes that can cause food poisoning. The principle behind a raw food diet is that cooking food destroys the natural enzymes and nutrients that would otherwise give us optimal health and control body weight. A raw food diet is almost entirely plant-based and includes fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, grains, vegetable oils and juices in their natural uncooked state. Now on the pro side for a raw food diet, it means if you are currently eating a lot of processed food, then switching to raw food will be a clear nutritional win. So that gets a big tick. Unquestionably, there are many benefits to eating plenty of fruits and vegetables. These foods are high in nutrients and fibre and low in kilojoules. But is raw superior to cooked? A review of 28 research studies found eaters of both cooked and raw vegetables had a lower risk of cancer compared to people who did not eat many vegetables in the first place. Where the science gets murky is the claim that raw food is better because cooking destroys the enzymes found in plants. It is 100 percent correct that cooking will do this. But so too does digestion. Few enzymes survive their trip through the hydrochloric acid spa bath in the stomach. And those plant enzymes are essential only to the plants. The... Question: After cooking vegetables, they are probably: Options: A. less tasty B. more healthy C. not enough information D. less healthy === The correct answer is Answer:","response":"B. more healthy. While cooking can lead to the loss of some nutrients in vegetables, it can also make other nutrients more available for our body to use. This, along with the fact that cooking can kill harmful bacteria and aids in the digestion of food, generally makes cooked vegetables more healthy. The 'loss in nutrients' aspect doesn't necessarily make the vegetables less healthy than their raw counterparts, it only means they might have less of certain nutrients. It's also important to note that the specific effects can vary depending on the cooking method and the particular type of vegetable."},{"question":"Given the following passage \\"During the post-World War I period ski-lifts were built in Swiss and Austrian towns to accommodate winter visitors, but summer tourism continued to be important; by the mid-20th century the popularity of downhill skiing increased greatly as it became more accessible and in the 1970s several new villages were built in France devoted almost exclusively to skiing, such as Les Menuires.

But because of the very specific set of circumstances, I remember exactly how Barend and I became friends. This, of course, was long before he became famous for inventing the easy-foldable map, and infamous for the series of bodies he'd decided to bury in his backyard. Barend and I became friends because he had one of the most attractive shadows I'd ever seen. I remember gazing out over the playground, watching a waning sun scatter its dying light over the monkey bars, the metal skeleton contrasting against the turquoise sky, when I noticed this kid coming toward me. He was one of those mostly invisible characters; faded jeans, dirty jacket, snot caked on his upper lip. I probably wouldn't have noticed him if not for his shadow. For some reason, his shadow immediately caught my eye. Now, I'm not one for noticing shadows in general, never really noticed a shadow before or since, but this kid had the most incredible shadow I'd ever seen. I cannot even put in words what that means. What specific set of properties make an ordinary shadow into an incredible one, I'm not sure anyone can, but his shadow was like a piece of art; I didn't necessarily understand it, but I liked it. And that's why this boring looking kid and I first became friends. Our kindergarten games were harmless and boring, but when puberty hit, Barend began to change. We were both expected to change, but I guess some kids just change more than others. Bared didn't want to kill at first. Like many overachievers in the death game, his first brush with the craft came about more or less accidentally.

To produce a detailed and long answer, more context and information is needed. Here's an example of a more elaborate response: The question seeks to know which additional newspapers have faced accusations of bias. One such example, as mentioned in the statement, is the French newspaper Libération. Libération has reported that it was accused of bias by the Chinese media. To understand the context of this accusation, it's crucial to consider the reporting and portrayal of certain events, such as international relations, politics, or cultural aspects that might have led to the claims of bias. However, Libération is not the only newspaper to have been accused of bias in various instances throughout history. Many newspapers and media outlets around the world have faced similar accusations at times, depending on their editorial stances, ideologies, or ownership. Some noteworthy examples include: 1. The New York Times: The prominent US-based newspaper has often been accused of having a liberal bias in its news content and editorial decisions, especially by conservative-leaning critics and publications. 2. Fox News: On the other side of the spectrum, Fox News, a cable news channel, has been accused of conservative bias in its reporting and analysis by liberal-leaning critics. 3. The Guardian: Based in the United Kingdom, this newspaper has faced accusations of left-leaning bias in its coverage of news events and political commentary. 4. The Daily Mail: Also based in the United Kingdom, this tabloid-style newspaper has been criticized for right-wing bias in its portrayal of news events and opinions. It's important to note that identifying bias in media can often be a subjective process, as it may involve interpreting the intentions behind reporting, selection of news stories, or representation of facts. Nonetheless, keeping an eye out for potential biases in news sources is crucial to maintaining a well-rounded understanding of current events and fostering critical thinking. In conclusion, while the statement about Libération being accused of bias does address the question partially, a thorough answer should encompass a wider range of newspapers including their origins, the nature of the accusations, and the context in which these accusations were made. This broader perspective helps to clarify the answer and provide a richer understanding of media bias in general."},{"question":"Two rivers spring from the same mountain. Olt was a fast moving river, while Mures river was slow moving and deep. Both rivers are very important for the local economies. Which river had a water that contains lower concentrations of dissolved oxygen? The answer to this question is:","response":"The Mures river, which is slow moving and deep, likely contains lower concentrations of dissolved oxygen compared to the fast moving Olt river. In general, fast moving rivers tend to have higher levels of dissolved oxygen due to increased agitation and water circulation, which promotes the absorption of oxygen from the atmosphere. Slow moving, deeper rivers usually have less surface area exposed to the air and lower water circulation, resulting in lower dissolved oxygen concentrations."},{"question":"Premise: \\"A little dog running between yellow poles.\\" Hypothesis: \\"The dog sat inbetween the yellow poles.\\" Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?

Throughout the 360° Tour, the band worked on multiple album projects, including: a traditional rock album produced by Danger Mouse; a dance record produced by RedOne and will.i.am; and Songs of Ascent. However, the latter was not completed to their satisfaction, and by December 2011, Clayton admitted it would not come to fruition. The sessions with Danger Mouse instead formed the foundation of U2's next album, and they worked with him until May 2013 before enlisting the help of producers Paul Epworth, Ryan Tedder, Declan Gaffney, and Flood. The band suspended work on the album late in 2013 to contribute a new song, \\"Ordinary Love\\", to the film Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom. The track, written in honour of Nelson Mandela, won the 2014 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. In November 2013, U2's long-time manager Paul McGuinness stepped down from his post as part of a deal with Live Nation to acquire his management firm, Principle Management. McGuinness, who had managed the group for over 30 years, was succeeded by Guy Oseary. In February 2014, another new U2 song, the single \\"Invisible\\", debuted in a Super Bowl television advertisement and was made available in the iTunes Store at no cost to launch a partnership with Product Red and Bank of America to fight AIDS.

The journey over the hills was a lot less difficult than the trip through the woods, because the","response":"The journey over the hills was a lot less difficult than the trip through the woods, because the journey was on an easy path that made navigating the terrain much smoother and more manageable. When compared to the challenges faced during the trip through the dense and tangled woods, the journey across the open and rolling hills provided a far more tranquil experience for the travelers. The path that snaked its way through the hills was well-trodden and wide enough for travelers to walk comfortably side-by-side. This made communication and companionship during the journey much more enjoyable, as the group was able to share stories, laughter, and conversation with ease. Along this easy path, the travelers were afforded breathtaking and expansive views of the surrounding countryside - a feast for the eyes as well as the heart. In contrast, navigating through the woods presented a myriad difficulties that made the trip far more challenging. The overgrowth of twisted roots and branches made each step precarious, requiring caution and focus just to maintain steady footing. The darkness cast by the trees above meant that sunlight rarely reached the forest floor, casting an eerie ambiance over the trip and dampening the spirits of the travelers. In addition to visual challenges, the dense underbrush obstructed the travelers' path, necessitating frequent detours and the exertion of extra energy to carve a way forward. Animal calls and rustling foliage sounded from all directions, making it difficult to discern friendly wildlife from potential threats. A heightened sense of vigilance was demanded throughout the trip, as challenges and hazards lurked at every turn. Moreover, the woods forced the travelers to confront their inner fears and anxieties, as the unfamiliar and disorienting environment tested each person's mettle in unique ways. Sleep disruption and fatigue exacerbated the physical and emotional strain, making the journey through the woods an ordeal not easily forgotten. All in all, while the trip through the woods offered an adventure filled with excitement, mystery, and untamed beauty, it also served as a stark reminder of the danger and unpredictability of nature. It is in the journey over the hills – with its easy path, open vistas, and calming atmosphere – that the travelers discovered genuine joy, camaraderie, and lasting memories. In comparing the two experiences, it becomes evident just how important the journey's path can be in shaping the overall quality and satisfaction gained from such an expedition."},{"question":"Question: Henry is a naughty boy in Bayern, Germany.

In June the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun, so at any given Northern Hemisphere latitude sunlight falls more directly on that spot than in December (see Effect of sun angle on climate). This effect causes seasons. Over thousands to hundreds of thousands of years, changes in Earth's orbital parameters affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth and influence long-term climate. (See Milankovitch cycles).The uneven solar heating (the formation of zones of temperature and moisture gradients, or frontogenesis) can also be due to the weather itself in the form of cloudiness and precipitation. Higher altitudes are typically cooler than lower altitudes, which the result of higher surface temperature and radiational heating, which produces the adiabatic lapse rate. In some situations, the temperature actually increases with height. This phenomenon is known as an inversion and can cause mountaintops to be warmer than the valleys below. Inversions can lead to the formation of fog and often act as a cap that suppresses thunderstorm development. On local scales, temperature differences can occur because different surfaces (such as oceans, forests, ice sheets, or man-made objects) have differing physical characteristics such as reflectivity, roughness, or moisture content. Dee and Ann were two cousins. Ann lived in a mountain village at 8000 ft altitude, while Dee lived in a coastal town at sea level. Which cousin experienced more thunderstorms?","response":"To determine which cousin experienced more thunderstorms, we will compare the climatic conditions at the two different locations - mountain village at 8000 ft altitude for Ann and coastal town at sea level for Dee. Step 1: Investigate the general atmospheric conditions In general, the higher the altitude, the cooler the temperature due to the adiabatic lapse rate. This means that air temperatures will decrease with an increase in elevation. Mountainous regions also have a higher probability of experiencing temperature inversions, which can suppress thunderstorm development. Step 2: Compare the two locations A mountain village at 8000 ft altitude (Ann's location): - Cooler temperatures due to higher elevation - Possibility of temperature inversions, which can suppress thunderstorm development A coastal town at sea level (Dee's location): - Warmer temperatures due to lower elevation - No significant elevation-based temperature inversions - Proximity to the ocean can contribute to higher moisture content in the air Step 3: Analyze the conditions that lead to thunderstorm formation Thunderstorms often form in areas where there are warm temperatures, moisture, and rising air. Warmer, moist air rises, cools, and condenses, creating clouds and precipitation, often resulting in thunderstorm activity. Step 4: Conclude which cousin experiences more thunderstorms Based on the comparison of the two locations, it is likely that Dee, who lives in the coastal town at sea level, experiences more thunderstorms. This is due to the warmer temperatures and higher moisture content associated with being near the ocean, which helps create more favorable conditions for thunderstorm development. On the other hand, Ann's location in the mountain village at 8000 ft altitude has cooler temperatures and a higher chance of temperature inversions, both of which can suppress thunderstorm formation."},{"question":"Given the stream of consciousness rationale, provide a reasonable question and answer.

Well, now you don't have to. According to AsapScience, a Canada-based video channel that touches on many different science topics, humans will be very different creatures 1,000 years from now. Artificial intelligence, genetic engineering and climate change will work together to change our bodies greatly, according to a video recently published by the channel. We could, for instance, develop red eyes as our DNA changes, and have darker skin because of global warming. The video painted a picture of a future world in which our bodies are part human, part machine. Nanobots, or tiny robots, will be put into our bodies, improving our abilities. \\"No longer will we be limited by our own physiology. We will truly become a mixture of biology and machine on the inside,\\" says the video. Meanwhile, designer babies will cause future generations to grow into intelligent, attractive people. As global warming takes hold, humans will also be skinnier and taller, as this body shape deals with heat better. In fact, Cadell Last, a researcher at the Global Brain Institute located in Belgium, believes change may happen even faster than this. As he said in a paper recently published in Current Aging Science, mankind is already going through a major evolutionary change. In less than four decades, Last claims, we will live longer, have children in old age and need artificial intelligence to finish daily tasks. \\"Your 80 or 100 is going to be so radically different than your grandparents,\\" Last said. Instead of living fast and dying young, he believes humans will live slow and die old. \\"The biological clock isn't going to be around forever,\\" he added, and said that people could pause it for some time using future technology.

On Christmas Eve, the submarine USS Copperfin, under the command of Captain Cassidy, departs San Francisco on a secret mission. At sea, Cassidy opens his sealed orders, which direct him to proceed first to the Aleutian Islands to pick up meteorologist Lt. Raymond, then to Tokyo Bay to obtain vital weather intelligence for the upcoming Doolittle Raid. On the way, two Japanese planes attack; both are shot down, but one pilot manages to parachute into the water. When Mike goes to pick him up, he is stabbed to death. New recruit Tommy Adams shoots the pilot, but because he was slow to react, Tommy blames himself for Mike's death and volunteers to defuse an unexploded bomb stuck under the deck. When Mike is buried at sea, Greek-American \\"Tin Can\\" (Dane Clark) does not attend the service, which angers the other men until he explains that every Allied death causes him great pain. Meanwhile, Raymond, who lived in Japan, discusses how the Japanese people were led into the war by the military faction. As the submarine nears Tokyo Bay, the Copperfin has to negotiate its way through protective minefields and anti-torpedo nets. When a Japanese ship enters the bay, Cassidy follows in its wake. That night, a small party, including the ship's womanizer, \\"Wolf\\" (John Garfield), goes ashore to make weather observations. Meanwhile, Tommy is diagnosed with appendicitis. \\"Pills\\", the pharmacist's mate, has to operate following instructions from a book, using improvised instruments, and without sufficient ether to last throughout the procedure.

The Bears fell behind the Lions after the Bears drive stalled, and Jason Hanson kicked a field goal. Chicago then struck back, with Jay Cutler throwing a swing pass to Earl Bennett, who ran 60 yards for the touchdown; the pass is the longest completion of the season for the Bears. On the eventual kickoff, Joique Bell fumbled, and the Bears scored on a field goal. In the second quarter, Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford fumbled, and the ball was recovered by Julius Peppers, who reached Detroit's 10-yard line, and Matt Forte later scored on a one-yard run. The Bears recorded another takeaway when Tim Jennings intercepted Stafford and returned the pick to Detroit's 23-yard line, and the Bears scored another field goal. Detroit scored the final points of the half on Stafford's 25-yard touchdown pass to Kris Durham to make the score at halftime 20-10 in Chicago's favor. In the second half, the Lions scored again on Stafford's 10-yard touchdown pass to Will Heller. The Bears then had to settle for Olindo Mare kicking another field goal after Cutler failed to connect with Brandon Marshall. Chicago later had to kick another field goal when Cutler again failed to connect with Marshall. The Lions then drew within two points when Stafford threw a nine-yard touchdown pass to Brian Robiskie. However, Detroit would fail to score again and keep Chicago from running out the clock. With the win, Chicago eliminated the New York Giants from playoff contention, but the Bears would also miss the playoffs after the Vikings defeated the Packers 37-34.

Look for bird food that has high quality seeds that are hulled and bound together with supplements that contain vitamins and minerals, such as pellet foods. The average lovebird should have 2-3 teaspoons of pellet or seed based bird food a day. You can also give your bird seed mixes. But keep in mind loose seed mix allows your lovebird to pick and choose what seeds it eats. Nutri-berries, Avi-cakes, and Pellet-berries require your lovebird to work to pry off a piece, so your bird is more likely to get a variety of seeds. Look for seed mixes from your local pet store that contain canary seed, millet, rice, oats, safflower and a small amount of sunflower seeds. Corn is often a big hit with lovebirds, as well as sprouted seed. Pellet foods and seed mixes should be given to your bird on a daily basis, but should not be the only food you give your bird as they do not provide proper nutrition. About 5-10% of your bird’s diet should be bite-sized fruits and vegetables. Give your bird healthy fruits like apples, grapes, berries, papaya, and mango. You should also feed your bird vegetables like carrots, broccoli, zucchini, squash, cooked sweet potatoes, and dark leafy greens like kale and romaine. These include cooked whole grains, like brown rice, whole grain pasta, multigrain breads, and sugar free cereals. When you feed your bird fresh foods, make sure you remove anything in their cage that is uneaten so the food does not spoil. You should also wash the bowls in their cage before using them again. It’s fine if your lovebird shares many of the foods you eat. But limit her consumption of fried, greasy, sugary, and salty foods so she stays healthy. Do not give your bird tap water or unfiltered water. Most cages come with a water attachment so your bird has access to water all the time. These substances can kill your lovebird, even in small amounts. You should also avoid giving your bird avocados, rhubarb, asparagus, onions, raw legumes like beans and peas, and dairy products.","response":"To feed your lovebird, look at the picture on the bird food label to find the right size.

Should I validate this answer? pick from the following. [+] No. [+] Yes. A:","response":"No, the suggested answer does not address the specific question about which RAID levels use striping. Instead, it provides a general overview of RAID and its purpose. The correct answer to the given question should specify the RAID levels that implement striping, such as RAID 0, RAID 1, RAID 5, RAID 6, and RAID 10. RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) is a method to store data in a way that divides and/or replicates it across multiple physical drives in order to improve performance, increase storage capacity, and/or provide data protection against drive failures. Striping is the process of distributing data across multiple drives in small chunks, called \\"stripes,\\" which can boost read and write speeds by leveraging the bandwidth of multiple drives simultaneously. To answer the question \\"what RAID levels use striping?\\", the following RAID levels should be mentioned: 1. RAID 0: This level uses striping without redundancy, providing increased performance, but no data protection. In RAID 0, data is split evenly across the drives in the array, with each drive containing a portion of the total data. 2. RAID 5: This level uses striping with parity, providing a good balance between performance and data protection. In RAID 5, data and parity information are striped across the drives, with parity information used to recover lost data in case of a drive failure. 3. RAID 6: Similar to RAID 5, RAID 6 uses striping with double parity, providing an even higher level of data protection against multiple drive failures. Data and parity information are striped across the drives, with two sets of parity information used to recover lost data in case of up to two drive failures. 4. RAID 10 (also known as RAID 1+0): This level combines the benefits of striping (RAID 0) and mirroring (RAID 1) by creating a striped set of mirrored pairs. Data is both mirrored for protection and striped for improved performance. In conclusion, the suggested answer should not be validated, as it does not address the main question about RAID levels that use striping. Providing the correct information about the RAID levels that use striping will benefit the user by offering a clear and accurate understanding of the subject matter."},{"question":"What is the final step of the following process: - An owl leaves his nest - The owl flys out into the night - The owl looks down at the ground - The owls keen eyesight allows him to see in the dark - The owls sensitive hearing allows him to locate hidden prey - The owl swoops down Answer:","response":"The final step of the following process is: The owl captures its prey with its strong and sharp talons, and consumes it or brings it back to the nest to feed its offspring or mate. After the owl has left its nest, flown out into the night, observed the ground with keen eyesight and sensitive hearing, and finally swooped down, it is ready to snatch its prey in its powerful talons. The owl's stealthy approach, excellent vision, and acute hearing all come to bear in this final moment as it zeroes in on its target. Owls are highly skilled predators, and their ability to capture prey with precision and speed is essential to their survival. As the owl closes in on its prey, it extends its sharp talons, which are equipped with a deadly grip to hold and kill the prey. These talons are specially designed for puncturing and gripping, with curved, razor-sharp nails at the end of each toe. As the owl makes contact with its target, the talons close around it, rapidly subduing and dispatching the prey. If the owl has caught a small prey item, such as an insect or a small mammal like a mouse, it may consume the prey on the spot, tearing it apart with its sharp beak before swallowing it whole. However, if the owl has captured a larger prey item, or if it needs to return to the nest to provide food for its offspring or mate, the owl will maintain its grip on the prey in its talons as it takes flight once again. In some cases, owls may even carry their prey over a significant distance to consume it in a secure location or to store it in a safe place for future consumption. Upon returning to the nest with its catch, the owl may engage in a number of different behaviors, depending on its species and the specific context of its capture. For example, it may share the prey with its mate to strengthen the pair bond or tear off smaller pieces to feed its offspring. Some owl species regurgitate pellets composed of indigestible parts of the prey, like bones and fur, which serve as a means for the owl to dispose of these materials and help maintain a clean nesting environment. In conclusion, the final step of the process outlined above is the owl capturing its prey with its strong and sharp talons and consuming it or bringing it back to the nest to feed its offspring or mate. This crucial step exemplifies the owl's superb hunting skills and represents the culmination of its nocturnal foraging activities."},{"question":"Question: who played the nagus in deep space nine??

Yes or no? Answer: Females weave silk egg-cases, each of which may contain hundreds of eggs. Question: what type of spider has the most eyes Answer:","response":"The type of spider with the most eyes is the Ogre-Faced Spider, also known as Deinopis, which belongs to the Deinopidae family. These spiders are unique among other spiders as they are known to possess a total of eight eyes, with two of these eyes being extremely large in comparison to the others. The larger eyes are highly specialized in night vision, which allows these nocturnal hunters to detect and capture their prey efficiently in the dark. Other spider species typically have six to eight eyes; however, the arrangement and size of the eyes differ significantly. Ogre-Faced Spiders use their excellent night vision to spot passing flies and other small insects and then use their specialized web structure called the \\"net-casting method\\" to capture their prey. They weave a small web and hold it with their four front legs, poised to strike when a potential meal approaches. The large, forward-facing eyes of the Ogre-Faced Spiders are equipped with a superb light-gathering capability, thanks to the large number of light-sensitive cells and the focusing power of the lenses. Their eyes are so sensitive to light that the creatures even have a built-in mechanism to protect their vision during the day. In daylight, a pigment within the cells of their large eyes moves into position, screening out the bright light and preventing any damage. As night falls, the pigment gradually moves away, allowing the eyes to better absorb light and afford the spider extraordinary nocturnal vision. In conclusion, the Ogre-Faced Spider or Deinopis has the most eyes among known spiders, boasting a total of eight eyes with two of them noticeably larger and highly specialized for night vision. This unique adaptation provides them with an advantage in detecting and capturing prey efficiently in low-light conditions."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Endocrinologist An endocrinologist is a medical doctor who specializes in treating disorders of the endocrine glands, hormone systems, and glucose and lipid metabolic pathways. An endocrine surgeon specializes in the surgical treatment of endocrine diseases and glands. Some of the diseases that are managed by endocrinologists: disorders of the pancreas (diabetes mellitus), disorders of the pituitary (gigantism, acromegaly, and pituitary dwarfism), disorders of the thyroid gland (goiter and Graves’ disease), and disorders of the adrenal glands (Cushing’s disease and Addison’s disease). Endocrinologists are required to assess patients and diagnose endocrine disorders through extensive use of laboratory tests. Many endocrine diseases are diagnosed using tests that stimulate or suppress endocrine organ functioning. Blood samples are then drawn to determine the effect of stimulating or suppressing an endocrine organ on the production of hormones. For example, to diagnose diabetes mellitus, patients are required to fast for 12 to 24 hours. They are then given a sugary drink, which stimulates the pancreas to produce insulin to decrease blood glucose levels. A blood sample is taken one to two hours after the sugar drink is consumed. If the pancreas is functioning properly, the blood glucose level will be within a normal range. Another example is the A1C test, which can be performed during blood screening. The A1C test measures average blood glucose levels over the past two to three months by examining how well the blood glucose is being managed over a long time. Once a disease has been diagnosed, endocrinologists can prescribe lifestyle changes and/or medications to treat the disease. Some cases of diabetes mellitus can be managed by exercise, weight loss, and a healthy diet; in other cases, medications may be required to enhance insulin release. If the disease cannot be controlled by these means, the endocrinologist may prescribe insulin injections. In addition to clinical practice, endocrinologists may also be...

Objects that move in uniform circular motion all have an acceleration toward the center of the circle and therefore, they must also suffer a force toward the center of the circle. That force is the centripetal force. For orbiting satellites, such as the moon orbiting the earth or the earth orbiting the sun, the centripetal force is produced by gravity. When an Olympic hammer thrower whirls a massive ball on a chain, the centripetal force is created by the athlete and transmitted by the chain. Paragraph: Adam wants to show his little brother a trick. He gets a bucket of water and says to him \\"I bet i can turn this bucket upside down and no water will fall out\\". His brother doesn't believe him of course. So Adam takes the bucket by the handle and quickly starts spinning it in a circle. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Given Adam stops swinging the bucket, will its centripetal acceleration increase or decrease? The answer is:","response":"When Adam stops swinging the bucket, its centripetal acceleration will decrease. To understand this, let's first look at the concepts involved. Centripetal acceleration is the acceleration experienced by an object moving in a circular path, directed towards the center of the circle. It is mathematically expressed as: a_c = v^2 / r where a_c is the centripetal acceleration, v is the linear or tangential velocity of the object, and r is the radius of the circular path. When Adam is swinging the bucket in a circle, the water inside experiences a centripetal acceleration towards the center of the circular path, which is the result of the centripetal force acting on it. This centripetal force, in this case, is provided by the tension in Adam's arm transmitted through the bucket handle. The centripetal force creates an upward force component that counteracts the force of gravity pulling the water downwards, allowing the water to stay in the bucket even when it is upside down. As Adam stops swinging the bucket, the linear velocity (v) of the water decreases, leading to a reduction in the centripetal acceleration (a_c) as seen from the equation. Without the centripetal acceleration to counteract gravity, the water inside the bucket is no longer \\"pushed\\" against the bottom of the bucket when it is upside down, and thus falls out due to gravity. In conclusion, when Adam stops swinging the bucket, the centripetal acceleration experienced by the water decreases, causing it to respond to the force of gravity without an opposing force, and consequently, the water falls out of the bucket."},{"question":"Question: True crows belong to what group?

Rohrabacher graduated from Palos Verdes High School in Palos Verdes Estates, California, attended Los Angeles Harbor College, and earned a bachelor's degree in history at California State University, Long Beach in 1969. He received his master's degree in American Studies at the University of Southern California. In terms of his positions, Rohrabacher voted to repeal Obamacare, disputes evidence of man-made global warming, is a staunch opponent of illegal immigration, and favors the legalization of marijuana. In foreign policy, he supported withdrawing U.S. troops from Afghanistan, called for Trump to punish Turkish President Erdogan on embassy violence, sided with Russia in the Russia-Georgia war, gave a qualified defense of the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and supports cooperating with Russia in Syria. On May 17, 2017, the Washington Post reported that a month before Donald Trump clinched the Republican nomination, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy stated \\"There's two people I think Putin pays: Rohrabacher and Trump.

Following the ISIS terrorist attacks in Tehran on June 7, 2017, in which 17 innocent civilians were killed, he suggested that the attack could be viewed as 'a good thing', and surmised that President Trump might have been behind the coordination of this terrorist attack. An article in The Atlantic suggested that there was serious concern in the State Department of ties between Rohrabacher and the Russian government. On November 21, 2017, the New York Times reported that Rohrabacher had come under scrutiny from special counsel Robert Mueller and the Senate Intelligence Committee for his close ties to the Kremlin. Rohrabacher has drawn public criticism for some of his positions. His controversial statements include the conspiracy theory claims, first promoted by the politically-biased conspiracy theory website Infowars, that Democrats secretly organized the Unite the Right Rally in Charlottesville to provoke the violence by the alt-right (which led to the murder of one anti-Nazi protester) in order to discredit President Trump.

Thompson's campaign quickly stalled, thanks in no small part to a general perception of apathy on the candidate's part. Comes now Rick Perry, the Texas governor who had seemed genuinely uninterested in running for president before Republicans still unsold on any of their candidates' electability went looking for their conservative savior. As with Perry, little of substance was known of Thompson, and neither underwent the kind of pre-campaign scrutiny devoted to Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton or John McCain. (And, as I've written before, the media limelight should help expose Perry's indifference to a potentially profound injustice in Cameron Todd Willingham's execution). Both Thompson and Perry boosted their poll numbers by flirting with their party's base before making their plans clear; Perry now sits within error-margin distance of front-runner Mitt Romney. Sure, the comparisons are largely superficial. Perry certainly seems not to share Thompson's dispassion (see the photo above). Plus, Thompson lacked the line on his resume about governing a state known for weathering the Great Recession relatively well, while Perry brags about it unceasingly, even though the government he oversees competes with California's dysfunction. Thompson, previously an actor, evoked comparisons to Reagan; Perry, the popular, conservative governor of Texas -- well, you know. Perhaps a more timely cautionary tale for Perry is Newt Gingrich, who already fills the GOP's spot for a marginally engaged candidate.

For this review, I'll choose the movie \\"The Pursuit of Happyness\\". Step 2: Provide a brief synopsis of the film. \\"The Pursuit of Happyness\\" tells the inspiring true story of Chris Gardner, a salesman who becomes homeless with his young son and, through sheer determination, earns a coveted position as a stockbroker. Step 3: Highlight the positive aspects of the movie. In this touching drama, Will Smith delivers a powerful performance as Chris Gardner, fully embodying the resilience and dedication of the real-life entrepreneur. Through his outstanding portrayal, Smith elevates the film to new emotional heights and grippingly showcases the raw humanity of Gardner's journey. Step 4: Emphasize the strong supporting characters and performances. Jaden Smith portrays Gardner's son, Christopher, with maturity beyond his years. The on-screen chemistry between real-life father and son, Will and Jaden, resonates with authenticity. Their heartwarming connection creates a moving and memorable portrayal of the struggle of single parenthood. Additionally, Thandie Newton gives a realistic and nuanced performance as Gardner's estranged wife, Linda. Step 5: Praise the direction and cinematography. Director Gabriele Muccino masterfully translates the emotion and passion of the story onto the big screen, creating a film that stays with viewers long after the credits roll. The cinematography by Phedon Papamichael effectively captures the essence of San Francisco in the 1980s, providing a vivid and immersive backdrop for the audience.

Adam's doctor made this suggestions: stop drinking coffee altogether. When Adam got up on October 3, he began his day without his morning coffee. By 11:00 a.m., Adam was in a terrible mood . He was tired and had a headache. At 11:30, he had a meeting with his student advisor. In the meeting, he found it almost impossible to continue. What was going on? Caffeine, a chemical found in coffee, was most likely the reason for how Adam felt. Caffeine is a stimulant that boosts energy levels and improves concentration- but only for a short time.

I was sent to court and found guilty based on no evidence by a magistrate court judge who was later struck off for corruption after defrauding an old lady of over a million pounds! I was not put in prison for this minor offense but did receive a minor criminal record. This criminal records the same DJ’s and bent ex-police have used to ruin my reputation and career. One of the bent policemen, who incidentally had already been thrown out of the police force for car insurance fraud, even turned up at the uni I went to and spread vicious slander to ruin me there, and in the area that I lived at the time. I was then victimised by the people at the famous college that I went to and all my intellectual and copyright works stolen. Which I note, generated millions for others. Once they made their money and gained credibility on the back of my hard work, innovation and some may say genius, the thieves then did all they could to ruin my reputation in the entertainment industry and in the area that I live.

It was written and directed by Jarrett Schaefer, based on the book Let Me Take You Down by Jack Jones, produced by Robert Salerno, and stars Jared Leto as Chapman. The film takes place in December 1980, and is intended to be an exploration of Chapman's psyche. Its title is a reference to J. D. Salinger's novel The Catcher in the Rye, which has twenty-six chapters, and suggests a continuation of the book. The script took Schaefer four years to write, but when it was finished, the film came together quickly. With the help of producers Alexandra Milchan and Robert Salerno, Schaefer cast Jared Leto as Mark David Chapman. For his role, Leto gained 67 pounds (30 kg) by drinking microwaved pints of ice cream mixed with soy sauce and olive oil every night. Gaining the weight, he said, was tougher than dieting himself into skeletal shape for his role as drug addict Harry Goldfarb in Requiem for a Dream (2000). The abruptness of Leto's weight gain gave him gout. He had to use a wheelchair due to the stress of the sudden increase in weight put on his body. After the shooting of the film, Leto quickly went on a liquid diet. He explained, \\"I've been fasting ever since. I've been doing this very strange, like, lemon and cayenne pepper and water fast. I didn't eat any food for 10 days straight; I think I lost 20 pounds that first 10 days.\\" Losing the excess weight after Chapter 27 proved a challenge. \\"It took about a year to get back to a place that felt semi-normal,\\" he said; \\"I don't know if I'll ever be back to the place I was physically. I'd never do it again; it definitely gave me some problems.\\" Twenty-two years prior to this film's production, actor Mark Lindsay Chapman, while professionally using the name Mark Lindsay, had been almost cast as John Lennon in the biopic John and Yoko: A Love Story (1985). Yoko Ono had been deeply involved in the production and had herself been initially impressed with his audition and approved his casting prior to discovering his full name was Mark Lindsay Chapman. She then nixed his casting on the grounds it was \\"bad karma\\", and a great deal of press attention was given to his having almost gotten the role. The director of Chapter 27, Jarrett Schaefer, auditioned many Lennon impersonators, but was especially impressed with Mark Lindsay Chapman's tape because he conveyed the \\"tough town\\" street-smart quality of Lennon that the impersonators failed to convey, as they always played Lennon as larger-than-life. Schaefer described Lennon as having a \\"chip on his shoulder and always cracking these cynical one-liners\\", and felt that actor Chapman was best at conveying this quality. Schaefer had some difficulty negotiating the casting with the film's producers because of Chapman's name. After Chapman was cast, he asked Chapman how he should be billed to which Chapman replied \\"Mark fucking Lindsay Chapman. That's my fucking name.\\" Schaefer remarks that this was so reflective of how Lennon talked, it just reinforced his sense that Chapman was right for the part.

He certainly does not \\"attribute it to a speech where it was not uttered\\" and, as noted above, doing so twice would make no sense whatsoever if Moore was the mastermind deceiver that his critics claim he is. Concerning the Georgetown Hoya interview where Heston was asked about Rolland, you write: \\"There is no indication that [Heston] recognized Kayla Rolland's case.\\" This is naive to the extreme -- Heston would not be president of the NRA if he was not kept up to date on the most prominent cases of gun violence. Even if he did not respond to that part of the interview, he certainly knew about the case at that point.

After the revelation by Dan Petrescu that he was offered the job and refused it, the Forest ownership must act quickly to secure an appropriate manager that can lead the team to success and promotion in the Championship. The Forest board, keen to mitigate the damage caused by the alleged failed negotiations with Petrescu, decides to expand their search and consider a wider array of candidates. Over the next few weeks, the club undergoes a comprehensive selection process, transparently communicating updates and developments with their fans. During this time, various names circulate in the media as potential candidates, including the likes of Nigel Clough, Shaun Derry, and even Gary Rowett. The Forest board, however, is determined to choose a candidate who not only fits the club's requirements but is also well-received by the fans. They eventually engage in negotiations with Harry Redknapp, former manager of Tottenham Hotspur and Queens Park Rangers. The veteran coach, with a wealth of experience in the English leagues, seems like a strong and reliable option to help the club gain promotion. Upon announcing Redknapp's appointment as Nottingham Forest's new manager, reactions among fans are largely positive. Supporters welcome the experienced manager with open arms, hoping that he’ll bring stability and success to the team. Harry, in turn, expresses his excitement and motivation to work with Forest and help them reach their full potential. The first half of the season proves challenging as Redknapp tries to implement his style and tactics at the City Ground. Results are inconsistent, but glimpses of brilliance and teamwork show that the squad is adapting to the new system. During the January transfer window, Redknapp is given the necessary funds to bring in players that will strengthen the line-up and fill crucial gaps. Post-January, Nottingham Forest find their rhythm and begin to climb the Championship rankings. A collective effort from the players, management, and fans alike sees the club push towards a playoff spot. The positive atmosphere around the City Ground provides momentum, and the team’s performances exceed expectations as they make a dash for the top of the table. In the last few games of the season, Forest’s fate is hanging in the balance to secure promotion to the Premier League. The final game of the season becomes the most important event of the year, billed as the most significant match in the club's recent history. The players, inspired by the unwavering support of their fans and confident in Redknapp’s guidance, deliver a stunning performance and clinch the victory they need to secure promotion. As the final whistle blows, the City Ground erupts with sheer joy and overwhelming emotions. Nottingham Forest, led by Harry Redknapp and against all odds, achieves promotion to the Premier League. The club's tenacity and resilience in overcoming adversity are rewarded, and the entire city comes together to celebrate this fantastic achievement. Dan Petrescu’s refusal of the Nottingham Forest job becomes a distant memory, overshadowed by the club's new era of success under Redknapp's management."},{"question":"This is some data: Abner (footballer), currentclub, Real Madrid Castilla; Real Madrid Castilla, manager, Luis Miguel Ramis; Abner (footballer), club, Brazil national under-20 football team; Abner (footballer), club, Coritiba Foot Ball Club.

Article: Every autumn, as families across the United States get ready to send their kids to college, the economics of higher education receive renewed attention. College is expensive and becoming more so in the U. S. The situation raises two questions: Why does it cost so much, and how can students and their families afford it? Several studies published in the past few weeks reflect on these questions. The findings provide comfort to poor families. First, it appears that only the minority actually pay the \\"high price\\". A study by the US Education Department's National Center for Education Statistics found that 55 percent of college students last year received some forms of help--scholarships, loans or jobs. Other factors are also at work. The government has increased the size of its grants to lower-income students. Grants, unlike loans, don't have to he repaid and are awarded only to college students who have not earned a bachelor's or professional degree. At the same time, most colleges are spending more on undergraduate education than they are collecting in tuition fees. A study, which is part of the Williams College Project on the Economics of Higher Education, reaches the conclusion that on average colleges \\"subsidize \\" their students. The results of these studies, however, leave unanswered the questions of whether educational costs are higher than they need to be. Some experts argue that much of the college cost results from educational competition for fame, students and facilities. This puts upward pressure on tuition, hut many colleges feel that good fame will enable them to attract students even if they charge them more. Therefore, until something important changes in the marketplace, costs seem likely to continue rising. And American families will continue to beat down the doors of the high price \\"college in the end.

Cage reluctantly agrees when Gibbons offers to wipe his criminal record. Cage goes to Prague and meets with the NSA support team including Czech agent Milan Sova. While scouting an Anarchy 99 party, Cage purposely reveals Sova's cover, which allows him to gain the confidence of Anarchy 99's leader, Yorgi.

While silicone works best on fresh scars, it can also soften and reduce the appearance of older scars. For the best results, cover your scar with silicone gel or a silicone sheet for 8-24 hours a day over the course of several months. You can buy silicone gel or silicone scar sheets at most pharmacies. You can also order these treatments online. A variety of over-the-counter creams and ointments are available on the market that may be able to help reduce the appearance of scars. Follow the ingredients on the packaging carefully and talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions or concerns. Look for ointments that include ingredients such as: Retinol creams. These are particularly effective for treating acne scars. Glycolic acid. This ingredient has also been shown to be effective for reducing acne scars, especially when combined with retinoic acid. Protective or moisturizing ingredients, such as oxybenzone (a sunblock), petroleum jelly, or paraffin. Chemical peels can be helpful for scars that are not too thick or deep, such as acne scars or chicken pox scars. Ask your doctor or dermatologist about getting a medical peel done in their office. You can also buy over-the-counter peels that you can use at home. Over-the-counter peels are not usually as effective as peels done by a medical professional, but they may help reduce the appearance of light scaring. Peels containing glycolic acid or salicylic-mandelic acid may be particularly effective. If you have a deep or indented scar, a soft-tissue filler may help reduce its appearance. For this treatment, your doctor or dermatologist will inject a soft substance, such as fat or hyaluronic acid, into the tissue under the scar to fill it in. Talk to your doctor about whether this treatment might be right for you. Fillers are a temporary solution since the injected substance breaks down after a while. You may need to repeat this treatment once every 6 months. Much like chemical peels, dermabrasion is typically used to give skin a smoother surface. This treatment involves the use of a motorized wire brush. Your surgeon will use the brush to safely wear down scar tissue. The procedure is typically quick, but you will be awake and may experience some discomfort. Your doctor may ask you to stop taking certain medications, such as aspirin and some skin care products, before the procedure. You should also avoid smoking for as long as possible both before and after the procedure. As you recover from dermabrasion, protect your skin by wearing sunscreen, cleaning the area regularly, and using ointments as recommended by your doctor to promote healing. While laser treatments can’t actually get rid of a scar, they can seriously reduce its appearance and improve other complications associated with scar tissue, such as pain, itching, and stiffness. If you have a severe scar, ask your doctor about getting light or laser therapy. The effectiveness of this treatment will depend on a lot of factors, including any medical conditions you have and any medications you are currently taking. Give your doctor or dermatologist detailed information about your health before attempting laser therapy. Follow your doctor’s home care instructions carefully to maximize the effectiveness of the treatment. For example, you’ll need to protect the area from the sun after the treatment until it fully heals. If you have a bothersome scar and other treatments aren’t working, talk to your doctor about surgical treatment options. With surgery, scars can be thinned, shortened, disguised, or even hidden in places like wrinkles and hairlines. If you choose to get surgical revision for a scar, it’s important to keep your expectations realistic. This treatment may not completely eliminate the scar, and you may also need multiple procedures in order to get the best results. Not all scars are good candidates for surgical correction. Ask your doctor, dermatologist, or plastic surgeon if this treatment is a good option for you. Scar revision surgery works best on scars that are at least 12-18 months old. In this procedure, your surgeon will take a small piece of normal, healthy skin and use it to replace your scar tissue. They will cut away the scarred tissue and graft the healthy skin into its place. Ask your doctor if a punch graft is appropriate for your type of scar. The skin for the graft is typically taken from behind your ear lobe. You may need a resurfacing treatment a few weeks after the surgery to correct any differences in color and texture between the grafted skin and the skin around it. Follow your doctor’s care instructions for treating your skin both before and after the surgery for the best results. In cryosurgery, your doctor will inject liquid nitrogen into the scar to freeze the scar tissue. This will cause the tissue to die and eventually fall off. You will need to treat the resulting wound carefully to ensure that it heals properly. It may take several weeks for the scar tissue to come off, and several more weeks for the area to heal. Follow your doctor’s home care instructions carefully. They will show you how to dress the wound and keep it clean. Your doctor will probably also provide medications to help you manage any pain during and after the treatment. Cryosurgery may affect your skin color or pigmentation. These steroid injections help shrink and flatten tough scars. They are especially good at reducing hypertrophic scars and keloids, which are scars that result from an overly aggressive healing process. In most cases, you’ll need to get cortisone injections every 4 or 6 weeks until the treatment takes effect. Ask your doctor if this treatment is a good option for you. Cortisone injections often work best when combined with other treatments, such as cryosurgery. Your doctor may combine the steroid injection with a local anesthetic to reduce pain. Cortisone injections could possibly lead to skin atrophy, skin ulcers, as well as hypo- or hyperpigmentation. What is a summary of what this article is about?","response":"The article reviews various treatments to reduce the appearance of different types of scars. Silicone gel or sheeting is suggested as a useful home treatment, with application recommended for 8-24 hours a day over several months. Other over-the-counter options include creams and ointments with ingredients like retinol and glycolic acid. Chemical peels and soft-tissue fillers provide alternatives for lighter scars and deep or indented scars respectively. More invasive procedures such as dermabrasion, laser therapies, and surgery are also discussed, each with their own set of pre- and post-treatment considerations.

Fortunately, there are devices such as Geiger counters that can detect radiation. A Geiger counter, like the one pictured in the Figure below , contains atoms of a gas that is ionized if it encounters radiation. When this happens, the gas atoms change to ions that can carry an electric current. The current causes the Geiger counter to click. The faster the clicks occur, the higher the level of radiation. You can see a video about the Geiger counter and how it was invented at the URL below. Paragraph: Keith landed a job with the EPA. As part of his training he needed to learn how the Geiger counter works. To learn more about the counter he tested it in three different locations, location A, location B, and location C. Location A had very high radiation; location B had low radiation; and location C didn't have any radiation. Keith learned how the counter works in locations with varying degrees of radiation. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: In which location the counter gas would be ionized, location B or location C? Answer:","response":"In the given paragraph, location B had low radiation while location C had no radiation. Since the Geiger counter's gas is ionized when it encounters radiation, the counter gas would be ionized in location B, where there is low radiation present."},{"question":"Premise: \\"It also became a prime base for missionary activity, with its succession of devout followers of different faiths the Franciscans, Augustinians, Dominicans, and the Jesuits which held them in line along with a rigorous Inquisition most notably led by Francis Xavier, who came to Goa in the year 1542.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"The Jesuits actually held very few devout followers.\\"?","response":"If the given premise is accurate, it provides information that contradicts the hypothesis \\"The Jesuits actually held very few devout followers.\\" To analyze this, let's break down the key points in the premise: 1. Goa became a prime base for missionary activity. 2. The religious orders involved in this missionary activity included the Franciscans, Augustinians, Dominicans, and Jesuits. 3. These religious orders had a succession of devout followers. 4. There was also a rigorous Inquisition, most notably led by Francis Xavier, who came to Goa in the year 1542. The premise describes Goa as a crucial hub for religious missionary work and establishes connections between different religious orders, including the Jesuits, maintaining a presence in the region lined with devout followers. This suggests that the Jesuits, like the other religious orders mentioned, had significant influence in the area and played a vital role in the missionary effort. The hypothesis \\"The Jesuits actually held very few devout followers\\" contradicts the information provided in the premise. The premise clearly indicates that the Jesuits, along with the other religious orders, held a succession of devout followers in Goa, where they were actively involved in the Inquisition led most notably by Francis Xavier. Moreover, the Jesuits' presence in such an important missionary setting implies that they had a considerable number of followers. The premise describes a rigorous Inquisition led by Francis Xavier, who was a Jesuit himself, further validating that the Jesuits not only attracted followers but also exercised leadership in the religious affairs of the region. In conclusion, the premise provides evidence that the Jesuits had a substantial number of devout followers, playing a significant role in the missionary activities and the Inquisition in Goa. This information directly refutes the hypothesis \\"The Jesuits actually held very few devout followers.\\" Based on the premise provided, the hypothesis does not hold true."},{"question":"Given the rationale, provide a reasonable question and answer. Step-by-step reasoning process: The game almost finished can not be determined by a penalty shot. The question and answer:","response":"Question: Can the outcome of a game be significantly influenced by a single penalty shot taken towards the end of the match? Answer: Yes, the outcome of a game can be significantly influenced by a single penalty shot taken towards the end of the match. It depends on the score at that time and how much time is remaining in the game. If the scores are close or tied, and the penalty shot is either successful or unsuccessful, it could potentially change the result of the game. However, if there is a significant point difference between the teams or very little time is left, then the impact of the penalty shot might be minimal."},{"question":"Build a movie plot around this: Em is surprised to learn what about James?

Review: After the departure of sideman instrumentalist David Galas, who contributed significantly to their previous two albums _Cold_ and _The Burning Circle And Then Dust_, Lycia are now just Mike and Tara. Tara has taken up some of the slack, although not in the same capacity; her swooning, blissful lyrics and vocals lead more than half of the songs, up from 3 on _Cold_ and just 2 on _Burning Circle_.

Question: Who does the government help with schools? Options: A. school children B. parents C. get money D. require to pay taxes E. take money A:","response":"The government helps with schools primarily to provide education to a broad range of individuals in the community, which includes school children, parents, and even educators. The primary option that aligns with common sense in terms of the direct beneficiaries of governmental assistance in education is option A: school children. However, it is important to acknowledge that multiple stakeholders play a role in the educational landscape, and the other options can also be closely related to the question. Option A - School Children: School children are the primary beneficiaries of governmental help with schools. This assistance is provided as a means to ensure that every child has access to an education that will enable them to acquire knowledge, skills, and competencies necessary to foster personal and societal development. Government-funded schools aim to maintain a certain level of educational quality, offering children an opportunity to thrive academically and develop essential life skills. Option B - Parents: Although school children are the primary focus of the government's efforts in education, parents also benefit indirectly from assistance provided by the government. Publicly-funded schools relieve parents of the financial responsibility attached to private schooling, ensuring that their children have access to education regardless of their financial means. Parents can also benefit from resources and support services provided to them as a means of promoting positive parenting practices and engagement in their children's education. Option C - Get Money: The government may provide funding to education through taxes, grants, and other sources aimed at improving the quality of education and resources available to schools. This funding helps both public and private schools, ultimately benefiting all students regardless of socioeconomic status. Option D - Require to Pay Taxes: Taxes are an essential part of funding education. All citizens are required to pay taxes, and a portion of these funds is allocated to support public education. By paying taxes, citizens contribute to the well-being and development of their community by ensuring that every child has access to the resources necessary for academic and personal growth. Option E - Take Money: The government does not take money directly from schools. However, it needs to oversee and manage the allocation of funds to public schools to ensure the fair distribution of resources and to prioritize investments in line with national and regional educational needs. In conclusion, the government helps with schools to primarily benefit school children, who are at the core of everything related to education. Still, it is also necessary to recognize and consider the various stakeholders involved in education, including parents, taxpayers, and educators, who all contribute to and benefit in different ways from governmental support in this area."},{"question":"You are presented with the quiz \\"What can be water vapor condensing in air be a hindrance to?\\" But you don't know the answer, so you turn to your teacher to ask for hints. He says that \\"fog is formed by water vapor condensing in the air\\" and \\"fog When driving, fog is an obstacle or a hindrance that makes things obscure\\". So, what's the best answer to the question? Answer:","response":"Based on the hints provided by the teacher, the best answer to the question \\"What can be water vapor condensing in air be a hindrance to?\\" is visibility while driving or engaging in various activities that require a clear line of sight. When water vapor condenses in the air, it can form fog, which is a thick cloud of tiny water droplets suspended in the atmosphere near the Earth's surface. Fog can significantly reduce visibility, making it harder for people to see clearly over short distances. This reduced visibility can be especially dangerous when driving, as it makes it difficult to see other vehicles, pedestrians, and obstacles, increasing the likelihood of accidents. Additionally, fog can be a hindrance to other activities that require clear visibility, such as aviation, boating, and outdoor sports events. It can even have a negative impact on wildlife, as it can disorient birds and other animals that rely on their sense of sight for navigation. In summary, water vapor condensing in the air can be a hindrance to driving and other activities that require clear visibility by forming fog, which reduces visibility and can lead to dangerous, obscure conditions."},{"question":"Q: Title: What an ugly doll!

Julia Stafford, 20, a University of British Columbia student, smartly played dead after the bear knocked her - and a male colleague - over and on to the ground. Attacked: Julia Stafford was working for a Canadian mining company in Alaska when she - and a male colleague - were attacked by a grizzly bear. 'It bit my hand and kind of dragged me 20 feet over the rocks and just left me,' Stafford told The Fairbanks Daily News-Miner from her hospital bed while ironically holding - you guessed it - a teddy bear. 'I was worried I was going to die briefly, but it was fine once she let me go and ran away...It happened really quick.' The hair-raising encounter reportedly occurred about 1:30 p.m. Sunday afternoon - just two days after another grizzly bear ate a hiker in Denali National Park and Preserve. Dangerous Encounter: Stafford was reportedly dragged some 20 feet by the beast after it knocked her over - and then just as suddenly meandered away. It happened when Stafford and Kerry - his last name was not available - were collecting rock samples in the rain near a foggy ravine for Pure Nickel Inc., a Canadian company. 'The bear sort of walked out of the fog and it had two cubs with it,' Stafford told the News-Miner. 'We started walking uphill to get away from it and it started walking toward us. 'We stopped once we saw it was following us and tried to get the bear spray out but by then it was already running toward us. Striking Twice: The attack on Stafford and her colleague came only two days after hiker Richard White of San Diego was eaten by a bear in Denali National Park and Preserve. 'I was wearing gloves and they were wet and it was confusing,' she reportedly added. 'There was just not enough time to get the bear spray out.' Stafford, a geological engineering student, suffered cuts to her right hand and scratch marks on her back that required stitches. She told the News-Miner she will need surgery for a broken bone in her hand, as well. The attack happened two days after a lone backpacker in Denali was killed by another grizzly bear that has since been fatally shot by an Alaskan state trooper. It was the first fatal bear mauling in the park's 95-year history, officials have said. Richard White, 49, of San Diego was killed after he brazenly violated the quarter-mile berth that hikers at the park are required to give bears. During that incident, officials said, White spent eight minutes taking photos of his killer from a range of about 50 yards before the bear turned and attacked.

During lunch the employees had to eat the salads instead of the sandwiches because the Choose from: [A]. salads were stale.. [B]. sandwiches were stale..","response":"B. Sandwiches were stale. During lunch, the employees had to eat the salads instead of the sandwiches because the sandwiches were stale. The sandwiches were supposed to be a simple yet delicious meal option for the employees, but it seemed that something had gone wrong in the sandwich preparation process. As the taste and quality of a sandwich depend on the freshness of its ingredients, it had become inevitable for the employees to opt for salads instead. The lack of quality in the sandwiches raised several questions about the caterer's attention to detail and the supply chain management. Stale bread and other ingredients not only negatively affect the overall taste of the sandwich, but they can also lead to potential health problems if consumed. In light of this issue, the employees decided to take matters into their own hands and started discussing alternative lunch options that would ensure a more satisfactory dining experience. They began researching different caterers in the area, looking for one that had consistently positive reviews and demonstrated a commitment to delivering quality meals. The employees understood that choosing between a variety of options was essential for maintaining a healthy diet, and they couldn't risk that aspect of their health by relying on a caterer who couldn't guarantee the freshness of the food. During the next company meeting, the employees brought up their concerns about the stale sandwiches. The management, too, acknowledged the severity of the issue and promised to investigate the matter. They decided to conduct a thorough vendor evaluation, focusing on aspects such as the quality of the ingredients, price, customer service, and overall reliability. In parallel, the importance of proper food storage in the office kitchen was also underlined. The employees suggested investing in airtight containers to keep the sandwiches and other foods fresh, as well as implementing a system of labeling the food items with their respective expiration dates. These solutions would not only ensure the freshness of the food, but also allow the employees to consume their meals without constantly worrying about the risks associated with eating stale products. To further reduce the reliance on the caterer, some employees started to bring home-cooked meals to work, and even proposed hosting occasional potlucks where everyone could bring a dish to share. This initiative promoted a sense of community and collaboration among the staff while also guaranteeing that the food was fresh, delicious, and catered to various dietary preferences. After several weeks of research and careful consideration, a new catering company was selected to provide the office's meals. The new caterer met the high standards set by the employees and had a reputation for delivering top-notch food and exceptional customer service. As soon as the employees started enjoying their fresh, satisfying sandwiches and various meal options, they realized that every inconvenience they had faced with stale sandwiches had led to a positive outcome. The office's lunch experience had become a representation of teamwork and commitment to looking out for each other's well-being. The employees understood that criticism and constructive feedback were crucial for growth, and by tackling the issue of stale sandwiches, they had learned to take initiative, communicate effectively, and continuously strive for improvement."},{"question":"On a scale of 1-5 (with 1 being least favorable and 5 being most favorable), how would you rate this review? \\"Awesome Best\\" The answer to this question is:","response":"2"},{"question":"Does the following sentence make sense? \\"Many who love the Star Trek series also revere Gene Roddenberry.\\" Options: - yes - no Step-by-step reasoning process:","response":"Yes, the sentence makes sense.

The Queen's son flew out of the UK on a private jet for talks with billionaire despot Ilham Aliyev, who has been repeatedly accused of appalling human rights abuses. It is understood that the royal will stay in the capital, Baku, until Sunday and his 'private' four-day trip includes at least one face to face meeting with the leader. When visiting Azerbaijan Andrew is known as 'the dear guest'. Close ties: Prince Andrew and Azerbaijan president Ilham Aliyev during one of their meetings in 2009. His visit was not publicised in the list of official royal engagements in advance and last night Buckingham Palace would only say: 'By long standing convention we do not confirm or comment on private travel by members of the Royal Family.' However it is understood that taxpayers are not being forced to foot the bill for the jolly, aside from the cost of security. Details of the trip only emerged after a British Government source tipped off the pressure group, Platform, which campaigns against social and environmental abuses associated with the energy industry. Its spokesman, Emma Hughes, accused the prince of having a 'cosy relationship' with President Aliyev and demanded to know in what capacity he was visiting Azerbaijan. Andrew was forced to give up his globe-trotting royal role as a UK trade envoy in 2011 after years of public criticism. While his efforts were lauded by some respected names in the business community, he was also repeatedly accused of wasting taxpayers' money on chartering costly private jets and helicopters - including £387,000 in his last few months in the job. Some of his business trips were also noted to coincide with golfing trips or private holidays. The prince also faced scrutiny over claims he was 'cashing in' on connections he had developed through his role including the sale of his Berkshire home for £15 million - £3million over the asking price - to the son-in-law of the controversial Kazakhstan president, a personal friend and goose hunting partner. The final nail in the coffin was the furore over his close friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, a billionaire US financier who was convicted and jailed for soliciting prostitution from underage girls. The pair were photographed together in New York after Epstein had been released from prison. During his decade as the UK's Special Representative for Trade and Industry he also forged a close relationship with the President of Azerbaijan, an oil and gas-rich former Soviet state. The Duke of York speaking at World Economic Forum in Baku, Azerbaijan, at the dinner hosted by Mr Aliyev. Officially, he has now met with him on 12 occasions, although it is believed that he has also enjoyed numerous private encounters too. In June 2009 Andrew spent an estimated £60,000 of public money on chartering a luxury private jet for a three-day visit. And in November 2012 the Mail revealed how the prince had even made a covert stop-off to visit the president en route to an official tour of the Middle East. On another earlier stay he was reported to have visited a luxury spa owned by President Aliyev, which employs a blind Russian masseur described as having the best hands in the world. And in 2013 this newspaper also revealed that Andrew had been given a valuable ornamental sword and a box of caviar by Aliyev when was guest of honour at his dinner table. The Prince is also friendly with the president's wife Mehriban, and her two glamorous daughters, one of whom, Leyla, is married to the son of a Russian oligarch and lives in a penthouse overlooking Hyde Park in London. The disclosures have added to the disquiet over the prince's relationships with the leaders of dubious regimes, as Azerbaijan is considered to be one of the most corrupt countries in the world. The regularity of his visits have also led media in the former Soviet state to speculate that the Queen's son may have business links to the oil-rich state, including a golf resort on the Caspian Sea. Buckingham Palace has vehemently denied this. News of his latest trip has attracted condemnation from pressure groups concerned by Azerbaijan's appalling human rights record. Aliyev, who inherited the presidency from his father, has been accused of torturing his political opponents, rigging elections and curtailing media freedom. Last October presidential elections were held in the country which saw 143 political campaigners jailed. Videos also emerged of ballot boxes allegedly being stuffed by regime supporters. Prince Andrew is not the only high profile British figure who has close links with the Aliyev regime. This August it was announced that Tony Blair is being paid to advise the Azerbaijani government and several oil companies - including BP - on the PR challenges they face in building the Euro-Caspian Mega Pipeline, a huge gas infrastructure that will run from Azerbaijan to Italy. Emma Hughes, Energy Campaigner at campaign group Platform said: 'It's shameful that both Prince Andrew and Tony Blair are so chummy with the Azerbaijani autocrat. 'There are hundreds of brave people in Azerbaijan fighting for democracy, yet our representatives are more concerned with caviar and gas deals.'","response":"Prince Andrew has faced international criticism after secretly flying out to meet Azerbaijan's controversial president, Ilham Aliyev.

Title: Porky's Movie plot: A group of Florida high school students plan on losing their virginity. They go to Porky's, a nightclub out in the Everglades, believing that they can hire a prostitute to satisfy their sexual desires. Porky takes their money but humiliates the kids by dumping them in the swamp. When the group demands their money back, the sheriff, who turns out to be Porky's brother, arrives to drive them away, but not before his minions extort the rest of their money and cause them more embarrassment. After Mickey (who returned to Porky's for revenge) is beaten so badly he has to be hospitalized, the gang becomes hellbent on exacting revenge on Porky and his brother, eventually succeeding in sinking his establishment in the swamp. Porky and his men, joined by the sheriff, chase after the group, but they make it across the county line (out of Porky's brother's jurisdiction), where they are met by a group of the local police officers, one of whom is Mickey's older brother Ted, and the high school band. After Ted repeatedly damages Porky's car, he says that all charges against Porky for driving an unsafe vehicle will be dropped if the night's events are forgiven. Because the boys were too young to be legally allowed in Porky's in the first place, Porky and his brother have no choice but to agree. The film ends with the group getting their revenge and Pee Wee finally losing his virginity. In a subplot, the boys also peep on female students in their locker room shower. After (apparently) several unsuccessful attempts, Tommy, Billy and Pee Wee finally see several girls showering, but Pee Wee gives them away when he shouts at a particularly fat girl (who has been blocking his view) to move so he can see. While a few girls run out, most stay, finding the situation funny. To test their attitude, Tommy sticks his tongue out through his peephole, but gets it smeared with soap. Infuriated, he drops his pants and sticks his penis through the opening just before female coach Beulah Balbricker (who has a running feud with Tommy) walks...

When their children use the same swing set, Sarah and Brad have an opportunity to talk to one another, titillating the other women. But when they, on a lark, hug and kiss, the women immediately take their children out of the park and refuse to associate with Sarah anymore.Both Brad and Sarah have unhappy home lives. Brad has yet to pass the Massachusetts state bar exam and doesn't even want to be a lawyer. However, his bossy wife, Kathy (Jennifer Connelly), pushes him to succeed. She makes documentaries for public television for a living. They live a bit beyond their means, forcing them to accept financial support from Kathy's mother. Their sex life is non-existent because Kathy is too self-involved in her career and being a mother.

In a Facebook post, law enforcement officials said they were involved in an \\"ongoing riot.\\" (Zoeann Murphy,McKenna Ewen/The Washington Post) Tensions over the Dakota Access oil pipeline flared again Sunday when North Dakota law enforcement used water cannons to disperse a group of about 400 protesters trying to move past a barricaded bridge toward construction sites for the project. As temperatures in Cannon Ball, N.D., dropped into the 20s, police in riot gear sprayed activists with a hose mounted atop an armored vehicle and formed a line to prevent them from advancing up the road, according to the Bismarck Tribune. Protesters also reported being pelted with rubber bullets, tear gas and concussion grenades during the standoff, which lasted until late Sunday night. A grainy Facebook Live video from the scene shows throngs of people gathered around the Backwater Bridge on Highway 1806, with flood lights shining down on the grass and road below and a haze of smoke and water vapor rising near police vehicles. The clashes began around 6 p.m., when protesters tried to remove burned out trucks that had been blocking the bridge since authorities and activists faced off there in late October. Police have since set up wire and concrete barriers on the bridge, which is about a mile south of where the pipeline developer plans to drill. Protesters, who call themselves “water protectors,” have argued that the barricade prevents emergency services from reaching the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation and a nearby camp they have used as a staging ground for demonstrations. The protest of an oil pipeline that is being constructed close to the Standing Rock Indian reservation has become a rallying point for Native Americans across the United States. Here's what you need to know. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post) Authorities responded after protesters moved one of the trucks blocking the roadway. The Morton County Sheriff’s Department said that by 8:30 p.m. an estimated 400 people had arrived to try to “breach” the bridge and had set dozens of fires in the area. The department called the situation an “ongoing riot,” saying protesters were “very aggressive” and were trying to “flank and attack the law enforcement line.” At least one person was arrested, the sheriff’s department said. One of the protest organizers, Dallas Goldtooth, said protesters started small fires in the area to help warm people who had been sprayed with water in the freezing cold. He told the Tribune that some activists tried to remove the burned out trucks to expose the heavily armed authorities behind them. “Folks have a right to be on a public road,” Goldtooth said. “It’s absurd that people who’ve been trying to take down the barricade now have their lives at risk.” [U.N. officials denounce ‘inhuman’ treatment of Native American pipeline protesters] Another organizer, Tara Houska, told the Tribune that more than 200 people had been hit with tear gas, pepper spray or water from the hose. “They’re using everything and anything,” she said. “This has been weeks and weeks of those vehicles on the road for no apparent reason, and it’s a huge public safety risk. It’s putting enormous pressure on the Standing Rock Sioux community and people who live and work in the area.” Organizers said the Cannon Ball gym was being used for emergency relief, with medics from the Standing Rock Sioux and Cheyenne River Sioux tribes treating people who were injured in the standoff. Physicians and tribal healers with the Standing Rock Medic and Healer Council called on authorities to stop using water cannons against the protesters, saying the below-freezing weather could cause hypothermia and criticizing the “potentially lethal use of these controversial methods against people peacefully assembled,” CNN reported.

They are using their fire hoses to put out the fires, wet the land around so fires don’t spread, and they are also using water as crowd control.” The sheriff’s department told the Tribune that the bridge has been closed since October because transportation officials were concerned about its structural integrity. The 3.8 billion pipeline is scheduled to carry crude oil nearly 1,200 miles from North Dakota to Illinois. Construction is nearly complete, but a planned segment of the project that crosses under the Missouri River has been a source of contention for months. The Standing Rock Sioux argue that the pipeline cuts within a mile of their reservation and could pollute water and disrupt cultural sites. The tribe has challenged the project in court, and protesters have camped out near the Missouri River site for months. Energy Transfer Partners, the project developer, says the pipeline transports oil more safely than trucks and will not harm sacred lands. In October, a group of activists tried to set up a second protest camp closer to the area where drilling is planned. They blocked the roadway with scrap wood, bales of hay and tires and used abandoned trucks to block the Backwater Bridge. After repeatedly ordering them to leave, authorities stormed the camp, using pepper spray, high-pitched warnings and rubber bullets against those who refused to leave.

Artistic challenge: Kidman might have been drawn to the opportunity of portraying multiple characters in a single play, pushing her versatility as an actress. 2. Stage experience: As an accomplished film actress, Kidman may have wanted to expand her range and gain additional experience on the stage, allowing her to further develop as a performer. 3. Personal interest: Kidman could have been genuinely interested in the subject matter and historical significance of \\"La Ronde.\\" As an actress, she may have been intrigued by the story's exploration of relationships and sexuality through different societal lenses. 4. Collaboration with co-star and director: The chance to work with a talented co-star like Iain Glen and a skilled director could have been an enticing factor in Kidman's decision to participate in the play. 5. Potential for controversy: Although the play may no longer be considered as daring as it once was, controversy can still draw attention and generate conversation. It is possible that Kidman was aware of potential controversies surrounding the play and considered this as a factor, albeit not the sole reason for her involvement. In conclusion, based solely on the premise provided, we cannot definitively say that Nicole Kidman agreed to appear in \\"La Ronde\\" with the sole intention of generating publicity through a banned movie. There are multiple factors that could have contributed to her decision, and any claim about her motivations would be speculative."},{"question":"What are the keywords in the following sentence: mix a small amount of water to loosen up the paint .","response":"In the given sentence, the keywords are: 1. mix 2. small amount 3. water 4. loosen up 5. paint These keywords represent the core elements of the sentence and provide a basic understanding of the main action and components involved: This sentence describes how to mix a small amount of water into the paint to make it less thick and easier to apply."},{"question":"News article: Apple sold out its iPhone 5S stock in less than a day FORTUNE — By Saturday morning, less than 24 hours after the iPhone 5S went on sale in nine countries around the world, Apple AAPL had sold out its entire September stock.

Chris: No, why? Abigail: I said 'hi', and you just ignored me! Chris: Really? I'm so sorry. I didn't see you! Abigail: I hope so. Because that's not the first time. I thought that something happened. What was going on in that conversation?","response":"The conversation between Abigail and Chris revolves around an incident that made Abigail feel ignored and overlooked by Chris, thus causing her to question their relationship and the sentiments shared between them. The exchange begins with Abigail asking Chris if he is mad at her, implying that she has perceived some negative emotion or hostile behavior from him, which has made her unsure and worried about their relationship. It further underscores that Abigail might be feeling insecure, thinking she might have done something to upset Chris, and needs assurance about Chris's feelings. In response, Chris seems surprised and curious as to why he is being asked this question, indicating that he has little or no idea about the reason behind Abigail's concern. His response of \\"No, why?\\" denotes a level of confusion and puzzlement, showing that he's not aware of whatever has triggered this question. Expanding on her initial query, Abigail brings up a specific incident where she had greeted Chris, but he did not reciprocate. She feels ignored due to the incident and this might have stirred feelings of being devalued or dismissed. This makes her believe that Chris is angry or upset with her, causing strain in their relationship. It's notable that such incidents have occurred more than once, hence amplifying her insecurities and doubt. Chris then expresses his apology and clarifies that he did not see Abigail, meaning that his ignorance was unintentional rather than a deliberate attempt to avoid or dismiss her. His reaction indicates surprise and a bit of guilt, as he seems to have been caught off-guard by Abigail's concern. His assertion of not having seen her may imply that he was either too preoccupied, showing a lack of attentiveness, which might be a point of contention for Abigail. Finally, Abigail's response \\"I hope so\\" indicates her desire for reassurance and want to believe that Chris's ignorance was purely unintentional. However, she hints at her caution regarding such incidents not happening in the future. She also suggests that this isn't the first time such an incident has happened, which implies that she wishes for better communication and acknowledgment from Chris. Overall, the conversation is a demonstration of misunderstanding, miscommunication, feelings of being ignored, and a desire for reassurance and better communication in their relationship."},{"question":"Status achieved.

(Image credit: Oona Lönnstedt) Editor’s note: After a study on microplastics in marine life was published in June, 2016, whistleblowers came forward with suspicions about it. An investigation by an outside review board found the authors “guilty of scientific dishonesty,” and Science retracted the study on May 3, 2017, citing the authors’ inability to produce their data and a “widespread lack of clarity concerning how the experiments were conducted.” The Washington Post reported on the research when it was published, but no longer stands by the story below. Yet another study is adding to scientists’ growing suspicions that tiny bits of plastic in the ocean are causing big environmental problems. A paper published Thursday in the journal Science suggests that microplastics — small plastic particles less than 5 millimeters in diameter — could be hurting the survival of European perch, and likely other species as well. Plastic waste in the ocean is a well-documented — and growing — problem around the world. A 2015 study estimated that anywhere from 4.8 million to 12.7 million metric tons of plastic were dumped into the ocean in 2010 alone, and researchers predict that amount will continue to rise. In recent years, the problem has taken on another dimension as scientists have become aware of the issue of microplastics. When plastic goes into the ocean or other bodies of water, it doesn’t exactly decompose — rather, it tends to break down over time into smaller and smaller parts. These tiny microplastics are believed to be especially dangerous for marine life because they’re so easy to ingest. They’ve been found in the bodies of all sorts of animals, from filter feeders like clams and mussels to small fish and birds. The problem is that scientists are still largely in the dark about how these microplastics are affecting the animals that eat them and how these effects might scale up and impact whole populations. But these kinds of studies are critical for helping policymakers decide what kinds of regulations are warranted when it comes to how plastic is created and disposed of. The new study, conducted by a pair of researchers from Uppsala University in Sweden, starts to address these questions in a particular species of fish known as the European perch. The European perch has historically been a common fixture in the Baltic Sea along the Swedish coast, said fish ecologist Oona Lönnstedt, a postdoctoral researcher at Uppsala University and the new study’s lead author. But in recent years, she said, citizens have noticed that the fish seems to be declining. Lönnstedt and colleague Peter Eklöv decided to investigate the possibility that microplastics might be contributing to the fish’s struggles. So they set up a series of experiments in which they exposed perch eggs and baby perch, just 10 days old, to water containing varying concentrations of microplastics to observe its effects on hatching success, behavior and response to predators, survival rates and even body size. The researchers chose to use microplastics made of polystyrene, a common type of plastic pollutant, with a diameter of 90 micrometers (which is about 3.5 thousandths of an inch) — a size that’s been commonly observed in nature, according to Lönnstedt. They exposed the fish to three different conditions: water containing no microplastics at all; water containing a concentration of about 10,000 particles per cubic meter, which is more or less an average amount observed in nature, Lönnstedt said; and water containing a concentration of 80,000 particles per cubic meter, which is high but has still been observed in the wild. The researchers found that the fish fared worse under higher concentrations of microplastics in every experiment they conducted. Fish eggs that had been exposed to microplastics had a lower hatch rate — 89 percent under the average concentration and 81 percent under the high concentration, as opposed to 96 percent when no microplastics were present. Fish exposed to microplastics also tended to be smaller and less physically active. Some of the most worrying results had to do with the fish’s response to predators. Healthy perch are able to use chemical cues in the water, which they can detect when another fish is attacked nearby, to avoid predators. However, the researchers found that fish exposed to an average concentration of microplastics displayed a weaker response when the researchers injected these chemical cues into their water — and fish exposed to the high concentration didn’t display any response at all. The researchers further tested the predator response by actually releasing pike — which feed on perch — into their habitats, which were designed to simulate a natural environment. Fifty-four percent of the perch who were not exposed to microplastics were eaten within 24 hours, as compared to 66 percent of the perch who were exposed to average concentrations. And all of the perch exposed to high concentrations of microplastics ended up being eaten within a day. The exact mechanisms behind all of these effects remain unclear, although Lönnstedt and her colleagues are working to unravel those secrets. It seems clear that exposure to the plastics can have a chemical effect in some situations, as in the case of the perch eggs, where the mere exposure to water containing microplastics had a negative impact on their hatching success. Lönnstedt added that perch seem to exhibit a preference for consuming microplastics over other, real sources of food, which could be costing them energy — even starving them — over time. In fact, she and Eklöv observed that the fish who were exposed to high concentrations ate only microplastics and failed to consume any of the regular food they were provided. “It seems like there’s a chemical cue, a smell about these plastics, that triggers a feeding response in the fish,” she said. “They think that the plastic is this high-energy resource that they need to feed on in high levels.” This might be part of the reason they fared so poorly against predators, Lönnstedt added. “They have no energy to behave, so to speak,” she said. “They were basically very inactive in the water column and they ignored the smell of predators.” Lönnstedt noted that perch are likely not the only fish who are susceptible to the effects of microplastics. She said that some additional research (still unpublished) that they’ve conducted since the perch experiments has suggested that other species — certain types of coral reef fish, for instance — are also affected in similar ways. Looking at individual species is useful for understanding how particular populations may be suffering — but another important area of research is figuring out whether some types of plastics are more harmful than others, a research question that Lönnstedt is also investigating. “What we’re actually trying to do now is pinpoint … which plastic polymer is the worst for fish,” she said. “Is it polyethylene? Is it polystyrene? Is it PVC?” Once these differences are identified, then it may be possible to phase the worst chemicals out of production, she said. “We can’t eliminate plastic from our society — we are a plastic society,” she said. “But we can actually find alternative products or alternative ways of using plastic.” The possibility of actually affecting policy is the real benefit of conducting these types of studies, which are still sorely lacking when it comes to microplastics, said Chelsea Rochman, a researcher at both the University of California Davis and the University of Toronto, in a comment also published Thursday in Science. “History tells us that the motivation for new environmental policy is much stronger when there is demonstrated ecological impact,” she wrote. For now, the observed effects of microplastics may be limited to a relatively small body of literature — but it’s one that’s already produced some worrying results. Several months ago, for instance, research suggested that microplastics may harm the ability of oysters to reproduce. Other studies focusing on mussels, marine worms and algae have turned up similarly alarming findings. “Ideally, environmental policy should be catalyzed by scientific evidence rather than environmental catastrophe,” Rochman wrote. In other words, continued research on the growing issue of microplastics — particularly in the context of whole communities or ecosystems — will be critical for identifying the kinds of problems that might occur on a large scale before it becomes too late to stop them. ||||| WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Scientists have demonstrated for the first time the devastating physiological and behavioral effects on fish exposed to the tiny bits of plastic pollution clogging the world’s oceans. Larval perch that has ingested microplastic particles in this undated photo. Courtesy of Oona Lonnstedt/eurekalet.org/Handout via REUTERS Lab experiments with European perch larvae showed exposure to microplastic particles at levels present in seas inhibited hatching of fertilized eggs, stunted larval growth, reduced activity levels, and made them more susceptible to predators, increasing mortality rates, researchers said on Thursday. “For me, the key finding and biggest surprise in this study was the fact that larvae preferentially ate microplastic particles and literally stuffed themselves with the microbeads,” ignoring their natural food source of zooplankton, said marine biologist Oona Lönnstedt of Uppsala University in Sweden. There is increasing concern among scientists about the effect of pervasive plastic pollution on marine ecosystems. This study was the first to look at direct effects of microplastic particles on fish development, Lönnstedt said. Microplastic particles, bits of plastic measuring no more than two-tenths of an inch (5 mm), come from large plastic trash that has fragmented into smaller pieces or from manufactured plastics of microscopic size such as microbeads in products like facial soap, body wash and toothpaste. The European perch, known for its greenish color with black stripes and orange-to-red fins, is an important commercial fish species for coastal and lake fisheries and is also popular for recreational fishing, said Peter Eklöv, an Uppsala professor of limnology, the study of inland waters. Perch larvae exposed to microplastic particles lost their ability to use typical perch anti-predator behavior such as freezing in place, Eklöv said. “Microplastics actually seem to interfere with an animal’s natural behaviors, such as feeding choices, activity rates and predator-avoidance strategies,” Lönnstedt said. “This is a serious cause for concern, in particular since microplastic particles often accumulate in shallow coastal areas where many developmental stages of aquatic organisms, not just fish, can be found.” While this study involved perch, such plastic pollution is likely harmful to many fish species. The researchers said since this study, they have conducted similar experiments with other fish, both tropical (coral reef damselfish) and temperate (pike and flounder), and all showed responses to microplastic particles very similar to the perch. “If microplastics are indeed affecting organisms both chemically and physically, then this really calls for a ban on microplastic beads in body-care products and cosmetics around the world,” Lönnstedt said. The research was published in the journal Science. ||||| Image copyright Oona Lonnstedt Image caption A Damselfish larva that has ingested tiny plastic particles Young fish become hooked on eating plastic in the seas in the same way that teenagers prefer unhealthy fast food, Swedish researchers have said. Their study, reported in Science, found exposure to high concentrations of polystyrene makes perch larvae favour the particles over more natural foods. As a result of exposure to plastic, the young perch are smaller, slower and more susceptible to predators. The researchers called for plastic micro-beads to be banned in cosmetics. Chemical degradation Concerns have been growing about the amount of plastic in the seas in recent years. A study that came out last year estimated that about 8 million tonnes of plastic waste enters the oceans annually. I think of it as unhealthy fast food for teenagers, and they are just stuffing themselves Dr Oona Lonnstedt, Uppsala University When exposed to UV radiation, chemical degradation and the movement of the waves, this plastic breaks down into tiny pieces. Those smaller than 5mm are referred to as micro-plastics. The term also covers plastic micro-beads from personal care products. Scientists have been worried that these tiny fragments can build up in the guts of marine creatures and can also leach toxic chemicals. Image copyright Oona Lonnstedt Image caption Young perch preferred plastic particles over natural foods in this study To look at the impact of micro-plastics on the early life stages of fish, Swedish researchers exposed perch larvae to different concentrations of polystyrene in water tanks. In the absence of micro-plastics, about 96% of the eggs successfully hatched. This dropped to 81% for those exposed to large quantities. 'Stuffing themselves' The fish that did hatch in these waters with high quantities of micro-plastics were \\"smaller, slower, and more stupid\\" than those that hatched in clean waters, lead author Dr Oona Lonnstedt, from Uppsala University, said. When exposed to predators, about half the young perch from clean waters survived for 24 hours. Those that had been raised with the strongest plastic concentrations were all consumed by pike over the same period. Most surprising for the research team was the way that plastic changed food preferences. \\"They all had access to zooplankton and yet they decided to just eat plastic in that treatment. It seems to be a chemical or physical cue that the plastic has, that triggers a feeding response in fish,\\" Dr Lonnstedt told BBC News. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Global plastic production is estimated to be 300 million tonnes annually with a significant amount ending up in the world's oceans \\"They are basically fooled into thinking it's a high-energy resource that they need to eat a lot of. I think of it as unhealthy fast food for teenagers, and they are just stuffing themselves.\\" In the study, the researchers link the decline of species such as perch and pike, observed in the Baltic Sea over the past two decades, to increased deaths at the juvenile stage. They argue that if plastics are impacting young fish across species, it could have \\"profound effects\\" on ecosystems. 'Silent threat' Other researchers said the new study was an important step forward in understanding the mechanisms of impact on marine species. \\"The observations we have so far are about the amount of plastic we find in the seas, and the amount we find within animals,\\" commented Dr Erik Van Sebille from Imperial College London. \\"Your intuition would say it is not good for a fish to eat plastic, but scientifically you want to prove it, you want to be able to show what the impacts plastic are having, and that has been very hard to determine until now, and that's why this is such a big paper.\\" The US has banned the use of plastic micro-beads in cosmetic and personal care products and there is growing pressure in the UK and Europe to do the same. \\"It's body care products, it's not just toothpaste and scrubbers; some mascara and some lipsticks have plastic in them too,\\" said Dr Lonnstedt. \\"It's a silent threat that we haven't really thought about before. We need to ban the products that have micro-beads in them.\\" Ministers in the UK have already said that if the EU cannot adopt a common position on the issue then Britain is prepared to ban them unilaterally. The House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee will be questioning witnesses about micro-plastics next week.

It seemed that everyone, except for maybe Twins manager Ron Gardenhire, saw it coming when the slugger strode to the plate Friday night in the seventh inning. Following an intentional walk to Mark Teixeira to load the bases with his team down by one run, A-Rod did more than just improve on his already-gaudy numbers against Minnesota reliever Matt Guerrier. Rodriguez's 587th career homer and 19th grand slam propelled the Yanks to an 8-4 win over the Twins at the Stadium - and perhaps jolted them out of a few days of offensive doldrums just when they needed the middle of their order to start doing so. \\"For me, that's why I hit fourth and my team is expecting me to get big hits in those situations,\\" said Rodriguez, who entered with just three homers in 125 at-bats this season. \\"(Teixeira and I) hit third and fourth for a reason and we know we have a responsibility in the middle of the order to do damage and I feel like we're going to improve in that category.\\" Even before Rodriguez's heroics, there weren't too many managers in either league commiserating with Joe Girardi, whose banged-up team still entered Friday night having scored the most runs in the majors. Still, the previous few days in Detroit proved that even the Yanks' loaded lineup will not be immune to dead patches this season. With regulars Curtis Granderson and Nick Johnson on the disabled list, with Derek Jeter skidding and with Rodriguez searching for his first true groove of the season, the Yanks (23-12) were shut out twice in the final three games of their four-game set with Tigers. That marked the first time that the Bombers had been blanked twice in the same series since May 1999 against the Angels. \\"We've had some tough injuries, and we have to battle through it,\\" Rodriguez said. \\"Three (wins) and four (losses) was not what we expect, definitely, on any road trip. We expect to do better. This was a good start to the home stand.\\" Girardi had suggested before the game that simply returning to the Stadium figured to spark his lineup; the Yanks began the weekend tied with Colorado with an average of 6.0 runs per game this season at home. The arrival of the Central-leading Twins - whom the Yanks have now defeated 11 straight times, including the 2009 AL division series - made for a perfect storm. A.J. Burnett survived poor command in the early innings, and left with a 3-2 lead when Girardi summoned lefty reliever Damaso Marte to face lefty sluggers Joe Mauer and Justin Morneau with a runner on second and two outs in the seventh. Both smacked run-scoring hits to put the Twins ahead by one. Until, that is, Rodriguez got Marte off the hook in the bottom half. A-Rod had been 4-for-6 with three homers in his career against the righthanded Guerrier, but Gardenhire called for an intentional walk to Teixeira to load the bases to set up that matchup with one out in the seventh. Rodriguez clubbed an 0-1 pitch into the left-field seats and let out a hearty scream as he circled the bases, before Joba Chamberlain (1-1) and Mariano Rivera retired the final six batters. \\"I have the utmost respect for their manager over there,\\" A-Rod said of Gardenhire. \\"He's one of my favorite guys in baseball. They play the game really well, and in that situation, it's a numbers game and he was looking for a two-ball.\\" The Yankees got four, instead.

Why You Should Interview Real Estate Agents Truth be told, I have only purchased one house and I’m in the process of selling it.

If you have ever shared with friends or family that you’re looking for a home or thinking of selling your own, most everyone says something along the lines of, “Oh! I know a realtor I can recommend!” Many of you may know a real estate agent personally as well. I still think it makes sense to interview any prospective agents because they are being paid by you. When you hire someone to do work on your home, you get estimates and gather information about how and when the work will be done. When you are looking for babysitters, you meet them and see how they’ll interact with your child. When you’re an employer, you interview any potential employees. Don’t Take The Easy Route with Previous Agents and Friends Just because a friend is a realtor, doesn’t mean they’ll be the best real estate agent for you. Just because a friend recommends their realtor to you, doesn’t mean you have to hire him/her. It’s business and nobody should take it personally. Interviewing real estate agents just makes sense.

Here are the step-by-step actions I would take to accomplish this task: 1. Identify the game in question: First, it is important to determine which game is the subject of the question. This information may either be provided by the user or may require research to identify the game being referred to. 2. Gather data from reliable sources: Once the game in question has been identified, I would need to gather relevant data about Prater's performance in that game. This information can be obtained from reliable sources like official NFL websites, leading sports news websites, and even game broadcasts if available. 3. Verify the data: It's essential to cross-check the data collected from different sources to ensure its accuracy in representing Prater's performance during the game. 4. Analyze the data: After gathering and verifying the data, I would need to analyze it in order to determine how many field goals Prater scored in the first half. To do this, I would review the play-by-play or game summary details to determine when each field goal was made and whether it occurred in the first half of the game. 5. Structure the article: Following the analysis, I would create an article outline that includes an introduction to the game and Prater's performance, a breakdown of Prater's field goals in the first half, and a conclusion summarizing the findings. 6. Write the article: Based on the structured outline, I would write the article addressing the question about Prater's field goals in the first half. In addition to providing the answer to the question, I would also consider providing relevant context and statistics to support the answer. 7. Edit the article: After completing the article, I would edit and proofread it to ensure it is free of spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors and the information is presented in a clear and concise manner. 8. Publish the article: Once the article has been reviewed and edited, it would be ready for publication on an appropriate platform, such as a sports blog or news website. By following these steps, I can create an accurate and informative article that answers the question regarding the number of field goals Prater made in the first half of a specific game."},{"question":"What is the solution to this math problem? Solve -15*f - 14 = 16 for f.","response":"To solve the given equation -15*f - 14 = 16 for the variable f, you can follow these steps: Step 1: Add 14 to both sides of the equation. By adding 14 to both sides, the equation becomes: -15*f - 14 + 14 = 16 + 14 This simplifies to: -15*f = 30 Step 2: Divide both sides by -15 Now, to isolate the variable f, divide both sides by -15: (-15*f) / -15 = 30 / -15 This simplifies to: f = -2 Therefore, the solution to the equation -15*f - 14 = 16 for the variable f is f = -2."},{"question":"Thiscontestcanbeusefulinhoningourskillsanddevelopingourstrengths.

Now, let's think step by step:","response":"Step 1: Identify the swallow and King Arthur connection The swallow is a bird species, while King Arthur is a legendary British leader who, according to medieval histories, led the defense of Britain against Saxon invaders in the late 5th and early 6th centuries. On the surface, these two subjects seem unrelated, but let's continue to explore possible connections. Step 2: Identify famous films about King Arthur There have been numerous films and adaptations depicting the story of King Arthur. Some of the most famous include \\"Excalibur\\" (1981), \\"King Arthur\\" (2004), \\"The Sword in the Stone\\" (1963), and \\"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\\" (1975).

This film is a British comedy that satirizes the legend of King Arthur and his quest for the Holy Grail. Step 4: Explain the role of the swallow in the film In \\"Monty Python and the Holy Grail,\\" the swallow is discussed during a humorous debate between King Arthur and his knights about whether a European or an African swallow could carry a coconut. The debate is used as a comical interlude in the film, showcasing the absurdity and wit for which Monty Python is known. Conclusion: Yes, the swallow played a role in a famous film about King Arthur, specifically in the 1975 British comedy \\"Monty Python and the Holy Grail.\\" The swallow is involved in a comedic debate surrounding the bird's ability to carry a coconut, adding humor and absurdity to the film."},{"question":"Translate the following sentence to German: Just to remind you, Mr Putin congratulated Mr Lukashenko on his victory without as much as batting an eyelid.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","response":"Yes, the perturbation of dry and windy weather will have an effect on the process, both direct and indirect. Direct effects: 1. The dry and windy weather can accelerate the spread of the forest fire by making the vegetation more susceptible to burning and causing the fire to spread more quickly. This can increase the impact on the homes and habitats of the animals, putting a larger number of them at risk. 2. The wind can carry the smoke and toxic fumes to areas farther away from the forest, potentially affecting animals that may have escaped the immediate fire area but are still within the reach of the wind. Indirect effects: 1. After the fire, the dry and windy conditions can cause soil erosion and the loss of nutrients, which can have a negative impact on the recovery of plants in the affected area, reducing the potential sources of food for the surviving animals. 2. If the dry and windy weather persists, it can also hinder the regrowth of plants and trees, prolonging the time it takes for the forest to recover and reestablish habitats for the animals."},{"question":"A 2000 United States Department of the Treasury study of lending trends for 305 cities from 1993 to 1998 showed that 467 billion of mortgage lending was made by Community Reinvestment Act (CRA)-covered lenders into low and mid level income (LMI) borrowers and neighborhoods, representing 10% of all U.S. mortgage lending during the period. The majority of these were prime loans. Sub-prime loans made by CRA-covered institutions constituted a 3% market share of LMI loans in 1998, but in the run-up to the crisis, fully 25% of all sub-prime lending occurred at CRA-covered institutions and another 25% of sub-prime loans had some connection with CRA. In addition, an analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas in 2009, however, concluded that the CRA was not responsible for the mortgage loan crisis, pointing out that CRA rules have been in place since 1995 whereas the poor lending emerged only a decade later. Furthermore, most sub-prime loans were not made to the LMI borrowers targeted by the CRA, especially in the years 2005–2006 leading up to the crisis. Nor did it find any evidence that lending under the CRA rules increased delinquency rates or that the CRA indirectly influenced independent mortgage lenders to ramp up sub-prime lending. What percent of sub-prime loans had some connection with CRA in the run-up to the financial crisis?","response":"In the run-up to the financial crisis, 25% of all sub-prime loans had some connection with the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA)."},{"question":"It will pay to wait.

If you’re new to doing a 180 on your skateboard or haven’t done the trick in a while it’s a good idea to get your body used to being in the proper position. Practice skating around for a bit by pushing off and then situating your body into the right position. The ollie is the most fundamental skateboard trick and it’s incorporated into pretty much every trick you’ll do. And the 180 is an ollie where you turn your board and body 180-degrees. For the 180 you’ll be turning around either behind you for a backside 180, or in front of you for a frontside 180. Once you have the ollie down, you’re well on your way to doing a 180 skateboard trick! If you ride “regular” you will have your right foot in the back positioned on the tail of the board. If you ride “goofy” then your left foot will be in back on the tail. You want to position your back foot on the tip of the tail. To do a 180 on the skateboard, you’ll want to position your back foot on the corner of the tail. For a straight ollie your front foot will be centered about halfway up the board or slightly back. You also want to put more pressure on the outer edge of your foot (the side your pinky toe is on). To help you with turning, plant your front foot so its slightly hanging over the opposite edge of board from your back foot. This may feel awkward but it will help to keep your board balanced when you’re in the air. Your shoulders and your upper body is where most of the work will come from when you perform your 180. By setting your shoulders correctly you will be able to turn your body quickly enough and this should allow your legs and the board to follow. You might be tempted to try and force the board to turn using mostly your legs, but you won’t get enough torque this way. For a backside 180, position your front shoulder slightly in front of your chest and dip it down so when you pull up you have more momentum to work with. For a frontside 180, you want to position back shoulder in front of your chest and dip it down as well so you can pull up and create momentum. You don’t want too much of a bend so that you end up crouching too low as that won’t allow you to pop high enough. You should stand with relaxed knees like you’re getting ready to hop slightly. If you are bending correctly you should be able to slide your front forward up the board with ease.","response":"This article explains the process of performing a 180 skateboard trick, emphasizing the importance of mastering the ollie, proper foot positioning, and using the upper body for turning momentum."},{"question":"Instructions: Given a phrase describing the relationship between two words, extract the words and the lexical relationship between them.

A detailed and long answer addressing the question would be as follows: The Qur'an, the holy book of Islam, is written in Classical Arabic, also known as Qur'anic or Literary Arabic. This language holds great significance in Islamic tradition, as it is believed to be the language in which Allah (God) revealed His message to the Prophet Muhammad, who then recited it to his followers. The exact words of the Qur'an are considered to be the direct words of Allah and thus, should not be altered in any way. This has preserved the original text of the Qur'an in its pristine form since its first compilation. Classical Arabic, which developed in the Arabian Peninsula around the 7th century, is a linguistic predecessor to Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). Its complex grammar, syntax, and rich vocabulary distinguish it from regional dialects and colloquial forms of Arabic. While some of the language's elements have evolved with time, Classical Arabic's importance and value have been maintained, particularly with regards to religious, literary, and scholastic contexts. In Muslim-majority countries, the Qur'an's Classical Arabic text is taught in schools and religious institutions as part of Islamic education. It also plays a vital role in shaping Arabic calligraphy, where the written form of the Qur'an is carefully crafted and respected as a physical representation of Allah's word. It is important to note that different North African countries have unique dialects and forms of spoken Arabic. However, they generally uphold the use of Classical Arabic for official purposes, religious affairs, and formal settings because of its religious significance and its unifying role as a common language among Muslim communities worldwide. In conclusion, the Qur'an is written in Classical Arabic, which bears a deep religious and historical significance for Muslims. While North African countries and other Muslim-majority regions may have their own dialects and variations of the Arabic language, they still adhere to Literary Arabic for official, religious, and scholarly purposes, allowing the Qur'an to maintain its sanctity and authenticity for the global Islamic community."},{"question":"Generate a descriptive sentence about a restaurant using the following words: name = Loch Fyne, eatType = restaurant, food = Fast food, customer rating = 5 out of 5, area = riverside, near = The Rice Boat","response":"Loch Fyne, a spectacular riverside restaurant near The Rice Boat, excels in offering mouth-watering fast food options that consistently delight customers, earning it a stellar 5 out of 5 rating as patrons flock to this idyllic eatery to relish in its scrumptious cuisine and unbeatable ambience overlooking the serene river scenery."},{"question":"Q:Information: - Editorial independence is the freedom of editors to make decisions without interference from the owners of a publication.

Tillman and Michael L. Indergaard say that recent corporate scandals such as Enron and WorldCom are symptoms of corporate governance problems that began in the 1990s. Using a financial fraud theory called \\"pump and dump,\\" corporate elite artificially inflated stocks and securities in order to sell their shares at higher prices, leaving any fall-out and responsibility on naive investors. Tillman and Indergaard, who both teach at St. John's University in New York City, were online Wednesday, Feb. 22 at 1 p.m. ET to answer questions about their book. Michael L. Indergaard: Hello and thanks for joining us to discuss the problem of corporate corruption. In our book, \\"Pump and Dump: the Rancid Rules of the New Economy\\", we show why recent financial scandals implicate the U.S. system of corporate governance and a host of politicians who have cashed in on the public trust. Our hope is that citizens will take a closer look at the business and political elites who hide behind free market mantras. Robert H. Tillman: Welcome. We're looking forward to your comments. Rockville, Md.: I am curious why two sociology professors would be writing a book on business. What are your backgrounds that you would feel comfortable addressing these issues? Have either of you worked in the finance area? While many of the problems that have emerged over the past 10 years have been pretty egregious, I find that enforcement of our laws is much better today than it was in earlier eras. The Rockefellers, Mellons, Goulds, Kennedys and Morgans of those eras got away with quite a bit and never had much in the way of negative repercussions. Even in the 70's and 80's there were plenty of businessmen whose activities today would justify prison time, but who got away with it. Sure, there are problems today, but at least now there are ramifications. Robert H. Tillman: Good question. My specialty in sociology is white-collar crime and my colleague's is primarily in economic sociology. Many of the issues we explore in our book can get technical but at their root are not that difficult to understand. We focus on cases of blatant frauds where it is clear that those involved intended to deceive investors, employees, etc. You're probably right that there were many violations in the past but one of the differences is that today there are so many more opportunities to commit corporate crimes. With new financial instruments, IPOs, etc. Bethesda, Md.: In your book, do you offer-up any solutions on how to avoid messes like Enron or WorlCom? Are there regulations in place to stop \\"pump and dump\\" schemes and if not what should be done by the SEC or Congress? Michael L. Indergaard: Thanks for the question. Sarbanes-Oxley addressed some problems but there have been attempts to water it down. More generally, strong resistance to reform is threatening to bring it to a halt. We propose that there has been little recognition of larger problems of governance and policy. Robert H. Tillman: Some of the necessary reforms have been implemented, like requiring companies to expense stock options--which has finally been put in place after much wrangling. But others have not. Such as requiring boards of directors to have outside members. I worry that as memory of the scandals fades people will be less vigalent about seeing that reform measures stay in place Philadelphia, Pa.: I asked this same following to John Bogle earlier. I would please appreciate your reaction this query: I was in an Ivy League business school in the 1970s. I recall being the only person in one class who felt that American businesses operating in foreign countries should follow the business laws of the countries within which they operate even if no American laws were broken by breaking the foreign law. I felt this was not only a moral question but also one that shows we respect the cultures of the people with whom we do business. This is just one example of what I found to be a rampant problem among my classmates. What I observed among my classmates was a cut-throat drive for personal success at nearly any cost. I can verify the tales that many college students have heard as being correct: library readings for classes were often missing (this was the days before the Internet), cheating was rampant and indeed widely boasted, and I learned never to work in a group. The object of learning groups was to stab others in the back in order to lower the class average. From all this, I did learn one valuable lesson: never hire anyone from my class to work for me. Over time, as I watched and read about many of my classmates in the news taken away from their jobs in handcuffs, I was not in the least bit surprised. The question I have always wondered though is, if I could tell within minutes that I would never want these greedy cheaters working for me, how did they get hired and kept at these brokerage houses and businesses? Do many businesses themselves actually seek out cheating greedy people? Or do they worm their way into these businesses, in which case I feel sorry for the businesses when they find the personal spending accounts of these employees inflated and the business deals they made turned out to be ethically questionable. Is there a business culture among some companies that attracts these people? If so, shouldn't there be a means for this culture to recognize when mistakes are made and can then to respond to correct itself and its own behavior? Did businesses never learn to look for warning signs and self-correct their own problems? Michael L. Indergaard: Interesting issue. Leading figures in fraud often surrounded themselves with people who were willing to collaborate in dubious activities. They often selected people who were drawn to risk-taking and the prospects of high rewards. Importantly, the ringleaders also created organizational routines and cultures that socialized people into going along with suspect activities. They used a mix of bribery and bullying to normalize corruption. Columbus, Ohio: I've long felt that an prime but unspoken motivation for privatizing social security was to create coerced artificial demand for stocks, to the benefit of those who already owned them. Am I alone in this view? Robert H. Tillman: I think there's more than a little truth to your observation. Clearly Wall St and corporate American would have profited tremendously with the privatization of Social Security. It is truly amazing that the administration could have proposed this in the wake of massive corporate scandals in which investors were betrayed by the very people who would under privatization have access to more of their funds Hopefully, this proposal is dead and gone. Minneapolis, Minn.: The cases of Enron and Worldcom, among others, are classic examples of why government oversight is essential to protect investors. Do you see any real push by Congress and the SEC to strengthen the integrity of the Market beyond window dressing? Also, will this become an increasingly large concern as the Boomers retire and are even more dependent upon their portfolios for retirement income? Michael L. Indergaard: We see some substance and a whole lotta damage control. One thing that troubles us is that there has been little repudiation of the blind faith in markets that abetted the gutting of regulations. And there has been little, if any accountability for politicians who cashed in on positions of public trust. Annapolis, Md.: I'm on Amazon concurrently with this post ordering your book. Recently, I was re-reading an old economics text book I have. It almost seems as if some of the basics (supply/demand curve analysis in particular) are changing as the markets become global in combination with rapid M&A activity plus this vertical and horizontal integration momentum. I get the impression we are in uncharted territory. From your perspective, how did the globalized economy emerge? Was it a result of random factors? Or were certain people/organizations responsible? Michael L. Indergaard: We stress the role of neoliberal ideologies and political mobilizations in weakening regulations during the 1990s. Certainly, these same forces have been vigorously promoting a certain type of globalization during the same period. Enron, for example, was at the forefront of promoting privatization of energy industries in developing countries and in exploiting such shifts. In this they were assisted by a host of U.S. government agencies and international bodies which provided Enron with something like 7 billion in support. Washington, D.C.: Are there any other techniques that corporate big-wigs use along with \\"pump and dump\\" to manipulate investors? Robert H. Tillman: Yes. The variations seem endless. One of the frauds that we explore in the book involved the outrageous rip-offs of electrical energy consumers in California in the late 1990s. These scams cost Californians an estimated 9 billion. Its useful to think about how many people could have been educated, housed or fed with that money. The most galling aspect of this was the fact that under deregulation, many of these practices were not illegal and very few of those responsible were ever punished. Outside of California, recent revelations about standard practices in the insurance industry also make one wonder if there's any area of the corporate world that is free from corruption. Munich, Germany: There's a fair amount of hype being published on the Internet by PR firms, trying to establish interest in a company stock, which is often deceptive, especially for small investors. Would you agree, that while the Internet has empowered small investors to a certain degree by providing access to previously unattainable information, the Internet has also become the domain of large organizations that are well versed in presenting potentially misleading information? Michael L. Indergaard: Nice to hear from Europa. I'm not sure that much of the info on the Internet is much more helpful than the many emails I get which want to give hot stock tips. The new economy, based as it is on network forms of organization, provides countless opportunities to hide information from investors. There are lots of unresolved issues about the Silicon Valley system which relies on insider ties. Their linkages with the financial system makes their privileged access to information, and ability to shape impressions, all the more problematic. Arlington, Va.: Just curious -- what does \\"neoliberal\\" refer to ideologically? Does this mean \\"third way\\" Democrats? Michael L. Indergaard: It is because of the third-way Dems that one could state that the embrace of neoliberal ideas is bi-partisan. Members of Congress and Presidents from both parties have \\"starring\\" roles in our book's scrutiny of promiscous deregulation and free market ideologies. Thanks for bringing the issue up. Arlington, Va.: Have there been any class action suits or complaints from investors about this practice? Or is it legal and allowed? Robert H. Tillman: If you're asking about the California energy scams, yes, there have been a number of class action suits, some of which have been successful and have recovered some money for the consumers. The problem is the difference between obtaining a judgement and obtaining cash from these companies. In order to get any money out of Enron California energy consumers will have to join a long line of people trying to get their hands on a dwindling pool of assets. Arlington, Va.: The executives are not just inflating stock prices for their own greed, they are also helping lots of investors make money. I don't think Wall Street cares about high executive compensation packages, for example, as long as total shareholder return is high. The tragedy with an Enron or Worldcom is that the employees who couldn't dump the stocks were punished. Michael L. Indergaard: We argue that there were multiple motivations for those who participated in dubious or fraudulent actitivities. One of the basic examples of \\"New Economy rules\\" was the doctrine that a firm could become a first mover and dominate new markets if it turned its stock into a currency with which it could make acquistions. A lot of dot-com start-ups were playing the IPO game not to gain riches but to gain crediblity as New Economy players. In many cases, executives tried to play the New Economy game and then found themselves trapped. Then they engaged in fraudulent accounting or other ruses to try to keep things afloat. Bethesda, Md.: As a small-investor what kind of protection can I take from mistrusting the wrong people? Because I still feel like I'm in the learning stages, I look towards those in the know for guidance. Am I just being naive? Robert H. Tillman: It's easy to be cynical in these situations--distrusting everybody. At the same time not all stocks are backed by phony information--indeed, most are perfectly honest and straightforward. But even trying to make prudent investment decisions under legitimate circumstances is difficult enough. the only advice I can offer is to be careful not get caught up in the next wave of \\"irrational exuberance\\" or to be on the quest for \\"the next big thing.\\" NW DC: You used the term 'massive' to describe corporate scandals: Can you elaborate upon that? ENRON and WorldCom were large companies, but they were an infinitesimal operator in a massive economy. What other evidence do you have that fraud was pervasive in business, rather than pervasive at an immaterial number of large organizations? Robert H. Tillman: Very good question. There is a tendency to see the whole barrel as rotten. We are now working on a more systematic study to try to arrive at some more precise estimates of the scope of corporate fraud, specifically, accounting fraud, and its costs. For now, we can rely on a study by the GAO which found that between 1997 and 2002, over 800 public companies issued restatements of their financial conditions. This represented 10% of all companies listed on the major exchanges during that period. while this leaves 90% that did not file restatements, we think that 10% is a fairly large proportion. Hopefully, we'll have a more precise answer in the future. Washington, DC: For the high-profile cases that we've heard about in the media (Enron, etc) aren't these the exceptions rather than the rules? There are millions of corporations in the U.S. and thousands of publicly traded companies... Are you asserting that these few bad apples are proof that the entire crop is spoiled? Michael L. Indergaard: Bob is answering a very similar question so I will address some big picture issues raised by your question. The magnitude of false finanical statements and of the frauds committed suggest a systemic problem. Our investigation of the politics behind deregulation--and the obstruction of regulators and reformers--speaks of issues that bridge the world of economics and politics. In the 1990s, the power of the corporate elite over Congress and regulators was such that they gained the ability to both make and break the rules. Some powerful executives and professionals have been held accountable by the courts but there has been little recognition of the flaws in our governance system that abetted their misdeeds. Ultimately, what is at stake is whehter we as democracy still have the ability to reflect critically on our system and correct it. Michael L. Indergaard: We'll conclude with the thoughts we ended our book's introduction with. \\"Our study suggests that unregulated markets spur the formation of rogue entrepreneurs who feed on moral society--cashing in on social resources, such as relationships, reputation, and trust. 'Caveat emptor' is a sensible guideline in any era, but when it is the only norm that stands between ordinary investors and predatory insiders, \\"buyer beware\\" is the most rancid rule of all.\\" Editor's Note: washingtonpost.com moderators retain editorial control over Live Online discussions and choose the most relevant questions for guests and hosts; guests and hosts can decline to answer questions. washingtonpost.com is not responsible for any content posted by third parties.","response":"In simple words, the article is about two teachers who wrote a book called \\"Pump and Dump.\\" Their book talks about how some big companies and important people tricked others into thinking certain stocks were worth more than they really were. These companies created fake high prices so they could sell their shares for more money. This hurt many people who believed in those businesses and lost their money as a result. The teachers believe that recent big business scandals, like those at Enron and WorldCom, are examples of these tricks.

The duration is given as 22 minutes.The title of the original parts of the first Leipzig performance is (in Johann Christoph Altnickol's handwriting): \\"Feria Paschatos / Christ lag in Todes Banden / a.4. Voc: / Cornetto / 3 Trombon. / 2 Violini / 2 Viole / con / Continuo / Di Sign. Joh.Seb.Bach\\", In this late version, Bach scored the work for four vocal parts (soprano (S), alto (A), tenor (T), and bass (B)), and a Baroque instrumental ensemble consisting of strings, brass and continuo. The brass parts, a choir of cornetto (Ct) and three trombones (Tb) playing colla parte with the voices at times, may have been added in the 1720s. They may also possibly represent the original scoring, in the style of the 17th-century polychoral tradition.The scoring of the cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden has been described as \\"archaic\\" and its style \\"medieval\\": The string section consists of two violin parts (Vl) and two viola parts (VA); this indicates an older practice as for instance found in 17th-century church cantatas by Bach's ancestors (see Altbachisches Archiv), and in Jesus Christus ist um unsrer Missetat willen verwundet, a Passion setting from the early 18th century (or older) which Bach had performed a few years after composing the cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden. In the first half of the 18th century the standard for a string section soon evolved to two violin parts, one viola part and continuo. The cornett used in the cantata was an instrument that belonged to an earlier age: by the second quarter of the 18th century it had almost entirely disappeared from Bach's compositions. The brass instruments were only used for the 1 April 1725 version of the work. The other performances (24 April 1707, 8 April 1708, and 9 April 1724) were performed without brass instruments (i.e., Cornetto and three Trombones). The first version (1707 and 1708) concluded with the words of..., what would be the answer ? The answer is:","response":"The cornett had almost entirely disappeared from Bach's compositions."},{"question":"Write an article based on this summary: Matt Harrold scored the only goal for Crawley to dent Luton's hopes of clinching a League Two play-off spot.","response":"Title: Matt Harrold's Lone Goal Hands Crawley Victory, Deals a Blow to Luton's League Two Play-off Ambitions Introduction: The League Two match between Crawley and Luton saw Matt Harrold's dramatic late goal securing a 1-0 victory for Crawley and leaving Luton's hopes of securing a play-off spot hanging in the balance.

Call her R. R was from an Eastern European country. We chit-chatted a lot, while she was taking my blood pressure readings and stuff. Lots of fun stories! But she relayed to me one of her first U.S. memories: She wanted to lose weight. She was impressed by some things the U.S. had to offer - \\"you have actual nutritional information on everything!\\" - and thus figured everything she encountered was on the level. And she found a \\"miracle cure\\" company who was along those lines! \\"These are AWESOME miracle shoe inserts! Wear them, and the pounds will melt away!\\" She saved her pennies and dimes; she sprung for the inserts. She received them... and they were shoe inserts; that much was true. But then there was their documentation: \\"using these insoles, combined with a 1200 calorie-per-day diet....\\" Like a 1200-calorie diet won't likely involve weight-loss, no matter what else you did, shoe inserts aside. The inserts did nothing, obviously. It was a sham. At which point she knew she was snookered, but really had no recourse. She wasn't explicit about it, but I got the feeling that it was a leading factor towards her chosen profession. \\"I might not have been the most sage medical person ever, but I'm gonna rectify that, and if ever I hear someone falling for that sort of gambit again, I'll be there to nip those sentiments in the bud with my own anecdotes.\\" Which is awesome.

A: OPT: a. ambient b. respiration c. graduation d. measurement Answer:","response":"d. measurement The process of making an observation in terms of a numerical scale and recording the value is known as measurement. Here's a step-by-step justification: Step 1: Choosing the appropriate numerical scale To measure something, we need to select an appropriate numerical scale that can be employed to represent the property or quantity being examined. This often involves defining the units we will use (e.g. meters, grams, degrees Celsius, etc.). Step 2: Observing and evaluating the property Next, we observe the property or quantity being measured, often using tools or instruments designed for this purpose (e.g. a ruler, balance, or thermometer). These tools help us gather accurate and consistent data. Step 3: Recording the value Once we have the numerical representation of the property or quantity, we record the value obtained. It's important to ensure that the value is written down with the correct units of measurement to avoid confusion. By following these steps, we can make an observation in terms of a numerical scale and accurately record its value as a measurement."},{"question":"BRABUS GmbH, founded 1977 in Bottrop (Ruhr Area), Germany, is a high-performance aftermarket tuning company which specializes in Mercedes-Benz, Smart, Tesla and Maybach vehicles.

Yes Based on the information provided in the paragraph, BRABUS GmbH was indeed founded in Germany. The text states that BRABUS was established in 1977 in Bottrop, a city that lies in the Ruhr Area of Germany. This automotive tuning company specializes in modifying Mercedes-Benz, Smart, Tesla and Maybach vehicles. Founded by Prof. Hartge and Mr. Buschmann, BRABUS has built a reputation as one of the most renowned tuners of Mercedes vehicles globally. Its operations grew rapidly due to its focus on producing high-performance aftermarket tuning parts primarily for Mercedes vehicles. Not only does BRABUS offer engine tuning, but it also provides a wide array of other modifications, including custom interiors, body kits, alloy wheels, and more. In recent years, the company has expanded its offerings to include tuning for Smart, Tesla, and Maybach vehicles as well. All the tuning methods used by BRABUS are characterized by the highest quality, excellent fit, and sophisticated functionality. BRABUS became the largest Mercedes tuner, eclipsed only by Mercedes-AMG. AMG started as an independent engineering firm specializing in performance improvements for Mercedes-Benz vehicles; thus, it was initially a competitor to BRABUS. However, in the 1990s Mercedes-AMG became a DaimlerChrysler affiliate, separating it from other third-party tuners like BRABUS.

The user's feedback, \\"Good Haven't used it yet!😌\\" is a bit contradictory, as they've provided a positive rating (\\"Good\\"), but also admitted they haven't yet used the application. As an AI, I cannot interpret emojis sentiment with certainty, though typically, the 😌 emoji is associated with feelings of calm or relaxation. Based on this information, it's unclear whether the user's positive rating is based on their impressions or potential of the app instead of actual usage. However, considering just the positive rating, one might be inclined to say 'Maybe' or even 'Yes'. This would be under the assumption that the reviewer is making a presumptive positive judgment about the app based on factors such as its description, other reviews, reputability, screenshots, or branding. On the other hand, considering the statement \\"Haven't used it yet,\\" we might be inclined to say 'No' or 'Definitely not', as we typically rely on firsthand experience when recommending something to others. In conclusion, given the conflicting parts of this review, the safest answer to the question - \\"Would you recommend this app to a friend?\\" would be 'Maybe', as it would be inappropriate to wholeheartedly recommend something based on a review where the user admits to not having used the app yet.

Answer:","response":"The first step of the rusting process, also known as corrosion, begins when water comes into contact with metal, specifically iron or iron-based materials. As water combines with carbon dioxide (CO2) present in the air, it leads to the formation of a weak carbonic acid (H2CO3). This acidic environment initiates the dissolution of iron atoms, which sets the stage for the subsequent events leading to the formation of iron oxide, commonly known as rust. In this step, water (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) react to form carbonic acid, which can be represented by the following chemical equation: H2O + CO2 → H2CO3 The formation of carbonic acid consequently leads to the reduction of the pH levels around the metal surface, making it more acidic and thus promoting the corrosion process. This conversion of water and carbon dioxide into carbonic acid is crucial in setting the conditions necessary for the subsequent chemical reactions that contribute to the overall rusting process. As a result, the first step of the process, which is the combination of water and carbon dioxide to form carbonic acid, plays an essential role in understanding the fundamental mechanism behind the corrosion of iron and related materials."},{"question":"Translate to Turkish: The country currently has few computer and internet users, mostly because of low living standards and the high cost of computers and internet use.

Answer the above question based on the context below: After two rainy summers in 1664 and 1665, London had lain under an exceptional drought since November 1665, and the wooden buildings were tinder-dry after the long hot summer of 1666. A fire broke out at Thomas Farriner's bakery in Pudding Lane a little after midnight on Sunday 2 September. The family was trapped upstairs but managed to climb from an upstairs window to the house next door, except for a maidservant who was too frightened to try, who became the first victim. The neighbours tried to help douse the fire; after an hour, the parish constables arrived and judged that the adjoining houses had better be demolished to prevent further spread. The householders protested, and Lord Mayor Sir Thomas Bloodworth was summoned, who alone had the authority to override their wishes. When Bloodworth arrived, the flames were consuming the adjoining houses and creeping towards the paper warehouses and flammable stores on the riverfront. The more experienced firemen were clamouring for demolition, but Bloodworth refused on the grounds that most premises were rented and the owners could not be found. Bloodworth is generally thought to have been appointed to the office of Lord Mayor as a yes man, rather than by possessing requisite capabilities for the job. He panicked when faced with a sudden emergency and, when pressed, made the oft-quoted remark, \\"Pish! A woman could piss it out\\", and left. After the City had been destroyed, Samuel Pepys looked back on the events and wrote in his diary on 7 September 1666: \\"People do all the world over cry out of the simplicity [the stupidity] of my Lord Mayor in general; and more particularly in this business of the fire, laying it all upon him.\\" Pepys was a senior official in the Navy Office by then, and he ascended the Tower of London on Sunday morning to view the fire from a turret. He recorded in his diary that the eastern gale had turned it into a conflagration. It had burned down several churches and, he estimated, 300 houses and reached the riverfront.

The film tells of two very different individuals who share a prison cell in Brazil during the Brazilian military government: Valentin Arregui, who is imprisoned (and has been tortured) due to his activities on behalf of a leftist revolutionary group, and Luis Molina, a transgender woman in prison for having sex with an underage boy. Molina, who self-identifies as \\"she,\\" passes the time by recounting memories from one of her favorite films, a wartime romantic thriller that's also a Nazi propaganda film. She weaves the characters into a narrative meant to comfort Valentin and distract him from the harsh realities of political imprisonment and separation from his lover, Marta. Valentin encourages Molina to have self-respect and opens her up to political commitment. Despite Valentin's occasionally snapping at Molina over her shallow views of film watching and unrealistic romance, an unlikely friendship develops between the two. As the story develops, it becomes clear that Valentin is being poisoned by his jailers to provide Molina with a chance to befriend him, and that Molina is spying on Valentin on behalf of the secret police. Molina has apparently been promised parole if she succeeds in obtaining information that will allow the secret police to break up the revolutionary group. When Molina declares herself in love with Valentin, a physical consummation of that love occurs on Molina's last night in prison. Molina is granted parole in a surprise move by the secret police. Valentin provides Molina with a telephone number and a message for his comrades. Molina at first refuses to take the number, fearing the consequences of treason, but she relents, bidding Valentin farewell with a kiss.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process The answer to this question is:","response":"directly impacting a step of the process The life cycle of a butterfly consists of several stages, each of which is vulnerable to various natural and human-caused factors. When human intervention is lowered, it can directly impact one or more steps in the butterfly's life cycle, potentially affecting the overall population of butterflies, resulting in changes in their numbers, distribution, and even the ecological balance within their habitats. Let's examine how directly impacting a step of the butterfly's life cycle can affect their population: 1. Egg: If human intervention reduces the application of pesticides and herbicides on plants or introduces measures to conserve the host plants, it may lead to an increase in the number of viable eggs laid by butterflies and a better survival rate for the eggs. This, in turn, will contribute to an increased number of butterflies emerging in the next generation. 2. Larva (Caterpillar): By reducing human-caused disturbances such as habitat destruction, fragmentation, and pollution, the survival rate of caterpillars may increase as they will face fewer threats in their environment. This could lead to an increased number of caterpillars successfully growing, feeding, and eventually transforming into adult butterflies. 3. Pupa: Just as with the previous stages, lowering human intervention can help improve the survival rate for pupae. Actions like reducing the use of harmful pesticides, preserving native plants, and maintaining healthy habitats can all contribute to a higher number of pupae successfully undergoing metamorphosis and becoming adult butterflies. 4. Adult Butterfly: Once butterflies emerge from their pupae, they rely on flowering plants for nectar, which provides energy for flying, mating, and laying eggs. By preserving and promoting native plants and reducing the use of pesticides and herbicides, humans can directly impact the survival of adult butterflies. This can lead to an increase in the overall butterfly population, as more adults survive, mate, and lay eggs to produce subsequent generations. It is essential to note that directly impacting a step in the butterfly's life cycle doesn't always guarantee a positive outcome for the butterfly population. Some human interventions could negatively affect the butterflies at various stages. For example, the introduction of non-native plants may cause butterflies to lay their eggs on unsuitable plants, which could result in the death of the caterpillars. Therefore, it is crucial to carefully consider any direct human intervention to ensure it benefits the butterfly populations rather than causing unintended harm."},{"question":"Read the article and select the best answer.

The premise states that the women are dressed in white and have white umbrellas, while the hypothesis only mentions that they have white umbrellas. The information about the women's clothing is missing in the hypothesis, but it doesn't contradict the premise. 3.

Use a variety of teaching methods: Different students have different learning styles, and it's essential for teachers to cater to these diverse needs. By using a mix of teaching strategies like lectures, group activities, hands-on experiments, and multimedia resources, teachers can better engage students and address their individual learning preferences. 3. Encourage active learning: Teachers should encourage students to take an active role in the learning process by prompting them to ask questions, participate in discussions, and work collaboratively with their peers. This approach promotes deeper understanding and long-term retention of the material. 4. Set clear expectations and provide feedback: Teachers should provide students with explicit learning objectives and expectations for performance. Regular formative assessment and feedback can help students understand their strengths and weaknesses, enabling them to work on areas that need improvement. 5. Foster critical thinking and problem-solving skills: Instead of merely teaching students to memorize and repeat information, teachers should focus on developing their analytical, critical thinking, and problem-solving abilities. This will not only help students absorb and apply new information more effectively but will also prepare them for life beyond the classroom. 6. Establish connections to real-life situations: By relating the material to real-world examples and applications, teachers can help students understand the relevance of the subject matter and increase their motivation to learn. 7. Encourage self-directed learning: Teachers should provide students with opportunities to explore their interests and set individual learning goals. This approach empowers students to take ownership of their education and develop intrinsic motivation to learn. 8. Provide support and resources: Teachers should be accessible and approachable, providing guidance and assistance when needed. Additionally, they should offer a variety of resources, such as textbooks, articles, videos, and online tools, to help students further their learning outside the classroom. In summary, the answer is \\"learn\\" because a teacher's main job in the classroom is to facilitate learning through various strategies and techniques that go beyond mere memorization. By creating a positive learning environment, using diverse teaching methods, promoting active learning, and fostering essential skills such as critical thinking and problem-solving, teachers can help students achieve a deep and lasting understanding of the material."},{"question":"Imagine a question and stream-of-consciousness explanation for which this is the answer: no","response":"Question: Is it possible for humans to survive without water?

Step 1: Define vermiculture Vermiculture is the process of using worms to decompose organic waste and convert it into nutrient-rich material. This material, known as vermicompost or worm castings, can be used as a natural fertilizer for plants, improving their overall health and growth. Step 2: Identify what is being cultivated Vermiculture primarily involves the cultivation of worms, specifically composting worms such as red wigglers (Eisenia fetida) and European nightcrawlers (Eisenia hortensis). These worms are efficient decomposers and can break down organic matter more effectively than regular composting methods.

These were located beside the coast at St Mildred's Bay, named after Mildrith, Thanet's patron saint and a one-time Abbess of Minster. The town inherited its name from the Westgate Manor, which was located in the area in medieval times. In the early 20th century, the remains of a Roman villa were discovered in what is now Beach Road, where a stream once used to flow. Fresh water can still be seen rising from the sand at low tide. During the late 1860s, businessmen developed the area into a seaside resort for the upper to middle-classes. A stretch of sea wall, with promenade on top, was constructed around the beaches at St Mildred's Bay and West Bay, and the land divided into plots to be sold for what would become an exclusive development by the sea for wealthy metropolitan families within a gated community, rather than for occasional tourists. The opening of a railway station, in 1871, led to the rapid expansion of the population, which reached 2,738 by 1901. The demands of the increasing population led to the building of the parish churches of St. James in 1872 and St. Saviour in 1884. St. Saviour's was designed by the architect C.N. Beazley. In 1884 it was reported that Essex, on the other side of the Thames Estuary, was hit by a tremor so large that it caused the bells of St. James' Church to ring. In 1884, ownership of most of the resort passed to Coutts Bank, after the previous proprietors had gone bankrupt.Around twenty schools were opened during the late 19th century, although many had only a few pupils or closed within a few years. The largest of the schools were Streete Court School, Wellington House Preparatory School and St Michael's School.Wellington House was established in 1886 by two clergymen, the Bull brothers. It closed in 1970 and was demolished in 1972. Notable old boys included Doctor Who actor Jon Pertwee and..., can you guess it ?

Therefore, considering the options provided: 1. Horizontal room: A horizontal room is generally any room that is wider than it is tall, but it does not necessarily have a panoramic view. 2. Storey book: This is not a valid option, as it seems to be a confusion of the terms \\"storey\\" (a level of a building) and \\"storybook\\" (a book containing stories). 3. Mall: While a mall is a large commercial building, it typically doesn't offer panoramic views, as its focus is on providing space for retail and entertainment establishments. 4. Tall building: This is the most suitable option among the ones provided. A tall building, such as a skyscraper or high-rise, would likely have several storeys with panoramic views of the surrounding area, especially if it features large windows or an observation deck. 5.

Options: (A) Decreases by 19% (B) Decreases by 25% (C) Increases by 6% (D) Increases by 19% (E) Increases by 25% Hmmm, my stream of consciousness:","response":"First let's determine the new length and width of the rectangle with respect to the changes. If the length (E) is decreased by 15%, then the new length can be represented as: 0.85 * E (since we're keeping 85% of the original length) If the width (W) is increased by 40%, then the new width can be represented as: 1.4 * W (since we're now having 140% of the original width) Now let's find the original area and the new area. Original area: A1 = E * W New area: A2 = (0.85E) * (1.4W) = 1.19 * E * W Now let's compare the two areas and find the percentage difference. Percentage difference = ((A2 - A1) / A1) * 100 = ((1.19 * E * W - E * W) / (E * W)) * 100 = ((1.19 - 1) * 100)% = 0.19 * 100% = 19% Therefore, the area of the rectangle increases by 19%.

This may help you more effectively catch a moth or moths. Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\" Acquaint yourself with moth social behavior before you begin catching them.\\"?","response":"Yes, based on the paragraph above, we can conclude that acquainting yourself with moth social behavior before you begin catching them would be appropriate. The paragraph emphasizes the importance of understanding the behavior of moths to more effectively catch the insects. By familiarizing yourself with their social behavior, you increase your chances of successfully capturing them. Expanding on this idea, one should consider the following aspects of moth behavior to improve their moth-catching abilities: 1. Habitat: Moths can be found in various habitats, including forests, meadows, and gardens. Research the specific species of moths you wish to catch and identify their preferred habitats to increase your likelihood of finding them. 2. Active Times: Many moth species are nocturnal, making nighttime the ideal time for catching them. However, some moths may be active during the day or particular periods of the night. Determine the activity patterns of the moths you are targeting to plan your moth-catching expedition accordingly. 3. Attraction to Light: Moths are often drawn to sources of light. To take advantage of this behavior, set up a bright light, like a white or mercury vapor light, in an area where moths are known to be present. The light will attract moths, making it easier for you to catch them. 4. Pheromone Traps: The use of pheromone traps is another method for catching moths. These traps contain a specific chemical scent that attracts moths of a certain species. Setting up pheromone traps can be a more targeted approach to catching particular moth species and can prove effective when used in conjunction with other methods. 5. Observation and Patience: Moth catching often involves observing the insects in their natural environment before attempting to catch them. This will provide insights into their behavior, movements, and patterns, enabling you to predict where they may be at any given time. Patience is essential when trying to catch moths; rushing or making sudden movements may startle them and make it more difficult to successfully capture them. By following these steps and acquainting yourself with the social behavior of moths, you will be more prepared and skilled to catch them. Remember, understanding their behavior is crucial for success in any moth-catching endeavor."},{"question":"What happens next? How to get rid of a uti fast Recognize the symptoms.

Usually, it will clear up on its own within a few days.;","response":"To get rid of a UTI fast, follow the steps below: 1. Consult a healthcare professional: As soon as you notice symptoms of a UTI, consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis. They will likely collect a urine sample to confirm the presence of bacteria and recommend appropriate treatment. 2. Antibiotics: Your doctor may prescribe a course of antibiotics to treat the infection. It is crucial to complete the full course as prescribed, even if you start feeling better before it's finished, to ensure the infection is properly treated and prevent recurrence or antibiotic resistance. 3. Increase water intake: Drink plenty of fluids, especially water, to help flush bacteria from your urinary system. Aim for at least eight 8-ounce glasses of water per day. Drinking more water will also result in more frequent urination, which can help eliminate the bacteria causing the infection. 4. Use a heating pad: Applying a heating pad to your lower abdomen can help alleviate pain and discomfort associated with a UTI. Make sure to place a layer of clothing or a towel between the heating pad and your skin to prevent burns. 5. Avoid irritants: During a UTI, it's essential to avoid bladder irritants, such as caffeine, alcohol, and acidic or spicy foods, which can worsen your symptoms. Stick to a mild, balanced diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. 6. Take over-the-counter pain relievers: Non-prescription pain medications like ibuprofen, acetaminophen, or naproxen can help alleviate pain and discomfort caused by the UTI. Always follow the dosage instructions on the label and consult your healthcare provider to ensure these medications won't interfere with any other medicines you may be taking. 7. Avoid holding in urine: Holding in urine for an extended period can lead to a buildup of bacteria, worsening the infection. Make it a point to empty your bladder as soon as you feel the need to urinate. 8. Maintain proper hygiene: Make sure to keep your genital area clean and dry. Wipe from front to back after using the toilet to prevent bacteria from entering the urethra. Additionally, opt for mild, fragrance-free soaps and avoid using irritants such as bubble baths, douches, and scented feminine products. 9. Wear loose, breathable clothing: Tight clothing can create a moist environment that promotes bacterial growth. Opt for loose, cotton underwear and breathable fabrics to help prevent UTIs. 10. Take a probiotic: Probiotics contain good bacteria that can help maintain a healthy balance of bacteria in your urogenital tract. Incorporating a probiotic supplement or consuming probiotic-rich foods, such as yogurt or kefir, may support your recovery process. While these steps can help in getting rid of a UTI fast, it is vital to follow your healthcare professional's recommendations and continue monitoring your symptoms. If you do not notice improvement or if your symptoms worsen, seek medical attention immediately.

So, the result for this list is 100. 2. For the second list: [-50, 48, 13]. The even numbers are -50 and 48. Multiply them together to get -2400. So, the result for this list is -2400. 3. The third list: [1, 13]. There are no even numbers in the list, so the result is 0. 4. The fourth list: [-34, 37, 8]. The even numbers are -34 and 8. Multiply them together to get -272. So, the result for this list is -272. 5. The fifth list: [-46, 11, -42]. The even numbers are -46 and -42. Multiply them together to get 1932. So, the result for this list is 1932. 6. The sixth list: [48, 28]. The even numbers are 48 and 28. Multiply them together to get 1344. So, the result for this list is 1344. 7. The seventh list: [-46, -50, 19]. The even numbers are -46 and -50. Multiply them together to get 2300. So, the result for this list is 2300. 8. The eighth list: [44, -33, -24, -23, 16]. The even numbers are 44, -24, and 16. Multiply them together to get -16896. So, the result for this list is -16896. 9. The ninth list: [-24, 48, -34]. The even numbers are -24, 48, and -34. Multiply them together to get 39168. So the result for this list is 39168. 10. The tenth list: [-41, -31, -6]. The even number is -6. So the result for this list is -6. So, after doing the required operation on each inner list, the final output will be a list with results for each inner list: [100, -2400, 0, -272, 1932, 1344, 2300, -16896, 39168, -6]. That is the result expected from this task. Remember, for an integer to be considered even, it must be divisible by 2. If an integer is not divisible by 2, it's considered odd."},{"question":"Article: The best that can be said about the House-Senate budget deal announced late Tuesday is that it includes no tax increases, no new incentives for not working, and some modest entitlement reforms. Oh, and it will avoid another shutdown fiasco, assuming enough Republicans refuse to attempt suicide a second time. The worst part of the two-year deal is that it breaks the 2011 Budget Control Act's discretionary spending caps for fiscal years 2014 and 2015. The deal breaks the caps by some 63 billion over the two years and then... ||||| 2013 has not been a pleasant year if you work for the federal government. You’ve been subject to pay freezes, furloughs and shutdowns. One of you got yelled at by a Tea Party Republican at the World War II memorial. And if Congress passes the budget deal announced Tuesday night by Rep. Paul Ryan and Sen. Patty Murray – a big if – you will get a final Christmas present: You’ll have to pay more into your pension, an effective wage cut that just adds to the 114 billion, with a \\"B,\\" federal employees have already given back to the government in the name of deficit reduction. The deal between House and Senate negotiators Ryan and Murray would reverse part of sequestration for 2014 and 2015, itself a major source of pain for federal workers. But negotiators want to pay for that relief in future years, with the overall package cutting the deficit by an additional 23 billion. And one of the major “pay-fors” is an increase in federal employee pension contributions. President Obama’s 2014 budget included such a proposal, which would have raised the employee contribution in three stages, from 0.8 percent of salary to 2 percent. Congress had already made this shift for new hires; the Obama proposal would affect all workers hired before 2012. That proposed increased contribution translated to a 1.2 percent pay cut, and a total of around 20 billion in givebacks over 10 years. Negotiators were pressured by the powerful Maryland Democratic delegation, including Minority Leader Steny Hoyer, House Budget Committee ranking member Chris Van Hollen and Senate Appropriations Committee chairwoman Barbara Mikulski, into softening the blow on federal employees, many of whom live in their districts. According to Sen. Murray, the increase in contributions now equals about 6 billion over 10 years. But negotiators traded some of the cuts to federal employee pensions with different cuts to military pensions, also totaling 6 billion. So whatever the occupation, people who work for the government will bear the brunt of the pain. A small pay cut doesn’t sound like much. But you have to add that to the pile of hits federal workers have taken over the past several years. Government pay has been frozen since January 2010. The only way you’ve gotten a raise over the last four years if you work for the government is if you received a promotion or a similar advance. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that this has reduced the purchasing power of a government salary by over 7 percent since 2010. The deal to avoid the government shutdown in October finally broke this fever with a 1 percent pay raise starting in January. This budget deal would wipe much of that out. Pay freezes are just the beginning. In February, hundreds of thousands of federal workers were forced into unpaid furloughs in accordance with sequestration’s across-the-board budget cuts. In virtually every federal agency, workers had to take as many as 15 unpaid days off during the last fiscal year. Then, when the government shutdown occurred, workers were again sent home without knowing if they would ever get paid for the missed time. The lack of cash flow stressed workers and made it difficult to pay bills on time. Fortunately, Congress did provide back pay for the 6.6 million work days missed during the shutdown. However, that comes out of agency budgets, and workers have to still complete their tasks without the ability to hire additional personnel to make up the time. The Federal Workers Alliance, a coalition of unions representing federal employees, estimated in a message to the budget negotiators that between the pay freeze and furloughs, federal employees have sacrificed 114 billion in pay cuts over the past three years, an average of over 50,000 per employee. Yet somehow, budget negotiators are going to the well again. It’s notable that this attack targets public pensions, which have been under assault all over the country. Last week, a federal bankruptcy judge allowed Detroit to enter bankruptcy and impair pensions for city workers and retirees, and Illinois passed a sweeping law that would cut pensions significantly. Both of those states have constitutional protections preventing cuts to pensions, but no matter. Now, under the proposed budget deal, federal pensions would be subject to higher employee contributions. The Federal Workers Alliance notes that the average annual pension benefit for federal employees is just 12,800 per year. The proposed increased costs amount to close to hundreds of dollars a year in lost take-home pay without any increase to that meager benefit. Moreover, they represent a weakening of public pensions generally, at a time when the loss of pensions in the private sector, in favor of shaky 401(k)-style plans, has contributed to a retirement crisis. The threat to a dignified end of life is now coming to government workers, who explicitly forgo wages in exchange for the promise of a modest retirement benefit. Sequestration in 2014 was scheduled to squeeze agency budgets even more. The budget cuts are larger, particularly on the military side. Cuts from 2013 sequestration have not been fully implemented, and agencies were able to shuffle around money to lessen the pain in ways that would not be available to them next year. All this means that a full sequestration in 2014 would have, in all likelihood, lead to layoffs. Now, just as Congress closes in on limited relief from sequestration, workers are told they’ll have to pay for some of that relief themselves. You could probably find some federal workers to blame for the economic predicament in which we find ourselves, but those would be members of Congress. By contrast, federal employees, who inspect our food, work in veterans hospitals, investigate crimes at the FBI and generally ensure the smooth functioning of essential government services, have been blasted over and over again, as if their pay and benefits packages are a cookie jar to be repeatedly raided by Congress. This has led to terrible morale for federal workers, and a difficulty in finding and recruiting new talent. Federal retirements have risen as workers cash out rather than subject themselves to more stings. If you wanted to devalue the role of government from the inside out, what we’ve done to federal employees over the past few years would be the perfect blueprint. President Obama just gave a speech highlighting inequality as “the defining challenge of our time.” If he signs a budget deal that knocks federal employees once again, he will have contributed to the continued hollowing out of the middle class, which after all is one of the biggest causes of inequality. If you cannot secure the promise of a decent living and an honest retirement even by working for the government, then there’s little hope that we can arrest this growing split between the ultra-rich and everybody else. |||||Summary:","response":"The House-Senate budget deal announced in late 2013 features no tax increases and modest entitlement reforms while avoiding a government shutdown.

After several small tests to determine Rodrigo's trustworthiness, he suggests a partnership, to which Rodrigo quickly agrees. Although Rodrigo distrusts Richard greatly, he agrees to partner him on a gigantic scam, provided he gets a percentage of the money gained to help his ailing father, who is in trouble because of his gambling debts.

Step 1: Understand the question The question seeks to find the option that requires less water and is more likely to survive in a drought. Step 2: Gather information about roundworms and shrub beds Roundworms are microscopic organisms that typically live in moist environments, whereas shrub beds are a type of landscaping consisting of various shrubs and plants that can be adapted to different climates and water requirements. Step 3: Compare water requirements Roundworms require moisture to move and reproduce, although they can survive in dry conditions by entering a dormant state. The water requirements of shrub beds vary depending on the type of shrubs and plants used. Drought-tolerant shrubs and plants can survive with little water and are well-adapted to arid environments. Step 4: Determine which option is better suited for drought conditions Given that drought-tolerant shrub beds will need less water compared to roundworms (which depend on moisture), the better answer to the question is shrub beds. A well-planned shrub bed with drought-tolerant plants is more likely to survive in a drought than roundworms that require moisture for their normal activities.

So you want to know if there is any evidence that shows the current laws do not do a good job stopping or punishing bullying, right? I will explain it to you like you're five years old. Imagine you are in school, and you see a bigger kid teasing and bothering a smaller kid. This is called bullying. There are some rules, or laws, to try to stop this from happening or to punish the bully if they continue. But sometimes, these rules don't work well enough, and that's what the claim is saying. Now, if we see why some people believe this, here are few reasons: 1. Different places, different rules: Laws are not the same everywhere. Some places may have strict rules against bullying, while others may not. This can make it easier for bullies to get away with their behavior. 2. Not enough understanding: Sometimes, the people who need to know the rules (like teachers, parents, and students) might not be aware of them or how to use them properly. This can also make it harder to stop bullying. 3. Hard to prove: When someone is bullied, it can sometimes be difficult to show clear evidence or proof. Since many cases of bullying happen in private or over the internet, it might be hard to collect enough evidence to punish the bully. 4. No harsh consequences for bullies: Even if a bully is caught and punished, sometimes the punishment might not be strong enough to make them stop bullying or to show others that bullying is not okay. Because of all these reasons, some people think that current laws cannot prevent or punish bullying the way they should. And that's why they say laws need to be improved or changed to better protect kids from bullying."},{"question":"In the show's final minutes, the crew stand dumbfounded that they have finally returned home after seven years lost in the Delta Quadrant and are greeted by a fleet of Starfleet vessels that had arrived to fight the Borg.

They’ve given me a special vantage point onto people’s temperaments and tics, especially (but not solely) in regard to eating and food. On top of a culinary education, I have gotten something of a psychological, sociological and anthropological one. I learned that the world is divided into the hoarders and the sharers, and into the perpetually slighted and the eternally grateful; that the diners who eat the least are the ones who pretend to eat the most; and that no manner of advance instruction can prevent guests from saying your real name and even referencing your last three reviews loudly, repeatedly and in direct earshot of the restaurant manager. There’s a reason most people don’t go into the spying business. They have no aptitude for it. I learned that the desire to turn everything into a competition runs just as deep as the impulse toward ownership, at least in America. “First, second, third, fourth” was a string of words I heard time and again, as someone at the table took it upon himself or herself to rank the appetizers in precise order of appeal — and then to do the same, 45 minutes later, with the entrees. For many tablemates, saying yea or nay to a dish wasn’t judgment enough. They itched to dole out medals: gold to the squid à la plancha, bronze to the beets. I learned, too, that there is little sense to the eating rules many people adopt and to the peeves and peccadilloes they nurse. My friend K. swore off veal, citing her sorrow for calves that would never grow to be (slaughtered) steers, but she ate young chicken and the littlest of lambs. She also ate foie gras, though animal rights advocates have protested the treatment of the ducks used to make it more vociferously than they have the lot of those calves. My frequent companion T. ordered foie gras whenever he had the chance and thrilled to the presence of calf’s liver on a menu, but he spurned sweetbreads, on account of their being organ meat. I had more than a few companions who rejected food based solely on its texture (eggplant dip), shape (tendrils of octopus) or color (uni). And while my friend M. had no complaint when duck, lamb or pork came to the table in slices, she fumed if her steak arrived as anything other than one solid slab of meat, feeling insulted and infantilized by the cutting of it before it reached her. People are as strange about eating as they are about love. They want what they want. Dining with a critic doesn’t exactly facilitate that. I typically ate out with three other people, so a large number of dishes could be tried, and began each meal by telling my guests which dishes should or shouldn’t be ordered, in accordance with my progress through the menu on any earlier visits. “So I can’t get the steak?” my friend R. said one night, his pout so pronounced he was like a male Jolie: Mangelina. I apologized. I explained: I’d capitulated to the last steak maniac, on the second visit to the restaurant, and there really, truly, honestly wasn’t any way to justify a third examination of the steak. “Oh, O.K., I understand,” he sighed, not sounding O.K. at all, and making me feel like the Grinch Who Stole Sirloin. Many guests, I could tell, experienced a kind of cognitive dissonance over being treated to a meal in a restaurant — which is, after all, a theater of pleasure — but having to follow the precise, constricting script of a petty culinary dictator (that would be me). Maybe the hoarders were just struggling with that confusion. When they liked the dish in front of them, they’d forget that they were supposed to eat no more than a quarter of it, to preserve enough for the other three diners, including me, to have a good taste. “Oh, I lost track!” they’d say as they passed a nearly empty plate. The sharers, in contrast, would be so frightened of consuming so much as a strand of angel hair beyond their allotment that they’d merely stare at the dish, visibly petrified. I’d say: “Please, please have some. You didn’t have any.” “But I did,” they’d usually protest. “Didn’t you see?” In fact I had been watching, and my observation, coupled with the survival of a full portion on the plate, was how I knew that nothing had been consumed. The pretend eaters who amused me the most, though, were the skinny men and women who had developed a whole theatrical routine — a pantomime of gluttony — to obscure their asceticism. It wasn’t enough for them to be thin; they had to pretend that it was a fluke of metabolism, magical and effortless. My friend A. was like that. I told her that we were going to a new steakhouse in Brooklyn. “Steak!” she exulted. “Excellent! You’re too good to me!” Reading the menu, she homed in on what promised to be the heftiest cut of beef: “Can we get the porterhouse for two? Oh please, oh please! And the fries? I’m dying to try the fries.” We got the porterhouse, we got the fries, she loaded up her plate, and then she commenced such frantic knife and fork movements that a veritable cloud of dust rose around her — I was reminded of a Road Runner cartoon. When the dust settled 15 minutes later, I took a close look at her plate, and almost nothing was missing. The food had just been reconstituted and rearranged, a Picasso of its former self. Some companions kept track and kept count. They noticed if the four restaurants they’d accompanied me to all wound up with one-star ratings, and they wondered whom I’d taken to the restaurant that just got three stars. Guilt more than girth is a critic’s fiercest enemy. But dining with a critic just as frequently brought out the protective, gallant side of friends. One frequent review accomplice noticed early on, and without my saying anything, that I felt abashed and anxious about my role as portion policeman. So he did the job himself, reprimanding hoarders and reassuring sharers. I, in turn, tried not to throw more one-star than two-star restaurants his way. Companions were fixated on stars, their obsessions underscoring a human itch to codify, categorize, rank and render a verdict. Often, toward the end of a meal, I’d catch one of them making odd, half-hidden hand signals in his or her lap, flashing one finger, then two — or two fingers, then three — while watching for me to shake or nod my head. The companion wanted to know what the star rating was likely to be. Sometimes I obliged, but usually not. But what fascinated me most was the inherent resistance to setting aside individual will for communal mission. When a meal began, I’d always explain that everything we ordered would be shared equally, so it didn’t matter who actually asked for the lobster versus who took charge of the vegetarian cassoulet. This explanation seldom made a difference. “Remember, I don’t eat pork,” L. said one night when I asked if she’d be the one to request the pork entree I needed to try. “Yes, yes, of course,” I sputtered apologetically. While the pork would rotate to her at some point, it seemed fair enough that she not begin with it. “You ask for the salmon. I’ll ask for the pork.” Then I turned to another tablemate and instructed him to order the nightly pasta special. “You’ve already tried the rib-eye on another visit?” he asked, clearly bummed to be missing the steak. No one ever, ever wanted to miss the steak. I told him that I had not, in fact, tried the rib-eye — “I saved it for all of you tonight!” I crowed — but was going to assign it to our fourth tablemate, who then piped up to say that he would be more than willing to trade it away for the pasta if that was best. He didn’t sound willing at all. “Remember, you’re all just temporary custodians of the dish you’re asking for,” I said, “and won’t eat more or less than a quarter of what’s randomly in front of you.” I was putting the hoarders on notice and the sharers at ease. I was also, apparently, bucking human nature. Each guest seemed to think that what he or she wound up ordering was a matter of identity, a reflection of self. And more often than not, he or she would go on to describe and defend that dish as the very best. Even if it wasn’t the steak.

Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context? A: support quinn B: resent quinn C: avoid quinn A:","response":"The best answer to the question \\"What will Tracy want to do next?\\" according to the context provided is answer A: \\"support Quinn.\\" The context provided suggests a positive relationship between Tracy and Quinn, with Quinn being smart and thus likely to make good decisions, and Tracy in the role of providing advice indicates that Tracy is in a supportive or mentor-like role. Given no indications to the contrary, it is reasonable to infer from the information provided that Tracy would want to continue in this supportive role. Now, let's analyze each option: A: Support Quinn - This is the most logical continuation of the relationship as presented in the context. Tracy has provided advice, which Quinn has followed, suggesting a positive and possibly ongoing relationship of guidance or mentorship. As such, Tracy's next step would be to continue supporting Quinn. B: Resent Quinn - There is nothing in the context that suggests that Tracy would have any reason to resent Quinn. Tracy provided advice, and Quinn followed it, respecting Tracy's advice shows a positive interaction between the two. C: Avoid Quinn - Similarly to option B, there is no indication in the context that Tracy would want to avoid Quinn. On the contrary, the fact that Tracy offered advice suggests that they want to be involved in Quinn's decisions or life, and therefore, Tracy would not wish to avoid Quinn. Based on the context given, the situation seems to depict a relationship of trust and mutual respect. Following someone's advice often means that one recognizes the other person as wise or knowledgeable, and since Quinn chooses to follow Tracy's advice, it can be seen that Quinn trusts Tracy and Tracy would like to continue these acts of support or guidance. Thus, from the context, answer A \\"support Quinn\\" makes the most sense as the most probable action for Tracy to take next, keeping in alignment with their earlier supportive behaviour of offering advice."},{"question":"David: Attached is an example of the \\"tainted swaption\\".

During the composer's lifetime his Henry VIII became a repertory piece; since his death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, Ascanio (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work. The critic Ronald Crichton writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns \\"lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior\\". In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: \\"Saint-Saëns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics\\". Saint-Saëns's biographer James Harding comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of La princesse jaune, which Harding describes as like Sullivan \\"with a light French touch\\".Although most of Saint-Saëns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as \\"a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s\\". In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music – \\"lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content ... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable.\\" Stylistically, Saint-Saëns drew on a range of models. From Meyerbeer he drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece; for Henry VIII he included Tudor music he had researched in London; in La princesse jaune he used an oriental pentatonic scale; from Wagner he derived the use of leitmotifs, which, like Massenet, he used sparingly. Huebner observes that Saint-Saëns was more conventional than Massenet so far as through composition is concerned, more often favouring discrete arias and ensembles, with less..., what would be the answer ?

Ryan now lives alone and is hated by his neighbors; Bill Weaver (Gil Bellows), a local police officer, appears to be Ryan's only supporter. The mother-daughter relationship becomes rocky and Elissa starts dating Ryan against her mother's wishes, finding Ryan to be lonely but a sweet boy. Ryan confides in her that he accidentally injured Carrie-Ann by allowing her to fall from a swing when they were little; he was supposed to be watching her while their parents were getting high on drugs. The resulting brain damage from the accident made her extremely aggressive, leading to their parents' murder.

Doménikos Theotokópoulos (Greek: Δομήνικος Θεοτοκόπουλος [ðoˈminikos θeotoˈkopulos]; October 1541 – 7 April 1614), most widely known as El Greco (\\"The Greek\\"), was a Greek painter, sculptor and architect of the Spanish Renaissance. \\"El Greco\\" was a nickname, a reference to his Greek origin, and the artist normally signed his paintings with his full birth name in Greek letters, Δομήνικος Θεοτοκόπουλος, Doménikos Theotokópoulos, often adding the word Κρής Krēs, Cretan. El Greco was born in the Kingdom of Candia, which was at that time part of the Republic of Venice, and the center of Post-Byzantine art. He trained and became a master within that tradition before traveling at age 26 to Venice, as other Greek artists had done. In 1570 he moved to Rome, where he opened a workshop and executed a series of works. During his stay in Italy, El Greco enriched his style with elements of Mannerism and of the Venetian Renaissance taken from a number of great artists of the time, notably Tintoretto. In 1577, he moved to Toledo, Spain, where he lived and worked until his death. In Toledo, El Greco received several major commissions and produced his best-known paintings. El Greco's dramatic and expressionistic style was met with puzzlement by his contemporaries but found appreciation in the 20th century. El Greco is regarded as a precursor of both Expressionism and Cubism, while his personality and works were a source of inspiration for poets and writers such as Rainer Maria Rilke and Nikos Kazantzakis. El Greco has been characterized by modern scholars as an artist so individual that he belongs to no conventional school. He is best known for tortuously elongated figures and often fantastic or phantasmagorical pigmentation, marrying Byzantine traditions with those of Western painting.

The Shinto shrine of Ise-Shima, also known as Ise Grand Shrine or Ise Jingu, is located in the city of Ise in Mie Prefecture, Japan. This shrine is one of the most important and holiest sites in the Shinto religion and is dedicated to the sun goddess Amaterasu. It consists of 125 shrines, with the main ones being the Inner Shrine (Naiku) and the Outer Shrine (Geku). The mirror in question may be related to Yata no Kagami, one of the three sacred treasures of Japan (Sanshu no Jingi). These treasures represent the Imperial Regalia of Japan, which includes the Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi sword, the Yasakani no Magatama jewel, and the Yata no Kagami mirror. The mirror is said to represent wisdom and is believed to have been given to Amaterasu's grandson, Ninigi-no-Mikoto, by the goddess herself. The mirror has significant symbolism in Shinto belief, as it is supposed to embody Amaterasu's spirit and be a conduit to communicate with her. While it is not confirmed that the Yata no Kagami mirror is housed at the Ise Grand Shrine, it is believed that the shrine holds a replica of the sacred mirror. The Ise Grand Shrine is rebuilt every 20 years, following a tradition called Shikinen Sengu, which is a form of ritual renewal. This practice dates back more than a thousand years and is meant to symbolize the renewal of nature and the passing of knowledge and skill from one generation to another. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the statement \\"The mirror has been present at this Shinto shrine for decades\\" is valid. In conclusion, if the mirror mentioned refers to Yata no Kagami or a replica of the sacred treasure, then it is correct to say that the mirror has been present at the Shinto shrine of Ise-Shima for decades. The Ise Grand Shrine's importance and reverence in the Shinto religion, combined with the Shikinen Sengu tradition of renewing the shrine every 20 years, ensures the continuity and preservation of the sacred mirror's presence within the holy site."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Information: - The Doric order was one of the three orders of ancient Greek or classical architecture; the other two canonical orders were the Ionic and the Corinthian. The Doric is most easily recognised by the simple circular capitals at the top of columns. It was the earliest and in its essence the simplest of the orders, though still with complex details in the entablature above. - The Renaissance was a period in European history, from the 14th to the 17th century, regarded as the cultural bridge between the Middle Ages and modern history. It started as a cultural movement in Italy in the Late Medieval period and later spread to the rest of Europe, marking the beginning of the Early Modern Age. - The Ionic order forms one of the three classical orders of classical architecture, the other two canonic orders being the Doric and the Corinthian. There are two lesser orders: the Tuscan (a plainer Doric), and the rich variant of Corinthian called the composite order, both added by 16th-century Italian architectural writers, based on Roman practice. The Ionic columns are the thinnest and smallest columns out of the three canonic orders. - Classical architecture usually denotes architecture which is more or less consciously derived from the principles of Greek and Roman architecture of classical antiquity, or sometimes even more specifically, from the works of Vitruvius. Different styles of classical architecture have arguably existed since the Carolingian Renaissance, and prominently since the Italian Renaissance. Although classical styles of architecture can vary greatly, they can in general all be said to draw on a common \\"vocabulary\\" of decorative and constructive elements. In much of the Western world, different classical architectural styles have dominated the history of architecture from the Renaissance until the second world war, though it continues to inform many architects to this day. - Architecture (Latin \\"architectura\\", from the Greek \\"arkhitekton\\" \\"architect\\", from - \\"chief\\" and \\"builder\\") is both the process and the product of planning, designing, and constructing buildings and other physical structures. Architectural works, in the material form of buildings, are often perceived as cultural symbols and as works of art. Historical civilizations are often identified with their surviving architectural achievements. - \\"\\"An Order in architecture is a certain assemblage of parts subject to uniform established proportions, regulated by the office that each part has to perform\\".\\" The Architectural Orders are the ancient styles of classical architecture, each distinguished by its proportions and characteristic profiles and details, and most readily recognizable by the type of column employed. Three ancient orders of architecturethe Doric, Ionic, and Corinthianoriginated in Greece. To these the Romans added, in practice if not in name, the Tuscan, which they made simpler than Doric, and the Composite, which was more ornamental than the Corinthian. The Architectural Order of a classical building is akin to the mode or key of classical music, the grammar or rhetoric of a written composition. It is established by certain \\"modules\\" like the intervals of music, and it raises certain expectations in an audience attuned to its language. - The composite order is a mixed order , combining the volutes of the Ionic order capital with the acanthus leaves of the Corinthian order . The composite order volutes are larger , however , and the composite order also has echinus molding with egg - and - dart ornamentation between the volutes . The column of the composite order is ten diameters high . Until the Renaissance , the composite was not ranked as a separate order . Instead it was considered as a late Roman form of the Corinthian order . The Arch of Titus , in the forum in Rome , built in 82 AD , is considered the first example of a composite order . The composite order , due to its delicate appearance , was deemed by the Renaissance to be suitable for the building of churches dedicated to The Virgin Mary or other female saints . Sebastiano Serlio ( 1475 -- 1554 ) published his book I sette libri d'architettura in 1537 in which he was the second to mention the composite order as its own order and not just as an evolution of the Corinthian order as previously suggested by Leon Battista Alberti . Leon Battista Alberti in his De re aedificatoria ( English : On the Art of Building ) mentions the composite order , calling it \`\` Italic '' . Bramante ( 1444 -- 1514 ) used the composite order in the second order of the cloister of Santa Maria della Pace , Rome . For the first order , the Ionic order was used . Francesco Borromini ( 1599 -- 1667 ) developed the composite order in San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane , Rome ( 1638 ) . The interior of the church has 16 composite columns . The load - bearing columns placed underneath the arches have inverted volutes . This choice was highly criticised at the time , thinking it was a lack of knowledge of the Vittruvian orders that led him to his decision . The inverted volutes can also be seen in Borromini 's Oratorio dei Filippini in the lower order . There the controversy was even higher , considering that Borromini also removed the acanthus leaves , leaving a bare capital . - The Tuscan order is in effect a simplified Doric order, with un-fluted columns and a simpler entablature with no triglyphs or guttae. It was not one of the three orders of classical architecture described by the Roman architect Vitruvius; these were the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian. Instead the Tuscan order, presented as a standardized formal order, is an invention of Italian Renaissance writers largely motivated by nationalism. However, relatively simple columns with round capitals had been part of the vernacular architecture of Italy and much of Europe since at least Etruscan architecture. - A column or pillar in architecture and structural engineering is a structural element that transmits, through compression, the weight of the structure above to other structural elements below. In other words, a column is a compression member. The term column applies especially to a large round support (the \\"shaft\\" of the column) with a capital and a \\"base\\" or pedestal and made of stone, or appearing to be so. A small wooden or metal support is typically called a post, and supports with a rectangular or other non-round section are usually called piers. For the purpose of wind or earthquake engineering, columns may be designed to resist lateral forces. Other compression members are often termed \\"columns\\" because of the similar stress conditions. Columns are frequently used to support beams or arches on which the upper parts of walls or ceilings rest. In architecture, \\"column\\" refers to such a structural element that also has certain proportional and decorative features. A column might also be a decorative element not needed for structural purposes; many columns are \\"engaged\\", that is to say form part of a wall. - The Corinthian order is the last developed of the three principal classical orders of ancient Greek and Roman architecture. The other two are the Doric order which was the earliest, followed by the Ionic order. When classical architecture was revived during the Renaissance, two more orders were added to the canon, the Tuscan order and the Composite order. The Corinthian, with its offshoot the Composite, is the most ornate of the orders, characterized by slender fluted columns and elaborate capitals decorated with acanthus leaves and scrolls.

Choose the right sandpaper: First, pick the right type of sandpaper for your job. Sandpaper comes in different grit numbers, which show how rough or smooth the sandpaper is. A lower grit number (like 60 or 80) is more rough, while a higher grit number (like 180 or 220) is smoother. 2. Prepare the surface: Before you start sanding, make sure the surface you want to sand is clean and dry. Remove any dirt, dust, or loose paint. 3. Hold the sandpaper: Wrap the sandpaper around a sanding block (a small, flat piece of wood or foam). This helps you hold the sandpaper better and also helps to make a flat and even surface when you sand. 4. Sand in one direction: Start sanding the surface gently by moving the sandpaper in one direction. Imagine you're petting a cat, and you want to go in the direction of its fur. Going in one direction will help avoid scratches. 5. Check your progress: Periodically stop and check to see if the surface has become smoother and if any uneven areas have been removed. When you're happy with the result, you can stop sanding. 6. Clean up: After you've finished sanding, use a soft brush or cloth to clean the surface and remove any leftover dust. 7. If needed, repeat: If you started with a rougher sandpaper and need a smoother finish, switch to a higher grit number sandpaper and repeat the above steps. Remember, always be gentle when you sand, and take your time. Happy sanding!"},{"question":"In computer networking, a wireless access point (WAP), or more generally just access point (AP), is a networking hardware device that allows a Wi-Fi device to connect to a wired network.

Article: \\"I left Tangier, my birthplace, the 13th of June 1325 with the intention of making the pilgrimage to Mecca... to leave all my friends both female and male, to abandon my home as birds abandon their nests.\\" So begins an old manuscript in a library in Paris-the travel journal of Ibn Battuta. Almost two centuries before Columbus, Ibn Battuta set off for Mecca, returning home three decades later as one of history's great travelers. Driven by curiosity, he journeyed to remote comers of the Islamic world, traveling through 44 modern countries, three times as far as Marco Polo. Little celebrated in the West, his name is well known among Arabs. In his hometown of Tangier, a square, a hotel, a cafe, a ferry boat, and even a hamburger are named after him. Ibn Battuta stayed in Mecca as a student for several years, but the urge to travel soon took over. In one adventure, he traveled to India seeking profitable employment with the sultan of Delhi.On the way, he described his group being attacked in the open country by 80 men on foot, and two horsemen. \\"We fought... killing one of their horsemen and about twelve of the foot soldiers... I was hit by an arrow and my horse by another, but God in his grace preserved me... \\". In Delhi, the sultan gave him the position of judge, based on his _ study at Mecca.

Options: - press conference - globular cluster - on the milky way - heavens - night sky Reasoning process:","response":"To answer the question, let's analyze each option and see which makes the most sense: 1. Press conference: A press conference is an event where people from the media gather to ask questions to someone, usually a famous or influential person. If \\"star\\" refers to a celebrity or famous person, this is where the star could be walking and interacting with people. This option is viable in the context of a celebrity. 2. Globular cluster: A globular cluster is a spherical collection of thousands to millions of stars that are tightly bound together, usually found around a galactic core. If \\"star\\" refers to an astronomical object, this is where a star could be in a fixed position, but not \\"walking\\" as stars don't physically walk or move in that manner. Thus, this option is unlikely to be the correct answer. 3. On the Milky Way: The Milky Way is a spiral galaxy that contains our solar system and is home to approximately 100-400 billion stars. If \\"star\\" refers to an astronomical object, it could be in the Milky Way, but again, the term \\"walking\\" does not apply to stars moving in space. Therefore, this option is also unlikely to be correct. 4. Heavens: Heavens is a term often used to describe the skies or the universe beyond Earth's atmosphere. It can also refer to the celestial realm, such as in religious or spiritual contexts. If \\"star\\" refers to an astronomical object, it might be in the heavens, but like options 2 and 3, the term \\"walking\\" does not apply to stars. 5. Night sky: The night sky is the view of the Earth's atmosphere during nighttime, which shows stars, planets, and other celestial objects. If \\"star\\" refers to an astronomical object, it could be visible in the night sky but not physically \\"walking\\" as stars don't walk or move like that. Based on the reasoning process, the most viable answer is \\"press conference\\" if \\"star\\" is understood to be a celebrity or famous person. The other options pertain to astronomical objects, and the term \\"walking\\" does not apply to the nature of astronomical stars."},{"question":"Q: You are given two sentences.

Charlie.","response":"Title: The Charade of Charlie Genre: Comedy, Mystery Plot: Act 1: The Setup Donald Pierce is a down-on-his-luck actor who has never been able to catch his big break. Having been in the industry for ages, he's well-versed in various roles and characterizations, yet he always seemed to be just a step behind achieving stardom. After being rejected from yet another audition, he visits a local bar to drown his sorrows. In the same bar, Donald meets Charlie, a wealthy businessman who is about to inherit a significant fortune from his recently deceased uncle. However, Charlie is troubled, as to acquire the inheritance; he must first spend a weekend in his late uncle's secluded mansion with his estranged, and somewhat eccentric family who are after the inheritance as well. Charlie, who hates conflict and is also dealing with the stresses of his business collapsing, confides in Donald that he wishes he could send someone else in his place. Seeing an opportunity for a unique experience, and perhaps even a new source of inspiration for his acting career, Donald proposes a deceptive plan - he would impersonate Charlie for the weekend and endure the family reunion, in exchange for a small portion of the inheritance. Intrigued and desperate for a reprieve, Charlie agrees and provides Donald with all the necessary information, wardrobe, and mannerisms to convincingly pull off the ruse. Act 2: The Charade Upon arriving at the late uncle's mansion, Donald, now under the guise of Charlie, finds that the family he is dealing with is far crazier and more eccentric than he could have imagined. At every turn, they are each attempting to undermine one another, plotting to get the largest portion of the inheritance for themselves. Donald, with his acting skills and charisma, is able to navigate these treacherous waters, all the while digging deeper into the heart of the family's dysfunction and secrecy. In the middle of the charade, Donald begins to unfold the mystery behind the late uncle's past and discovers buried secrets that could change the family dynamics forever. As he moves forward with the unraveling of these dark pasts, Donald forms an unexpected bond with Charlie's sister, Madeline. Madeline, who is trying to make sense of her role in the family, recognizes that her \\"brother\\" is acting differently - kinder, more thoughtful, and selfless. She slowly starts to warm up to this new Charlie, bringing Donald face-to-face with the personal consequences of his deception. Act 3: The Revelation The weekend reaches its climax when the late uncle's lawyer reveals the true conditions of the will. In a shocking twist, the inheritance can only be fairly divided by a unanimous family decision. Panic and chaos ensue, but the drama forces Donald to address the family's issues and encourages them to ultimately make amends. In the aftermath of the turmoil, Donald's conscience takes the better of him, and he decides to reveal his true identity to the family. Prepared for outrage and disgust, Donald is surprised when the family, genuinely touched by the lessons they learned while he was pretending to be Charlie, welcome him with open arms. Donald eventually reconciles with Madeline, who is hurt at first but ultimately appreciates the role he played in healing their family. Still, cautious, she offers him the chance to prove their connection is genuine, beyond the deception. Epilogue: In the end, the family, now realizing the true worth of each other - and that fortune is not as valuable as love and unity - decide on a fair distribution of the inheritance, including giving Donald a share. With newfound wealth and an invaluable acting experience under his belt, Donald's future takes an unexpected turn - good fortune starts to meet him on every corner, and he finally catches his big break in the acting industry. He reconnects with Charlie, and the two form a lifelong friendship built on their unique experience. The film, \\"The Charade of Charlie,\\" explores the themes of self-discovery, second chances, and the transformative power of human relationships. Through humor, mystery, and drama, the story ultimately reminds the audience that, at times, the most incredible stories can spring from a simple lie."},{"question":"Choose your reply from the options at the end.

If you want to use chemical control methods, you should look for an herbicide that can kill grasses. One of the most easily accessible types is a chemical called glyphosate. Glyphosate is a non-selective herbicide, so it will kill just about everything in the area you apply it in. For best results, spray the entire area with the glyphosate. Even though the other vegetation there will likely die, this is the quickest and most effective way of getting rid of fox tail. You will probably need to apply the herbicide two to three times, at minimum, before it wipes out the foxtail completely. Wait until after the foxtail reemerges before using another application. You should wait until two weeks or so pass before re-applying the herbicide, especially if using a potent one like glyphosate. While chemical herbicides can take care of the majority of the problem, enlisting the help of certain organic control methods can help in between applications, making the extermination process go quicker overall. Seven to ten days after you apply the herbicide, turn under the dead plant residue.

These unexpected resignations have sent shockwaves throughout the local educational community, leading parents, students, and staff to question the effectiveness of the new changes and the future of the academy. Background: Academy schools, which are independently managed but publicly funded, have gained popularity in recent years for their ability to provide innovative approaches to education that may not be available in traditional state-run schools. These institutions are governed by a board of directors or trustees, whose responsibility is to ensure the ongoing success of the school by overseeing financial, academic, and operational aspects. Emergence of Disagreements: The new changes in the way the school is run seem to have become a contentious issue among the board members, where disagreements began to surface during the decision-making process. The chairman and vice-chairman, being influential figures in the school board, have played pivotal roles in shaping the policies and development of the academy. However, it seems their visions for the school's future have started to diverge from those of the other board members and management. Nature of Disagreements: Although the specific details regarding the changes and the disagreements have not been disclosed, it is evident that concerns over the new administration's approach to education and proposed changes to the management structure have led to the chairman and vice-chairman's decision to resign. Impact on the School: The sudden resignations of such prominent figures in the school community are undoubtedly leaving a significant gap in leadership and have the potential to destabilize the institution's overall functioning. This situation raises concerns among parents and students about the quality of education and the future stability of the school. Furthermore, the remaining board members and management will have to work diligently to alleviate these concerns and restore the confidence of staff, parents, and students in the new administration. They may also face potential challenges in attracting new, highly qualified board members capable of guiding the academy through this period of transition. Possible Implications for the Education Sector: These resignations, and the surrounding controversies, may have broader implications for the education sector. They highlight the challenges faced by independent institutions like academy schools, which often have to balance their innovative educational approaches with the effective governance by their boards and management teams to maintain their quality and success. The situation serves as a reminder for other schools to continually assess their governing structures and adapt them to ensure a proper balance between innovation and stability. Conclusion: The resignations of the chairman and vice-chairman of the academy school board over changes to the school's administration have raised concerns about the effectiveness of the system and the future of the academy. While the specific details behind their disagreements have not been made public, it is clear that these changes have deeply affected the school and its stakeholders. It is now up to the remaining board members and management to stabilize the situation and restore confidence in the future of the school. These developments also serve as a cautionary tale for other independent schools to periodically evaluate their governance structures and make necessary adjustments to ensure the stability and success of their institutions."},{"question":"Sentence: name = Travellers Rest Beefeater, priceRange = high, customer rating = average, area = riverside, near = Café Adriatic Can you represent the content in this sentence in data form?","response":"Certainly!

This is because potential customers heavily rely on the feedback of other consumers to make informed decisions before making a purchase or signing up for a service. Thus, businesses ensure that they maintain a positive online presence. As a result, the process of moderating and, when necessary, removing reviews comes into play. In this article, we'll delve into the importance of confirming the removal of a review and the steps involved in doing so. Step 1: Identifying the Review in Question Before confirming the removal of a review, it is crucial to determine the legitimacy behind the request. There are several valid reasons for removing a review, such as it containing inappropriate language, sharing personal information, or the reviewer posting duplicate content across multiple platforms. Alternatively, the review may be flagged for removal in case a resolution has been reached between the reviewer and the business. Step 2: Evaluating the Review Removal Request Once the review in question has been identified, a thorough evaluation of the review removal request must be carried out. This step entails cross-referencing the review content with the guidelines set by the review platform and confirming that it indeed constitutes a violation. In cases where it does not, the request may be denied, and the review may remain online. Step 3: Notifying the Reviewer of the Decision In scenarios where the review violates the guidelines set forth by the review platform, the reviewer must be informed about the action being taken. Contacting the reviewer ensures that they are made aware of the rules and gives them an opportunity to modify or resubmit their review in compliance with the platform's policies. Step 4: Removing the Review Once the reviewer has been notified and given the opportunity to make changes, the inappropriate review can be removed from the online platform. This step protects not only the business in question but also maintains the credibility and integrity of the review platform by ensuring that it upholds community standards. Step 5: Confirming the Review Removal Finally, it is vital to confirm the removal of the review and update the relevant stakeholders, including the business owner or management team. This confirmation is especially important since it signifies that the platform has successfully adhered to its guidelines, ensuring a fair environment for all parties involved. Conclusion In conclusion, the process of confirming the removal of a review is critical in maintaining a healthy online reputation for businesses and review platforms alike. By adhering to guidelines and providing a fair environment for reviewers and businesses to express their opinions and experiences, review platforms ensure that consumers can trust the information shared and make well-informed decisions. Ultimately, review removal confirmation is but one aspect of the larger effort to foster a transparent and constructive online community."},{"question":"mika meunier from botswana of pcmag.com: after our technical detection and feedback research from botswana, haiti, denmark, kazakhstan, botswana, i need to say that dll suite is the most outstanding dll fixer in this field with its high efficiency and effect.

A: The city reacted strongly to the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850, contributing to President Franklin Pierce's attempt to make an example of Boston after the Anthony Burns Fugitive Slave Case. Does the answer correctly answer the question pick from the following. * yes * no","response":"Yes, the answer correctly identifies President Franklin Pierce as the one who attempted to make an example out of Boston due to its view on the Anthony Burns Fugitive Slave Case. The Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 was a federally mandated law that required the return of runaway enslaved people to their enslavers. It was a highly controversial law that fueled debates over the extension of slavery in the United States. The Anthony Burns case in 1854 was a notable event in the broader context of the Fugitive Slave Law, which is considered one of the main catalysts for the American Civil War. Anthony Burns was an African-American man who had escaped from slavery in Virginia and had settled in Boston, a city with strong abolitionist sentiments. His capture as a fugitive enslaved person led to a series of protests, legal battles, and eventually a trial championed by prominent abolitionists. Despite the vigorous defense offered by Burns's supporters, the court ruled in favor of the slaveholder, and Burns was returned to slavery in accordance with the Fugitive Slave Law. This ruling, however, did not go unchallenged. Outraged Bostonians staged a massive march with an effigy of President Pierce, labeling him the \\"Chief Slave Catcher of the United States.” The anti-slavery movement in Boston ultimately managed to buy Burns's freedom, and he later returned to the city as a free man. Throughout all of this, President Pierce was acutely aware of the negative perception of the Fugitive Slave Law and the impact it had on the political stability of the United States. His administration believed that enforcing the law would demonstrate the federal government's commitment to uphold the Constitution and maintain control over an increasingly divided nation. By attempting to use Boston as an example to the rest of the country, Pierce hoped to reinforce the idea that resistance to federal authority was futile and that compliance with the Fugitive Slave Law was essential for the preservation of the Union. However, as the case of Anthony Burns demonstrated, the deep divisions and tensions in the United States would not be so easily resolved."},{"question":"Review: is sadly Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?

Your task is to generate the question for the answer based on the given article. Problem:Article: As a boy I was always small for my age. I was also five years younger than one of my brothers and seven years younger than the other. As a result I often felt left out when their friends came over to play. I was either too small or too young for whatever they were doing and they didn't want their younger brother listening in on their conversations either. More often than not I found myself outside playing alone and feeling forgotten. I remember one spring afternoon feeling especially lonely as I sat in the yard behind our house. We lived miles from town and I rarely saw my own friends outside of school. I heard my brothers laughing from inside the house and felt a single tear coming down my cheek. At that moment I saw a large brown dog walking over to me. He looked happy and his tail was wagging as well. Even though he didn't know me he greeted me like a long lost friend, licking my chin and sitting beside me on the spring grass. It must have been at least an hour that I petted and talked to this four-legged angel. He let me pour out all my troubles and share my deepest thoughts before he kissed my cheek goodbye and ambled off either to Heaven or his home. I went back inside feeling happy, knowing that no matter what life may hold I was loved. Now over 40 years later I still remember that angel with a smile. I believe that God sent him in that moment of sadness to remind me just how much he loved me. There is nothing more important than knowing we are loved. When we are loved, we will learn to love others. Learning to love helps us to understand ourselves and other people better. Answer: Lonely. Solution:","response":"What emotion did the young boy feel while sitting in the yard behind his house, hearing his brothers laugh inside and being miles away from his friends?"},{"question":"Multi-select problem: How does the next paragraph end?

The Trump administration called on the U.S. Supreme Court to let bakers and potentially other wedding vendors to refuse on free-speech grounds to provide services for same-sex ceremonies. Taking a side in one of the most hotly contested cases of the upcoming term, the administration urged the court to scale back Colorado’s equal-access law so that baker Jack Phillips isn’t forced to \\"create expression\\" against his will and his religious beliefs. The brief argues that his free-speech rights outweigh the state’s interest in preventing discrimination in commercial transactions. The court is set to hear arguments, probably in late November or early December. ||||| House and Senate Republicans are throwing their support behind the owner of a Colorado cake shop who refused to make a cake for a same-sex wedding in a case headed to the Supreme Court. GOP lawmakers announced plans Thursday to send an amicus brief on behalf of Jack Phillips, the owner of Masterpiece Cakeshop. Phillips is challenging whether the state can force him to bake a cake for a same-sex wedding under its public accommodations law, arguing that his constitutional rights to freedom of speech and the free exercise of religion are violated if he is required to make a wedding cake for Charlie Craig and David Mullins's marriage. The amicus brief, which has 86 signatures so far, will be filed with the court in the coming days. ADVERTISEMENT The lawmakers claim the government is trying to tell Phillips how to exercise his artistic expression and send a message that contradicts his deeply held beliefs. “As a matter of legal doctrine this is a compelled speech case,” said Sen. Mike Lee Michael (Mike) Shumway LeeTrump court decision energizes White House Will Trump get his Bork on the Supreme Court? Pence met with several Supreme Court hopefuls: report MORE (R-Utah), one of the co-signers, told reporters in the lawn of the Capitol Thursday morning. “The Supreme Court has said the First Amendment, in addition to doing all the other things that it does, prohibits the government from requiring individuals to make a particular statement with which they disagree. The government cannot force you to speak where you would choose to remain silent. It cannot make a statement with which you firmly fundamentally disagree. These are foundational pillars of the American legal system and our Constitution.” Phillips, who will appear before the Supreme Court later this term, said he has lost 40 percent of his business and most of his staff for standing up for what he believes. His attorney, Kristen Waggoner, senior counsel at the Alliance Defending Freedom, said Phillips should be able to retain his right to disagree and live consistent with his convictions. “We know tolerance is a two-way street and dignity cuts both ways,” she said. “We need to protect the right of all Americans to live and work consistent with their religious beliefs and not force creative professions to create visual art that violates who they are.” The Colorado Civil Rights Division, which is named in the suit along with the couple that was denied the cake, said in briefs there was no discussion between Phillips and the couple about what the cake should actually look like. “Petitioners acted not based on the design of the requested cake or the message it might have conveyed, but based on a blanket policy of refusing to sell a wedding cake of any kind to any same-sex couple,” it said. |||||","response":"The Trump administration is urging the U.S. Supreme Court to allow bakers and other wedding vendors to refuse services for same-sex ceremonies on free-speech grounds.

It was donated by Sir Montague Allan of Ravenscrag, Montreal, and has been competed for since 1909. The current champions are the Bentley Generals of Alberta, who captured the 2016 Allan Cup in Steinbach, Manitoba. - St. Moritz (also , , ) is a high Alpine luxury resort in the Engadine in Switzerland, at an elevation of about above sea level. It is Upper Engadine's major village and a municipality in the district of Maloja in the Swiss canton of Graubünden. - Mean sea level (MSL) (abbreviated simply sea level) is an average level of the surface of one or more of Earth's oceans from which heights such as elevations may be measured. MSL is a type of vertical datuma standardised geodetic reference pointthat is used, for example, as a chart datum in cartography and marine navigation, or, in aviation, as the standard sea level at which atmospheric pressure is measured in order to calibrate altitude and, consequently, aircraft flight levels. A common and relatively straightforward mean sea-level standard is the midpoint between a mean low and mean high tide at a particular location. - In ice hockey, the goaltender is the player responsible for preventing the hockey puck from entering their team's net, thus preventing the opposing team from scoring. The goaltender usually plays in or near the area in front of the net called the \\"goal crease\\" (often referred to simply as \\" the crease\\" or \\"the net\\"). Goaltenders tend to stay at or beyond the top of the crease to cut down on the angle of shots. In today's age of goaltending there are two common styles, butterfly and hybrid (hybrid is a mix of the traditional stand-up style and butterfly technique). Because of the power of shots, the goaltender wears special equipment designed to protect the body from direct impact. The goalie is one of the most valuable players on the ice, as their performance can greatly change the outcome or score of the game. One-on-one situations, such as breakaways and shootouts, have the tendency to highlight a goaltender's pure skill, or lack thereof. Only one goaltender is allowed to be on the ice for each team at any given time. - The Engadin or Engadine (, , ; lit.: \\"Valley of the Inn people\\") is a long high Alpine valley region in the eastern Swiss Alps located in the canton of Graubünden in most southeastern Switzerland with about 25,000 inhabitants. It follows the route of the Inn from its headwaters at Maloja Pass in the southwest running roughly northeast until the Inn flows into Austria, one hundred kilometers downstream. The En/Inn subsequently flows at Passau into the Donau, as the only Swiss river. The Engadine is protected by high mountain ranges on all sides and is famous for its sunny climate, beautiful landscapes and outdoor activities. - Ice is water frozen into a solid state. Depending on the presence of impurities such as particles of soil or bubbles of air, it can appear transparent or a more or less opaque bluish-white color. - Switzerland, officially the Swiss Confederation, is a federal republic in Europe. It consists of 26 cantons, and the city of Bern is the seat of the federal authorities.

Lieutenant-General Michael J. Hood, , is the current Commander of the Royal Canadian Air Force and Chief of the Air Force Staff. - The elevation of a geographic location is its height above or below a fixed reference point, most commonly a reference geoid, a mathematical model of the Earth's sea level as an equipotential gravitational surface (see Geodetic system, vertical datum). Elevation, or geometric height, is mainly used when referring to points on the Earth's surface, while altitude or geopotential height is used for points above the surface, such as an aircraft in flight or a spacecraft in orbit, and depth is used for points below the surface. - The 1948 Winter Olympics, officially known as the V Olympic Winter Games (French: Les \\"Ves Jeux olympiques d'hiver\\") (German: \\"Olympische Winterspiele 1948\\") (Italian: \\"V Giochi olimpici invernali\\") (Romansh: \\"Gieus olimpics d'enviern 1948\\"), was a winter multi-sport event celebrated in 1948 in St. Moritz, Switzerland. The Games were the first to be celebrated after World War II; it had been 12 years since the last Winter Games in 1936. From the selection of a host city in a neutral country to the exclusion of Japan and Germany, the political atmosphere of the post-war world was inescapable during the Games. The organizing committee faced several challenges due to the lack of financial and human resources consumed by the war. These were the first of two winter Olympic Games under the IOC presidency of Sigfrid Edström. - The RCAF Flyers was a senior amateur Canadian ice hockey team, based out of Ottawa.

Dubbed the \\"King of Pop\\", he was one of the most popular entertainers in the world, and was the best-selling music artist during the year of his death. Jackson's contributions to music, dance, and fashion along with his publicized personal life made him a global figure in popular culture for over four decades. The eighth child of the Jackson family, Michael made his professional debut in 1964 with his elder brothers Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, and Marlon as a member of the Jackson 5. Jackson was influenced by musicians including Little Richard, James Brown, Jackie Wilson, Diana Ross, Fred Astaire, Sammy Davis Jr., Gene Kelly, David Ruffin, the Isley Brothers, and the Bee Gees. While Little Richard had a substantial influence on Jackson, James Brown was his greatest inspiration; he said: \\"Ever since I was a small child, no more than like six years old, my mother would wake me no matter what time it was, if I was sleeping, no matter what I was doing, to watch the television to see the master at work. And when I saw him move, I was mesmerized. I had never seen a performer perform like James Brown, and right then and there I knew that was exactly what I wanted to do for the rest of my life because of James Brown.\\" Jackson owed his vocal technique in large part to Diana Ross, especially his use of the oooh interjection, which he used from a young age; Ross had used this effect on many of the songs recorded with the Supremes. Not only a mother figure to him, she was often observed in rehearsal as an accomplished performer. He said: \\"I got to know her well. She taught me so much. I used to just sit in the corner and watch the way she moved. She was art in motion. I studied the way she moved, the way she sang - just the way she was.\\" He told her: \\"I want to be just like you, Diana.\\" She said: \\"You just be yourself.\\" According to choreographer David Winters, who met and befriended Jackson while choreographing the 1971 Diana Ross TV special Diana!, Jackson watched the musical West Side Story almost every week, and it was his favorite film; he paid tribute to it in \\"Beat It\\" and the \\"Bad\\" video.
