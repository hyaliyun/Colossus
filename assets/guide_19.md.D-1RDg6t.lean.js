Its cooking was influenced by a combination of factors, including the region's arid landscape, the war-like lifestyle of its inhabitants, and the availability of ingredients. In this desert area, scarcity of water and fresh green vegetables led to preference for food items that could last for several days without the need for heating. The Rajasthani people, who were known for their warrior lifestyle, needed food that was suitable for long battles and journeys, which also influenced the choice of ingredients and preparation methods. Consequently, Bikaneri Bhujia became an ideal snack option, as it was non-perishable, easy to carry, and required no heating before consumption. Bikaneri Bhujia is a spiced, deep-fried crispy snack made from gram flour and various spices, such as black pepper, red chili powder, and ajwain (carom seeds). Some variations also include moth bean flour, rice flour, or potato, to bring diversity in taste and texture.

In 2035, James Cole is a prisoner living in a subterranean compound beneath the ruins of Philadelphia. Cole is selected to be trained and sent back in time to find the original virus in order to help scientists develop a cure. Meanwhile, Cole is troubled by recurring dreams involving a foot chase and shooting at an airport. Cole arrives in Baltimore in 1990, not 1996 as planned. He is arrested, then hospitalized in a mental hospital on the diagnosis of Dr. Kathryn Railly. There he encounters Jeffrey Goines, a mental patient with fanatical views.

May had a reputation for off-the-wall arrangements, and 'Swing Along' is no exception.'Curse of an Aching Heart' is relentless, but with great lyrics. 'Granada' is one of the loudest things they ever recorded, and a lot of fun, while 'Moonlight on the Ganges' brings a lot of brass and a huge gong at the end.

Answer the above question based on the context below: In 1967 Solti was invited to become music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. It was the second time he had been offered the post. The first had been in 1963 after the death of the orchestra's conductor, Fritz Reiner, who made its reputation in the previous decade. Solti told the representatives of the orchestra that his commitments at Covent Garden made it impossible to give Chicago the eight months a year they sought. He suggested giving them three and a half months a year and inviting Carlo Maria Giulini to take charge for a similar length of time. The orchestra declined to proceed on these lines. When Solti accepted the orchestra's second invitation it was agreed that Giulini should be appointed to share the conducting. Both conductors signed three-year contracts with the orchestra, effective from 1969.One of the members of the Chicago Symphony described it to Solti as \\"the best provincial orchestra in the world.\\" Many players remained from its celebrated decade under Reiner, but morale was low, and the orchestra was 5m in debt. Solti concluded that it was essential to raise the orchestra's international profile. He ensured that it was engaged for many of his Decca sessions, and he and Giulini led it in a European tour in 1971, playing in ten countries. It was the first time in its 80-year history that the orchestra had played outside of North America. The orchestra received plaudits from European critics, and was welcomed home at the end of the tour with a ticker-tape parade.The orchestra's principal flute player, Donald Peck, commented that the relationship between a conductor and an orchestra is difficult to explain: \\"some conductors get along with some orchestras and not others.

Complete the following sentence. Aaron shined a flashlight into the corner and showed Adam where the beetles nested, because","response":"Aaron shined a flashlight into the corner and showed Adam where the beetles nested because as a concerned homeowner, he knew it was his responsibility to address any potential threats to his property and the wellbeing of his family. Aaron had noticed the signs of a beetle infestation when he saw small holes in wooden furniture and structural elements of the house, as well as the presence of tiny droppings that he quickly realized were left behind by insects. Concerned about the extent of the infestation and the possible damage these beetles could be causing to the very foundation of his home, Aaron decided to investigate further to pinpoint the source of the infestation and devise a plan to eliminate these unwanted intruders. Adam, a close neighbor and also a concerned homeowner, had faced similar issues in the past with various pests destroying his property's integrity. His knowledge and experience in dealing with these invaders made him a valuable ally to Aaron in their joint effort to protect their homes from threats posed by pests. When Aaron shared his findings with Adam, they both agreed that it was necessary to locate and eradicate the beetles before they could cause more damage or spread to other homes in the neighborhood. Equipped with flashlights, the two concerned homeowners meticulously searched every inch of Aaron's home, checking for any other signs of infestation. Their efforts eventually led them to a corner where they discovered a large nest of beetles tucked away from plain sight. Aaron shined his flashlight on the nest, revealing the extent of the beetle infestation to Adam, who then pulled out a notepad to take notes and strategize a course of action on how to get rid of the beetles. Together, they developed a multi-point plan which involved first applying insecticides specifically designed to target and exterminate beetles. After waiting a few days for the insecticides to take effect, they would then seal off the corner to prevent a resurgence of the infestation and further damage to the house. Additionally, they agreed that routinely monitoring for any new signs of beetle activity would be key to ensuring the property remained safe from future infestations. Aaron expressed his gratitude to Adam, not only for his assistance in locating the nest but also for his unwavering support and guidance throughout the entire process. In the end, Aaron and Adam's combined efforts and proactive attitude toward addressing the beetle infestation helped protect their respective properties and the overall health and wellbeing of their families. The experience also strengthened their bond as neighbors who could rely on one another in times of need, and it served as a testament to the importance of proactive and vigilant homeownership."},{"question":"Write a sentence in English.","response":"Step 1: Begin with choosing a subject for the sentence.

Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: I Wonder Who's Kissing Her Now Movie plot: Set in the turn of the 20th century, the film focuses on Joseph E. Howard, an aspiring songwriter who happily sells a song to performer Lulu Madison, who later takes sole credit for the writing. He angrily confronts her, but she distracts him by seducing him in her hotel suite. Thinking that she can use Joe's talent for her career, she invites him to serve as her personal piano player on her tour. He accepts her invitation and bids farewell to Katie, the young niece of his guardian John McCullem who reluctantly says goodbye. Over the following period, Joe grows to become a successful songwriter. Katie follows him to Philadelphia and joins the tour by lying, saying that her uncle has died. Katie's presence distracts Joe, much to Lulu's anger and jealousy. Although Lulu makes sure it obvious to Katie she is not happy about her presence, Katie remains unaffected and continues supporting Joe in his career, rather than working for Lulu. One evening, Lulu tries to cancel Joe's performance, and Katie responds by ruining Lulu's costume, thus making it possible for Joe to perform his latest song, which is received with wild applause. After being fired by Lulu, Joe and Katie form their own group, working for producers Karl and Kassel. However, Joe is later seduced by attractive performer Fritzi Barrington to work for her. They are successful, but their collaboration proves short-lived, as Fritzi's financial supporter, a flame from the past, is jealous of Joe's connection to her and withdraws. Joe and Fritzi are able to perform a show, though, and it proves to be a major success. They eventually make their debut on Broadway and work together for a while, until Fritzi retires to marry Martin Webb. Joe, feeling betrayed, blames Katie for scaring away Fritzi, as Katie is her understudy in the show. Sometime later, Joe finds out Katie is working under the stage name Pat O'Dare, performing 'I Wonder Who's Kissing Her Now', an unpublished song by Joe. Katie is surprised to see him, and they eventually kiss each other. My question: What type of artist could record the title song? A:","response":"The title song \\"I Wonder Who's Kissing Her Now\\" could be recorded by an artist who has a strong background in classic and traditional music genres, such as jazz, pop standards or musical theater. This artist should have a versatile vocal range and emotive expression, capable of delivering the song's sentimental and nostalgic feel. Ideally, they would possess a timeless quality in their voice and style, paying homage to the turn-of-the-century setting of the film while appealing to contemporary audiences. Some examples of such artists could include Michael Bublé, Diana Krall, or Harry Connick Jr. However, it would also be interesting to see a modern artist with a unique interpretation on the song, such as Lady Gaga or Josh Groban. Ultimately, the selection of the artist would depend on the overall vision and direction of the film's music and soundtrack."},{"question":"Couldn't even finish my lunch, maybe this place is great for breakfast but it's terrible for lunch.

Answer: (1). negative."},{"question":"Prolific and highly influential filmmaker Martin Scorsese examines a selection of his favorite American films grouped according to three different types of directors: the director as an illusionist: D.W. Griffith or F. W. Murnau, who created new editing techniques among other changes that made the appearance of sound and color later step forward; the director as a smuggler: filmmakers such as Douglas Sirk, Samuel Fuller, and mostly Vincente Minnelli, directors who used to disguise rebellious messages in their films; and the director as iconoclast: those filmmakers attacking civil observations and social hang-ups like Orson Welles, Erich von Stroheim, Charles Chaplin, Nicholas Ray, Stanley Kubrick, and Arthur Penn. He shows us how the old studio system in Hollywood was, though oppressive, the way in which film directors found themselves progressing the medium because of how they were bound by political and financial limitations. During his clips from the movies he shows us, we not only discover films we've never seen before that pique our interest but we also are made to see what he sees. He evaluate his stylistic sensibilities along with the directors of the sequences themselves. The idea of a film canon has been reputed as snobbish, hence some movie fans and critics favor to just make \\"lists.\\" However, canon merely denotes \\"the best\\" and supporters of film canon argue that it is a valuable activity to identify and experience a select compilation of the \\"best\\" films, a lot like a greatest hits tape, if just as a beginning direction for film students. All in all, one's experience has shown that all writing about film, including reviews, function to construct a film canon. Some film canons can definitely be elitist, but others can be \\"populist.\\" As an example, the Internet Movie Database's Top 250 Movies list includes many films included on several \\"elitist\\" film canons but also features recent Hollywood blockbusters at which many film \\"elitists\\" scoff, like The Dark Knight, which presently mingles in the top ten amidst the first two Godfather films, Schindler's List and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, and the fluctuation of similar productions further down such as Iron Man, Sin City, Die Hard, The Terminator and Kill Bill: Vol. 2. Writer Scorsese's Taxi Driver Paul Schrader has straightforwardly referred to his canon as \\"elitist\\" and contends that this is positive. Scorsese is never particularly vocal at all about his social and political ideologies, but when we see this intense and admittedly obsessive history lesson on the birth and growth of American cinema in both ideological realms, we see that there is really no particular virtue in either elitism or populism. Elitism concentrates all attention, recognition and thus power on those deemed outstanding. That discrimination could easily lead to self-indulgence much in the vein of the condescending work of Jean-Luc Godard or the overrationalization of the production practices of a filmmaker like Michael Haneke. Yet populism invokes a belief of representative freedom as being only the assertion of the people's will. As has been previously asserted about the all-encompassing misconceptions the people have about cinema, populism could be the end of the potential power and impact of cinema. One can only continue seeing films, because it is a vital social and metaphysical practice. And that's what Martin Scorsese spends nearly four hours here trying to tell us, something which can't be told without being seen first-hand. Would you say this review is positive or negative?","response":"I would say this review is mostly positive. The reviewer acknowledges Scorsese's expertise and passion for cinema, as well as the valuable insights and exposure to lesser-known films that the audience gains from his work. The reviewer also engages in a thoughtful discussion about elitism and populism in film canon and argues that Scorsese's approach doesn't necessarily fall into either category. While there are some critical thoughts on elitism and populism, overall the review seems to praise Scorsese's efforts in examining American cinema and the importance of watching films for their social and metaphysical impact."},{"question":"In this task, you are given commands (in terms of logical operations) to select relevant rows from the given table.

Doctors usually prefer to give patients vaccines instead of medications because the","response":"latter often has side effects and does not provide long-term immunity. Vaccines, on the other hand, allow the body to build a natural defense against various diseases, thus preventing health issues from arising in the first place. Additionally, vaccines can be cost-effective and significantly reduce the risk of outbreaks and infections within communities. One day, in the busy city of Metropolia, a young doctor named Dr. Amelia Hayes was working tirelessly at Eden Health Clinic, a well-renowned medical facility known for its cutting-edge research and healthcare services. Dr. Hayes was passionate about preventative care, specifically through vaccination, and she displayed a genuine dedication to the wellbeing of her patients. On this particular day, Dr. Hayes received news about an emerging virus that had recently surfaced in a small village near the outskirts of Metropolia. The World Health Organization (WHO) had issued an advisory about the spread of this virus and called for immediate efforts to curtail the outbreak before it could escalate into a pandemic. Eager to find a solution, Dr. Hayes gathered a team of her most trusted colleagues, including Dr. Aaron Chen, a brilliant virologist, and Dr. Stephanie Michaels, a prominent epidemiologist. Together, they began their research on the new virus, painstakingly analyzing its structure, transmission, and potential impact on human health. Over the course of several weeks, the team of medical professionals dug deep into their studies and began to notice unique patterns in the virus' genetic makeup. This discovery proved instrumental, as it offered vital clues on devising an effective vaccine. Working day and night, Dr. Hayes and her team started developing and testing various formulations, driven by the urgent need to safeguard the residents of Metropolia and beyond. News of the impending virus threat caught the attention of the media, causing widespread paranoia and fear among the public. Desperate citizens flocked to Eden Health Clinic, pleading with Dr. Hayes and her peers for any treatment or preventative measures available. However, the process of creating a safe and effective vaccine took time, and the team had to delicately balance meeting the expectations of the public while staying true to their commitment to scientific research. Eventually, after numerous iterations and rigorous clinical trials, Dr. Hayes and her team succeeded in producing a promising vaccine candidate demonstrating both safety and efficacy against the new virus. Metropolia’s governing authorities promptly approved the vaccine for emergency use, allowing Dr. Hayes to initiate a mass vaccination campaign. Logistics proved to be quite a challenge, with limited resources and a frightened populace. However, Dr. Hayes was determined not to let these obstacles deter her from saving lives. She collaborated with various governmental and non-governmental organizations to roll out an organized and efficient vaccination drive, starting with the most vulnerable individuals and the frontline healthcare workers. Strict hygiene protocols, public awareness campaigns, and the tireless dedication of healthcare professionals like Dr. Hayes gradually diminished the prevalence of the virus. As the months passed, Metropolia and the surrounding regions continued to witness a steady decline in viral infections, thanks to Dr. Hayes and her team's persistent efforts. The newly-developed vaccine became a prime example of how preventative healthcare through vaccination saves lives, time, and resources, as well as spares countless people from unnecessary pain and suffering. In the end, Metropolia managed to avert what could have been a catastrophic pandemic, all due to the timely response, scientific prowess, and relentless determination of doctors like Amelia Hayes. The community realized the importance of vaccine-driven preventative healthcare, learned to appreciate and trust the expertise of medical professionals, and started to prioritize vaccination within their healthcare systems. Through a combination of education, empathy, and relentless determination, Dr. Hayes not only managed to save her city from an unnerving viral outbreak but also reminded the world of the power and significance of vaccine-driven preventative care, inspiring future generations to follow in her footsteps."},{"question":"Frank E.

In 2008, Michael Bloomberg proposed congestion pricing for Manhattan's inner core, proposing an 8 charge for most passenger cars, to be charged only once a day. The money would've gone to the MTA, to fix up subway stations, improve bus and subway service, and help pay for extensions to the system. Naturally, it died in Albany without even coming up for a vote. Now, famous transportation expert \\"Gridlock\\" Sam Schwartz is trying to sell a new congestion pricing proposal, one that simply adds tolls to bridges entering Manhattan, and that also lowers already existing tolls on other area bridges. The proposal is designed to alleviate the (misleading) class-based argument against Bloomberg's plan, which was said to benefit rich Manhattanites at the expense of the blue-collar outer boroughs. The proposal briefly seemed like it might actually have a shot at passing, until New York's Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo effectively killed it by declaring that it wouldn't pass. (It would, needless to say, have a better chance of passing if the state's powerful governor exerted any effort at all toward passing it.) Richard Brodsky, a former assemblyman and a regularly quoted opponent of congestion pricing, summed up the argument against charging drivers a bit more to help maintain the transit system: Richard L. Brodsky, a former Democratic assemblyman and a senior fellow at the Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service at New York University, said Mr. Schwartz’s plan was “a fundamentally regressive tax,” even if equity problems among the boroughs were “addressed to an extent,” at least compared with the 2008 plan. “It will modify the behavior of the guy driving the ’97 Chevy,” Mr. Brodsky said, “but will do nothing to modify the behavior of the guy driving the 2013 Mercedes.” As StreetsBlog explains, this is a very silly argument. Drivers are, on average, richer than non-drivers. Owning cars is expensive, even without East River bridge tolls. There are more car-less New Yorkers than drivers. But the drivers earn more, and we all remember how American politicians only respond to the desires and preferences of the wealthy, right? The congestion pricing argument has always taken place, rhetorically, in a bizarre alternate universe where everyone drives, and where every citizen deserves to be able to drive without bearing anything close to the cost of that driving on the city's infrastructure and atmosphere. In 2008, politician after politician cried that it was unfair to ask anyone to pay money to go from one of the city's boroughs into another, and no one reminded them that every single subway rider has always been forced to pay to do that very thing. The sad thing is that Cuomo's refusal to support the proposal wasn't remotely surprising. Cuomo has never evinced any concern at all about his state's mass transit system. Indeed, he has sometimes seemed actively hostile to the idea of adequately funding, let alone expanding it. He has blocked efforts to even study transit options on the replacement Tappan Zee Bridge over the Hudson River. He vetoed a bill that would've discouraged the state Legislature from diverting transit money to other things -- which Cuomo did in his 2013 budget. Cuomo isn't at all unusual. In New York state, as in the country as a whole, more resources continue to be spent on drivers and roads than buses and trains. One transit blogger has calculated that, according to how Albany allocates transportation money, \\"every driver is worth as much as 4.5 transit riders.\\" And while Mayor Bloomberg's administration has a generally very good record on transit, there's always been a strange tension between Bloomberg's pedestrian and bicycle-friendly Department of Transportation and his NYPD, which has a bizarrely antagonistic relationship with bicyclists and which rarely -- as in almost never -- prosecutes reckless driving, speeding, or accidents leading to the death of pedestrians. This should be the most transit-friendly government in the country. A majority of New York citizens rely on public transit for their livelihoods. The city and state are run by Democrats, many of them among the most liberal in the nation. Our incoming mayor, Bill de Blasio, ran as a left-wing populist. But incoming Mayor Bill de Blasio is a driver. Andrew Cuomo has been a driver, or had drivers, his entire life. There are certain richer Manhattanites, accustomed to walking, for whom anti-car policies improve their quality of life, but for most of the political class, everyone they know and interact with owns a car. Finding a steady and sufficient revenue source for the local transit system, one that can't be raided for other purposes and that doesn't rely too heavily on burdening its users with hefty fare increases, should be an urgent priority for local politicians, but most of them simply don't care. We already have a political system in this country that, nationally, heavily favors the interests of the rural and the suburban over the urban. Many state legislatures have similar biases. But when, even in New York, politicians ignore transit, because they don't know or interact with or receive checks from people who rely on it every day, there's almost no hope for cheap, efficient mass transit options anywhere. Take Minneapolis, a decently dense city that could, and ought to, support a much more extensive mass transit system. The existing system, mainly buses and a light rail line, with more lines planned, is operated by a division of the Metropolitan Council, and, predictably, the council designs transit in a way that reflects the ostensible needs of the entire metro area, including suburbs that sprawl out miles beyond the city center. The result is a series of ambitious plans to build rail lines traveling from outside the city to downtown, while the urban bus system is unreliable, neglected and nearly impossible to navigate without extensive prior knowledge. Meanwhile, the light rail lines the council and the state are pressing forward with have been designed in a bizarre fashion, along low-traffic, low-density routes and ignoring the most dense and highly trafficked corridors in the city. The city government is now fighting with the council over its plan to put a streetcar line on one major urban avenue. The streetcar is probably not as good a solution as either improving bus service, on the cheap side, or creating a real subway or light rail line, on the more expensive, but it's the only proposed transit expansion right now in the area designed to serve people who actually live in the city. Here, again, politicians don't ride the bus, and likely know hardly anyone who does regularly. If this very liberal town, in a liberal state, run entirely by Democrats, has so much trouble creating and maintaining a decent mass transit system, what hope is there for the rest of America's cities? Especially the ones in states, and metro areas, that aren't so liberal. Take poor Atlanta, where the baseball team is in the process of becoming the only MLB team to move farther away from the city core in decades. The Braves will be going to suburban Cobb County, a rich, white, conservative county that has always rejected the expansion of the local rail line into its community, citing fears of unnamed \\"people\\" from Atlanta. The current stadium is a 25-minute walk from mass transit. The new one will be essentially unreachable -- by design, because sometimes transit expansion is blocked not just because of neglect, but also to enforce racial segregation. Just about the only place where there seems to be hope for mass transit in America is, bizarrely enough, Los Angeles, where the system is currently in the process of growing and improving. Why there, of all places? Maybe because while Los Angeles politicians are as unlikely to ride buses and trains as politicians anywhere else, they do have a personal stake in seeing other drivers get the hell off the road. ||||| Summary:","response":"This article talks about why mass transit systems like buses and trains are not doing very well in the United States. The author explains that even in New York, where mass transit is most used, the government doesn't do enough to support it. Many politicians drive cars or have drivers and don't see the importance of improving mass transit for the people who rely on it every day. The author also mentions that some cities like Atlanta have even blocked the growth of mass transit to keep certain groups of people out of their communities. This means that it's hard for there to be good, cheap public transportation options for people in America."},{"question":"What is the solution to this math problem? Solve 14*f + 30 = 19*f for f.","response":"Okay, let's solve the math problem step by step: 1. We have the equation: 14*f + 30 = 19*f. 2. We want to find the value of 'f'. Now let's do it together: - First, let's get all the 'f' terms on one side of the equation. To do that, we can subtract 14*f from both sides. 14*f + 30 - 14*f = 19*f - 14*f 30 = 5*f - Now, we want to find out what 'f' is, so we need to get 'f' by itself. To do that, we can divide both sides by 5. 30 ÷ 5 = 5*f ÷ 5 6 = f So the value of 'f' is 6.

Article: Should we be afraid of sharks ? Maybe not. New research into the reasons for shark attacks suggests that sharks don't like the way humans taste! In fact, most people who are attacked by the shark are still alive after receiving only one bite . Why is this? There are many opinions to explain why sharks sometimes attack people. One opinion is that sharks are just curious . We know that sharks are the strongest animals in their environment, so they are not afraid of anything. Naturally, that means they are curious when they meet something unusual. Because they don't have hands or feet., the only way they can find out an object is to bite it! It is thought that sharks sometimes bite humans for this reason, and then swim away. Scientists also say that sharks would not waste energy trying to eat a human, as we have a lot of bones . It is hard for a shark to eat us because sharks don't have hands, and they can't pull the meat off our bones. Maybe that's why they only bite us once. Unluckily, one bite from a large shark is serious enough to hurt people greatly! Another opinion is that sharks attack humans by mistake. Some sharks may sometimes mistake humans for a seal. An example of this is when a shark attacks a surfer. A surfer lying on a surfboard looks like a seal when seen from below. Sharks like seals because they have thick fat. Whatever the reason for shark attacks on humans, sharks should be afraid of us. Sadly, we kill almost 40 million of them each year. Question: What would the author write the passage mainly for? Options: A: To tell surfers to stay away from sharks. B: To ask people to stop killing sharks. C: To let us know the reasons for shark attacks on people. D: To show that humans are much stronger than sharks. Answer:","response":"C: To let us know the reasons for shark attacks on people. The passage primarily discusses various opinions and research findings on why sharks sometimes attack people, suggesting that they might be curious or might mistake humans for other prey."},{"question":"Answer this question. What is the medical name for the large intestine of the human body?","response":"The medical name for the large intestine of the human body is the \\"colon\\" or, more specifically, the \\"large bowel.\\" The colon is a critical component of the digestive system, which is responsible for processing food, extracting water, electrolytes, vitamins, and other essential nutrients, forming feces, and eliminating waste from the body. The large intestine extends from the end of the small intestine to the rectum and is divided into several distinct parts. These include: 1. Cecum: As the first section of the large intestine, the cecum is a pouch-like structure that receives the undigested food material from the small intestine through the ileocecal valve. The vermiform appendix, a small, finger-like projection with immune functions, is also connected to the cecum. 2. Ascending colon: This section starts at the cecum and moves upward on the right side of the abdominal cavity. It is responsible for the absorption of water, electrolytes, and vitamins produced by enteric bacteria. 3. Transverse colon: Running across the abdomen from the right to the left, the transverse colon is the longest section of the large intestine. It continues the process of absorbing water, electrolytes, and nutrients while also serving as a storage area for feces. 4. Descending colon: This part travels downward on the left side of the abdominal cavity and stores feces until they are ready to be eliminated from the body. 5. Sigmoid colon: The S-shaped segment connects the descending colon to the rectum and transports feces to the rectum. 6. Rectum: This final section of the large intestine temporarily stores feces before they are eliminated from the body through the process of defecation. The colon plays a vital role in maintaining water and electrolyte balance in the body and is inhabited by gut microbiota, which contributes to digestion, immune functioning, and overall health. Dysfunction or disease of the large intestine may lead to conditions such as constipation, diarrhea, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and colon cancer, among others."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: Compose a new way to ask the same question.

If she sells each pancake for 2, how many pancakes must Janina sell each day to cover her expenses? Give me reasons, before answering the question","response":"To determine how many pancakes Janina must sell to cover her daily expenses, we first need to calculate her total daily expenses. Her daily rent is 30, and she uses 12 worth of supplies daily. Let's add these two expenses: 30 (rent) + 12 (supplies) = 42 So, her total daily expenses are 42. Now, we need to find out how many pancakes she must sell to cover this cost. Since each pancake is sold for 2, we can find out the required number of pancakes by dividing the total expenses by the price per pancake: 42 (total daily expenses) ÷ 2 (price per pancake) = 21 pancakes Therefore, Janina must sell 21 pancakes each day to cover her expenses (rent and supplies)."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: You are given a password and you need to generate the number of steps required to convert the given password to a strong password.

The Homeric Epics (i.e. Iliad and Odyssey) were especially and generally accepted as part of the Greek past and it was not until the 19th century that scholars began to question Homer's historicity. As part of the Mycenaean heritage that survived, the names of the gods and goddesses of Mycenaean Greece (e.g. Zeus, Poseidon and Hades) became major figures of the Olympian Pantheon of later antiquity. Who was the author of these tales ?","response":"The author of the Homeric Epics, the Iliad and the Odyssey, is traditionally attributed to a blind poet named Homer. Homer is considered one of the greatest poets of ancient Greece and a seminal figure in the development of Western literature. However, his historicity and even his existence has been a subject of debate among scholars. The Iliad and the Odyssey are epic poems composed in dactylic hexameter and were likely composed orally before being transcribed into written form. These epics recount the stories of the Trojan War and the various heroes involved in the conflict, as well as the adventures of the Greek hero Odysseus on his journey home after the war. The tales consist of a mixture of mythology, heroic legend, and history, which is why they were accepted as part of the Greek past. The exact dating and origins of the Homeric Epics remain uncertain, but it is generally believed that they were written down in the 8th century BCE. Although the poems are attributed to Homer, there is ongoing debate about the \\"Homeric Question,\\" which involves the uncertainty around who the real author was or even whether a single author was responsible for both epics. Some theories suggest that the Iliad and the Odyssey were composed by a single author, Homer, who composed and transmitted these tales through an oral tradition. Other theories propose that the poems were the work of multiple poets who compiled existing oral traditions and tales, and that the figure of Homer was created as a symbolic representation of these poets. Yet another theory posits that the poems were the result of a long process of accumulation and synthesis of various narratives and that they were eventually attributed to a figure named Homer for convenience. In recent times, various analytical methods have been applied to determine the authorship of the Homeric Epics, including linguistic and stylistic analyses, as well as the examination of historical, archaeological, and cultural evidence. However, despite these efforts, the identity of the author of the Iliad and the Odyssey still remains elusive. In conclusion, the author of the Homeric Epics, the Iliad, and the Odyssey is traditionally regarded as the poet Homer. However, the historicity and even the existence of Homer continue to be debated among scholars, and no definitive answer has been reached about the actual author(s) behind these influential works of ancient Greek literature."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: You are given a sentence in Portuguese.

Daniel Answer:","response":"Title: \\"Resonance\\" Daniel, a fireman renowned for his mild demeanor and heroic deeds, leads a peaceful life in the small, serene town of Bedford. Until one fateful day, his world is turned upside down when he hears a sound that would haunt him incessantly - the anxious cry of a child echoing from the bell tower of the town’s dilapidated church that has been locked up and abandoned for years. The child, named Eli, is an adventurous and curious six-year-old who has an affinity for exploring abandoned places and collecting relics. He sneaked into the bell tower out of curiosity but accidentally tripped on some loose rubble, causing a floor collapse. He is now trapped in the towering structure that has become a nightmarish maze. Daniel learns about the situation through Eli’s friends who saw him sneak into the church but were too scared to follow. He immediately springs into action, negotiating the disintegrating stairs and loose floors of the tower, calling out Eli's name and reassured by the responding echoes indicating the child's consciousness. Battling the odds not just from the hazardous conditions inside the bell tower but also the ticking clock, Daniel, with his firefighting equipment, breaks through barriers and navigates with precise judgment and unparalleled bravery. All the while, the town's people remain vigilant and supportive outside the bell tower, their hopes dwindling with each passing hour. With time running out, Daniel gets into a fix – he has to traverse through a weakened floor that might give away under their combined weight. Making a tough choice, he decides to cross it alone, promising to return for Eli. Yet, as he crosses, the floor gives away despite his calculated efforts. Miraculously, he manages to hang on to the ropes of the bell tower which leads him to a safely reachable part of the floor below. Yet now Daniel is faced with a two-pronged dilemma – to find a safe route back up to Eli, and to do it quickly as the bell tower walls start to crumble. He hatches an ingenious plan utilizing his fireman's gear and the thick bell ropes. After multiple trials and sweat-drenching efforts, an exhausted Daniel hoists himself back to Eli. Clinging to each other amidst the collapsing tower, they miraculously navigate their way down, guided by Eli's knowledge of his previous exploration. As they walk out of the tower, just as it finally crumbles to the ground, the townspeople cheer in relief and joy. Daniel becomes a celebrated hero in the town of Bedford, and young Eli learns a valuable lesson about safety. Most importantly, a resonant bond forms between the two of them — one that encapsulates the spirit of humanity, resilience, and the strong bond shared in the face of adversity."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Background: A mycorrhiza (Greek for \\"fungus roots\\") is a symbiotic association between a fungus and the roots of a plant. In a mycorrhizal association, the fungus may colonize the roots of a host plant by either growing directly into the root cells, or by growing around the root cells. This association provides the fungus with relatively constant and direct access to glucose, which the plant produces by photosynthesis. The mycelia of the fungi increase the surface area of the plant’s root system. The larger surface area improves water and mineral nutrient absorption from the soil. Paragraph: Two gardeners started their planting season at the same time. Bill used mycorrizal fungi compost for the garden, while Hank used regular top soil. Bill was very happy with the harvest.

Passage:Denean Howard and her 3 sisters gained fame in 1979 when the four of them teamed up to set the National High School record in the 4x440 yard relay for San Gorgonio High School in San Bernardino. That distance is now rarely run as the NFHS converted to metric distances, so the record still stands today. Later teams with Denean broke the record for the slightly shorter 4x400 metres relay, after sister Atra graduated and the rest of the family moved to Kennedy High School (Los Angeles). Denean was the California High School Athlete of the Year at Kennedy in 1982, following in the footsteps of her sister Sherri. Also following her sister, she was named the national Girl's \\"High School Athlete of the Year\\" by Track and Field News, two years in a row. Her 1982 52.39 was the NFHS national high school record for eighteen years, before it was beaten by Monique Henderson.

Hi there, little friends! Today, we're going to talk about people and households. Sometimes, it's fun to know how many more people there are than places they call home. First, let's learn what a household is. A household is a place where people live together under one roof. It can be a family, a group of friends, or even just one person living alone. A household can live in a house, an apartment, or any other kind of building. Now, imagine you have a toy box with different types of toys. Let's say, there are dolls, cars, and LEGO blocks. If we count how many toys are there in total, it's bigger than the number of types, right? The same happens with people and households. There are more people than the number of households because more than one person usually lives in a household together. People count everyone in the world – all the children, moms, dads, grandmas, grandpas, and even your friends. If we could count how many people there are in the whole world, we would get a very, very big number. Over 7 billion! That's like having 7 thousand million playmates! Isn't that a lot? On the other hand, households are the homes where these people live. So, if we count how many houses or apartments there are in the world, we get a smaller number than the total number of people. When we want to know how many more people there are than households, we need to compare the number of people with the number of households. It's like comparing the number of all toys and the number of types of toys in your toy box. But, because every place is different, it's hard to give a perfect number. In some countries, there are more people living in each household, while in others, fewer people live together. So, when someone asks how many more people there are than households, we could say that there are many millions more people! So, always remember that there are more people in the world than households, and the difference is a very big number. Keep exploring and learning, and maybe one day, you can help count all those people and households around the world!"},{"question":"Teacher:You are given a sentence in Persian.

She served as the First Lady of the United States from March 1933 to April 1945 during her husband President Franklin D. Roosevelt's four terms in office, making her the longest serving First Lady of the United States. Roosevelt served as United States Delegate to the United Nations General Assembly from 1945 to 1952. President Harry S. Truman later called her the \\"First Lady of the World\\" in tribute to her human rights achievements. Roosevelt's chief project during her husband's first two terms was the establishment of a planned community in Arthurdale, West Virginia. On August 18, 1933, at Hickok's urging, Roosevelt visited the families of homeless miners in Morgantown, West Virginia, who had been blacklisted following union activities. Deeply affected by the visit, Roosevelt proposed a resettlement community for the miners at Arthurdale, where they could make a living by subsistence farming, handicrafts, and a local manufacturing plant. She hoped the project could become a model for \\"a new kind of community\\" in the U.S., in which workers would be better cared for. Her husband enthusiastically supported the project. After an initial, disastrous experiment with prefab houses, construction began again in 1934 to Roosevelt's specifications, this time with \\"every modern convenience\\", including indoor plumbing and central steam heat. Families occupied the first fifty homes in June, and agreed to repay the government in thirty years' time. Though Roosevelt had hoped for a racially mixed community, the miners insisted on limiting membership to white Christians. After losing a community vote, Roosevelt recommended the creation of other communities for the excluded black and Jewish miners. The experience motivated Roosevelt to become much more outspoken on the issue of racial discrimination. Roosevelt remained a vigorous fundraiser for the community for several years, as well as spending most of her own income on the project. However, the project was criticized by both the political left and right. Conservatives condemned it as socialist and a \\"communist plot\\", while Democratic members of Congress opposed government competition with private enterprise. Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes also opposed the project, citing its high per-family cost. Arthurdale continued to sink as a government spending priority for the federal government until 1941, when the U.S. sold off the last of its holdings in the community at a loss. Later commentators generally described the Arthurdale experiment as a failure. Roosevelt herself was sharply discouraged by a 1940 visit in which she felt the town had become excessively dependent on outside assistance. However, the residents considered the town a \\"utopia\\" compared to their previous circumstances, and many were returned to economic self-sufficiency. Roosevelt personally considered the project a success, later speaking of the improvements she saw in people's lives there and stating, \\"I don't know whether you think that is worth half a million dollars. But I do.\\" Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: were the people of Arthurdale grateful to her?","response":"Yes, the people of Arthurdale were grateful to her. The quote from the article that supports this is: \\"However, the residents considered the town a 'utopia' compared to their previous circumstances, and many were returned to economic self-sufficiency.\\""},{"question":"This House Believes the IAEA is not effective at preventing proliferation What argument could one make about this debate topic?","response":"When debating the topic of \\"Is the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) effective at preventing proliferation?\\" one could make a strong argument that the IAEA is not entirely effective at preventing proliferation. This argument can be broken down into several key points, offering examples and explanations that back up the assertion. 1. Limited power and jurisdiction: The first argument that can be made is that the IAEA, as an international organization, lacks the power necessary to enforce its regulations and safeguards on a global scale. Though the IAEA has the authority to conduct inspections and verify compliance, countries are ultimately free to ignore or downplay the findings of these inspections without any immediate consequences. This can lead to situations where countries discreetly continue their nuclear programs without meaningful deterrence from the IAEA. 2. Non-member states: Another issue with the IAEA’s ability to prevent proliferation is the fact that not all countries are members of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). This compromises the IAEA's role as a global nuclear watchdog. Non-member states, such as India, Pakistan, and Israel, are not obliged to adhere to the same regulations as member states and can develop their nuclear programs freely, effectively sidestepping IAEA scrutiny. 3. Verification challenges: The IAEA heavily relies on inspections and monitoring to verify whether a nation is in compliance with its nuclear agreements. However, these verification mechanisms can be compromised by various factors, including the ability of countries to conceal their nuclear activities, misrepresent their intentions, or undergo covert development of nuclear capabilities. The agency's inability to guarantee foolproof verification raises questions over its effectiveness in preventing nuclear proliferation. 4. Dependence on member-state cooperation: The IAEA's success and ability to prevent proliferation depend on the cooperation of its member states. If a member refuses to comply with IAEA regulations or denies access to its nuclear facilities, the agency's ability to fulfill its mandate is significantly diminished. High-profile examples such as Iran and North Korea demonstrate how countries can defy IAEA regulations, furthering their nuclear ambitions despite international scrutiny and pressure. 5. Political Influences: The IAEA is not exempt from political pressures, both internally and externally. Decisions made by the agency are often subject to negotiation and compromise among member states, which can sometimes undermine the IAEA's role in upholding the NPT. Additionally, major powers with significant nuclear capabilities have been known to intervene in IAEA affairs, potentially skewing the agency's purpose and mandate. 6. Insufficient resources: It can be argued that the IAEA is not adequately funded or equipped to effectively carry out its duties. While the agency has seen a considerable increase in its budget over the past few decades, its responsibilities have grown as well. The IAEA's ability to monitor emerging threats and carry out thorough inspections in multiple countries is hampered by a lack of resources, further hindering its prevention efforts. 7. Slow response to emerging threats: Due to bureaucratic complexities and the need for consensus, the IAEA is often slow to address emerging proliferation risks. Cases such as North Korea and Iran have shown that the agency can fall behind in responding to advances in nuclear technology, making it less effective at preventing proliferation. In conclusion, the argument that the IAEA is not effective at preventing proliferation is based on several key points, including limited power and jurisdiction, challenges in verification, dependence on member-state cooperation, political influences, insufficient resources, and a slow response to emerging threats. While the IAEA certainly has a crucial role to play in global nuclear non-proliferation efforts, these shortcomings must be addressed in order to maximize the effectiveness of the agency in its ongoing mission to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons."},{"question":"Translate \\"Today we are being called upon to say yes or no to the text negotiated.\\" to German?","response":"\\"Heute werden wir aufgefordert, Ja oder Nein zu dem verhandelten Text zu sagen.\\" In this translation: - \\"Today\\" is translated to \\"Heute\\". - \\"we are being called upon\\" is translated to \\"werden wir aufgefordert\\". - \\"to say\\" is translated to \\"zu sagen\\". - \\"yes or no\\" is translated to \\"Ja oder Nein\\". - \\"to the text\\" is translated to \\"zu dem Text\\". - \\"negotiated\\" is translated to \\"verhandelten\\"."},{"question":"Сегодня, когда нет СССР, международное соотношение сил ухудшилось.

James is memorizing the periodic table and some of the features of the elements on it. He is currently working on the fourth row which starts with Potassium (K) on the far left and ends with Krypton (Kr) to the far right. Hint: The increase in electrons across the periodic table explains why elements go from metals to metalloids and then to nonmetals from left to right across the table. Look at period 2 in Figure below as an example. Lithium (Li) is a metal, boron (B) a metalloid, and fluorine (F) and neon (Ne) are nonmetals. The inner energy level is full for all four elements. This level has just one orbital and can hold a maximum of two electrons. The outer energy level is a different story. This level has four orbitals and can hold a maximum of eight electrons. Lithium has just one electron in this level, boron has three, fluorine has seven, and neon has eight. Answer:","response":"In a given row of the periodic table, a nonmetal will have a higher number of electrons compared to a metal.

In the given example, the elements go from lithium (a metal) with one electron in its outer energy level, to boron (a metalloid) with three electrons in its outer energy level, to fluorine (a nonmetal) with seven electrons, and neon (a nonmetal) with eight electrons in their outer energy levels."},{"question":"Trivia question: Myocardium is the muscular tissue of which part of the human body? And the answer is?","response":"The myocardium is the muscular tissue of the human heart. It is a crucial component of the heart and performs the primary role of contracting and relaxing to pump blood throughout the body. The myocardium is composed of involuntary muscle, specifically cardiac muscle, which is distinct from smooth muscle and skeletal muscle. The heart is divided into four chambers: two upper chambers called the atria and two lower chambers called the ventricles. The atria receive blood returning to the heart from the rest of the body, while the ventricles pump blood out of the heart and to the rest of the body. The myocardium serves as the middle layer of the heart wall, sandwiched between the outer layer, called the epicardium, and the inner layer, called the endocardium. Cardiac muscle cells, also known as cardiomyocytes, are the primary cell type found in the myocardium. These cells are unique in that they are branched and interconnected, allowing them to contract in synchrony, and they contain structures called intercalated disks that provide electrical connections between adjacent cells. This allows for the rapid and coordinated contraction of the heart's muscular tissue. The myocardium is supplied with blood by the coronary arteries, which branch off the aorta—the main blood vessel taking blood from the heart to the rest of the body. Oxygen and nutrients are delivered to the myocardial tissue via the coronary arteries, and the coronary veins collect deoxygenated blood and waste products, ultimately returning the blood to the right atrium through the coronary sinus. The function of the myocardium is regulated by the autonomic nervous system. The sympathetic nervous system increases the strength and rate of myocardial contraction during periods of increased activity or stress. Conversely, the parasympathetic nervous system helps to slow down the heart rate and decrease the force of myocardial contraction during periods of rest or relaxation. Conditions that can damage or impair the function of the myocardium include ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction (heart attack), cardiomyopathy, and viral infections such as myocarditis. Ensuring the health of the myocardium is essential for maintaining efficient blood circulation and overall cardiovascular health."},{"question":"I have a new situation: Two old friends Mary and Ann lived thousands of miles away.

However, it's important to note that this is just a rough estimate based on limited information. Ideally, a review would contain more details to allow for a better understanding of the user's experience and a more accurate ★-rating. Factors that may potentially affect the assignment of a ★-rating to this review could include: 1. The context of the review: If the average rating of the app is very high (e.g., above ★★★★), then this review might be considered lower in comparison. On the contrary, if the average rating of the app is low (e.g., below ★★★), then this review might be considered higher in comparison. 2. The user's previous reviews: Analyzing the user's past reviews can provide insight into their rating behavior. If the user is generally more critical of apps and rarely gives high ratings, then \\"Nice app\\" might actually be a strong endorsement. Conversely, if the user tends to give out high ratings easily, then \\"Nice app\\" might suggest a lower rating than expected. 3. The reviewer's expectations: Some users might expect more than just a 'nice' experience from the app, resulting in a lower rating. Others might find a 'nice' experience more than satisfactory and lean towards a higher rating. Given these factors, assuming a ★-rating of around ★★★ or ★★★★ might be a reasonable estimate. However, it is essential to keep in mind the limitations of deriving a ★-rating from such a brief review and consider this assessment as a rough approximation rather than an exact rating."},{"question":"Choose from options: Determine if the sentence is true based on the text below: Virginia has at least once county.

Now he was afraid he had lost his athletic touch forever. However, a friend encouraged him to try a cartwheel on the beach. Rex did an awesome cartwheel on his first try! Write the next sentence, by choosing from: OPTIONS: a. He was relieved. b. Rex did his first ever cartwheel that day.","response":"a. He was relieved. Upon completing the cartwheel, Rex felt a mixture of joy, accomplishment, and relief wash over him. Deep down, there had always been a lurking fear that he had completely lost his athletic touch as he left his gymnastics days behind in high school. This fear was often intensified as he found himself growing increasingly distant from the rigorous and exhilarating physical activities that he once adored. However, his friend's encouragement to simply try a cartwheel on the beach brought about a powerful realization. It showed Rex that, even with the passage of time and the changes that life had taken him through, the resilience and skill that had been cultivated during his time as a gymnast had not entirely vanished. In many ways, this simple cartwheel on the beach symbolized a reawakening for Rex. It proved that he had not, and could not, fully lose touch with the athletic aspect of his identity that had once played such a fundamental role in his life. It was a reminder that the skills he had honed years ago as a gymnast, though seemingly dormant, were very much alive, waiting to be rediscovered and explored. This realization opened up a realm of possibilities for Rex. Emboldened by the successful cartwheel, he began to seek out ways to reintegrate physical activities and gymnastics elements into his daily life. The world around him became a playground once again, as he found joy in practicing handstands, jumps, and balancing exercises. In time, Rex started attending local gymnastics classes, where he connected with like-minded individuals who shared his passion for the sport. Together, they pushed each other to refine their techniques and reach new heights, drawing from their past experiences and the unshakable spirit of determination that burned within each of them. Rex's newfound enthusiasm for gymnastics also had a ripple effect on the rest of his life. It taught him that growth often stems from stepping outside of our comfort zones and reconnecting with our past, even when we may not think that we have anything left to learn. Additionally, it demonstrated the power of encouragement and willingness to try something as seemingly simple as a cartwheel on the beach. Ultimately, finding the confidence to rediscover his gymnastics skills turned out to be one of the most valuable moments of Rex's life. Not only did it renew his love for gymnastics and help him forge meaningful connections with others, but it also served as a reminder of the importance of never giving up on a part of ourselves that once made us feel truly alive. The sense of relief that Rex felt that day on the beach was more than just the result of a successful cartwheel. It was the beginning of a personal transformation – one that would leave an indelible mark on his life for years to come."},{"question":"Given the question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

Movie plot title: Fast Food Nation Movie plot: Don Anderson is the Mickey's hamburger chain marketing director who helped develop the \\"Big One\\", its most popular menu item. When he learns that independent research has discovered a considerable presence of fecal matter in the meat, he travels to the fictitious town of Cody, Colorado to determine if the local Uni-Globe meatpacking processing plant, Mickey's main meat supplier, is guilty of sloppy production. Don's tour shows him only the pristine work areas and most efficient procedures, assuring him that everything the company produces is immaculate. Suspicious of the facade he's been shown, Don meets rancher Rudy Martin, who used to supply cattle to the Uni-Globe plant. Rudy and his Chicana housekeeper both assure him that because of the plant's production level, several safety regulations are ignored or worked against; workers have no time to make sure that the manure coming from the intestines stays away from the meat. Don later meets with Harry Rydell, executive VP of Mickey's, who admits being aware of the issue, but is not concerned. Amber is a young, upbeat employee of Mickey's, studying for college and living with her mother Cindy. While her life seems to be set, she continually faces the contrast between her current career and her own ambition, emphasized by her two lazy co-workers, Brian and Andrew, who, having heard of armed robberies at fast food restaurants in the area, start planning their own.

I'm really terrible with the rules set by others, especially companies. Even as a child, I could never stay inside the lines in colouring books. Some of you might put this down to poor hand-eye coordination, but I maintain that I was a rule-breaker right from the beginning. One of my roles as an engineer with a multiplicity of companies was to set up projects, define the scope of the work, contract the work out and manage the project. I was setting up a robot-based manufacturing cell for the company in the business of making early cellphones. The cell design required some equipment to be designed and built from scratch, so I got a local designer, Fergus, to give me a quote and got him started on the work. Now, any project will run over budget and take longer than planned and the contractor may come back for more money. And so it was with this designer; he wasn't really vocal about it, but he indicated that the work did take a lot more time and expense than he's originally budgeted. My usual reaction to these things is that this is not my problem. Most of the companies I've work for have lost money, so why should I give a rat's ass if some other company comes up a little short? In this case though, I liked Fergus and, as he was really a one-man operation, I decided to cut him some slack. But first, I had to get permission from my boss to drop another few grand into Fergus's jeans. My boss refused. Having someone tell me I can't do something really brings out my dark side; especially around the time of the full moon. Not long before, we had just waved a fond(-ish) farewell to our president as he was going on to greener fields. As a parting gift, the company bought him either a boat or a motor home, I forget which, and equipped it with three of their cell phones. who is the author? Pick the correct answer from the following options: - not enough information - an engineer - a manager - a scientist","response":"not enough information"},{"question":"Information: - Rodrigo de Villandrando ( 1588 -- December 1622 ) was a court painter during the reign of Philip III of Spain . He worked in the tradition of Alonso Sánchez Coello and Juan Pantoja de la Cruz . His death opened the road to court for the young painter Diego Velázquez from Sevilla . - Jan van Eyck (before c. 1390 9 July 1441) was a Flemish/Netherlandish painter active in Bruges. He is often considered one of the founders of Early Netherlandish painting school and one of the most significant representatives of Northern Renaissance art. The few surviving records of his early life indicate that he was born c. 13801390, most likely in Maaseik. He took employment in the Hague as painter and \\"Valet de chambre\\" with John III the Pitiless, ruler of Holland and Hainaut in the Hague around 1422, when he was already a master painter with workshop assistants. After John's death in 1425 he was employed in Lille as court painter to Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, until 1429 before moving to Bruges, where he lived until his death. He was highly regarded by Philip, and undertook a number of diplomatic visits abroad, including to Lisbon in 1428 to explore the possibility of a marriage contract between the duke and Isabella of Portugal. - The House of Habsburg, also called House of Hapsburg, or House of Austria, was one of the most influential royal houses of Europe. The throne of the Holy Roman Empire was continuously occupied by the Habsburgs between 1438 and 1740. The house also produced emperors and kings of the Kingdom of Bohemia, Kingdom of England (\\"Jure uxoris\\" King), Kingdom of France (Queen consort), Kingdom of Germany, Kingdom of Hungary, Kingdom of Croatia, Second Mexican Empire, Kingdom of Ireland (\\"Jure uxoris\\" King), Kingdom of Portugal, and Habsburg Spain, as well as rulers of several Dutch and Italian principalities. From the sixteenth century, following the reign of Charles V, the dynasty was split between its Austrian and Spanish branches. Although they ruled distinct territories, they nevertheless maintained close relations and frequently intermarried. - A portrait is a painting, photograph, sculpture, or other artistic representation of a person, in which the face and its expression is predominant. The intent is to display the likeness, personality, and even the mood of the person. For this reason, in photography a portrait is generally not a snapshot, but a composed image of a person in a still position. A portrait often shows a person looking directly at the painter or photographer, in order to most successfully engage the subject with the viewer. - Alonso Sánchez Coello (1531 8 August 1588) was a Spanish portrait painter of the Spanish Renaissance. He is mainly known for his portrait paintings executed in a style, which combines the objectivity of the Flemish tradition with the sensuality of Venetian painting. He was court painter to Philip II. - Diego Rodríguez de Silva y Velázquez (; baptized on June 6, 1599August 6, 1660) was a Spanish painter, the leading artist in the court of King Philip IV, and one of the most important painters of the Spanish Golden Age. He was an individualistic artist of the contemporary Baroque period, important as a portrait artist. In addition to numerous renditions of scenes of historical and cultural significance, he painted scores of portraits of the Spanish royal family, other notable European figures, and commoners, culminating in the production of his masterpiece \\"Las Meninas\\" (1656). - The Baroque (or ) is often thought of as a period of artistic style that used exaggerated motion and clear, easily interpreted detail to produce drama, tension, exuberance, and grandeur in sculpture, painting, architecture, literature, dance, theater, and music. The style began around 1600 in Rome and Italy, and spread to most of Europe. - Juan Pantoja de La Cruz (1553 26 October 1608) was a Spanish painter, one of the best representatives of the Spanish school of court painters. He worked for Philip II and Philip III. The Museo del Prado contains examples of his severe portraiture style. - Philip III of Spain (14 April 1578 31 March 1621) was King of Spain (as \\"Philip III\\" in Castile and \\"Philip II\\" in Aragon) and Portugal. A member of the House of Habsburg, Philip III was born in Madrid to King Philip II of Spain and his fourth wife and niece Anna, the daughter of Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian II and Maria of Spain. Philip III later married his cousin Margaret of Austria, sister of Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor. - The Prado Museum is the main Spanish national art museum, located in central Madrid. It features one of the world's finest collections of European art, dating from the 12th century to the early 20th century, based on the former Spanish Royal Collection, and unquestionably the best single collection of Spanish art. Founded as a museum of paintings and sculpture in 1819, it also contains important collections of other types of works. El Prado is one of the most visited sites in the world, and is considered one of the greatest museums of art in the world. The numerous works by Francisco de Goya, the single most extensively represented artist, as well as by Diego Velázquez, El Greco, Titian, Peter Paul Rubens and Hieronymus Bosch are some of the highlights of the collection. - A court painter was an artist who painted for the members of a royal or noble family, sometimes on a fixed salary and on an exclusive basis where the artist was not supposed to undertake other work. Especially in the late Middle Ages, they were often given the office of valet de chambre. Usually they were given a salary and formal title, and often a pension for life, though arrangements were highly variable. For the artist, a court appointment had the advantage of freeing them from the restriction of local painters' guilds, although in the Middle Ages and Renaissance they also often had to spend large amounts of time doing decorative work about the palace, and creating temporary works for court entertainments and displays. In England the role of Serjeant Painter was set up for this, leaving the \\"King's painter\\" (and the queen's) free to paint mostly portraits. See category of \\"Italian art collectors\\" for lists that included non-aristocratic patrons. Some artists, like Jan van Eyck or Diego Velázquez, were used in other capacities at court, as diplomats, functionaries, or administrators. - Valet de chambre, or \\"varlet de chambre\\", was a court appointment introduced in the late Middle Ages, common from the 14th century onwards. Royal households had many persons appointed at any time. While some valets simply waited on the patron, or looked after his clothes and other personal needs, itself potentially a powerful and lucrative position, others had more specialized functions. At the most prestigious level it could be akin to a monarch or ruler's personal secretary, as was the case of Anne de Montmorency at the court of Francis I of France. For noblemen pursuing a career as courtiers, like Étienne de Vesc, it was a common early step on the ladder to higher offices. - The Spanish Golden Age (, \\"Golden Century\\") is a period of flourishing in arts and literature in Spain, coinciding with the political rise of the Spanish Habsburg dynasty. \\"El Siglo de Oro\\" does not imply precise dates and is usually considered to have lasted longer than an actual century. It begins no earlier than 1492, with the end of the \\"Reconquista\\" (Reconquest), the sea voyages of Christopher Columbus to the New World, and the publication of Antonio de Nebrija's \\"Gramática de la lengua castellana\\" (Grammar of the Castilian Language). Politically, it ends no later than 1659, with the Treaty of the Pyrenees, ratified between France and Habsburg Spain. The last great writer of the period, Pedro Calderón de la Barca, died in 1681, and his death usually is considered the end of \\"El Siglo de Oro\\" in the arts and literature. - In the history of Europe, the Middle Ages or medieval period lasted from the 5th to the 15th century. It began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and merged into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery. The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history: classical antiquity, the medieval period, and the modern period. The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early, High, and Late Middle Ages. - Las Meninas (Spanish for The Ladies-in-Waiting) is a 1656 painting in the Museo del Prado in Madrid, by Diego Velázquez, the leading artist of the Spanish Golden Age. Its complex and enigmatic composition raises questions about reality and illusion, and creates an uncertain relationship between the viewer and the figures depicted. Because of these complexities, \\"Las Meninas\\" has been one of the most widely analyzed works in Western painting. - Ferdinand II (9 July 1578 15 February 1637), a member of the House of Habsburg, was Holy Roman Emperor (16191637), King of Bohemia (16171619, 16201637), and King of Hungary (16181625). His acts started the Thirty Years' War. Ferdinand's aim, as a zealous Catholic, was to restore Catholicism as the only religion in the Empire and to suppress Protestantism. - The Spanish Renaissance refers to a movement in Spain, emerging from the Italian Renaissance in Italy during the 14th century, that spread to Spain during the 15th and 16th centuries. - Philip II of Spain (21 May 1527 13 September 1598), called \\"the Prudent\\" (el Prudente), was King of Spain (155698), King of Portugal (158198, as \\"Philip I\\", \\"Filipe I\\"), King of Naples and Sicily (both from 1554), and during his marriage to Queen Mary I (155458) \\"jure uxoris\\" King of England and Ireland.

In a speech to the National Association of Manufacturers in Washington, Trump promised to deliver on a “giant, beautiful, massive, the biggest ever in our country, tax cut.” Trump is eager to move past setbacks on health care reform and the results of a Republican Senate primary Tuesday in Alabama where he found himself on the losing side. The president and his administration also have been on the defensive over hurricane recovery efforts in Puerto Rico. Senate Republicans put off a vote on a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare after it became clear they did not have enough votes to pass the measure, thanks to a handful of Republican defectors. Democrats expressed relief they had beaten back another attempt to undo former President Barack Obama’s signature achievement, the Affordable Care Act. “The reason this bill failed is because millions of Americans didn’t want it,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer told reporters at the Capitol. On the same day, Christian conservative and former judge Roy Moore easily won a Republican Senate primary in Alabama, defeating incumbent Luther Strange, whom Trump had supported. “We are put here on Earth for a short time, and for that short time our duty it to serve almighty God,” Moore said in his victory speech. Moore has made controversial statements on a number of issues in the past, but he is considered the favorite in a race against Democrat Doug Jones in a general election Dec. 12. Trump had appeared with Strange the week before at a rally in Alabama, but even some analysts said his heart did not appear to be in it. “Trump was campaigning for Luther Strange, but you could tell he was having some second thoughts about that,” said Republican strategist John Feehery.

In a situation like this, it's important to approach the issue in a systematic way. Step 1: Identify the problem The primary issue in this scenario was the mix-up of the meal options. The employees had been expecting sandwiches, but instead, they found salads waiting for them. Understanding this situation helps in addressing it more efficiently. Step 2: Communicate with the catering company Once the problem was identified, the office manager immediately called the catering company to inform them of the error. By addressing the issue promptly, the manager aimed to prevent similar problems in the future and to see if any immediate solutions were available. Step 3: Offer alternatives Although the employees were disappointed with the salad options, the office manager took initiative and quickly searched the kitchen for any additional meal choices. They found some leftover pizza from a previous meeting, which they promptly offered as an alternative. Step 4: Gather feedback In order to understand if this issue affected employee satisfaction, the office manager spoke with a few employees to gather their opinions on the lunch mishap. This feedback would be valuable for future event planning and coordination. Step 5: Follow up with the catering company After gathering feedback, the office manager contacted the catering company once more to provide them with the input collected. They explained how the error impacted employee morale and requested a possible refund or discount on future orders as compensation for the inconvenience. Step 6: Improve future lunch orders Finally, the office manager made notes of the incident and considered how to avoid similar mix-ups in the future. This could include finding a more reliable catering company, double-checking orders ahead of time, or even taking a poll of employee meal preferences to ensure maximum satisfaction.

Ten years after the end of World War II, Tom Rath is living in suburban Connecticut with his wife Betsy and three children; he's having difficulty supporting his family on his salary writing for a nonprofit organization. Tom is also dealing with flashbacks from his combat service as an Army Captain in both the European and Pacific theaters, involving men that he killed (including, by accident, his best friend), and a young Italian girl named Maria, with whom he had a brief but heartfelt affair in Italy despite his being in a relationship with Betsy at the time.

She spends 4 hours per day working on homework. She spends 8 hours per day sleeping. She works part-time 20 hours per week. How many hours left over does Madeline have? If the answer is '46'; explain the reasoning:","response":"To calculate the number of hours Madeline has left over, we first need to find the total number of hours spent on class, homework, sleep, and work during a week. The information provided is as follows: 1. Madeline spends 18 hours a week in class. 2. She spends 4 hours per day working on homework. 3. She spends 8 hours per day sleeping. 4. She works part-time 20 hours per week. First, we need to find the total number of hours Madeline spends on homework and sleep per week. Since there are 7 days in a week: Homework per week: 4 hours/day * 7 days = 28 hours Sleep per week: 8 hours/day * 7 days = 56 hours Now, let's add the total hours spent on class, homework, sleep, and work: Total hours spent: 18 hours (class) + 28 hours (homework) + 56 hours (sleep) + 20 hours (work) = 122 hours There are 168 hours in a week (24 hours/day * 7 days). To find the number of hours Madeline has left over: 168 hours - 122 hours = 46 hours So, Madeline has 46 hours left over during the week. The answer is correct, and here's the reasoning: Madeline spends a combined total of 122 hours per week on class, homework, sleep, and her part-time job. When we subtract that total from the total number of hours in a week (168 hours), we find that she has 46 hours remaining for other activities."},{"question":"Out of boredom, two scientists from the New Contagious Diseases Research Centre devised themselves a new game. One day, as a result of the suspension of a research project dealing with a dynamically mutating vaccine following the pattern of the eyesocket flu bacillus, they had absolutely nothing to do until the end of the day, because the boss didn't order them to wash test-tubes. They decided to play a game of hockey under the microscope. For a puck they used one of the millions of experimental bacillus, and one-arm pincettes, which as it happened also resembled hockey sticks, served as sticks. The bacillus was not happy with it at all. It wanted to rest after an exhausting task involving vaccine discouragement, and these whitecoats here planned to put it to work yet again. And this time the work was much more labor-intensive and even more exhausting than before, but the condition and health of the tired bacillus not as good as in the times of youth, about two hours ago. The scientists got excited. On a microscope slide they etched a hockey rink with laser, agreed on the rules, connected the microscope's camera to the big screen display and played until the morning. They had to change pucks several times, but that was fine, they had millions of them in stock. The next day they didn't have anything to do either and they continued to play.

When water in the sand cannot escape, it creates a liquefied soil that loses strength and cannot support weight. Quicksand can form in standing water or in upwards flowing water (as from an artesian spring). In the case of upwards flowing water, forces oppose the force of gravity and suspend the soil particles. The saturated sediment may appear quite solid until a sudden change in pressure or shock initiates liquefaction. This causes the sand to form a suspension and lose strength. The cushioning of water gives quicksand, and other liquefied sediments, a spongy, fluid-like texture. Objects in liquefied sand sink to the level at which the weight of the object is equal to the weight of the displaced soil/water mix and the submerged object floats due to its buoyancy. Rob is competing in a cross country race. After running about a mile he reached a place with two signs, sign A and sign B. Sign A says that it's a quicksand. But sign B says that it's not a quicksand. He has to decide which way to go. Would sing A indicate spongy texture or not spongy texture of the soil? The answer is:","response":"Sign A would indicate a spongy texture of the soil, as it states that it is quicksand. Quicksand, as described, has a spongy, fluid-like texture due to the cushioning of water and liquefied sediments. So, if Rob encounters the area marked by Sign A, he should expect the soil to have a spongy texture because it is quicksand."},{"question":"Information: - Bronisaw Maria Komorowski (born 4 June 1952) is a Polish politician and historian who served as President of Poland from 2010 to 2015. - Donald Franciszek Tusk (born 22 April 1957) is a Polish politician and historian.

(CNN) -- Monsignor William Lynn, the highest-ranking cleric accused of imperiling children by helping cover up sexual abuse, was found guilty Friday of one count of child endangerment. He was found not guilty on a second count of endangerment and a conspiracy charge to protect a priest accused of abuse. The jury was unable to bring a verdict against his co-defendant, the Rev. James Brennan, who was charged with attempted rape of a 14-year-old altar boy and endangering the welfare of a child. Lynn was taken into custody after Friday's verdict, when the judge revoked his bail. His lawyer, Jeffrey Lindy, derided the decision not to let his client remain free on bond prior to sentencing, calling it \\"an unspeakable miscarriage of justice (for) a 61-year-old man with no prior record and long established ties to the community.\\" \\"Because of the","response":"nature of the case and the gravity of the charges, Monsignor Lynn's conviction represents a monumental moment within both the Catholic Church and the larger discussions on sexual abuse within religious institutions. While many supporters argue that he has long served the community and should not be jailed immediately, the fact remains that his actions, or lack thereof, had a direct impact on the lives and well-being of vulnerable children. For years, cases of sexual abuse within the Church have been met with varying degrees of dismissal, denial, and secrecy. As allegations continue to surface, it has become clear that the Catholic Church's hierarchy has often been complicit in shielding abusers from the consequences of their actions, thereby allowing the abuse to continue. With the conviction of a high-ranking official like Monsignor Lynn, a glaring spotlight has been cast on the Church, forcing it to confront its patterns of internal mismanagement and cover-ups. The verdict in Monsignor Lynn's case is indicative of a significant shift in societal attitudes towards sexual abuse within religious organizations. As the public becomes less tolerant of abuse, figures like Monsignor Lynn serve as stark reminders of the need for transparency, accountability, and immediate action within the Church. Following the conviction, the Archdiocese of Philadelphia issued a statement expressing sorrow for the victims, emphasizing their commitment to supporting survivors and pledging to make necessary changes to prevent future abuse. The verdict has undeniably served as a deterrent for other religious institutions to be more diligent in addressing allegations of abuse and prioritizing the safety and welfare of their congregants—especially the most vulnerable members. In the coming months, Lynn's defense team will likely appeal the verdict and seek leniency in sentencing. While the outcome of these attempts remains uncertain, one undeniable fact is clear: the Catholic Church, and religious institutions as a whole, now face heightened scrutiny in addressing the sexual abuse crisis. As more survivors continue to come forward, the Church must listen, respond, and make meaningful reforms to protect, support, and seek justice for those who have suffered at the hands of clergy. In conclusion, although opinions surrounding Monsignor Lynn's immediate detainment may differ, it cannot be denied that his conviction serves as a seismic shift in addressing sexual abuse within religious institutions. It signifies a move towards greater accountability and an unwavering demand for the protection of vulnerable individuals. Society can only hope that this case marks the beginning of a new era in which faith-based organizations take meaningful steps to prevent any form of abuse from occurring in the future, and provide unyielding support to those impacted by the actions of malignant individuals.\\""},{"question":"On a scale of 1-5 (with 1 being least favorable and 5 being most favorable), how would you rate this review? \\"Sucks 45 minutes and only 28 percent updated\\" Answer:","response":"Given that the review \\"Sucks 45 minutes and only 28 percent updated\\" is brief and lacks specific details, it is difficult to provide a comprehensive rating without further context. Nevertheless, I will do my best to analyze the review based on its content. 1. Clarity: The review is relatively clear in expressing the user's dissatisfaction with the time taken for an update. Hence, I would rate this aspect a 3 out of 5. 2. Details: The review provides some details, such as the amount of time taken (45 minutes) and the percentage of the update completed (28 percent). However, it doesn't mention what is being updated or any related issue. This lack of information makes it challenging to understand the problem's cause or offer possible solutions. As a result, I would rate the review a 2 out of 5 for details. 3. Constructive feedback: The review does not provide specific, actionable feedback for improvement. Although the user is clearly unhappy with the update's duration, they do not provide suggestions or elaborate on their expectations. On this criterion, I would rate the review a 1 out of 5. 4. Tone: The review is negative, using words such as \\"sucks\\" to convey the user's dissatisfaction. While it is essential to share honest opinions, being curt about it does not help provide a comprehensive understanding of the issue. Thus, I would give a 2 out of 5 for tone. 5. Objectivity: The review is subjective and seems based on the user's personal experience. It presents no evidence or comparisons to other updates or user experiences to form a well-rounded opinion. Therefore, I would rate the review a 2 out of 5 for objectivity. Taking into account these five aspects, the average rating for the review would be 2 out of 5. This rating suggests that the review is poorly-constructed, lacking important context and specific feedback to help improve the issue at hand. It is also not objective in its assessment and could benefit from a more constructive tone."},{"question":"Alfred Alder, a famous psychiatrist, had an interesting experience. When he was a small boy he got off to a poor start in arithmetic. His teacher got the idea that he had no ability in arithmetic, and told his parents what she thought in order that they would not expect too much of him. In this way, they too developed the idea, \\"Isn't it too bad that Alfred can't do arithmetic?\\" He accepted their mistaken estimate of his ability, feeling that it was useless to try, and that he was very poor at arithmetic, just as they expected. One day he became very angry at the teacher and the other students because they laughed when he said he saw how to do a problem which none of the other students had been able to solve. Adler succeeded in solving the problem. This gave him confidence. He rejected the idea that he couldn't do arithmetic and was determined to show them that he could. His anger and his new found confidence stimulated him to go at arithmetic problems with a new spirit. He now worked with interest, determination, and purpose, and he soon became extraordinarily good at arithmetic. He not only proved that he could do arithmetic, but he learned early in life from his own experience that, if a person goes at a job with determination and purpose, he may astonish himself as well as others by his ability. This experience made him realize that many people have more ability than they think they have, and that lack of success is as often the result of lack of knowledge of how to apply one's ability, lack of confidence, and lack of determination as it is the result of lack of ability. Now, provide a numbered list of answers to these questions: 1. Is Alfred Alder good at math? 2. Was he always? 3. Did the teacher encourage him? 4. Did she have a talk with his parents? 5.

When you're doing the backstroke, you want your body to lay as flat on the surface of the water as possible. The smaller your profile in the water, the less resistance you'll feel as you swim and the easier it will be to go fast. (a). Position your body as you begin the backstroke. First, do your standard front stroke, followed by a mid stroke, followed by a ste stroke (which is a fairly accurate stroke).. (b). Most people have a hard time getting their hips to float on the surface of the water, so they sink down a little below the surface. This is ok but try to keep your hips as close to the surface as possible.. (c). When your body is submerged, keep your feet about shoulder width apart. If you swim along a rigid surface, you'll be able to change direction when you rotate your toes.. (d). Balance your weight on the balls of your feet and keep your shoulders down and in profile. Pass your arms and legs out to your sides..","response":"Correct answers: (b). Most people have a hard time getting their hips to float on the surface of the water, so they sink down a little below the surface. This is ok but try to keep your hips as close to the surface as possible.. (c). When your body is submerged, keep your feet about shoulder width apart. If you swim along a rigid surface, you'll be able to change direction when you rotate your toes.. Explanation: Option (a) is incorrect because it refers to different strokes and not specifically on how to swim backstroke perfectly, which is the main topic of the paragraph. The terms 'standard front stroke', 'mid stroke', and 'ste stroke' are also not relevant in swimming backstroke. Option (d) is wrong as it suggests to 'balance your weight on the balls of your feet'. This doesn't apply to swimming backstroke as you are on your back and not standing or balancing on your feet. On the other hand, Option (b) correctly adds to the instructions by giving advice on hip position during backstroke, which indeed should be as close to the surface as possible to maintain the flat body position. Finally, Option (c) provides relevant advice on foot positioning and movement while swimming backstroke, hence it's a correct choice."},{"question":"What key details about vaso sepashvili can be extracted from the following bio?

American pressmen had been alerted to an upcoming Buddhist demonstration to coincide with Double Seven Day at Chanatareansey Pagoda in the north of Saigon. The nine-man group, which included Arnett, Browne, AP photographer Horst Faas, David Halberstam, Neil Sheehan of United Press International, and CBS's Peter Kalischer and photographer Joseph Masraf waited outside the building with their equipment. After an hour-long religious ceremony, the Buddhist monks, numbering around 300, filed out of the pagoda into a narrow alley along a side street, where they were blocked and ordered to stop by plain-clothed policemen. The Buddhists did not resist, but Arnett and Browne began taking photos of the confrontation. The police, who were loyal to Ngo Dinh Nhu, thereupon punched Arnett in the nose, knocked him to the ground, kicked him with their pointed-toe shoes, and broke his camera. Halberstam, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of the Buddhist crisis, was a tall man, standing around 20 centimetres (8 in) taller than the average Vietnamese policeman.

He is currently the senior coach of the Collingwood Football Club. He is listed by journalist Mike Sheahan as one of the top 50 players of all time. Buckley won the inaugural Rising Star Award, in 1993, then went on to become one of the game's elite, captaining Collingwood between 1999 and 2007, winning the Norm Smith Medal for best player afield in the 2002 Grand Final despite playing in the losing team, only the third player in history to do so, the Brownlow Medal in 2003, winning Collingwood's Best and Fairest award, the Copeland Trophy, six times and named in the Collingwood Team of the Century. After months of speculation, Buckley signed a 5-year deal with the Collingwood Football Club. He was the assistant coach for the seasons of 2010 and 2011; he then became head coach in 2012, having taken over from Mick Malthouse, initially signing for a period of three years. Collingwood began the 2012 season shakily, losing to Hawthorn in round 1 and being thrashed by Carlton in round 3. However they recovered to win their next ten matches and finish the home-and-away season in fourth place with a record of 16-6. They were defeated by Hawthorn in the Qualifying Final before bouncing back to defeat West Coast in the Semi Final. However they lost comfortably to eventual premier Sydney in the Preliminary Final at ANZ Stadium to bring an end to the 2012 season. 2013 started poorly for the Magpies, slumping to a 5-4 record after 9 games. They couldn't quite find the consistency of previous seasons and finished the year in sixth place with a 14-8 record. They played Port Adelaide in their Elimination Final at the MCG and slumped to a shock 24-point loss, which caused Buckley to call into question the club's culture. Buckley's contract was extended until the end of 2016 by Collingwood in early March 2014, however Collingwood produced a poor performance in round 1 and lost to 2013 grand finalists Fremantle by 70 points. They ended up missing the finals to finish 12th partly due to an injury crisis. Collingwood started the 2015 season at 3-1 as of Round 4 and a gutsy win against Essendon on Anzac Day in 100th centenary of Gallipoli landing. At the end of Collingwood's 2017 season on 28 August 2017, Buckley was given a two-year contract extension by the club after it undertook a review of the entire football club.

Collect information about the subjects you are studying and your current performance in each of them. You can use report cards, progress reports, or consult your teacher to get the most accurate information. Step 2: Prioritize Areas of Improvement Based on your analysis, identify which subjects or assignments require immediate attention. Rank these areas according to their level of importance and impact on your overall grade. This will help you allocate your time and energy more effectively. Step 3: Set SMART Goals When setting goals for improvement, ensure that they are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. For instance, rather than setting a vague goal like \\"get better at math,\\" opt for something more specific like \\"increase my grade in math from a C to a B by the end of the semester.\\" Step 4: Develop Effective Study Habits One of the most critical aspects of improving your grades is establishing effective study habits. Some examples of good study habits include: - Creating a consistent study schedule - Designating a quiet and organized study space - Breaking tasks into smaller, manageable sections - Using active learning techniques, such as summarizing information, asking questions, and teaching others - Taking regular breaks to prevent burnout - Reviewing class materials and notes regularly Step 5: Use the Notebook Approach In the notebook, use the columns you labeled as 'reason', 'what?', and 'improvement' to identify and address weaknesses in your academic performance. For each area of improvement, write down the reason for the poor performance (e.g., procrastination, lack of understanding), the specific topic or assignment that needs improvement, and the action steps you will take to address the issue. Step 6: Seek Additional Resources To further support your effort to improve your grades, seek additional resources and assistance. This might include: - Attending tutoring or study group sessions - Asking teachers for additional help or supplementary materials - Utilizing online resources, videos, or tutorials to solidify understanding - Partnering with a classmate for peer support and encouragement Step 7: Track Progress and Adjust Strategies Regularly track your progress towards your goals by monitoring your grades, assignments, and any feedback from your teachers. Use this information to evaluate the effectiveness of your strategies and make adjustments as needed to stay on track. Step 8: Practice Time Management Create a daily and weekly schedule to allocate your time effectively between various subjects, extracurricular activities, and leisure. Ensure you include time for completing assignments, studying, review sessions, as well as self-care and relaxation. This will help you maintain a healthy balance between academic responsibilities and personal well-being. By consistently following these steps, you will be well on your way to improving your grades in middle school and establishing habits that will lead to success in your academic journey."},{"question":"Czech language The verbs of most aspect pairs differ in one of two ways: by prefix or by suffix.

Dieses beeindruckende militärische Unterfangen hätte eigentlich dazu führen sollen, dass sich der Staat Israel sicherer und stabiler in der Region fühlt. Zu Beginn des Sechs-Tage-Krieges im Jahr 1967 galt die israelische Armee als David, der gegen drei Goliaths ins Feld zog. Trotz dieses scheinbar ungleichen Kampfes gelang es Israel jedoch, all seine Feinde in einer beispiellosen Schlacht rasch zu besiegen und wichtige Territorien wie die Sinai-Halbinsel, die Golanhöhen und das Westjordanland zu erobern. Diese Siege demonstrierten die militärische Überlegenheit und Entschlossenheit Israels, seine Existenz und Unabhängigkeit als souveräner Staat zu verteidigen. Das Ergebnis dieses äußerst beeindruckenden Krieges hätte die Sicherheit des Staates Israels in der umkämpften Region des Nahen Ostens stärken sollen. Denn wenn man es schafft, trotz der gewaltigen Anstrengungen und Ressourcen, die auf Seiten der arabischen Armeen im Spiel waren, entscheidende Siege zu erringen, sollte das auch für zukünftige Konflikte ein klares Zeichen setzen. Allerdings sollte sich Israel trotz dieser militärischen Erfolge nicht in falscher Sicherheit wiegen. Die Zerschlagung der ägyptischen, jordanischen und syrischen Armeen im Sechs-Tage-Krieg hat zwar die militärische Überlegenheit des Landes unterstrichen, aber auch tief sitzende politische und soziale Spannungen innerhalb der Region entfacht. Diese Spannungen sind auch heute noch Gegenstand von Debatten und Verhandlungen, in denen es um den Frieden und die Stabilität im Nahen Osten geht. Daher sollte Israel trotz des erstaunlichen Sieges im Sechs-Tage-Krieg immer achtsam sein und weiterhin daran arbeiten, konstruktive Dialoge mit seinen Nachbarn aus Nahost zu führen. Nur so lässt sich eine langfristige Sicherheit und Stabilität in der Region erreichen, die auf Verständigung und Zusammenarbeit beruht."},{"question":"Angelo Cimadomo (born 11 March 1978) is an Italian footballer.

Article: Harry Houdini was a man who astonished and attracted many people during his life. Whether he was escaping from a locked box or making things disappear and reappear, he surely was entertaining. People thought that he must truly have some supernatural powers, but in fact, what Harry really had was drive. Harry was born in Budapest, Hungary, in 1874. His real name was Ehrich Weiss, the third of five children. His family moved to Wisconsin not long after his birth and when he was nine, he was tying ropes all over his backyard and learning amazing tricks to show his friends and neighbors. He visited the local locksmith, and when he had reached his teens he could pick almost any lock that was made. He also learned how to do card tricks. He and his brother, Theo, would often entertain at local parties and clubs for extra money. When Ehrich was 16, he came across a book that would actually change his life: the biography of France's greatest magician, Jean Eugene Robert-Houdin. It showed Ehrich that his hobby of magic and tricks could also be a career. Immediately, he changed his name to Harry Houdini. He and Theo headed out to make a living as magicians. In 1893, they performed at the Chicago World's Fair, and after that they traveled around giving magic shows for anyone willing to listen and pay. Theo grew restless, however, as the jobs became scarce, so he left. His timing was perfect since Harry had just fallen in love with a lovely woman named Bess who was just the right size for slipping in and out of the trunk they used in their magic tricks. They married immediately and then off they went, traveling with circuses and other road shows. Harry learned more and more tricks and spent much of his time reading and studying all kinds of locks, especially handcuffs. However, no matter what tricks they did or how hard they tried, Bess and Harry were not doing well. They tried to sell their shows for seven years and finally, in desperation, they went to Europe.

But the former pitcher and recently fired ESPN analyst insists his endorsement of presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump is not a last-resort decision. In a lengthy blog post published on Friday, Schilling listed reasons why he’s backing Trump, which do not necessarily include the claim that Trump once asked the famed owner of one bloody sock to appear on “The Apprentice.” Schilling wrote that he trusts Trump despite disagreeing with him on “many things,” among them the candidate’s controversial comments about women. But to Schilling, that issue is mitigated by the women in Trump’s life - his daughters, wife and ex-wives - who don’t “come out and complain” about him. Trump’s love of America - possesed by neither candidate \\"on the Soviet ticket” - and his clean-cut children provide Schilling with further reason to support the bloviating billionaire. Since being fired by ESPN last month for sharing a meme that ripped the controversial transgender bathroom law, Schilling has cut loose on social media, trashing his former employer and arguing with followers. Besides an unlikely debate with Stephen A. Smith, Schilling’s free-agent schedule should allow him to continue the trend of athletes joining Trump on the campaign trail.

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","response":"If cutting a deeper gash happens, it will have more effect on the formation of larger ravines. Step-by-step reasoning: 1. A deeper gash in the bedrock and soil will lead to increased erosion over time, as the stream or river continues to flow and further erode the surrounding material. 2. This increased erosion will contribute to the ravine becoming wider and deeper, eventually forming a larger ravine. 3. As the deeper gash also provides a more significant path for water to follow, it increases the likelihood of additional water sources joining the stream or river, which further accelerates the formation of larger ravines. 4. The second effect mentioned is the formation of dry ravines after the river dries up. With a deeper gash causing accelerated growth and more larger ravines, the impact of the perturbation will also increase the likelihood of more dry ravines being formed once the water dries up. In conclusion, cutting a deeper gash will have a more significant effect on the formation of larger ravines and will influence the formation of more dry ravines once the water source dries up."},{"question":"The #39;News of the World #39; reveals that David Blunkett is having an affair with a married woman.

Many scientists believe that increased use of these fuels (in vehicles and other gas-powered equipment) has the potential to irreversibly damage our environment. In addition to the environmental concerns, supplies of fossil fuels are finite, and because they are non-renewable energy sources, we will eventually need alternatives. New developments in batteries and other energy storage devices are being explored to help deal with these issues. Electrochemical processes are at the heart of these new technologies. Paragraph: Two countries used different fuels as power sources for their activities. Alsacia used fossil fuels, while Lorena devised more advanced energy storage devices, therefore relying on electricity. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which country contributed less to the irreversible damage our environment? Answer:","response":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, it is clear that Lorena contributed less to the irreversible damage to our environment. This conclusion can be derived from the fact that Lorena utilized more advanced energy storage devices and relied on electricity as a power source, rather than fossil fuels which are known to have significant negative environmental impacts. Fossil fuels, the primary energy source for Alsacia, are significant contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, including CO2, which is a major factor in climate change. The combustion of fossil fuels in vehicles and gas-powered equipment releases CO2 into the atmosphere, leading to global warming and other adverse effects on ecosystems and human health. In addition to the release of greenhouse gases, the extraction, processing, and transportation of fossil fuels can also lead to environmental degradation, such as oil spills, air and water pollution, and deforestation. On the other hand, Lorena's reliance on advanced energy storage devices and electricity indicates a focus on cleaner, more sustainable energy sources. These technologies, including batteries and other electrochemical processes, can help reduce the environmental impact associated with power generation and consumption. By utilizing cleaner energy sources and shifting away from fossil fuels, Lorena has taken a significant step towards decreasing its contribution to climate change and environmental damage. It is important to note, however, that electricity generation can still have environmental impacts depending on the sources used. For instance, if coal or natural gas is used to generate electricity in Lorena, they may still be contributing to greenhouse gas emissions, albeit to a lesser extent than Alsacia. However, with advances in renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydropower, countries like Lorena have the potential to further reduce their environmental footprints. In conclusion, based on the information provided, Lorena contributed less to the irreversible damage to our environment as compared to Alsacia, by employing advanced energy storage devices and relying on electricity rather than fossil fuels as primary power sources."},{"question":"Premise: A man with tattoos sits on a chair in the grass.

For example, if they did not exist, then a single species could become dominant over others. Grazers on a grassland keep grass from growing out of control. Predators can be keystone species . These are species that can have a large effect on the balance of organisms in an ecosystem. For example, if all of the wolves are removed from a population, then the population of deer or rabbits may increase. If there are too many deer, then they may decrease the amount of plants or grasses in the ecosystem. Decreased levels of producers may then have a detrimental effect on the whole ecosystem. In this example, the wolves would be a keystone species. Now, I have a new situation: Large birds are natural predators of rodents. Unfortunately, rodents consume crops in farmlands. In recent years, use of chemicals in agriculture has seen reduced number of large birds in Germany. But in some places in France farmers are cautions about using chemicals in agriculture. As a result, large bird population had been stable in France. Answer this question please: Which country would see less crops produced, France or Germany?","response":"Based on the given information, it is likely that Germany would see less crops produced compared to France. The reason is that the use of chemicals in agriculture has reduced the number of large birds in Germany, which in turn, could lead to an increase in the rodent population. As rodents consume crops, this could result in a decrease in crop production. In contrast, France has maintained a stable large bird population due to cautious use of chemicals in agriculture, which could help in controlling the rodent population and minimizing crop loss."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: Where could you find a pit that is burned?

A:","response":"A: The missing first step of the described process is the ingestion of food and its breakdown in the mouth through the process of mechanical and chemical digestion. Here is a more detailed explanation of the entire process, including the missing step: 1. Ingestion: The process begins with the consumption of food. The food is chewed and mixed with saliva, which contains the enzyme amylase that starts breaking down carbohydrates in the food. This creates a soft mass called a bolus that is ready to be swallowed. 2. Food begins to be processed by the digestive system: Once the bolus is swallowed, it passes down the esophagus into the stomach. Here, stomach acids and enzymes further break down the food into a semi-liquid mixture called chyme. 3. The pancreas releases enzymes to aid digestion: After chyme leaves the stomach, it enters the small intestine. The pancreas releases digestive enzymes, such as amylase, protease, and lipase, which help break down carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, respectively. The pancreatic enzymes mix with the chyme, allowing nutrients to be absorbed through the intestinal walls. 4. Digested food affects the amount of sugar in the blood: As nutrients from the food are absorbed, the level of sugar (glucose) in the blood starts to rise or fall, depending on the type and quantity of food consumed. 5. The pancreas releases one hormone to lower blood sugar (glucose) levels: In response to the rising blood sugar levels, the pancreas releases the hormone insulin. Insulin helps glucose enter the body's cells to be used for energy or stored for later use. This, in turn, lowers the blood sugar levels. 6. The pancreas releases another hormone to raise blood sugar (glucose) levels: When blood sugar levels fall, such as in between meals or during periods of fasting, the pancreas releases the hormone glucagon. Glucagon signals the liver to convert stored glycogen back into glucose, which is then released into the bloodstream, raising blood sugar levels. In summary, the missing first step of the process is the ingestion of food and the initial breakdown of that food in the mouth through mechanical and chemical digestion. This is followed by a series of events involving the digestive system, pancreatic enzymes, and hormones that ensure the body maintains a proper balance of blood sugar levels."},{"question":"Teacher:In this task you will be given a list of integers.

To combine them, we'll add their coefficients: -5*z + 4*z = -1*z So, the simplified equation is: -5 = -1*z Step 2: Solve for z Now, our goal is to isolate the variable z on one side of the equation. Since the coefficient of z is -1, we'll need to divide both sides of the equation by -1 to solve for z: -5 = -1*z To isolate z, we'll divide both sides of the equation by -1: -5 / -1 = (-1*z) / -1 This simplifies to: 5 = 1*z or 5 = z So, the solution is z = 5."},{"question":"Next question: who is the actor who plays doctor strange?","response":"The actor who plays Doctor Strange is named Benedict Cumberbatch.

Let's delve a bit deeper into this. Bird names for groups or collections can be quite intriguing, with a few examples being a \\"parliament\\" of owls, a \\"murder\\" of crows, or a \\"murmuration\\" of starlings. However, a less known term for a group of starlings is a \\"stare.\\" It's fascinating how certain species of birds get these unique collective nouns to describe a group of their kind, and the story behind each name can be equally as interesting. Starlings are small to medium-sized passerine birds in the family Sturnidae. The name \\"starling\\" is derived from the Old English word \\"staerling,\\" meaning little star — likely in reference to the dappled plumage of some starlings that resembles a night sky scattered with stars. They are known for their remarkable diversity and adaptability, with more than 120 species inhabiting different parts of the world including Europe, Asia, Africa, North America and Australia. Starlings are primarily characterized by their strong feet, their sharp, straight beaks, and their beautiful, often iridescent, feathers. Starlings are very social creatures; they commonly roost, forage, and migrate in flocks. When these birds congregate in enormous groups, their sheer number can make a spectacular visual impression. This is frequently seen in their murmurations — a thrilling display wherein tens or even hundreds of thousands of starlings move and flutter together as one, creating a seemingly fluid shape-shifting cloud in the sky. The term \\"stare\\" for a group of starlings has its roots in the Old English language. In Old English, the word for starling is \\"staer\\" and the suffix \\"ling\\" implies \\"a little.\\" When starlings are in a group, they will often stare in unison at possible threats, perhaps leading to the unusual collective noun, a \\"stare.\\" While the term might not be in common use today, it adds to the rich tapestry of language we use to describe and understand the natural world. Furthermore, the performance of these groups of starlings, both in flight and on the ground, and their unusual 'staring' behaviour is likely what led to the creation of these collective terms. It's nature's theatre at its finest, and it's no wonder that such remarkable phenomena inspire us to coin unique and eloquent terms like a 'stare' of starlings."},{"question":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Aeneas was the son of the goddess Venus (Aphrodite in Greek mythology) and the mortal Anchises, a Trojan prince. He is a central figure in the epic poem \\"Aeneid\\" written by the ancient Roman poet Virgil. The poem tells the story of Aeneas's journey from the fallen city of Troy to the land of Italy, where he becomes the ancestor of the Romans. According to the legend, after the Trojan War and the fall of Troy, Aeneas led a group of survivors, known as the Aeneadas, to search for a new home. During their voyage, they encountered numerous challenges, including battles and divine interventions. Eventually, Aeneas and his followers reached the Italian Peninsula, where he married Lavinia, the daughter of the Latin king Latinus. Aeneas and Lavinia's descendants include Romulus and Remus, the mythical founders of Rome. As a Roman general and statesman, Julius Caesar sought to associate himself with the divine lineage and heroic ancestry of Aeneas. By tracing his family lineage to the renowned hero Aeneas, Caesar aimed to legitimize his political power and elevate the prestige of his family. Moreover, it reinforced the idea that Rome was destined to rule the world, as Aeneas's journey and its divine intervention by the gods attested to Rome's favored status.

After all, people change all the time, if only because they have aged by another second and had some further experience. These occasions of experience are logically distinct, but are progressively connected in what Whitehead calls a \\"society\\" of events. By assuming that enduring objects are the most real and fundamental things in the universe, materialists have mistaken the abstract for the concrete (what Whitehead calls the \\"fallacy of misplaced concreteness\\").

While he was with the band, they had a #5 UK/#1 US hit single with \\"Make It With You\\". He was replaced by Larry Knechtel in 1971. In 1982 Royer wrote the song \\"Quittin' Time\\" (co-written with Roger Linn) which eight years later was recorded by Mary Chapin Carpenter and won an ASCAP Airplay award. Royer traveled to Nashville to receive the award and stayed with Griffin, who had previously relocated from L.A. to Nashville. Larry Knechtel had also been living and working as a session musician in Nashville. Royer relocated to Nashville in 1994. Todd Cerney was already a grammy-nominated songwriter when Royer met him in 1994 at Jim Della Croce's house. Cerney had written two top-forty songs (Loverboy's \\"Notorious\\" and Restless Heart's \\"I'll Still Be Loving You,\\" which reached number one on the Country charts). Cerney had established a private recording studio in his home where he engineered a number of other singer-songwriters' albums. Griffin, Royer and Cerney first collaborated by co-writing the song \\"Kyrie\\" in 1994. Knechtel later joined the trio and together they performed and co-wrote songs (including the 1995 song \\"Slow Train\\") under the band name \\"Toast\\". Toast performed at various Nashville venues including the Bluebird, Third and Lindsley, and 12th & Porter. They wrote and performed their own songs including such titles as \\"Road Kill,\\" \\"Knechtelodeon,\\" \\"No More Smokin',\\" \\"Grenadine,\\" \\"Magdelena,\\" and \\"Radio Dixie.\\" The group used session drummers for their recordings and performances. The group would later be known as Radio Dixie in 1998. The name change was intended to help with promotion of the group, but the group disbanded by the end of 1998. Royer and Cerney continued to write together, generating additional titles including \\"Hurtin' Cowboy,\\" \\"New Orleans Prayer,\\" \\"I Believe I Kissed an Angel,\\" and \\"Beside Myself.\\" why did they disband?","response":"The article does not explicitly state the reason for the disbandment of the group Radio Dixie (formerly Toast) in 1998."},{"question":"Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Which astronaut was born earlier, Bertalan Farkas or Christer Fuglesang?

It identifies a specific person, and differentiates that person from other members of a group, such as a family or clan, with whom that person shares a common surname. The term \\"given name\\" refers to the fact that the name usually is \\"bestowed\\" upon a person, normally \\"given\\" to a child by its parents at or near the time of birth. This contrasts with a surname (also known as a family name, last name, or gentile name), which is normally inherited, and shared with other members of the child's immediate family. - Unicode is a computing industry standard for the consistent encoding, representation, and handling of text expressed in most of the world's writing systems. Developed in conjunction with the Universal Coded Character Set (UCS) standard and published as \\"The Unicode Standard\\", the latest version of Unicode contains a repertoire of more than 128,000 characters covering 135 modern and historic scripts, as well as multiple symbol sets. The standard consists of a set of code charts for visual reference, an encoding method and set of standard character encodings, a set of reference data files, and a number of related items, such as character properties, rules for normalization, decomposition, collation, rendering, and bidirectional display order (for the correct display of text containing both right-to-left scripts, such as Arabic and Hebrew, and left-to-right scripts). , the most recent version is \\"Unicode 9.0\\". The standard is maintained by the Unicode Consortium. - A synonym is a word or phrase that means exactly or nearly the same as another word or phrase in the same language. Words that are synonyms are said to be synonymous, and the state of being a synonym is called synonymy. The word comes from Ancient Greek \\"sýn\\" (\\"with\\") and \\"ónoma\\" (\\"name\\"). An example of synonyms are the words \\"begin\\", \\"start\\", \\"commence\\", \\"initiate\\", \\"fun\\", \\"pleasing\\" . Words can be synonymous when meant in certain senses, even if they are not synonymous in all of their senses. For example, if one talks about a \\"long time\\" or an \\"extended time\\", \\"long\\" and \\"extended\\" are synonymous within that context. Synonyms with exact meaning share a seme or denotational sememe, whereas those with inexactly similar meanings share a broader denotational or connotational sememe and thus overlap within a semantic field. Some academics call the former type cognitive synonyms to distinguish them from the latter type, which they call near-synonyms. - A surname or family name is a name added to a given name. In many cases, a surname is a family name and many dictionaries define \\"surname\\" as a synonym of \\"family name\\". In the Western Hemisphere, it is commonly synonymous with last name because it is usually placed at the end of a person's given name there. - In the German alphabet, the (traditionally lowercase-only) letter ß, called Eszett or scharfes S, in English \\"sharp S\\", is a consonant that evolved as a ligature of \\"long s and z\\" (z) and \\"long s over round s\\" (s). It is pronounced (see IPA). Since the German orthography reform of 1996, it is used only after long vowels and diphthongs while \\"ss\\" is written after short vowels. The name \\"Eszett\\" comes from the two letters S and Z as they are pronounced in German. Its Unicode encoding is U+00DF. - The long, medial, or descending s () is a form of the minuscule (lower-case) letter \\"s\\", which was formerly used where \\"s\\" occurred in the middle or at the beginning of a word (e.g. \\"infulnes\\" for \\"sinfulness\\" and \\"uccesful\\" for \\"successful\\"). The modern letterform was called the \\"terminal\\", \\"round\\", or \\"short\\" s. - The German orthography reform of 1996 (\\"\\") was a change to German spelling and punctuation that was intended to simplify German orthography and thus to make it easier to learn, without substantially changing the rules familiar to users of the language. - Strauss , Strauß or Straus is a common Germanic surname . Outside Germany and Austria Strauß is always spelled Strauss ( the letter \`\` ß '' is not used in the German - speaking part of Switzerland ) . The families using the Strauss name represent a genetically varied group of people of both Jewish and Germanic origin . The name has been used by families in the Germanic area for at least a thousand years . The overlord of Gröna for example , went by the name of Struz and used the image of an ostrich as his symbol . Examples of it could still be seen on the thousand - year - old church bell of that town . \`\` Struz '' or \`\` Strutz '' is the North - German form of the word \`\` Strauss '' , which is the modern German word for an \`\` Ostrich '' . Some of the earliest Jewish bearers of the name hailed from the Judengasse in medieval Frankfurt , where families have been known by the name of the houses they inhabited . All the houses had names and these included Haus Strauss , complete with an image of an ostrich on the façade . When , for tax purposes , Napoleon made surnames obligatory in 1808 , some more Jewish families decided to adopt the Straus ( s ) name . - An alphabet is a standard set of letters (basic written symbols or graphemes) that is used to write one or more languages based upon the general principle that the letters represent phonemes (basic significant sounds) of the spoken language. This is in contrast to other types of writing systems, such as syllabaries (in which each character represents a syllable) and logographies (in which each character represents a word, morpheme, or semantic unit). - The Western Hemisphere is a geographical term for the half of the earth that lies west of the Prime meridian (which crosses Greenwich, UK) and east of the antimeridian, the other half being called the Eastern Hemisphere. - A diphthong (or ; from Greek: , \\"diphthongos\\", literally \\"two sounds\\" or \\"two tones\\"), also known as a gliding vowel, is a combination of two adjacent vowel sounds within the same syllable. Technically, a diphthong is a vowel with two different targets: that is, the tongue (and/or other parts of the speech apparatus) moves during the pronunciation of the vowel. In many dialects of English, the phrase \\"no highway cowboys\\" has five distinct diphthongs, one in every syllable. - In articulatory phonetics, a consonant is a speech sound that is articulated with complete or partial closure of the vocal tract. Examples are , pronounced with the lips pronounced with the front of the tongue pronounced with the back of the tongue pronounced in the throat; and , pronounced by forcing air through a narrow channel (fricatives); and and , which have air flowing through the nose (nasals). Contrasting with consonants are vowels. - An orthography is a set of conventions for writing a language.

Through the dark, I could see three bolts left in the wall from where they'd taken down the crucifix. A confessional too beaten-up to have been sold was shaking in a way that suggested activity inside, and where the pews had been taken out, a couple hundred people were testifying to the DJ's moving sermon. Rachel stepped forward into the crowd while I took a moment to drink in the ceiling's blue-lit, shadowed vault and the light-catching haze from who-knows-what rising between the DJ and the crowd. There was a terrific echo, each beat reverberating inside of the next, and the old stained-glass windows rattled in their frames. On the dance floor, people moved with their eyes closed and their hands in the air. I danced with Rachel for a while, but then something by the bar seemed to be pulling her eyes. She told me that she was heading for a drink and slipped out of the crowd. When she hadn't come back halfway through the next song, I glanced over at the bar. It was just a little set-up where someone had stacked a few crates and brought something alcoholic to share, mostly beer. Rachel was standing with a plastic cup, looking like she was having a conversation, but I couldn't see anyone else there. The next time the crowd split, I saw him. He stood in front of a blue light, so I couldn't see him clearly, but what I saw was memorable.

Let your cleaner sit in the tank. Scrub your cleaner into the tank. Flush out the tank.","response":"Title: How to Effectively Clean Your Water Tank: A Step-by-Step Guide Introduction: A clean water tank is essential for maintaining the health and safety of the water stored within. Over time, water tanks can accumulate debris, algae, and other contaminants that can affect the quality of the water and pose a risk to your health. Regular cleaning and maintenance of your water tank will not only keep your water clean and safe, but also extend the life of the tank. In this article, we will walk you through the process of cleaning your water tank, providing a step-by-step guide that is easy to follow and implement. Step 1: Prepare Your Cleaning Supplies and Equipment Before you begin cleaning your water tank, gather all the necessary supplies and equipment. This may include: - A cleaning solution or disinfectant suitable for use in water tanks - Gloves to protect your hands while handling the cleaning solution and scrubbing the tank - A long-handled scrub brush or sponge to reach all the areas inside the tank - A hose or other source of clean water to flush out the tank - A bucket or other container to collect the dirty water while flushing out the tank Step 2: Empty the Water Tank Before you can clean your water tank, you will need to empty it. If your tank has water inside, make sure to shut off any connected water supplies and drain the tank completely. You may also want to place a tarp or other protective cover on the ground beneath the tank to catch any spills or debris. Step 3: Put on Gloves Before handling the cleaning solution or scrubbing the interior of the tank, put on a pair of gloves to protect your hands. This is especially important if you are using a strong cleaning solution or disinfectant, as these substances can be harsh on the skin. Be sure that your gloves are properly fitted and do not have any holes or tears. Step 4: Apply Cleaner to the Tank Once your gloves are on, prepare the cleaning solution according to the manufacturer's directions. Pour or spray the cleaner into the empty water tank so it can start working on any residue, algae, or other contaminants. Let the cleaner sit in the tank for the amount of time specified by the manufacturer. This will allow the cleaner to penetrate and break down the contaminants, making them easier to remove when scrubbing. Step 5: Scrub the Tank With the cleaning solution in the tank, use your long-handled brush or sponge to scrub the interior surfaces of the tank thoroughly. Be sure to reach all the corners, crevices, and other hard-to-reach areas to ensure that all contaminants are removed. You may need to reapply the cleaning solution as you scrub to maximize its effectiveness. As you scrub the tank, be gentle but firm to avoid damaging the tank's surfaces. Step 6: Flush the Tank Once you have scrubbed the entire interior of the tank, you will need to flush out the dirty water and any remaining cleaner. Attach a hose to a source of clean water and spray it into the tank, allowing the water to flow through and rinse away the cleaning solution and loosened debris. As the water fills the tank, use your bucket or other container to catch the water as it overflows, then dispose of it properly. Continue flushing the tank until the water runs clear and there are no more signs of cleaning solution or debris. Step 7: Inspect and Refill the Tank After flushing the tank, inspect the interior surfaces to ensure that all debris and residue have been removed. If any areas still appear dirty, repeat the scrubbing and flushing process as needed. Once the tank is clean, you can refill it with fresh water and reconnect any water supply lines. Conclusion: Regularly cleaning your water tank is essential for maintaining clean, safe water supply and prolonging the lifespan of your tank. With the proper supplies and a bit of elbow grease, you can effectively clean your water tank and keep it in optimal condition. By following our step-by-step guide, you can ensure that your water tank remains a safe and reliable source of water for years to come."},{"question":"Choose your answer from options.

Generate a detailed description of this data","response":"Adare Manor, located in Adare, County Limerick, Ireland, is an exquisite example of the neo-gothic architectural style. It is a stunning manor house and hotel set amid lush landscapes. This unique structure was designed by the renowned architect Lewis Nockalls Cottingham in the mid-19th century. Lewis Nockalls Cottingham (1787-1847) was a highly respected English architect, best known for his work in the Gothic Revival style. As one of the pioneers of historic architecture preservation, Cottingham was instrumental in restoring many medieval churches and buildings in England throughout his career. His skillful understanding of Gothic elements, as well as his passion for preserving architectural heritage, made him an ideal choice for designing Adare Manor. The manor was commissioned by the second Earl of Dunraven, Windham Henry Quin, who sought to create an exquisite Gothic Revival country house as a response to the burgeoning industrial development of that era. The Earl's ambition was to produce a stunning building that showcased the best of Gothic design while also reminding the world of Ireland's rich architectural heritage. Construction began on Adare Manor in the 1830s, and it took almost 30 years to complete, spanning the architectural careers of both Cottingham and his later successor, Philip Charles Hardwick. While the manor's master plan was conceived by Cottingham, he passed away before its completion, and Hardwick then took over, bringing his own touch to the project. Adare Manor incorporates several architectural styles, most prominently featuring Neo-Gothic, Tudor, and Elizabethan influences. The building's exterior demonstrates the harmonious use of local limestone, enhanced by pinnacles, turrets, and ornate sculpted ornamentation, predominantly featuring heraldic motifs. One of the most remarkable features of Adare Manor is the symmetrical design of the structure, which includes several repeating elements - an innovative concept for its time. Within the manor's interior, visitors can find spacious rooms with intricate woodcarvings, ornate plasterwork, and vast neo-gothic windows allowing an abundance of natural light to filter through. The neo-gothic, grey limestone structure sits on an 840-acre estate along the banks of the River Maigue. The estate boasts exquisite formal gardens, lush woodlands, and a championship golf course – providing a tranquil contrast to the imposing manor house. The manor combines ancient aesthetics with modern luxuries, having been meticulously restored and reopened in 2017 as a five-star hotel, offering guests a one-of-a-kind experience in terms of accommodation, dining, and leisure. The adaptation of this historic building into a contemporary hotel required immense effort and careful consideration to preserve and restore the architectural heritage it represents. Yet, Adare Manor is a prime example of how it remains possible to breathe new life into these magnificent buildings without sacrificing their historical appeal. In summary, Adare Manor is a beautiful and elaborate neo-gothic manor house designed by the esteemed architect Lewis Nockalls Cottingham. Its magnificent structure, with intricate details, symmetrical elements, and the seamless fusion of architectural styles, has made it a landmark in Irish heritage. As a luxurious hotel today, Adare Manor continues to preserve and showcase the extraordinary craftsmanship and dedication that defined the work of Cottingham and his successor, Hardwick."},{"question":"I know that the answer to the question \\"What's used?\\" is in \\"However, even if UTC is used internally, the systems still require information on time zones to correctly calculate local time where it is needed.

During a Mardi Gras celebration in New Orleans, a group of friends including Ben and his best friend Marcus decide to go on a haunted swamp tour. They find the tour closed because the guide, Rev. Zombie, was sued for negligence. Rev. Zombie suggests they try a place farther down the street, owned by the over-the-top, inexperienced tour guide Shawn. Marcus decides to leave but changes his mind upon seeing two topless girls: Misty, a ditzy porn star, and Jenna, a bossy, boastful, up-and-coming actress. Their sleazy director, Doug Shapiro, is also present. Ben pays for himself and Marcus and Shawn leads them to his tour bus, where the other tourists, Jim and Shannon Permatteo, a Minnesota married couple, and the quiet, hot-tempered Marybeth are waiting. Shawn does not know what he is doing, which the others realize as they arrive at the swamp. Shapiro has Misty and Jenna strip down and film a scene for Bayou Beavers as everyone boards the boat, while a homeless swamp-dweller named Jack Cracker warns them away from the swamp. Shawn leads them through swamplands and past abandoned houses, including one where Victor Crowley, a deformed creature, lived. The boat hits a rock and begins sinking, leaving them stranded. As the crew walks through the woods, they encounter the shabby Crowley house, and Marybeth shares the legend of Victor Crowley. Victor was a deformed child with a rare disease, bullied by other kids and was kept hidden by his father, Thomas Crowley. One night a group of mean teenagers stumbled across the house and threw fireworks at it to scare Victor. The house began burning, and Thomas returned, causing the teens to flee. Victor was killed when Thomas accidentally hit him in the face with a hatchet while trying to break down the door. Marybeth claims that Victor roams the swamp at night, looking for his...

Here's how to do it: 1. Start with -1344 and 2741. Adding them together will give us -1344 + 2741 = 1397. 2. Now, we have 1397 + 3183. Adding these numbers together will give us 1397 + 3183 = 4580. Now, we have the equation 4580 = 229*y. To find the value of \\"y,\\" we need to divide 4580 by 229. Here is the division: 4580 ÷ 229 = 20 So, the value of y is 20."},{"question":"Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which system is less stable? Ken is a scientist who studies atomic systems. He is currently responsible for studying two systems that they are referring to as Omega and Alpha. These two systems are essential to the research that is being done to potentially allow humans to travel to Mars in a reasonable amount of time. Little is known about these systems currently, but scientists have observed that Omega has been steadily gaining more potential energy. Alpha has been rapidly losing potential energy. Ken is hoping to discern why this is happening and try to utilize his findings to further space exploration. Hint: As the atoms first begin to interact, the attractive force is stronger than the repulsive force and so the potential energy of the system decreases, as seen in the diagram. Remember that the lower potential energy increases the stability of the system. As the two hydrogen atoms move closer and closer together, the potential energy continues to decrease. Eventually, a position is reached where the potential energy is at its lowest possible point. If the hydrogen atoms move any closer together, a third interaction begins to dominate and that is the repulsive force between the two positively-charged nuclei. This repulsive force is very strong as can be seen by the sharp rise in energy at the far left of the diagram.","response":"Based on the information provided, the system that is less stable is Omega. This is because Omega has been steadily gaining more potential energy, which results in lower stability. In contrast, Alpha has been rapidly losing potential energy, which increases the stability of the system. The paragraph emphasizes that lower potential energy corresponds to higher stability, as the attractive force dominating over the repulsive force causes the potential energy to decrease, reaching its lowest possible point for the most stability. Since Omega is gaining potential energy, it implies that the system is becoming less stable as opposed to Alpha, which is losing potential energy and thus becoming more stable."},{"question":"Data: Chinabank, numberOfLocations, 295; Chinabank, foundationPlace, Manila; Chinabank, type, Public company; Chinabank, location, Philippines Sentence about the following data:","response":"Chinabank, a public company originating in Manila, has significantly expanded since its inception and now operates across 295 locations throughout the Philippines, continually providing quality banking services to its customers."},{"question":"What is an example of a tweet?","response":"Step 1: Identify the purpose of the tweet In order to create an example of a tweet, I first need to determine the purpose of the tweet.

The anonymous buyer, believed to be an individual collector who lives in the United States, made the winning bid in a fiercely contested nine-minute auction at Sotheby's in Manhattan. Eight bidders were joined by 500 coin collectors and dealers in an auction house audience seemingly devoid of celebrity bidders, while an additional 534 observers followed the bidding on eBay. As auction houses prepare for their fall seasons in an uncertain economy, the sale price \\"suggests that the marketplace for important items is enormously strong,\\" said David Redden, a vice chairman at Sotheby's, who was the auctioneer. \\"This is an astonishing new record for a coin,\\" he said. In an unprecedented move, the auction proceeds were split by the U.S. Mint and a London coin dealer, Stephen Fenton, who had won that right in court after having been arrested by Secret Service agents for trying to sell the coin in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan in 1996. Henrietta Holsman Fore, the director of the U.S. Mint, who witnessed the sale, said, \\"The monies we receive will go toward helping to pay down the debt and to fight the war on terrorism.\\" Fenton commented that the double eagle had been on \\"a long historic journey, with a very satisfying ending.\\" He added, \\"I am thrilled with the price.\\" The previous numismatic record holder was an 1804 U.S. silver dollar, which sold for 4.14 million in 1999. Sotheby's partner in the one-lot auction was Stack's Rare Coins, with which it shared the customary 15 percent commission. \\"I have never seen as much interest in the sale of any coin in my 30 years in the business,\\" said Lawrence R. Stack, the company's managing director. \\"This is the Mona Lisa of coins,\\" said Beth Deisher, editor of Coin World, the largest weekly coin publication in the United States, with a circulation of 85,000. \\"It is unique. Forbidden fruit.\\" Collectors' Web sites have surged with speculation about the sale price, and enthusiasts even organized betting pools. Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"7.58 Million\\" correctly answer the question \\"What was the price it was finally sold?\\"?","response":"No, the correct answer is \\"7.59 million.\\" The 1933 double eagle gold coin was sold for that price at the auction."},{"question":"Hoping to increase their winning streak the Saints played inside their dome for an NFC South rivalry match against the Falcons.

Therefore, the hypothesis is not a valid conclusion based on the given information. In this detailed answer, we will explore the relationship between the premise, the hypothesis, and what can be inferred from the given information. The premise suggests the following points: 1. Nitrates are a contributing factor to visibility problems. 2. There are differences in the specific role nitrates play in visibility issues between the West and the East. 3. In some areas of the West, nitrates have a more significant impact on visibility problems compared to the East. Now, let's consider the hypothesis \\"The West does not have visibility problems due to nitrates.\\" This statement implies that nitrates play no part in visibility issues in the West. However, the premise does acknowledge that nitrates contribute to visibility problems, at least in some areas of the West. Therefore, the hypothesis contradicts the established premise. To better understand the implications of the premise, we can discuss a few potential reasons for the differences between the West and the East regarding nitrates' effect on visibility problems. 1. Geographic and climatic factors: The West and the East have different geographical and climatic characteristics, which can influence the dispersal and concentration of air pollutants like nitrates. For instance, the West may have a more arid climate, leading to a greater accumulation of nitrates on the ground and in the atmosphere. This, in turn, could exacerbate visibility problems. 2. Human activities and pollution sources: Differences in industrial, agricultural, and other human activities between the West and the East can lead to variations in the sources and levels of nitrates released into the atmosphere. If the West has higher nitrate emissions resulting from its specific economic and infrastructural profile, it could experience more severe visibility problems linked to nitrates. 3. Regulatory and policy differences: There could be differences in environmental regulations and policies between the West and the East, which may influence nitrate emissions and consequently the severity of visibility issues linked to nitrates. If the West has less stringent controls on nitrate-emitting activities or sources, this could lead to higher nitrate concentrations and more visibility problems. To summarize, the premise that \\"Nitrates can play a larger role in visibility problems in some portions of the West than in the East\\" does not entail or support the hypothesis that \\"The West does not have visibility problems due to nitrates.\\" Contrarily, the premise suggests that nitrates contribute to visibility issues in certain areas of the West, and their role might be even more significant than in the East. This distinction may be attributed to geographic, climatic, human activity, or policy differences between the West and the East. However, the premise does not negate the existence of visibility problems related to nitrates in the West; it merely emphasizes variations in the severity of the issue between the two regions."},{"question":"Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: To nail a board to another, you can","response":"Alright, little buddy, imagine you want to attach two pieces of wood together, like sticking two LEGO blocks. To do that, we can use something called a nail, which is like a tiny and pointy stick made out of metal. There are two popular ways to put the nail into the wood: 1. Hammer and nail: We use a tool called a hammer to hit the nail and push it into the wood. It's like using a small car to push a tiny stick into playdough. 2. Nail gun: It's a special machine that shoots the nail into the wood very fast, like a superhero with a nail-shooting power. Both ways can help us stick the wood together, but a nail gun may be faster and easier for some people. But remember, it can also be more dangerous. So, for a five-year-old like you, it's better to let grown-ups do the job using either a hammer and nail or a nail gun."},{"question":"Translate \\"*Mito de creación hebreo y cristiano:\\" from Spanish to English.","response":"The phrase \\"Mito de creación hebreo y cristiano\\" in Spanish translates to \\"Hebrew and Christian creation myth\\" in English. To provide a detailed and long response, let's expand on the Hebrew and Christian creation myths: The Hebrew and Christian creation myths share similarities as they are both rooted in the same religious text, the Old Testament (also known as the Hebrew Bible). The creation story that is most well-known and accepted by both Jews and Christians can be found in the Book of Genesis, the first book of the Bible. The account outlines a sequence of events where God, or Yahweh in Hebrew tradition, creates the world and everything in it within six days, followed by a day of rest on the seventh day. Day 1: God creates light, separating it from the darkness, and names them Day and Night. Day 2: God creates the sky, or firmament, to separate the waters above from the waters below. Day 3: God gathers the waters below the sky to form the seas and causes the dry land to appear, creating Earth. God then brings forth plant life on the land, including trees, grass, and other vegetation. Day 4: God creates the celestial bodies – the sun, moon, and stars – to serve as markers for days, seasons, and years, and to give light to the Earth. Day 5: God creates the creatures of the sea and the birds of the sky. Day 6: God creates land animals, including livestock, wild beasts, and creeping creatures. Afterward, God creates humans in his own image, both male and female, and gives them dominion over the animals and Earth. Day 7: God rests after completing his creation, declares the seventh day holy, and blesses it. This account is central to both Hebrew and Christian beliefs, although the interpretation of the creation myth may vary between different Jewish and Christian denominations and sects. While some adherents may view the creation story as a literal, historical account of the origins of the universe, others interpret it as a symbolic or allegorical narrative that holds deeper spiritual truths about God and his relationship with humanity. In conclusion, the phrase \\"Mito de creación hebreo y cristiano\\" refers to the shared creation myth in Hebrew and Christian traditions, which is rooted in the Book of Genesis. This story outlines the process by which God creates the universe and all its inhabitants in a six-day period, with a day of rest following the completion of his creation. This account serves as the basis for understanding the creation, nature, and purpose of the world in both religious traditions."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: You are given a set of queries separated by ' ', and your job is to find out the query which is not a well-formed or well-structured query in terms of grammar, punctuations, or spelling errors.

I am writing to discuss an important matter concerning the recent performance analysis and assessment of our East and West Bankruptcy Portfolios. Having reviewed the latest financial data and industry trends, our team has noticed a few areas of concern deserving immediate attention. In the following paragraphs, I will summarize our findings, outline our recommendations, and provide an action plan for moving forward. **Findings** 1. Portfolio Performance: Both the East and West portfolios have witnessed a decline in performance over recent quarters. Our initial analysis attributes this downward trend to various internal and external factors, including macro-economic conditions, underperforming investments in several key sectors, and portfolio diversification challenges. 2. Industry Trends: Bankruptcies in the retail and energy sectors have seen a significant uptick over the last year. Losses from these bankruptcies have adversely impacted the overall performance of both portfolios, due to their significant exposure in both regions. 3. Communication and Collaboration: We have observed a lack of cross-regional communication and collaboration between the East and West teams. This has resulted in missed opportunities to identify and address portfolio risks, inefficiencies in resource allocation, and slow responses to shifting market conditions. **Recommendations** 1. Portfolio Diversification: In order to mitigate risks associated with sector-specific bankruptcies, we recommend rebalancing the portfolios by re-allocating resources to less-exposed industries with stronger growth prospects. This will require thorough due diligence and close monitoring of emerging market trends. 2. Enhanced Collaboration: To improve the flow of information and maximize resource efficiency, it is essential to establish a more robust communication framework between the East and West teams. Regular video conferences, synchronized strategic planning sessions, and shared project management tools can streamline coordination efforts and drive more informed decision-making. 3. Risk Assessment and Monitoring: An effective risk management process needs to be implemented, ensuring that potential threats to our portfolios are identified, assessed, and mitigated in a timely manner. The introduction of real-time monitoring tools and a stronger focus on data-driven decision-making will contribute to a more proactive risk management approach. **Action Plan** 1. Conduct an in-depth analysis of both portfolios to identify high-risk exposure areas and underperforming sectors, commencing on [Date]. 2. Develop a comprehensive rebalancing strategy based on the findings from the above analysis, taking care to align with market trends and ensure regulatory compliance. Target completion date: [Date]. 3. Initiate open lines of communication between the East and West teams, establishing a weekly video conference call and providing access to shared documents and project management resources. Start date: [Date]. 4. Introduce risk assessment and monitoring tools, providing training and support as necessary for East and West Bankruptcy Portfolio management teams. Implementation date: [Date]. I believe the above plan provides a solid foundation for addressing the current challenges faced by our bankruptcy portfolios on both regions. I recommend that a follow-up meeting be scheduled within the next two weeks to discuss progress, address any concerns, and ensure the alignment of all involved stakeholders. Please let me know if you require additional information or wish to discuss any of the aforementioned points in greater detail.

Answer the question and classify your answers into yes or no. Q: Is NOBODY wrong in the post ? POST : Clarification My boyfriend is out of the country. We message each other daily. Yesterday night, he got home and messaged that he missed me. I messaged him back, but didn't reply for 30 min. because he was listening to some singers (he was also with his friend). For some reason, this irritated me. He uses his phone a lot and I'm assuming he just saw the notification and just swiped up to reply to me later. Background: Early in our relationship, he said that it bothers him when he is texting someone and they reply even a minute late. (A little unreasonable, because but whatever, that's his thing) So I try to reply to him as soon as I see the conversation. Like I'll message good morning as soon as I wake up. I noticed he has this habit of not messaging me right away even though he has this stipulation, so I talked to him about it and he said he will do it. And he has been. I understand he is out of the country and I try to be understanding. Usually there was something going on and I get it, he can't be on his phone 100% while he is with family/friends/etc. But yesterday, that small 30 min. seemed deliberate. Anyways, I tried not to let it bother me. But it was obvious it was during our video chat that night so I ended it early and said I just wanted to sleep. AITA? Tbh I just want confirmation that I am so that I can attribute this to anxiety and be done with it.

It is important to recognize that both individuals in this anecdote have their own reasons for their actions and feelings. The author is upset because her boyfriend did not respond promptly, despite having previously expressed his preference for immediate responses to messages. However, it's important to note that the boyfriend is currently out of the country, and as such, there may be various distractions and commitments that could have led to his delayed response. Meanwhile, the boyfriend is not necessarily in the wrong either. He is away and likely engaged with friends and family. It's normal for people to be briefly unresponsive while spending time with others, even if they prefer quick replies themselves in other circumstances. In conclusion, while it is understandable that the author may feel irritated by the boyfriend's late response, it is important to remember that nobody is perfect, and there may be external reasons for his delayed reply. Additionally, it's crucial for both individuals to understand each other's point of view and communicate openly about their feelings and expectations to maintain a healthy relationship.

A man from Côte d'Azur in the south of France claims a problem in the app meant that his wife received notifications on her phone whenever he took an Uber ride, and that she was able to see his pick up points, destinations and times. And he says it all began when he borrowed his wife's phone and logged in to Uber. Despite logging out of the app, notifications of his journeys continued to roll in to her phone, revealing what she suspected was evidence of his extra-marital encounters and leading to the couple's divorce. The man is now suing Uber for €45 million, reported Le Figaro newspaper. The technical fault is thought to be that after you log in to Uber on another device, it can keep information on you as a user and continues to give updates on that phone. So whoever was kind enough to lend you their phone could be privy to your future rides. Philanderous Android users should be safe however, as the problem seems to be limited to the iPhone iOS versions of the app updated after the 16th of December 2016. Uber’s spokesperson declined to speak to Le Figaro on the matter, saying “Uber doesn’t publicly comment on individual cases, and especially those which concern things such as a divorce procedure”. An initial hearing for the case is expected next month. And with its high-profile status, we could see more similar complaints coming from Uber’s 40 million monthly active users soon. This isn’t the first run-in Uber has had with the French either. In December Paris Uber driver’s blockaded French airports in protest over pay and in 2015 a French version of the app Le Taxi launched to rival Uber's dominance. Will this case be another blow for Uber's popularity in France? READ ALSO: Protesting Uber drivers blockade access to Paris airports By Rose Trigg ||||| A French businessman is suing Uber for 45 million after a bug in the ride-hailing app led to his divorce. A glitch in the Uber app allegedly allowed the man’s wife to keep tabs on his location, and determine he’d been cheating on her, according to the French newspaper Le Figaro. The man had previously used his wife’s iPhone to hail an Uber, but the device continued receiving notifications even after he logged out. Those notifications led his ex to believe he had been cheating on her. And the man now wants Uber to pay for it. He is suing for a hefty 45 million in damages, claiming the app (not the whole cheating thing) led to his divorce. Le Figaro was able to replicate the incident on iPhones (Android users, you’re probably safe), and says it is possible to obtain the information on an Uber passenger’s location without needing a password. Uber, understandably, doesn’t want anything to do with all this. The company told the newspaper, “Uber doesn’t publicly comment on individual cases, and especially those which concern things such as a divorce procedure.” Ouch. The case will have an initial hearing in late February. H/T the Next Web ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: muscle cells of the uterus become more sensitive to its effects. Oxytocin is continually released throughout childbirth through a positive feedback mechanism. As noted earlier, oxytocin prompts uterine contractions that push the fetal head toward the cervix. In response, cervical stretching stimulates additional oxytocin to be synthesized by the hypothalamus and released from the pituitary. This increases the intensity and effectiveness of uterine contractions and prompts additional dilation of the cervix. The feedback loop continues until birth. Although the mother’s high blood levels of oxytocin begin to decrease immediately following birth, oxytocin continues to play a role in maternal and newborn health. First, oxytocin is necessary for the milk ejection reflex (commonly referred to as “let-down”) in breastfeeding women. As the newborn begins suckling, sensory receptors in the nipples transmit signals to the hypothalamus. In response, oxytocin is secreted and released into the bloodstream. Within seconds, cells in the mother’s milk ducts contract, ejecting milk into the infant’s mouth. Secondly, in both males and females, oxytocin is thought to contribute to parent–newborn bonding, known as attachment. Oxytocin is also thought to be involved in feelings of love and closeness, as well as in the sexual response. Choices: - hemoglobin - insulin - vasopressin - oxytocin A: Answer:","response":"oxytocin"},{"question":"Article:Andrew Iacovou, 55, was repeatedly hit with a hammer at a branch of Ladbrokes in Aberconway Road, Morden, on 25 May. Shafique Ahmad Aarij, 21, of no fixed address, was jailed for a minimum of 26 years. He denied murder claiming diminished responsibility. The victim was knocked down after the first blow but Aarij went on to hit him another eight times, police said. The Met Police said Mr Iacovou, who had worked for Ladbrokes for 25 years, was alone in the shop in the morning when he was hit on the head with the hammer. After the attack Aarij stole more than £296 from the shop and wired most of that amount to Pakistan within 90 minutes of the fatal attack, police said. Southwark Crown Court was shown CCTV footage from the shop that captured the killer looking for money as the victim lay on the floor. Det Sgt Eric Sword said: \\"This was an incredibly violent and unprovoked attack on a hard-working father-of-two. \\"The level of violence was completely disproportionate to what the suspect sought to achieve which was robbing the shop. \\"An initial hammer blow knocked the victim to the floor but Aarij continued to swing the weapon another eight times.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: Water is the most common substance on Earth, and most of it exists in the liquid state. A liquid is one of four well-known states of matter, along with solid, gas, and plasma states. The particles of liquids are in close contact with each other but not as tightly packed as the particles in solids. The particles can slip past one another and take the shape of their container. However, they cannot pull apart and spread out to take the volume of their container, as particles of a gas can.

Their employer gave them a raise. Given the question \\"How would you describe Tracy?\\", is \\"an average employee\\" a valid answer? Possible answers: (a). Yes. (b). No. Answer:","response":"(b). No. A detailed explanation for this answer is as follows: Describing Tracy as an \\"average employee\\" based solely on the information provided in the given scenario is not a valid answer. The information presented reveals that Tracy was able to perform her job function successfully, which eventually led to a raise from their employer. This indicates that Tracy was not just an average performer, but rather someone who effectively completed tasks and had a positive impact on their employer's evaluation of their work. When assessing an employee, various factors and criteria are considered to determine their overall performance and value within an organization. Some factors to consider include work ethic, teamwork, adaptability, communication skills, problem-solving abilities, and leadership potential. Simply labeling an employee as \\"average\\" without considering these additional factors can be misleading and insufficient in painting a comprehensive picture of their capabilities and contributions. It is essential to acknowledge that the term \\"average\\" carries a different connotation across industries and workspaces. Generally, an average employee is someone who meets minimum expectations set by their employer or someone whose performance is neither outstanding nor below standard. However, with the limited information provided, it is challenging to determine Tracy's performance relative to her colleagues or how she compares with the typical employee in her company or industry. Therefore, based on the available information, it is not recommended to describe Tracy as an \\"average employee.\\" Doing so could be a disservice to her and doesn't reflect the fact that her efforts led to a raise. Instead, it would be more accurate to describe Tracy as an employee who performed her job functions effectively, maintained a strong work ethic, demonstrated potential, and ultimately earned a well-deserved raise from her employer."},{"question":"Write highlights for this article: British troops dressed in red jackets and black bearskin hats put on a military spectacle in London on Saturday to mark Queen Elizabeth's official birthday. They marched to music as other troops sat on horses for the annual ceremony, known as Trooping the Color. It took place on the Horse Guards Parade, the marching ground within sight of the queen's residence at Buckingham Palace. Queen Elizabeth, wearing a lilac outfit and hat decorated with bow of pink and green, sat front and center to watch what many consider the most celebrated event on the British royal calendar. The queen, who turned 84 this year, was born on April 21 but celebrates her birthday on a Saturday in June when the weather is better. Trooping the Color dates at least to the early 18th century, when the colors -- or flags -- of the battalion were \\"trooped\\" down the ranks so they could be seen and recognized by all the soldiers, according to Buckingham Palace and the British Army. Since 1748, the ceremony has also marked the sovereign's official birthday, the palace said. Queen Elizabeth has attended it every year except for 1955, when a national rail strike canceled the event, the palace said. A limited number of tickets are available to the public to watch the event at the Horse Guards Parade. It is also shown live on TV, and others can watch the troops go by on The Mall, which leads from the palace to the parade. The ceremony is carried out by fully operational troops from the Household Division of the British Army. Only one color can be trooped at a time, and the five Household Regiments -- Grenadier, Coldstream, Scots, Irish, and Welsh Guards -- take their turn each year. This year it was the turn of the 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards, who recently returned from Afghanistan. At the end of the ceremony, the queen climbed into an open-top horse-drawn carriage for the ride back to Buckingham Palace. The crowds along The Mall, lined with Union Jacks, cheered as she went past. The queen then stood on the palace balcony to watch a military fly-past that ended with aircraft trailing red, white, and blue, the colors of the British flag. She waved to the crowds and was joined by other members of the royal family, including her husband, Prince Philip; her son, Prince Charles; and her grandson, Prince William. CNN's Melissa Gray contributed to this report.","response":"The article reports on the military celebration that took place in London on a Saturday to mark Queen Elizabeth's official birthday, also known as the Trooping of the Color ceremony. The Queen, adorned in a lilac outfit and a hat decorated with a bow of pink and green, sat at the center of the event, an annual spectacle that is considered a highlight of the British royal calendar. According to Buckingham Palace and the British Army, this ceremonial tradition dates back to the early 18th century, and the process involves stepping down the ranks to present the battalion colours or flags for everyone to recognise. The tradition has doubled as a celebration of the sovereign's official birthday since 1748, and Queen Elizabeth has regularly attended the ceremony since her ascension to the throne. The only exception to her participation was in 1955 when a national rail strike led to its cancellation. Trooping the Color takes place on Horse Guards Parade, a site known as the marching ground, located within viewing distance of Buckingham Palace where the Queen resides. Only a limited number of tickets are made available to the public, but the ceremony is shown live on television. Additionally, spectators have an opportunity to watch as the troops march by on The Mall, a street stretching from the palace to the parade site. The celebrated event is carried out by fully operational troops from the Household Division of the British Army. Each year, a different regiment – from the Grenadier, Coldstream, Scots, Irish, and Welsh Guards – takes its turn for the flaging process. This year, the honour of trooping the colour fell to the 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards, recently returned from Afghanistan.

His father is a Canadian-born arranger, composer and conductor who worked on hundreds of albums and numerous films. Beck's mother grew up amid New York's Andy Warhol Factory art scene of the 1960s, where she was a Warhol superstar, but moved to California at age 17, where she met Campbell; she is a visual artist. Bibbe's maternal grandmother was Jewish, while Bibbe's father, artist Al Hansen, was partly of Norwegian descent. Guero, Beck's eighth studio album, was recorded over the span of nine months during which several significant events occurred in his life: his girlfriend, Marissa Ribisi, became pregnant; they were married; their son, Cosimo, was born; and they moved out of Silver Lake. The collaboration with the Dust Brothers, his second, was notable for their use of high-tech measures to achieve a lo-fi sound. For example, after recording a \\"sonically perfect\\" version of a song at one of the nicest recording studios in Hollywood, the Dust Brothers processed it in an Echoplex to create a gritty, reverb-heavy sound: \\"We did this high-tech recording and ran it through a transistor radio. It sounded too good, that was the problem.\\" Initially due to be released in October 2004, Guero faced delays and did not come out till March 2005, though unmastered copies of the tracks surfaced online in January. Guero debuted at number two on the Billboard 200, selling 162,000 copies, an all-time sales high. Lead single \\"E-Pro\\" peaked at number one at Modern Rock radio, making it his first chart-topper since \\"Loser\\". Beck, inspired by the Nintendocore remix scene and feeling a connection with its lo-fi, home-recording method, collaborated with artists 8-Bit and Paza on Hell Yes, an EP issued in February 2005. In December 2005, Geffen also issued Guerolito, a fully reworked version of Guero featuring remixes by the Beastie Boys' Ad-Rock, the Dust Brothers' John King and Scottish electronic duo Boards of Canada. Guerolito combines remixes previously heard as B-sides and new versions of album tracks to make a track-by-track reconfiguration of the album. Also released in 2005 was A Brief Overview, a 12-track promotional-only \\"History of Beck\\" compilation CD sampler that featured a combination of older and newer Beck tracks. The Information, Beck's ninth studio album, began production around the same time as Guero, in 2003. Working with producer Nigel Godrich, Beck built a studio in his garden, where they wrote many of the tracks. \\"The idea was to get people in a room together recording live, hitting bad notes and screaming,\\" said Beck, adding that the album is best described as \\"introspective hip hop\\". Beck described the recording process as \\"painful\\", noting that he edited down songs constantly and he perhaps recorded the album three times. For the release, Beck was allowed for the first time to fulfill a long-running wish for an unconventional rollout: he made low-budget videos to accompany each song, packaged the CD with sheets of stickers so buyers could customize the cover, and leaked tracks and videos on his website months ahead of the album's release. Digital download releases automatically downloaded the song's additional video for each single sale, and physical copies came bundled with an additional DVD featuring fifteen videos. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","response":"Yes, there are several interesting aspects about this article.

The answer is:","response":"The Boys from Doraville is an album by the American Southern rock band Atlanta Rhythm Section (ARS), which was released in 1980. The formation of this band dates back to the year 1970, so to answer your question, the band was formed in 1970. Atlanta Rhythm Section was formed in Doraville, Georgia, hence the reference to Doraville in the album title. The band's initial lineup consisted of Rodney Justo (vocals), Barry Bailey (guitar), Paul Goddard (bass), Dean Daughtry (keyboards), and Robert Nix (drums). Later, in 1972, Ronnie Hammond joined as the lead vocalist, which defined the band's sound for the years to come. ARS achieved moderate success in the 1970s with several albums and hit singles. Their major breakthrough came in 1977 with the release of the album A Rock and Roll Alternative, which included the hit single \\"So Into You.\\" Their biggest hit, \\"Imaginary Lover,\\" came from their follow-up album, Champagne Jam, released in 1978. The Boys from Doraville, despite having a strong fanbase, wasn't as successful as the band's previous efforts in terms of chart performance. However, it is still remembered for its blend of Southern rock and pop influences, which reflected the band's unique sound. In conclusion, The Boys from Doraville is an album by the Atlanta Rhythm Section, a band formed in 1970. This Southern rock band is known for their unique sound and various chart-topping hits in the 1970s, with The Boys from Doraville being one of their memorable albums, although not as successful as their previous ones."},{"question":"Information: - Doong Spank is the title of the fourth studio album by Bahamas - based musical group Baha Men .

Answer the above question based on the context below: The NSWCA appealed to Lord Harris, and in reply he said he did not blame them or the cricketers of Sydney in any way, but said that \\"it [the riot] was an occurrence it was impossible he could forget\\". On 11 February, one day after the conclusion of the match and three days after the riot, Harris wrote a letter to one of his friends about the disturbance. It was clear that he intended the letter to be printed in the press, and it appeared in full in The Daily Telegraph on 1 April, among other London newspapers, reigniting the furore. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack considered the incident of such significance that it reprinted the whole correspondence. The letter gives a detailed contemporary account of what Lord Harris thought about the riot.Lord Harris referred to the crowd as a \\"howling mob\\" and said \\"I have seen no reason as yet to change my opinion of Coulthard's qualities, or to regret his engagement, in which opinion I am joined by the whole team\\". He further added that \\"Beyond slyly kicking me once or twice the mob behaved very well, their one cry being, 'Change your umpire'. And now for the cause of this disturbance, not unexpected, I may say, by us, for we have heard accounts of former matches played by English teams.\\" Harris further accused a New South Wales parliamentarian of assisting the gamblers in the inciting the unrest, although he did not name the accusee. He said I blame the NSW Eleven for not objecting to Coulthard before the match began, if they had reason to suppose him incompetent to fulfil his duties. I blame the members of the association (many, of course, must be excepted) for their discourtesy and uncricket like behaviour to their guests; and I blame the committee and others of the association for ever permitting betting, but this last does not, of course, apply to our match only.

Bannerman had been run out instead of Murdoch, but the latter, besides being a great... Answer:","response":"Lord Harris accused the members of the New South Wales Cricket Association, including the New South Wales Eleven and a New South Wales parliamentarian, of being bad losers. He believed their actions displayed discourtesy and uncricket-like behavior towards their guests, and criticized the committee and other association members for permitting betting. However, he acknowledged that some members should be excepted from this accusation and appreciated their efforts in trying to quell the disturbance. In his letter, Harris mentioned his disappointment with the NSW Eleven for not objecting to Coulthard as an umpire prior to the match if they believed him to be incompetent. He also accused a NSW parliamentarian of assisting gamblers in inciting the unrest that led to the riot. He described the crowd as a \\"howling mob\\" but commended them for not behaving violently further than kicking him a few times. However, he suggested the disturbance might not have occurred if a different player had been run out instead of Murdoch. The publication of his letter in The Daily Telegraph and other London newspapers, along with its inclusion in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, further fueled the controversy surrounding the riot and showed the significance of the incident in the cricketing world at the time."},{"question":"Keep up the good work, Does it follow that \\"The person ended up messing everything up.\\"?

Option 1 (yes) is incorrect because there is not enough information to conclude that the person messed everything up. Option 3 (no) is also incorrect because, again, we simply do not have enough information to determine the outcome of their work.

The names of the rivers - Ebro, Jucar, Guadalquivir, Tagus, Douro, and Minho - exhibit a combination of Spanish and Portuguese language patterns. 2. Considering that Spanish and Portuguese are primarily spoken in Spain and Portugal, I will focus on these two countries. 3. I am now going to examine a map and verify if these rivers are located in either Spain or Portugal. 4. Upon closer examination, I found that: a. Ebro, Jucar, and Guadalquivir rivers are primarily located in Spain. b. Tagus river flows through Spain and Portugal. c. Douro river also flows through Spain and Portugal. d. Minho river defines a portion of the border between Spain and Portugal. 5. Since the majority of these rivers are located in Spain, and the others are shared with Portugal, I can conclude that the chief rivers listed are primarily associated with Spain. So, the chief rivers Ebro, Jucar, Guadalquivir, Tagus, Douro, and Minho belong to the country of Spain."},{"question":"Instructions: In this task, you are given Twitter posts.

Jones II is going to jail for trying to spy on his wife's text messages, the Raleigh News and Observer writes. When he suspected his wife was having an affair, instead of snooping through her phone himself, Jones thought it would be a good idea to ask a friend in the sheriff's office if copies of text messages between his wife and another man could be obtained through police channels—which is illegal without a warrant and suspicion of criminal activity. In exchange for the warrantless surveillance, Jones offered his \\"friend\\" two cases of Bud Light. Perhaps offended by the low-quality beer on offer, the deputy reported the judge for corruption. The jury deliberated for only 33 minutes before finding Jones guilty, Fox News reports. Jones was convicted on three felony charges. He will face sentencing on Jan. 23. His defense plans to appeal the verdict. Jones' defense team argues that he was never informed his request was illegal, but his long career as a judge—including time as the chairman of the North Carolina Innocence Inquiry Commission—would seem to make it unlikely their appeal will be successful.

It means getting new school bags and books, and seeing friends again after the summer holiday. My oldest son, 9-year-old Salem, asked me several times where we would go to buy a backpack, while my other son, 6-year-old Abdullah, asked what school would be like this year. For the last three years, school was a nightmare for many children and their parents as violence increased and there were more attacks on schools and teachers. As a result, many parents prevented their children from going to school. One of six children in this country did not attend primary school in 2009. Many kids who did attend school were accompanied by a parent for the entire day to make sure nothing happened to their children. For poor families or those with large families, back to school can be an expensive time. The government gives some help to those living in poor neighborhoods, and school bags, note books and other items are given for free. Most of the merchants who sell notebooks and pens now sell their products out on the street instead of in stores. They sit on the ground and lay their items on the ground or they have a small table to sell their goods. The bags cost between 10 and 20, while clothes and shoes cost between 20 and 30. I found all the things I needed for my sons and even bought something for myself. I spent about 50 on each of them, including school uniforms. At the end of the day, we returned to our home carrying many shopping bags filled with items that made my children happy and excited to go back to school. I just hope this school year will be a peaceful one.

Brent Walker, Executive Director of the Baptist Joint Committee, responded to Hamburger's claims noting; \\"The fact that the separation of church and state has been supported by some who exhibited an anti-Catholic animus or a secularist bent does not impugn the validity of the principle. Champions of religious liberty have argued for the separation of church and state for reasons having nothing to do with anti-Catholicism or desire for a secular culture. Of course, separationists have opposed the Catholic Church when it has sought to tap into the public till to support its parochial schools or to argue for on-campus released time in the public schools. But that principled debate on the issues does not support a charge of religious bigotry\\"\\" Answer:","response":"Throughout history, various individuals and groups have supported the principle of separation of church and state for varying reasons. While some may have been motivated by anti-religious sentiment or personal biases, many others have championed this principle based on strong convictions about the importance of religious liberty, pluralism, and the prevention of government interference in religious affairs. The following is a list of some people who were in favor of the separation of church and state: 1. Thomas Jefferson: One of the founding fathers and the U.S. president who is often credited with coining the phrase \\"wall of separation between church and state\\" in a letter he wrote in 1802 in the context of the First Amendment. Jefferson believed that government should not interfere in religious matters and that religious organizations should not be favored or supported by public funds. 2. James Madison: Another founding father and U.S. president who was a strong advocate for the separation of church and state, Madison played a significant role in drafting the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. His views were shaped by his own experience with religious persecution and his desire to ensure political and religious harmony in a diverse and pluralistic society. 3. Roger Williams: A 17th-century theologian and founder of Rhode Island, Williams was an early advocate for the separation of church and state in America, and his ideas had a significant influence on the development of religious freedom in the colonies. Williams experienced religious persecution as a Puritan and was expelled from Massachusetts for his religious views, which led him to establish a colony with religious freedom as its foundation. 4. John Locke: The influential philosopher, John Locke, advocated for religious tolerance and believed that government should not have the power to dictate matters of conscience or impose a particular religious belief on its citizens. His ideas on toleration and the distinction between the public sphere and private conscience laid the groundwork for Enlightenment thinkers and contributed to the development of the modern concept of the separation of church and state. 5. Baptists: As the quote from J. Brent Walker suggests, many Baptists have historically supported the separation of church and state due to their beliefs in religious liberty and the autonomy of local congregations. They argued that a separation would protect religious minorities and allow for diverse religious practices and beliefs to coexist without coercion or interference from the government. In conclusion, various individuals and groups supported the separation of church and state for a multitude of reasons. Some were motivated by a belief in religious liberty, pluralism, and the need to protect minority faiths from government interference. Others advanced this principle to promote political stability, social cohesion, and philosophical ideals. Whatever their motivations, these individuals contributed to the development and propagation of the principle of separation of church and state, which has become a cornerstone of democratic governance and religious freedom across the world."},{"question":"Explain simply why need money is the correct answer to: She was a human in America who wanted to live well, what was a given for her situation?

Simply avoid the person who's aggravating you. Hang out together as little as possible. The less time you spend with this person, the fewer chances s/he will have to get on your nerves. The best part of this policy is that it's also a subtle way of punishing someone for acting fake. When they act this way, they don't get the privilege of hanging out with you. Making decisions about who you hang out with one-on-one is easy. However, sometimes social situations can force you to hang out with fake people anyway (for example, if the fake person shows up to a group event). In this case, you still want to avoid being rude, so don't outright ignore the fake person. Instead, just try to act polite without being overly friendly. This way, you have less of a chance of starting a conversation with the fake person. A good rule of thumb is simply to avoid talking to this person until s/he talks to you first or until you have to for some other reason. Act polite but a little distant towards this person — a little like how you'd talk to someone you've never met before. Keeping your cool around fake people is very important, even if they're really annoying. It's almost always better to remove yourself from an annoying situation than to blow up at someone whose fakeness is aggravating you. Don't be afraid to give yourself a few minutes of \\"cool off\\" time if you feel your temper beginning to flare. However, if the fake person says something disrespectful to you, you don't have to lay back and take it. Fake people need to know that there are limits to their behavior, so fire back by saying something like, \\"I don't like it when you say things like that around me.\\" You never want to become fake yourself when you're trying to fight fakeness in other people. Resist the urge to \\"get back\\" at a fake person by giving in to petty gossiping and rude remarks. Remember that if you act this way, other people may not be able to tell the difference between your fakeness and the fakeness of the person you're fighting. What is a summary?","response":"A summary for this article is: If someone is annoying or fake, it's best to avoid spending time with them or to be polite but not too friendly if you have to be around them.

But we can’t be sure the ones I shot are the actual ones we’re eating right now. These are definitely from that same hunt, though.” “I could never shoot a bird,” she said. No, she could only eat one. And it’s that kind of disconnect, so prevalent, that made me curious to have a hand for once in killing an animal I was prepared to ingest. If I’m fine—if we’re fine—with someone else tackling that assignment in the service of our dinner, shouldn’t we be fine with tackling it ourselves? That was my thinking when I went hunting, for the first time, last week. I described that trip in a column, noting that hunters’ rights and potential inconveniences are often mentioned by opponents to new restrictions on firearms. I figured that a brush with hunting, no matter how fleeting or limited or contrived, might give me at least a few new insights into that opposition, a few new questions about it. And it did. Some readers wrote to me to complain that my experience of hunting wasn’t a wholly representative one. They’re right. It was confined to birds, and it was done not in the wild per se, but on a preserve, or hunting grounds, where pheasants and partridges are raised—and then let loose—expressly for hunters, or shooters, or whatever the right noun for those of us visiting preserves is. It’s hunting, of a sort, made convenient. Hunting lite. But such hunting isn’t uncommon at all. In Pennsylvania alone, as I noted in my column, there are more than 300 bird preserves. And to the extent that the birds in these preserves are raised only to be shot, well, the pork and beef and chicken that’s sold in supermarkets or served in restaurants come from animals that are raised only to be slaughtered, and usually from animals raised in much more confined circumstances than the birds on the preserve, which roam in large pens prior to their release. I visited the Pennsylvania preserve with the chef Seamus Mullen, whose restaurant Tertulia, which serves Spanish food in Greenwich Village, I adore. He had hunted many times before, and not only at preserves, and he offered to be my tutor and guide. Before we turned our attention to the actual birds, he had me shoot clay pigeons, for practice, because I’d never previously fired a shotgun. Or a handgun. Or a rifle. Or anything other than the kind of weapon you use in a game like laser tag, which I’ve played with nieces and nephews. He schooled me in gun safety. And only after that did the three of us—Seamus and I and a friend of his named Ernie Sabine, who is the designer and owner of the New York menswear and men’s accessory label Ernest Alexander—grab the preserve’s Brittany spaniel, which would find and flush out the birds for us, and spread out through the fields and forests of the preserve. Between us we shot 17 birds in all. I definitely shot one of them, a chukar partridge, or chukar, and probably shot another, a pheasant, though there was some confusion about who had hit that particular bird. And that elicited a strange brew of feelings. There was a bit of an adrenaline rush. Some nervousness. Some anxiety. Some squeamishness. Even some sorrow, for lack of a better word. And overarching all of this was indeed a sense that there was something honest about what I was doing, to the extent that I was taking ownership, if only partly and briefly, of how my food came to me and where it was coming from. I emphasize partly. Seamus gutted the birds. Seamus plucked and cleaned them. And he cooked them, for a dinner two nights later, to which I brought three companions. For the gastronomes out there, here’s a bit more detail about how Seamus cooked the chukar and the pheasant that we ate: He deboned the legs, ground the flesh and seasoned it with pimenton, garlic and other herbs. The ground meat was used in a paella-style rice made with brown chicken stock and with a jus that incorporated the birds’ innards. The breast meat of the birds was left on the bone, browned in duck fat, and then smoked over oak wood on a grill before being carved and served, in petal-shaped pieces, over the rice. On the side was a sauce made with the jus and with butter, sherry, several kinds of pepper and braised mushrooms, among other ingredients. On top of the rice Seamus put not only the breast meat but also a few pheasant eggs poached in duck fat. It was a great-looking dish, and if I were more adept with my iPhone’s camera, and hadn’t been taking the pictures of the meal in such a dark room, you’d see that. But I recounted Seamus’s construction of the dish not just as an exercise in food porn but as a bridge to the following observation: by the time the dish appeared in front of me, so much had happened—so much that I’d had no hand in—that I felt nearly as disconnected from it as if the meat had been bought from a butcher. I didn’t look at it or take a bite and think, “That’s my quarry. That’s my doing.” I thought, “That’s delicious, and apparently has something to do with my hunt the other day.” It didn’t taste better, worse, more or less immediate. It just tasted like dinner. With one difference. As I chewed one bit, one of my teeth clamped down on something small and hard: a bit of bird shot, apparently. In the final picture below, on the left of the plate, you can see something that looks round and metallic. That’s it. What are the most important parts of this text?","response":"This text is about a person who went hunting for the first time and their experience with the process of killing an animal, preparing it, and eating it. The important parts include: 1. The reason for going hunting: curiosity about taking responsibility for killing an animal they were going to eat. 2. The hunting experience: they went to a bird preserve in Pennsylvania where pheasants and partridges are raised for that purpose, and it was their first time using a gun. 3. Their feelings during the hunt: a mix of adrenaline, nervousness, anxiety, squeamishness, and some sadness, but also a sense of honesty about taking ownership of their food. 4. The preparation and cooking of the birds: a friend who is a chef deboned, seasoned, smoked and cooked them, making a beautiful dish with rice, vegetables, and sauces. 5. The eating experience: the person didn't feel a strong connection to the food, as cooking and preparation were done by someone else, but it tasted delicious and they found a piece of bird shot in their meal."},{"question":"What are the possible approaches to improve your stage fight? What is your stance on the 'improve you weaknesses' approach vs the 'focus on your strengths' approach? Would you say that these questions are the same?","response":"Okay, little buddy, let's break it down. 1. To improve stage fright, you can: - Practice a lot: The more you practice, the more confident you will feel on stage. - Take deep breaths: If you're feeling nervous, take a few deep breaths to help you relax. - Imagine the audience as friends: Pretend that you're talking to your friends instead of a big audience. - Focus on your message: Remember, you're on stage to share something special with others. - Learn from others: You can watch videos or ask people who are good at public speaking for tips. 2. Now let's talk about improving weaknesses vs. focusing on strengths. - Improving weaknesses: This means working on the things you're not good at so you can be more balanced and well-rounded. It's like learning how to tie your shoes if you're not good at it. - Focusing on strengths: This means putting more effort into the things you are already good at, so you excel even more. It's like playing more with your favorite toy to have more fun. Both approaches are important, and it depends on the person and their goals. Sometimes, it's good to work on weaknesses, and sometimes focusing on strengths can be better. 3. Finally, nope, these questions are not the same. The stage fright question talks about how to overcome being scared on stage, while the other question is about choosing between working on weaknesses or focusing on strengths. But, interestingly, both questions can help someone become better at something, like speaking in front of people or playing games."},{"question":"Process: - Two birds meet each other - Egg is produced after fertilziation - Mother sits on egg until it hatches - Bird Hatches - Grows up - Flee the next - Starts family - Dies. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose \\"birds dont have enough food\\" happens, how will it affect less eggs are produced. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","response":"If birds do not have enough food, this can lead to various effects on the process you have described, particularly on egg production. 1. Reduced egg production: Lack of food can impact a bird's health, leading to fewer eggs being produced. The body prioritizes survival over reproduction. In this case, birds may choose to produce fewer eggs or delay reproduction until resources become more abundant. 2. Unhealthy offspring: If eggs do get produced despite low food supply, the developing embryos inside the eggs may be negatively affected. Malnourishment may lead to weakened birds that may not survive long or have a lower chance to reproduce successfully. 3. Decreased survival rates: If the birds manage to hatch despite insufficient food supply, the young birds will likely face challenges as they grow. They may not develop properly, have weakened immune systems, or be more prone to diseases and predators. This could lead to lower survival rates of the young birds. 4. Reduced population growth: With fewer birds reproducing and decreased survival rates of the hatchlings, the population growth of these bird species would be negatively impacted. In extreme cases, this may result in population decline or local extinction of certain bird species. To summarize, the \\"birds don't have enough food\\" perturbation has both direct and indirect effects on the process. Directly influencing the number of eggs produced and the health of the embryos, and indirectly impacting the survival rates and the overall bird population growth."},{"question":"'\\"How to make money?'\\" How can I make my money make money?

The reason is that it combines two different types of questions (embedded and non-embedded) in an unnatural way. A better way to phrase the sentence would be: \\"Which philosopher, if not invited, will offend someone?\\" or \\"Who will be offended if we don't invite a specific philosopher?\\" These alternatives are more syntactically and semantically acceptable because they separate the two questions into more coherent structures.

Lizzie Edmonds. Former police officer Ian Langford, pictured with his new wife outside court today, slept with two women he met after attending incidents at their home. A police officer who seduced and slept with vulnerable women while on duty has been jailed for 18 months today. Ian Langford, 46, who served with West Mercia Police in Shropshire, struck up relationships with two women after being called to attend incidents at their homes. Langford would visit the women, who he was having relationships with at the same time, during his shifts, Gloucester Crown Court heard. The father-of-one’s police radio was heard to go off during visits and he even called a police car to bring him back to the station, the court was told. Langford’s 'totally unacceptable' actions led to a trial collapsing in court - as he was sleeping with the key prosecution witness. He also illegally accessed police records to gain the contact details of one of his victims when she changed her phone number after their relationship ended. The court was also told how Langford was docked 13 days pay in 2008 by West Mercia Police for sleeping with a. vulnerable women after attending her home following a domestic violence. incident. Langford, of Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, who was supported by his new wife in court today, admitted two charges of misconduct in a public office for the relationships, which took place in 2012 and 2013. The judge sentenced Langford to nine. months for each count of misconduct in a public office, to run. consecutively - meaning a prison term of 18 months. He also made an order banning the identification of any of Langford’s victims. Judge Jamie Tabor QC told Langford that his actions had brought the police service into disrepute. 'You are not a man of good character because in 2008 you were reprimanded for committing a similar, if not identical, offence with another vulnerable woman,' the judge said. 'If you needed reminding that such behaviour was totally unacceptable, that incident should have deterred you. 'However, in May 2012, you met up with one victim. She was the victim of domestic violence, as had been the victim in 2008. 'She was looking for the protection of the law and the understanding of the police. You chose to seduce her when she was at her most vulnerable. 'Later, when the affair had come to an end you misused police data to discover her private phone number.' Prosecuting, Janine Wood said Langford. met his first victim in May 2012, after being called to her home to. attend a domestic violence incident. Langford 'immediately' began complimenting the woman and later contacted her on Facebook. The former officer, who served with West Merica police, would visit the women - who he was seeing at the same time - while on duty. He also called a police car to come and collect him following a meeting. 'She was vulnerable having suffered. years of abuse from her partner, Mr Langford gave her compliments and. support,' Ms Wood said. 'A sexual relationship began very soon afterwards.' The relationship ended a few months later and the woman changed her phone number. 'In December 2012, the command and control logs were accessed by Mr Langford and he obtained her phone number,' Ms Wood said. 'He sent her a text message minutes later.' In a victim impact statement, the woman said: 'As painful as it is to look back, when I think of the mental state I was in at the time I feel sick at how the authority figure in our community took advantage of me when he should have protected me.' The court heard how Langford met with a. second victim in June 2012 following a neighbourly dispute at her home -. which resulted in a trial. This meeting was while he was in a relationship with the first woman, the court heard. Ms Wood continued: 'He then began complimenting her inappropriately and gave her his email address and told her it was the address his wife didn’t know about,' Ms Wood said. 'He asked if he could kiss her and the relationship progressed. On a number of occasions she wrote in her journal and she recorded when sexual activity took place. 'That corresponded with Mr Langford’s GPRS tracker on his police radio. It was while he was on duty. 'There are exchanges of text messages which talk about what happened between them and mention him having to get a police car back to the station, confirming he was on duty at the time.' The relationship ended in June 2013, when the woman discovered Langford was engaged to be married to another woman, Ms Wood said. In a victim impact statement read to the court, the woman said: 'I thought I was safe with him but he left me with an enduring belief that the old stereotype of dodgy policemen is still very much alive and kicking, especially when it comes to vulnerable women. 'My feelings are unsurprisingly more emotional, I feel rejected - why did he do this? For kicks or thrills while supposedly on police duty?' The court heard how the man had previous relations with a domestic violence victim in 2008. Judge Jamie Tabor added: 'The. case was compromised when it came to trial because the defendant let it. be known that you were having an affair with the prosecution witness. 'As a. result, the case had to be dropped, although a restraining order was. imposed. Nothing could demonstrate better why police officers have to. conduct themselves in a exemplary manner. 'Both. your victims feel extremely let down by the police. You targeted women. when they were at their most vulnerable. You carried out the affairs. while actually on duty. 'Your behaviour has brought the police service into disrepute.' Representing Langford, Simon Hunka said his client had joined the police force in 1989. He said Langford had previously been married but wed his new wife following the end of his relationship with the second victim in June last year. The relationship with his first victim ended in August 2012, when she went on holiday with her children, Mr Hunka explained. 'He is someone who has shown deep remorse and shame for his behaviour, he doesn’t try to excuse it,' Mr Hunka said. 'He is not someone who has set out with a specific sinister agenda.' Mr Hunka said his client, father to his 11-year-old daughter, no longer works for the police force. 'This is someone who had a long standing is the community,' Mr Hunka said. 'He is from a respected and respectful family and he knows he has brought shame on to that.'","response":"A police officer named Ian Langford did some very wrong things while he was on duty. He met two women when helping them during emergencies and later started relationships with them. He visited these women when he was supposed to be working.

Over the past two decades, social media has rapidly evolved, becoming an essential part of our daily lives. It has redefined how people connect, communicate, and share information. With platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok, people now have virtually unlimited access to news, entertainment, and means to forge connections. However, there has been growing concern about the impact of social media on mental health, especially among adolescents and young adults. Hypothesis: Prolonged and excessive use of social media is negatively affecting mental health, leading to higher rates of anxiety, depression, and loneliness in users. In order to test this hypothesis, several factors and potential consequences must be examined. These include: 1. Time spent on social media: Assess the average daily usage of social media platforms by individuals, across different age groups and compare the mental health indicators for each group. Determine whether higher usage is correlated with an increased risk of experiencing anxiety, depression, or loneliness. 2. Comparison and self-esteem issues: Analyze how social media can lead users to compare themselves to others, often resulting in feelings of insecurity and low self-esteem. Examine how exposure to others' idealized images and experiences may contribute to an altered perception of reality and negative self-image. 3. Fear of missing out (FOMO): Explore how viewing others' lives through social media may cultivate feelings of inadequacy and fear of missing out on experiences or events. Determine if people with higher levels of FOMO are more likely to experience anxiety or depression. 4. Online harassment and cyberbullying: Assess the prevalence of online harassment, cyberbullying, and other negative online interactions. Investigate the emotional and psychological consequences of these behaviors, including feelings of isolation, vulnerability, and the potential for severe mental health issues like depression or anxiety. 5. Role of social media in amplifying negative emotions: Examine how certain social media features, such as \\"likes\\" and \\"shares,\\" may contribute to negative emotions like envy, jealousy, or loneliness. Investigate whether these features foster a competitive environment that may impact mental health. 6. The impact of replacing real-life connections with virtual ones: Investigate how social media may replace face-to-face interactions, leading to weaker social bonds, detachment, and a decline in overall mental well-being. Through a comprehensive examination of these factors, one can determine the validity of the hypothesis that prolonged and excessive use of social media is negatively affecting mental health, leading to higher rates of anxiety, depression, and loneliness in users. This hypothesis, if confirmed, may be crucial in guiding future research and policy development related to social media use and mental health support."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Our family was going to go fishing on Saturday. A few years ago we went fishing down the hill from a mushroom farm called Happy Pond. Since that time, there has been a lot of rain and we noticed Happy Pond had a green coating across the top of it. We also thought about going to a new pond in center of the park called Ridge Pond. We are hoping to catch a lot of fish to serve at our family reunion. Which pond will the family most likely catch more fish, Ridge Pond or Happy Pond? Hint: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. The nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water bodies. Since there is a lot of nitrogen it causes algae to grow out of control. Figure below shows a pond covered with algae. Algae may use up so much oxygen in the water that nothing else can grow. Soon, even the algae die out. Decomposers break down the dead tissue and use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico. You can see it Figure below . Answer:","response":"Based on the information provided and the hint about rain dissolving fertilizer, causing algae growth and potentially creating dead zones, it is more likely that the family will catch more fish at Ridge Pond. Happy Pond has a green coating which could indicate an algae bloom, possibly reducing the number of fish due to decreased oxygen levels. Ridge Pond, in the center of the park, has not been mentioned to have any algae issues and could therefore provide a better environment for catching fish."},{"question":"Possible tweet sentiments: Choose from: [a]. negative; [b]. positive; Write a tweet that is [b]..","response":"A positive tweet might be something like, \\"I had so much fun at the park today!

It is a table tennis sports game featuring simple two-dimensional graphics. While other arcade video games such as \\"Computer Space\\" came before it, \\"Pong\\" was one of the first video games to reach mainstream popularity. The aim is to defeat an opponent in a simulated table-tennis game by earning a higher score. The game was originally manufactured by Atari, which released it in 1972. Allan Alcorn created \\"Pong\\" as a training exercise assigned to him by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell. Bushnell based the idea on an electronic ping-pong game included in the Magnavox Odyssey, which later resulted in a lawsuit against Atari. Surprised by the quality of Alcorn's work, Bushnell and Atari co-founder Ted Dabney decided to manufacture the game. - Atari, SA (ASA) is an international French holding company headquartered in Paris, France. It was originally called Infogrames Entertainment, SA (IESA). Its subsidiaries include Atari London Studio, Atari Interactive and Atari, Inc.. Because of continuing pressures upon the company, and difficulty finding investors, it sought bankruptcy protection under French law in January 2013; its subsidiaries in the United States have sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection there as well. All three subsidiaries have since exited bankruptcy, and are all going through a vigorous turnaround campaign. - Home computers were a class of microcomputers entering the market in 1977, and becoming common during the 1980s. They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming. - Ted Dabney is the co-founder of Syzygy and Atari. While working at Ampex Dabney met Nolan Bushnell and the two jointly created Syzygy with their first product being \\"Computer Space\\", which was manufactured and sold by Nutting Associates. Following Computer Space, Ted Dabney's video circuit that was created for Computer Space was used by Al Alcorn to create \\"Pong\\", with assistance from Dabney and Bushnell. Dabney remained out of the public eye after departing Atari and his role in creating the first commercially produced coin-op video game as well as Syzygy and Atari was often omitted or marginalized with several myths attached. Dabney appeared on the RetroGaming Roundup podcast in October 2010 and told his story in a two-hour interview. - IMAGE (from Imager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration), or Explorer 78, was a NASA MIDEX mission that studied the global response of the Earth's magnetosphere to changes in the solar wind.

The Mitsubishi outlanders brake caliper doesn't lend itself to using this, but I was able to set it up on the outside the caliper and spread the pads anyway. A:","response":"Based on the information provided in the customer's review, it seems that their satisfaction level is mixed. The confusion lies in the fact that, although the customer expressed some discontent by mentioning that the tool didn't work for their specific brake design, they continued to emphasize their ability to find an alternative use for it and ultimately make it work. In the title, they started with negative feedback by stating, \\"Didn't work for my brake design.\\" This implies that the customer experienced difficulty in using the tool due to their specific vehicle model, which led to a sense of dissatisfaction. However, the review shifts into a more positive light following this point. The customer recognizes the tool's quality by mentioning, \\"Good tool.\\" They also convey their ability to find a solution by setting up the tool in a different way. The statement \\"I was able to set it up on the outside the caliper and spread the pads anyway\\" reveals their resourcefulness in using the product, indicating a level of satisfaction in the end. In conclusion, the customer showcases mixed feelings about the product. Their dissatisfaction stems from the product's incompatibility with their specific brake design, but they appreciate its quality and utility after making some adjustments.

She is known as one of the top ranked female poker players in the world; a 3-time Bluff Reader's Choice Awards nominee for Favorite Female Poker Player and a World Series of Poker record-breaker, and for competing on the 15th season of \\"The Amazing Race\\". Hypothesis: Maria Ho is a popular poker player","response":"The hypothesis that Maria Ho is a popular poker player is true based on the provided paragraph. Her popularity is demonstrated by several factors identified in the text. To begin with, Maria Ho is renowned as one of the top-ranking female poker players in the world. Her skill and success in poker make her well-known, likely granting her a significant number of followers. This high global ranking suggests a high degree of competitivity and prowess on her part, characteristics that would contribute to her popularity in the poker playing community. Additionally, Maria Ho has been nominated for the Bluff Reader's Choice Awards for Favorite Female Poker Player three times. This fact not only indicates recognition from a popular poker magazine (Bluff), but it's also a clear demonstration of her popularity among the magazine's readers, who take part in nominating and voting for the award. Without a significant level of popularity, it’s unlikely that she would be considered for such a prestigious honor not once, but three times. Further indication of Maria Ho's popularity in poker is her record-breaking performance in the World Series of Poker. As one of the most recognized tournaments in poker, any notable achievements in the World Series of Poker would inevitably secure a player's popularity. On top of her poker success, Maria Ho also has made her mark on popular culture through her appearance on the 15th season of \\"The Amazing Race\\", a widely viewed television show. This not only puts her in the public eye but also allows for her popularity to extend beyond the poker playing community. Moreover, Maria Ho's work as a television personality and host likely contributes to her visibility and popularity. This role usually involves interacting with the public, which can naturally increase a person's popularity due to higher levels of recognition and familiarity. In conclusion, the given paragraph provides substantial evidence to confirm the hypothesis that Maria Ho is a popular poker player. Her high ranking as a poker player, multiple nominations for a prestigious award, record-breaking achievements in the World Series of Poker, past participation in a famous television show, and her role as a television personality and host collectively signify her popularity."},{"question":"Please write a short summary for the following article: Madonna shows up for jury duty in Manhattan, released to prevent ‘further distraction’ Who's that girl showing up for jury duty? Yep, it's Madonna. After dodging a jury summons with a doctor's note on May 27, Madonna arrived at 60 Centre St. Monday morning with an entourage fit for a diva -- two male bodyguards and two female assistants. But she was soon gone. While regular folks summoned to do their civic duty sat through hours of waiting, Madonna was sprung after an hour and a half. She was about 30 minutes late for her 10 a.m. scheduled arrival time, which is an hour later than the 9 a.m. time regular prospective jurors are asked to arrive. \\"I'm proud to do my job,\\" she said, standing tall as she left the courthouse with a gaggle of handlers and security guards. She didn't respond to questions about special treatment. On her way out of the iconic building overlooking Foley Square, the Material Girl showed she could still turn heads. \\"That's Madonna!\\" one star-struck onlooker said. \\"She looks so thin, right?\\" another chimed in. A group of fans stopped in their tracks to capture the pop icon's court cameo. The Upper West Sider had been ushered into the first-floor clerk's office instead of the regular jury assembly room. Madonna was not questioned for a panel. A court official said the decision was made to let her go early because her presence was a distraction. \\"We had ample jurors today and had we needed her, she would have been sent out on a panel,\\" said New York State Unified Court System spokesman David Bookstaver. \\"We had sufficient jurors not to have created a further distraction for the courthouse.\\" \\"She got credit for her service and we're delighted she came,\\" he added.

Sentence: He only had one trip to space","response":"Based on the text provided, the sentence \\"He only had one trip to space\\" cannot be conclusively determined as true. While the text states that Cosmonaut Valery Polyakov set the record for the longest continuous amount of time spent in space, with a whopping duration of 438 days between 1994 and 1995, it does not specifically mention whether this was his only space mission or one among others. However, to provide a complete answer, further research would be beneficial: Valery Vladimirovich Polyakov, a Russian medical doctor, researcher, and cosmonaut, is indeed known for his incredible record of spending 437 days, 17 hours, and 58 minutes continuously in space, which he achieved during his stay on the Mir Space Station between January 8th, 1994, and March 22nd, 1995. This space mission, known as Mir EO-15, culminated in him experiencing 7000 orbits around the Earth, witnessing 7000 sunrises and sunsets. However, it is important to note that this was not Polyakov's only journey into space. Before his record-setting mission, Polyakov served as a cosmonaut during the Soyuz TM-6 mission and the Mir EO-5 space expedition from August 29th, 1988, to April 27th, 1989. During this mission, he spent an additional 240 days, 22 hours, and 34 minutes in space. In conclusion, the sentence \\"He only had one trip to space\\" is not true.

Washington (CNN) -- Massachusetts Sen.-elect Scott Brown arrived on Capitol Hill on Thursday, two days after pulling off a once-unthinkable victory that has bolstered Republicans nationwide and reformulated the political calculus in Washington. Brown was scheduled to meet with several senior Republican and Democratic senators. During his visit, he took on the aura of a virtual celebrity, surrounded by dozens of reporters, aides, and well-wishers. Brown, a state senator who defeated Democratic state Attorney General Martha Coakley on Tuesday, is the first Massachusetts Republican to win a U.S. Senate race since 1972. His win stripped Democrats of their filibuster-proof 60-seat Senate supermajority and has forced the Obama White House to reconsider its options for passing a health care bill. One of the problems with","response":"the current political landscape was the deep partisan divide that had made bipartisan cooperation increasingly difficult. As a senator-elect with a reputation for being somewhat moderate and willing to work with colleagues across the aisle, Scott Brown's arrival in Washington had the potential to signal a shift in political dynamics. His willingness to meet with senior Republican and Democratic senators demonstrated his interest in fostering bipartisan collaboration and advancing policy discussions. But the weight of Brown's victory extended far beyond the halls of the Capitol. His win in predominantly Democratic Massachusetts pushed Republicans one step closer to regaining control over the Senate. It also highlighted the growing dissatisfaction among American voters with the political status quo and sent ripples of concern through the Democratic Party, which was gearing up for the midterm elections later that year. The loss of the Democratic supermajority in the Senate threw a wrench in the Obama administration's plans to pass comprehensive health care reform. Democrats had been hoping to use their 60-seat majority to push the Affordable Care Act (ACA) through the Senate without fear of a Republican filibuster. However, with Brown's election, the Democrats now faced the daunting challenge of finding a way to pass the legislation with a less secure majority. Recognizing the urgent need for reform, President Obama and other Democratic leaders had no choice but to reassess their strategy for passing the health care bill. They would need to find a way to secure the necessary votes from party members who had been wavering in their support and perhaps make additional concessions to win over more moderate Republicans like Brown. In the days and weeks following Brown's arrival on Capitol Hill, intense negotiations took place between Democrats and Republicans in an attempt to reach a compromise on the health care legislation. Ultimately, the Democrats successfully managed to pass the ACA without Brown's support by using a process known as budget reconciliation, which required only a simple majority vote in the Senate. Despite the ultimately partisan passage of the ACA, Brown's election in Massachusetts served as a wake-up call to politicians on both sides of the aisle. It reminded them of the importance of responding to the needs and desires of their constituents and the potentially dire consequences of failing to do so. While Brown's tenure in the Senate may not have brought about the end of partisan divides or ushered in an era of renewed collaboration, it did serve to reaffirm the notion that no political majority should ever be taken for granted, and that voters have the power to reshape the political landscape in unexpected ways."},{"question":"Christopher Tafoya (born June 2, 1976), better known by his stage name Sleep or Sleep of Oldominion, is an American hip hop artist from Farmington, New Mexico, who is currently based in Portland, Oregon.

When a baptized member is accused of committing a serious sin—usually cases of sexual misconduct or charges of apostasy for disputing Jehovah's Witness doctrines—a judicial committee is formed to determine guilt, provide help and possibly administer discipline. Disfellowshipping, a form of shunning, is the strongest form of discipline, administered to an offender deemed unrepentant. Contact with disfellowshipped individuals is limited to direct family members living in the same home, and with congregation elders who may invite disfellowshipped persons to apply for reinstatement; formal business dealings may continue if contractually or financially obliged. Witnesses are taught that avoiding social and spiritual interaction with disfellowshipped individuals keeps the congregation free from immoral influence and that \\"losing precious fellowship with loved ones may help [the shunned individual] to come 'to his senses,' see the seriousness of his wrong, and take steps to return to Jehovah.\\" The practice of shunning may also serve to deter other members from dissident behavior. Members who disassociate (formally resign) are described in Watch Tower Society literature as wicked and are also shunned. Expelled individuals may eventually be reinstated to the congregation if deemed repentant by elders in the congregation in which the disfellowshipping was enforced. Reproof is a lesser form of discipline given formally by a judicial committee to a baptized Witness who is considered repentant of serious sin; the reproved person temporarily loses conspicuous privileges of service, but suffers no restriction of social or spiritual fellowship. Marking, a curtailing of social but not spiritual fellowship, is practiced if a baptized member persists in a course of action regarded as a violation of Bible principles but not a serious sin.[note 4]\\".

Answer:","response":"Title: A Solid Control Experience with Room for Improvement Review: I have recently had the pleasure of trying out the com.opendoorstudios.ds4droid app, and I must say, as a mobile app enthusiast, I was quite impressed with its capabilities. After spending a considerable amount of time exploring its features and using it for my daily needs, I would like to provide a comprehensive review and assign it a deserving 4-star rating. To begin with, the user interface of the app is clean, straightforward, and easy to navigate. Upon opening it, I was instantly greeted with a simple layout where I could easily access the app's various functions. The minimalist design approach is always appreciated, catering to the demands of both casual users and multitaskers alike. The color palette used is also visually pleasing, making it more enjoyable for extended periods of use. One of the foremost features that caught my attention was the compatibility of the application with a variety of devices. As a person who frequently switches between devices, this is an essential aspect I look for in any app. The app also supports multiple languages, which makes it more accessible to users worldwide. The responsiveness of the controls within the app is another notable aspect. I was pleasantly surprised by the absence of lags, and the smooth scrolling and button responses were a welcome change compared to other similar apps in the market. This impressive feature significantly improved my overall user experience. However, despite its many strengths, the app suffers from a few drawbacks. Most notably, the lack of an extensive help section or tutorials makes it difficult for new users to familiarize themselves with the functionality of the app. I experienced a slight learning curve before I felt confident in navigating the app and maximizing its potential entirely. An improvement in this area would be a fantastic addition, allowing users to make the most out of the app. Another area where I felt the app could improve is incorporating regular updates, addressing possible bugs, and expanding on its core features. An effort to maintain a frequent update cycle would undoubtedly be well received by the users, leading to a more robust and stable experience with the application. Lastly, the app occasionally displays unobtrusive advertisements. While these ads are not overly intrusive, it would be an excellent option to provide a premium, ad-free version for users who wish to have an ad-free experience. In conclusion, com.opendoorstudios.ds4droid is a well-developed and practical application that caters to several requirements of mobile users. Although it suffers from minor shortcomings, it has genuine potential for growth. Given the exceeding responsiveness of its controls, compatibility, and visually pleasing interface, I award it a favorable 4-star rating and look forward to the continued development and enhancement of the app."},{"question":"Ask a question about Middle Ages.","response":"What factors contributed to the rise and development of feudalism during the Middle Ages in Europe? Feudalism was a socio-economic and political system that pervaded throughout medieval Europe, wherein land was exchanged for military service and labor. It developed as a result of several factors following the decline of the Roman Empire and the Western Roman Empire's fall in 476 AD. Key aspects such as invasions by various groups, decentralization of power, and the necessity for protection and stability laid the groundwork for feudalism's rise and development. Here, we will discuss a few major factors that contributed to this process: 1. Barbarian invasions: Following the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Europe faced continuous incursions by various external forces, including the Visigoths, Ostrogoths, Vandals, Vikings, Magyars, and Muslim Moors. The collapse of centralized rule and the weakness of subsequent Kingdoms, such as the successor barbarian states and the Frankish Empire, left the region vulnerable to invasions. These invasions lasted for centuries, and in response, locals sought protection from regional landowners, who raised armies for defense. Thus, the need for security and protection gave rise to relationships between vassals (knights or nobles) and lords (landowners). 2. Decentralization of power: The decline of centralized authority and the absence of a dominant empire brought about political fragmentation. Smaller kingdoms and regional authorities took control of various territories, leading to the establishment of a more localized ruling structure. As local lords gained more power, they seized control of the resources and land in their domain and needed to maintain a personal army to defend their people and property. In return for military service, they granted land to their vassals, solidifying the feudal hierarchy. 3. The role of the Catholic Church: The Church played a vital role in the development of feudalism. As the most powerful institution in medieval Europe, the Church had vast land holdings. Church officials, such as bishops and abbots, acted as feudal lords, granting land to vassals and receiving services, gifts, and loyalty in return. The Church was instrumental in legitimizing feudal relationships and duties, subsequently entrenching the feudal system throughout the European continent. 4. Manorialism: The manorial system or the economic counterpart to feudalism developed around the same time. European peasants, seeking protection and sustenance, pledged their service to the local lords in exchange for a plot of land on the lord's estate, or manor. The peasants worked on the manor, farming and providing resources such as food, cloth, and building materials to the lord and his vassals. In return, the lord offered protection to the peasants from external threats. This relationship between the lord and serfs provided stability to the society and became an essential element of feudalism. 5. The need for social organization: Feudalism provided a structured and hierarchical organization to medieval society, allowing for the smooth functioning of daily life. In an era marked by uncertainty and vulnerability, the feudal system offered clear roles and responsibilities for each social group – from the monarch, who held supreme authority, to the serfs who worked on the lands to sustain the community. This social structure helped to maintain a sense of order and stability in an otherwise chaotic period in history. In conclusion, the rise and development of feudalism during the Middle Ages in Europe were prompted by a combination of factors, including external invasions, decentralization of power, the need for organization and stability, the influence of the Church, and the closely related manorial system. This complex web of relationships and obligations allowed for the creation of a system that helped maintain order in a tumultuous period."},{"question":"Question: \\"How would you identify these groups with one word?\\" Context: \\"The original Latin word \\"universitas\\" refers in general to \\"a number of persons associated into one body, a society, company, community, guild, corporation, etc.\\" At the time of the emergence of urban town life and medieval guilds, specialised \\"associations of students and teachers with collective legal rights usually guaranteed by charters issued by princes, prelates, or the towns in which they were located\\" came to be denominated by this general term.

Many more wars had been fought over the centuries. Aside from the Forty Years' War in the 14th and 15th centuries, the south usually had been on the losing side. But this war proved to be the proverbial final nail. For the Mon, the defeat marked the end of their dream of independence. For a long time, they would remember the utter devastation that accompanied the final collapse of their short-lived kingdom. Thousands fled across the border into Siam. One Mon monk wrote of the time: \\"Sons could not find their mothers, nor mothers their sons, and there was weeping throughout the land\\". Soon, entire communities of ethnic Burmans from the north began to settle in the delta. Mon rebellions still flared up in 1762, 1774, 1783, 1792, and 1824-1826. Each revolt typically was followed by fresh deportations, Mon flight to Siam, and punitive cultural proscriptions. The last king of Hanthawaddy was publicly humiliated and executed in 1774. In the aftermath of revolts, Burmese language was encouraged at the expense of Mon. Chronicles by late 18th century and early 19th Mon monks portrayed the south's recent history as a tale of unrelenting northern encroachment. By the early 19th century, assimilation and inter-marriage had reduced the Mon population to a small minority. Centuries of Mon supremacy along the coast came to an end.

The dead had no opinions, no agendas. They weren't sensitive. The dead did what you fucking told them to do and didn't complain. Right? The living simply did not understand that there were rules.

Title Credits: Depths of Survival – An Adventure That Took Humanity to the Brink"},{"question":"Ilya Nikolayevich Bryzgalov ( ( listen); Russian: Il'ia Nikolaevich Bryzgalov; born 22 June 1980) is a Russian former professional ice hockey goaltender. He was selected in the second round of the 2000 NHL Entry Draft, 44th overall, by the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. He has also played for the Phoenix Coyotes, Philadelphia Flyers, Edmonton Oilers and Minnesota Wild. In 2006-07 season, Bryzgalov won the Stanley Cup with the Anaheim Ducks. Bryzgalov started his professional career in his native Russia, splitting the 1999-2000 season between Spartak Moscow of the Russian Supreme League (RSL-2) and Lada Togliatti of the Russian Superleague (RSL). Bryzgalov played two seasons with Lada Togliatti before joining the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, who had drafted him in the second round, 44th overall, in the 2000 NHL Entry Draft. However, with Jean-Sebastien Giguere and Martin Gerber ahead of him in the club's depth chart, Bryzgalov spent the better part of his first four seasons in North America with the Cincinnati Mighty Ducks of the American Hockey League (AHL). He made his Mighty Ducks debut in 2001-02, playing in his first of two games during that four-season stretch. With the departure of backup Gerber, Bryzgalov took over behind Giguere in 2005-06 season. However, injuries to the Ducks starter allowed Bryzgalov to play more games than he otherwise would have and he responded to the challenge with a 13-12-1 record with a 2.51 goals against average (GAA) and .910 save percentage. In the subsequent playoffs, Bryzgalov made three starts and one relief appearance for the Ducks in their first-round series against the Calgary Flames. In Game 1, he filled-in for an injured Giguere, taking a 2-1 overtime loss. He relieved Giguere once more in Game 5 and stopped all 19 shots he faced in a 3-2 loss. He then took over the starting job for Games 6 and 7 of the series, winning 2-1 in Game 6 and recording a shutout in the decisive Game 7. Moving past the Flames, Bryzgalov then recorded 5-0 and 3-0 shutouts in the first two games of the second series against the Colorado Avalanche for three consecutive shutouts. He tied Frank McCool's 1945 playoff record for most consecutive shutouts by a rookie and passed Giguere, who had recorded consecutive shutouts in 2003 for the third-longest playoff shutout streak of all time. Despite his success in the first two rounds, Bryzgalov struggled in the semi-finals against the Edmonton Oilers and was eventually replaced by Giguere for the rest of the series as the Ducks were eliminated in five games. Bryzgalov continued to play backup to Giguere the following season and into the 2007 playoffs. Bryzgalov made comments regarding Anaheim Ducks Head Coach Randy Carlyle, saying he believed Carlyle has no confidence in him. However, he briefly took over as the starter for the first four games of the Western Conference Quarter-Finals, winning three games as Giguere took a leave of absence with personal issues. Bryzgalov came in for relief in the Western Conference finals against the Detroit Red Wings, but remained on the bench as the Ducks went on to defeat the Ottawa Senators in the Finals in five games to win the franchise's, and Bryzgalov's, first Stanley Cup. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: what was the anaheim tenure about?","response":"The Anaheim tenure was about Ilya Bryzgalov's time playing as a professional ice hockey goaltender for the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. He was drafted by them in 2000 and spent most of his first four seasons playing in the American Hockey League. When he started playing more for the Mighty Ducks, he faced some challenges but also had successful moments. He played as a backup to Jean-Sebastien Giguere and eventually helped the team win their first Stanley Cup in the 2006-2007 season."},{"question":"Dinner will be from IV . Silver Greens ?

Forty-eight) are a Japanese idol girl group named after the Akihabara (Akiba for short) area in Tokyo, where the group's theater is located. The group has expanded since then to include over 130 members as of December 2015, aged from their early teens to their mid-20s. AKB48's producer, Yasushi Akimoto, wanted to form a girl group with its own theater (unlike pop groups performing occasional concerts and seen on television) and performing daily so fans could always see them live. This \\"idols you can meet\\" concept includes teams which can rotate performances and perform simultaneously at several events and \\"handshake\\" events, where fans can meet group members. Context: AKB48 was founded as \\"idols you can meet\\". The group's chief producer, Yasushi Akimoto, said that his goal was to create a unique idol group which, unlike other idol groups which perform occasional concerts and appear primarily on television, would perform regularly in its own theater. The AKB48 Theater is in the Don Quijote store in Akihabara, Tokyo. The group is split into several teams, reducing its members' workload (since the theater's near-daily performance is by only one team) and enabling AKB48 to perform simultaneously in several places. According to former member Misaki Iwasa, each team has its own theme. Team A represents freedom; Team B is idol-like, with cute costumes, and Team K has a strong, powerful image. According to an early press release the group was intended to have 16 members on each of three teams, for a total membership of 48; but its membership has varied over time, and has exceeded 120 people. New members are called trainees (Yan Jiu Sheng , kenkyusei) who are understudies for the group, performing occasionally in the theater as a team. In addition to their performances with the group, members are promoted by the Japanese mass media. AKB48 regularly hosts events, where fans can interact with the members, such as taking pictures or shaking hands with the members. The group members' ages range from their early teens to over 20, and they are selected from regular auditions. Members are not allowed to date, and must be well-behaved; any violation of these restrictions is to be punished, possibly by expulsion from the group. AKB48 has a system that allows members to \\"graduate\\" from the group when they are older and are replaced by trainees who are promoted. Monica Hesse of The Washington Post described the AKB48 audition process as \\"rolling American Idol-esque\\". In October 2006 AKB48 announced auditions for Team B, and 13 girls were chosen out of 12,828 applicants in December. The group's first DefStar Records single, \\"Aitakatta\\", was recorded by 20 members of Teams A and K and released on October 25. It debuted at number 12 on the Oricon weekly singles chart, selling 25,544 copies in its first six weeks, and remained on the chart for a total of 65 weeks. On November 3-4 AKB48 performed its first concert, \\"AKB48 First Concert: Aitakatta ~Hashira wa Nai ze!~\\" at Nippon Seinenkan in Shinjuku. The group performed \\"Aitakatta\\" on the New Year's Eve TV program 58th NHK Kohaku Uta Gassen as a part of the \\"Nihon ga Hokoru Saisentan! Special Medley\\". At 43 members, the group set a program record for the most people in one group onstage simultaneously. AKB48 made its first lineup change in December, transferring Kazumi Urano, Shiho Watanabe and Natsumi Hirajima from Team A to Team B as supporting members. AKB48's second major-label single, \\"Seifuku ga Jama o Suru\\", was released on January 31, 2007 and debuted at number seven on the Oricon Top 10 chart. Its music video and lyrics hinted at the subject of enjo kosai (compensated dating, remotely related to escort services outside Japan), triggering controversy and negative reviews. On March 18 AKB48 released \\"Keibetsu Shiteita Aijo\\"; debuting at number eight on the Oricon chart, it dropped to number 98 in its second week. The group's second concert, \\"AKB48 Haru no Chotto dake Zenkoku Tour ~Madamada daze AKB48!~\\" on March 10, had poor ticket sales. In April 2007 AKB48 posted its Team B roster on its website, with five fewer members than originally announced; for the first time, its membership numbered 48. The group's fourth single, \\"Bingo!\\", was released on July 18. AKB48's sixth single, \\"Yuhi o Miteiru ka?\\", was released on Halloween 2007 and sold 18,429 copies (the least of all the group's singles). AKB48's 16th single, \\"Ponytail to Chouchou\\", was released on May 26, 2010. Its sales exceeded those of the previous single, with over 400,000 copies sold on its first day and over 513,000 in its first week. On April 27 Anime Expo, the largest anime convention in the United States, announced that AKB48 would be a guest of honor and the group performed on July 1 at the Nokia Theatre. On October 23 AKB48 represented Japan at the seventh Asia Song Festival, organized by the Korea Foundation for International Culture Exchange, at Seoul Olympic Stadium. Four days later the group released its 18th single, \\"Beginner\\". It sold 826,989 copies in its first week, the highest first-week sales for a female idol group single. AKB48 member Mayu Watanabe appeared on the cover of the December issue of the idol magazine UP to boy with Airi Suzuki from the Japanese girl group Cute, the first gravure collaboration between Hello! Project and AKB48. In November 2010, AKB48 participated in several events outside Japan. On November 20, 12 members of the group performed at the Japanese Pop Culture Festival in Moscow. AKB48 performed at the Cool Japan forum in Singapore as part of Anime Festival Asia X, and at the Singapore Toy, Games and Comics Convention. Group graduates in 2010 included second-generation member Erena Ono, who left on September 27 to pursue an acting career overseas. The group's first 2011 single, \\"Sakura no Ki ni Naro\\", was released on February 16. It sold 655,000 copies on its first day, surpassing \\"Beginner's\\" first-day sales of 568,000. By the end of its first week the single sold 942,479 copies, the group's best and the fastest sales in Japan since 2000. On February 21 AKB48 announced its third album, Koko ni Ita Koto (kokoniitakoto), which would include 11 new tracks and was scheduled for an April 6 release. Due to the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami, the group stopped its AKB48 Theater performances and canceled some of its public events. AKB48 began the \\"Dareka no Tame ni\\" (Shui kanotameni, lit. \\"For someone's sake\\") project, collecting donations for earthquake and tsunami relief. One of its concert venues, the Yokohama Arena, was used for a two-day charity event beginning on March 26 and 12 AKB48 members attended the Okinawa International Movie Festival that day for the same purpose. On March 15, AKB48 announced that Y=500 million would be donated by the group, its sister groups SKE48, SDN48 and NMB48 and associates of AKS, its management company. Koko ni Ita Koto's release was postponed until June 8, with part of the album's proceeds donated to disaster victims. On April 1 the group released the charity single \\"Dareka no Tame ni (What can I do for someone?)\\" (Shui kanotameni -What can I do for someone?-) on the Recochoku website as a digital download, with all proceeds earmarked for earthquake and tsunami relief.

Sadly, the weather has been pretty gray and rainy so far – in fact the forecast has it cloudy and rainy every day until after we leave. So I was pleasantly surprised to be awakened by the sun peeking around the edges of the curtain in my room, especially after the weather yesterday in which the wind gusted 35-40 mph – hard enough to blow the patio furniture around on my balcony (and at one point, catching a chair and flipping it against the rail so hard that if the rail had been just a bit shorter, it might have gone over). Our group all agreed that we should take advantage of the nice weather and head to the old city walls and St. Lawrence Fort (Lovrijenac). We spent several hours walking the walls and climbing up and down stairs. The sun sparkled off the Adriatic Sea and cast a warm glow on the orange and red tiled roofs in old city. It was such a change from the gray and foggy gloom of the last couple of days and it created a completely different mood, at least for me. From foreboding and dark to welcoming and bright. The clouds eventually rolled back in again, but the sunshine was nice while it lasted. We walked over to the fort and I took these shots of the city wall and from across the small cove between them. If you look closely in a few shots, you’ll see a stone pier, which is just between the Pile Gate (pronounced “peel-ay”) at the city walls and the fort.

After her latest project is undervalued she faces professional setbacks including clients losing confidence in her work. To bounce back she is hired to handle the IPO for Cachet, a privacy company with a social networking platform. Around the same time Naomi bumps into Samantha Ryan, an old college classmate who now works as a public attorney. Unbeknownst to Naomi, Samantha is investigating Naomi's on-again, off-again boyfriend Michael Connor, a broker at the same firm as Naomi who Samantha suspects is involved in insider trading. Michael tries to get information from Naomi about Cachet but fails. While doing due diligence, Naomi learns from Marin, one of the coders, that Cachet is hackable. Despite having a nagging feeling that something is wrong, the numbers check out and Naomi continues to try to sell the shares of the company to investors. Michael, who has had no new insider trading tips to pass on to his friends at investment firm Titanite, tries unsuccessfully to hack into Naomi's phone. Vice President Erin Manning, Naomi's assistant on the IPO, learns that Marin has been fired. To warn Naomi of this, she goes to Michael's home after not being able to reach Naomi and ends up leaking the information to him in the hope that he will be able to get her a promotion, something Naomi has been unable to do for her. Michael leaks the tips to his friends at Titanite and then sends the story to an old college roommate who is a tech journalist. Naomi figures out that it was Erin who betrayed her, based on her having a green pen, the same type of pen that Michael uses.

Emily is an experienced boxer. 2. Kayla is a novice. The sentence is about comparing Emily's and Kayla's boxing experience. Let's see how each choice connects to the context: i. Emily took weekly lessons: This choice does not make sense in the context of the comparison, as the sentence already establishes that Emily is an experienced boxer. Therefore, mentioning her taking weekly lessons does not help to emphasize or develop the comparison. ii. Kayla took weekly lessons: This choice makes more sense. Considering Kayla is a novice in boxing, it would be logical to mention something about her working to improve her skills. Therefore, by saying \\"Kayla took weekly lessons,\\" it can be understood that even though she is currently less experienced than Emily, she is actively working on developing her boxing ability.

Iron Maiden are an English heavy metal band formed in Leyton, East London, in 1975 by bassist and primary songwriter Steve Harris. The band's discography has grown to thirty-eight albums, including sixteen studio albums, twelve live albums, four EPs, and seven compilations. Pioneers of the new wave of British heavy metal, Iron Maiden achieved initial success during the early 1980s. After several line-up changes, the band went on to release a series of UK and US platinum and gold albums, including 1982's The Number of the Beast, 1983's Piece of Mind, 1984's Powerslave, 1985's live release Live On New Year's Eve 1978, Iron Maiden recorded a demo, consisting of four songs, at Spaceward Studios in Cambridge. Hoping the recording would help them secure more gigs, the band presented a copy to Neal Kay, then managing a heavy metal club called \\"Bandwagon Heavy Metal Soundhouse\\", located in Kingsbury Circle, northwest London. Upon hearing the tape, Kay began playing the demo regularly at the Bandwagon, and one of the songs, \\"Prowler\\", eventually went to No. 1 in the Soundhouse charts, which were published weekly in Sounds magazine. A copy was also acquired by Rod Smallwood, who soon became the band's manager, and, as Iron Maiden's popularity increased, they released the demo on their own record label as The Soundhouse Tapes, named after the club. Featuring only three tracks (one song, \\"Strange World\\", was excluded as the band were unsatisfied with its production) all five thousand copies were sold out within weeks. In December 1979, the band secured a major record deal with EMI and asked Dave Murray's childhood friend Adrian Smith of Urchin to join the group as their second guitarist. Smith declined as he was busy with his own band, Urchin, so Iron Maiden hired guitarist Dennis Stratton instead. Shortly afterwards, Doug Sampson left due to health issues and was replaced by ex-Samson drummer Clive Burr at Stratton's suggestion on 26 December. Iron Maiden's first appearance on an album was on the Metal for Muthas compilation (released on 15 February 1980) with two early versions of \\"Sanctuary\\" and \\"Wrathchild\\". The release led to an ensuing tour which featured several other bands linked with the new wave of British heavy metal. Iron Maiden's eponymous 1980 release, Iron Maiden, debuted at No. 4 in the UK Albums Chart. In addition to the title track (a live version of which would be one of the first music videos aired on MTV), the album includes other early favourites such as \\"Running Free\\", \\"Transylvania\\", \\"Phantom of the Opera\\", and \\"Sanctuary\\" - which was not on the original UK release but appeared on the US version and subsequent remasters. The band set out on a headline tour of the UK, before opening for Kiss on their 1980 Unmasked Tour's European leg as well as supporting Judas Priest on select dates. Iron Maiden also appeared, to much acclaim, at the Reading Festival 1980. They were second to top of the bill on the Saturday, with UFO headlining. After the Kiss tour, Dennis Stratton was dismissed from the band as a result of creative and personal differences, and was replaced by Adrian Smith in October 1980. In 1981, Iron Maiden released their second album, entitled Killers. Containing many tracks written prior to their debut release, only two new songs were written for the record: \\"Prodigal Son\\" and \\"Murders in the Rue Morgue\\" (the latter's title was taken from the short story by Edgar Allan Poe). Unsatisfied with the production on their debut album, the band hired veteran producer Martin Birch, who would go on to work for Iron Maiden until his retirement in 1992. The record was followed by the band's first world tour, which included their debut performance in the United States, opening for Judas Priest at The Aladdin Casino, Las Vegas.

A strong base solution with a known concentration, usually NaOH or KOH, is added to neutralize the acid solution according to the color change of the indicator with the amount of base added.[7] The titration curve of an acid titrated by a base has two axes, with the base volume on the x-axis and the solution's pH value on the y-axis. The pH of the solution always goes up as the base is added to the solution.

In the study, researchers looked at about 1,900 schoolchildren. The scientists found that the kids who had been instructed to spend more time outdoors over three years were 23 percent less likely to develop nearsightedness during this time than those who had not been instructed to spend more time outdoors. Moreover, among the kids who did become nearsighted during the study, the degree to which their eyesight worsened was slightly smaller among those who spent more time outdoors. The researchers selected six schools and required the children, whose average age was 7 at the start of the study, to attend one additional 60-minute class of outdoor activities during each school day for three years. The parents of these children were also encouraged to engage their children in outdoor activities after school, especially during weekends and holidays. The other half of the children, from another six schools, continued their usual activity patterns. Afterthree years, 30.4 percent of the kids in the intervention group had become nearsighted, compared with 38.5 percent of the kids in the other group. It is not clear exactly why spending more time outside would benefit children's eyesight, the researchers said. However, some research has suggested that the higher levels of light intensity found outdoors may increase the release of the chemical dopamine of the eye. In turn, dopamine is known to restrain the type of growth in the eye that is associated with nearsightedness. Based on the new results, the researchers recommend that children spend more time outdoors because of the potential benefits to their eyesight. However, it's important to protect kids' skin and eyes from UV light, which can be damaging. Answer:","response":"Question: Based on the article, which statement is accurate about the effects of spending more time outdoors on children's risk of developing nearsightedness? A.

Most emergencies require urgent intervention to prevent a worsening of the situation, although in some situations, mitigation may not be possible and agencies may only be able to offer palliative care for the aftermath. - Boris Eliozovich Chochiev ( Russian : ; Ossetian : ; born 1 November 1957 in Styrkom , Tskhinvali district , South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast , Georgian SSR , Soviet Union ) is a former acting Prime Minister of South Ossetia . He became Prime Minister on 18 August 2008 , after South Ossetian President Eduard Kokoity had dismissed the former government and proclaimed a state of emergency . On 22 October 2008 , the South Ossetian parliament appointed Aslanbek Bulatsev as new Prime Minister . Before becoming Prime Minister , Chochiev served as first deputy minister , as well chief negotiator for the South Ossetian secessionist government . Chochiev was also a member of the Joint Control Commission . - A government or division of government (i.e. on a municipal, provincial/state level) may declare that their area is in a state of emergency. This means that the government can suspend and/or change some functions of the executive, the legislative and/or the judiciary during this period of time. It alerts citizens to change their normal behavior and orders government agencies to implement emergency plans. A government can declare a state of emergency during a time of natural or human-made disaster, during a period of civil unrest, or following a declaration of war or situation of international/internal armed conflict. \\"Justitium\\" is its equivalent in Roman law, where Senate could put forward senatus consultum ultimum. - Ossetia (Ossetic: , \\"Ir\\", \\"Iryston\\"; Russian: , \\"Osetiya\\"; Georgian: , \\"Oset'i\\") is an ethnolinguistic region located on both sides of the Greater Caucasus Mountains, largely inhabited by the Ossetians. The Ossetian language is part of the Eastern Iranian branch of the Indo-European languages family. The Ossetian-speaking area south of the main Caucasus ridge is recognized by most countries as within the borders of Georgia, but under the control of the Russian-backed \\"de facto\\" government of the Republic of South Ossetia. The northern portion of the region consists of the republic of North OssetiaAlania within the Russian Federation. - The Supreme Soviet (\\"Verkhóvnyj Sovét\\") was the common name for the legislative bodies (parliaments) of the Soviet socialist republics (SSR) in the Soviet Union. These soviets were modeled after the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, established in 1938, and were nearly identical. Soviet-approved delegates to the Supreme Soviets were periodically elected in unopposed elections. The first free or semi-free elections were held during the \\"perestroika\\" in late 1980s. The soviets were largely rubber stamp institutions, approving decisions handed to them by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union or of each SSR. The soviets met infrequently (often only twice a year for only several days) and elected the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, a permanent body, to act on their behalf while the soviet was not in session. Under the 1936 and 1977 Soviet Constitution the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet served as the collective head of state of the Soviet Union. The Supreme Soviets also elected the Council of Ministers, an executive body. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in late December, 1991, most of these soviets became the legislatures of independent countries. - The South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast (, Ossetian: ) was an autonomous oblast of the Soviet Union created within the Georgian SSR on April 20, 1922. Its autonomy was revoked on December 10, 1990 by the Supreme Soviet of the Georgian SSR, leading to the First South Ossetian War. Currently, its territory is controlled by the breakaway Republic of South Ossetia. - The Soviet Union, officially the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR \\" ) was a socialist state in Eurasia that existed from 1922 to 1991. A union of multiple subnational republics, its government and economy were highly centralized. The Soviet Union was a one-party federation, governed by the Communist Party with Moscow as its capital. - Tskhinvali (; ) is the capital of South Ossetia, a disputed region in Georgia. It has been recognised as an independent Republic by Russia and three other UN members. South Ossetia is a de facto independent state that controls its claimed territory, in part with the support of Russian troops.

A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output. Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: run right thrice and turn opposite left Student:","response":"To solve this instance, we need to break down the command into the sequence of actions that it represents.

We don't need a specific action for this yet, as the sequence will naturally follow. 3. \\"turn opposite left\\": The agent needs to turn in the opposite direction of left. Since left is the direction, turning in the opposite direction will require a right turn. - I_TURN_RIGHT The correct sequence of actions to execute the command \\"run right thrice and turn opposite left\\" is: I_RUN, I_TURN_RIGHT, I_RUN, I_TURN_RIGHT, I_RUN, I_TURN_RIGHT, I_TURN_RIGHT"},{"question":"Fat stripper is one of the world s best - selling no - nonsense weight loss supplement , fat loss supplement and diet supplement ideal for those looking for fast and effective weight .

Martin's mother and father watched the interview and appeared on \\"Fox & Friends\\" Thursday morning. His mother and father both said Zimmerman's apology appeared insincere and were troubled that the man accused of killing their son considered it all \\"God’s plan.\\" \\"I don't understand what he was thinking by saying it was God's plan that he murdered our child,\\" Tracy Martin, the teen’s father said. \\"I really don’t understand what God he worships because it’s not the same God that I worship.\\" Sabrina Fulton, Martin’s mother, also appeared angered by the comment. \\"Why would God have him kill an unarmed teenager?\\" she asked. \\"It makes no sense.\\" During the interview with Hannity, Zimmerman said he followed Martin because he looked suspicious running between houses in the rain. Martin turned to confront Zimmerman and \\"asked me what my problem was\\" before the exchange escalated into violence, Zimmerman told Hannity in his first TV interview, conducted in an undisclosed location in Florida. The 28-year-old, with his attorney sitting by his side, said he reached into his pocket to find his phone to call 911 for a second time, and \\"I looked up and he punched me and broke my nose.\\" At one point Zimmerman said he heard Martin \\"telling me he’s going to kill me.\\" Zimmerman is charged with second-degree murder for shooting and killing 17-year-old Martin on Feb. 26 in Sanford, Fla., though he says he acted in self-defense. At first, \\"I didn't think I hit him,\\" Zimmerman said, adding he only found out later that Martin had died. Now he is in hiding and said he feels his life is in jeopardy, based on death threats he has received. He told Fox News that on the night of the shooting he had gone out to shop at Target -- \\"that's the last time I've been home.\\" The case drew intense national attention as speculation grew about the motives for the shooting, especially given that Martin was black. Zimmerman has white and Hispanic heritage. He dismissed suggestions by some that he acted out of racism. \\"I don't think it's fair that they rushed to judgment to assume that,\\" he told Fox News. Police initially declined to press charges, citing Florida's so-called \\"Stand Your Ground\\" law. But a special prosecutor who was called in to investigate concluded that the evidence didn't support Zimmerman's claims, and the murder charge was filed. When asked what he would say to Martin's parents, Zimmerman said, \\"I would tell them that, again, I'm sorry.\\" \\"My wife and I don’t have any children,\\" Zimmerman told Hannity. \\"I have nephews that I love more than life. I love them more than myself. And I know when they were born, it was a different unique bond and love that I have with them. And I love my children even though that they aren’t born yet. \\"I am sorry that they buried their child. I can’t imagine what it must feel like. I pray for them daily.\\" Zimmerman, who is free on bond in Florida while awaiting trial, has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder. Hannity had spoke with Zimmerman, 28, off the record in April when he contacted Hannity against the advice of his attorneys. Both Hannity and Zimmerman denied claims that Hannity offered the murder suspect any financial assistance or payment. The interview concluded with Zimmerman looking into the camera and saying that he wishes the night hadn't ended in Martin's death. \\"I do want to tell everyone, my wife, my family, my parents, my grandmother, the Martins, the city of Sanford and America that I'm sorry that this happened,\\" he said. \\"I hate to think that because of this incident, because my actions, it's polarized and divided American. And I'm truly sorry.\\" What was this article about?","response":"This article is about a man named George Zimmerman who was involved in a situation where he shot a teenager named Trayvon Martin. Zimmerman says he is sorry that Trayvon's parents had to bury their child, but Trayvon's parents think his apology is not genuine. Zimmerman believes what happened was part of God's plan, which Trayvon's parents do not agree with. Zimmerman is being charged with second-degree murder, which means he is being accused of causing someone's death on purpose.

From the reviews it is clear that a lot of people did not understand the movie. I write this in an attempt to explain it to those who already saw the movie. John (Scott Adkins) seems to wake up from a coma, after 9 months - or so he is told - still freshly remembering how a guy named Deveraux (Jean-Claude Van Damme) brutally killed his family. The truth however is that this John is a new clone, with implanted memories of a non-existent family. Obviously, also the killing did never happen. An FBI agent (Rus Blackwell) has some \\"questions\\" for John as soon as he wakes up, showing him a photo of the killer and providing John with a name. The objective of this all is to make John think he has free will and make him want to hunt down and kill Deveraux. Deveraux is wanted badly by the government because he's running an underground organisation that frees clones like John from the government and gives them the truth and gives them back their free will by removing any false memories they might have. When John goes out exploring he meets people that he never saw before (obviously, he was just born) but who seem to recognize him. At this point we don't know much of the background story yet, so it's a real mystery when we learn on a few occasions that John apparently can be very violent. First we hear from his ex-girl friend that he once beat a man half-to-death in front of the club where she works (which is why he isn't welcome anymore there), then we meet a guy in some storage building who looks awfully deformed with scares, which apparently is the work of John and reveals that John killed a good friend of himself! At last John finds his former clone, and things become more clear: the previous John had been sent on the same mission - albeit without the false memories about having a family. This John has been freed by Deveraux and worked for him for a while, until he felt he was now the slave of Deveraux instead of the government and left him. Meanwhile Deveraux and his recruits are also hunting John, thinking he is the traitor who left them. After our John kills Magnus, the guy that is hunting him (Andrei Arlovski), finds the first John and kills him (because he attacked the girl, not sure why myself), things change. He lets himself get captured by Deveraux's men and is finally revealed the real truth. They offer him to remove his false memories which at first he agrees to. However, when he is at the verge of losing the memories of his wife and daughter, he freaks out and goes on a killing spree instead, holding on to his memories as real. So, in the end, the government seems to succeed in their plan that making it a personal matter for their clone was the key to get through to Deveraux. What they did not foresee however is that John also holds the government responsible for his pain, whether or not Deveraux killed his family or not: if he did then the government set him up to it in order to make him want to kill Deveraux. It's the same to John. After Deveraux let himself be killed, John is now the respected leader of the other universal soldiers. The story gets in a stream acceleration in the end, because apparently they went and got the last container that had to be sent \\"upstream\\" which contained the last equipment needed to clone people. When John meets with the FBI agent again he is not alone. The agent boosts about his achievement (by giving John false memories) but John kills him... and replaces the agent with a clone. From there we can guess what kind of fight is going to follow, but I suppose that will indeed be part of a future movie. Output:","response":"Question: What is the main objective of implanting false memories in John? Answer: To make John think he has free will and make him want to hunt down and kill Deveraux. Question: Why is Deveraux wanted by the government? Answer: Because he's running an underground organisation that frees clones like John from the government, gives them the truth, and removes their false memories. Question: What did the previous John do after being freed by Deveraux? Answer: He worked for Deveraux for a while, then left him because he felt he was now the slave of Deveraux instead of the government. Question: Who hunts down John and eventually gets killed by him? Answer: Magnus, played by Andrei Arlovski. Question: What does John decide to do when offered to have his false memories removed?

Your task is to classify whether the given summary matches the original review. Generate \\"True\\" if the given review and its summary match, otherwise generate \\"False\\". Input: Reviews: Update: I will NEVER BUY A CUISINART PRODUCT AGAIN, ever. Was on phone with customer service for an hour having to literally ARGUE with an agent -- who refused for a long time to transfer me to a supervisor -- and then with a supervisor. After all that, no resolution. All they offered to do was pick up the machine and send it for repairs...but we'd have to stay home, waiting for pick-up, for a 2-3 day period -- which could not even be scheduled for a particular week. (We're leaving for vacation in a couple of days.) Or -- get this! -- they'd email us a shipping label so we could take the machine to UPS at our convenience, but it would take them 2-3 DAYS TO SEND THE EMAIL. An email! After that it would be about a month before we got the machine back. Utter absurdity. **** Like many other reviewers here, I've bought this machine twice -- the first one was good for a couple of years (not as long as I'd expect from this brand), then started pouring water out the bottom instead of through the coffee basket, so I figured I'd just gotten a bit of a dud or the problem was somehow my fault, and I bought a new one. The new one is truly awful -- sounds like a combine harvester, and now, after just 5 months, it makes nothing but sludge with black crema and a half-inch of grounds on the bottom of a weak, bad-tasting cup of coffee. I've cleaned and re-settled all the external parts every way I can think of, to no avail. I'd expect better of a machine that cost half of much. Cuisinart used to make top-quality products....

I think this is the detailed solution:","response":"First, let's determine how much Kenny contributed. Since he contributed 20% more money than Judson, we need to find what 20% of Judson's contribution (500) is. 20% of 500 = (20/100) * 500 = 100 Now, add this amount to Judson's contribution to find out the total amount Kenny contributed: Kenny's contribution = Judson's contribution + 100 Kenny's contribution = 500 + 100 = 600 Next, let's determine how much Camilo contributed. He contributed 200 more than Kenny: Camilo's contribution = Kenny's contribution + 200 Camilo's contribution = 600 + 200 = 800 Now, we have the contributions from all three individuals: Judson at 500, Kenny at 600, and Camilo at 800. Add these together to find the total cost of painting the house: Total cost = Judson's contribution + Kenny's contribution + Camilo's contribution Total cost = 500 + 600 + 800 Total cost = 1900 So, the cost of painting the house was 1900."},{"question":"Translate \\"Bate el aceite, el vinagre de vino tinto, el jugo de limón, el ajo, el jalapeño y la cebolla roja.\\" from Spanish to English.","response":"Step 1: Identify the main components of the sentence to be translated.

In his generation money was thought of as a real commodity that could be carried, or stolen. Therefore, to attract the custom of a sensible man, a bank had to have heavy walls, barred windows, and bronze doors, to make sure of the fact, however, untrue, that money would be safe inside. If a building' s design made it appear strong, the institution was necessarily reliable, and the meaning of the heavy wall as an architecture symbol showed the general attitude toward money. But the attitude toward money has, of course, changed. Except pocket money, cash of any kind is now rarely used; money as a tangible commodity has largely been replaced by credit. The banker no longer offers us a safe: he offers us a service in which the most valuable factor is the creativity for the invention of large numbers. It is in no way surprising, in view of this change in attitude, that we are witnessing the disappearance of the heavy-walled bank. Just as the older bank emphasized its strength, this bank by its architecture is proud of imaginative powers. According to this passage, a modern banker should be _ .

However, on the morning of his departure, he receives a mysterious letter signed by an unknown source. The letter contains only one line - \\"Where is Lecor flown to Memphis, Tennessee?\\" Intrigued by the cryptic message, Lecor decides to unearth the truth behind it. The plot thickens when Lecor arrives in Memphis to discover that the city is being plagued by a string of bizarre occurrences. A series of bank robberies, with the victims being left alive but in a state of temporary amnesia, have the police baffled. As he delves deeper into the story, Lecor finds himself uncovering a hidden world of crime and intrigue. The city's most prolific crime lord, Alastair King, orchestrates kidnappings, drug deals, and political machinations to control the city's underworld with an iron fist. Unbeknownst to Lecor, King is also intimately connected to the recent bank robberies. The amnesia suffered by those affected is the result of a groundbreaking technology designed to extract memories and information. While working his way through the seedy criminal underworld of Memphis, Lecor enlists the help of a rogue detective named Victoria Mitchell. The two quickly uncover that the cryptic letter Lecor received had been sent by a former victim of King's memory extraction technology in a desperate attempt to warn him about the dangers he faces in Memphis. As they investigate further, Lecor and Mitchell begin to unravel the truth behind the amnesiac bank robberies and the origin of the mysterious technology. They discover that King is using this technology to gather information that will allow him to exercise more significant control over the city's political and financial infrastructure, positioning himself to take over Memphis entirely. Together, the duo tenaciously pursue King and his network of criminals, capturing his right-hand man and decrypting information that leads them to King's secret lab, where the memory extraction technology is stored. The stakes are higher than ever when Lecor is captured and subjected to the memory extraction procedure by King himself. It's a race against time as Mitchell and her team work to rescue Lecor, dismantle the criminal network, and bring King to justice. With the help of his new allies, Lecor is saved from the memory extraction procedure, and King's operation is shut down. The war against corruption and crime in Memphis is ongoing, but thanks to the investigative prowess of Lecor and Mitchell, the streets are much safer. The Memphis Mystery is a thrilling film that takes viewers on a journey through the dark and dangerous world of crime and corruption, with unexpected twists and turns that keep the audience guessing until the very end. The city of Memphis serves as a sultry, enigmatic backdrop that adds depth to the overall storytelling experience. Overall, the film is a captivating adventure that showcases the power of perseverance, determination, and the importance of working together to bring about justice."},{"question":"The WORST restaurant I have EVER been to- food wise (which is the most important thing).

Their historic territory originally included an estimated 10 million acres (40,000 km2) in present-day Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The tribe currently has about 8,700 members. The tribe was terminated in the 1950s under federal policy of the time which stressed assimilation. In 1634, the Menominee and Ho-Chunk people (along with a band of Potawatomi who had recently moved into Wisconsin) witnessed the French explorer Jean Nicolet's approach and landing. Red Banks, near the present-day city of Green Bay, Wisconsin, later developed in this area. Nicolet, looking for a Northwest Passage to China, hoped to find and impress the Chinese. As the canoe approached the shore, Nicolet put on a silk Chinese ceremonial robe, stood up in the middle of the canoe and shot off two pistols. For at least forty years in the 20th century, this event was presented in a biased fashion to elementary school students studying Wisconsin history. The Native people were said to fear \\"the light-skinned man who could make thunder.\\" John Boatman has said it was more likely the native people feared for the light-skinned man, as he had demonstrated questionable mental faculties. Anyone with local knowledge would know better than to stand up in a canoe on the choppy waters of Green Bay. Pierre Francois Xavier de Charlevoix (1682-1761), a French Catholic clergyman, professor, historian, author and explorer, kept a detailed journal of his travels through Wisconsin and Louisiana. In 1721 he came upon the Menominee, whom he referred to as Malhomines (\\"peuples d'avoines\\" or (Wild Oat Indians), which the French had adapted from an Ojibwe term: After we had advanced five or six leagues, we found ourselves abreast of a little island, which lies near the western side of the bay, and which concealed from our view, the mouth of a river, on which stands the village of the Malhomines Indians, called by our French \\"peuples d'avoines\\" or Wild Oat Indians, probably from their living chiefly on this sort of grain. The whole nation consists only of this village, and that too not very numerous. 'Tis really great pity, they being the finest and handsomest men in all Canada.

Article: An affordable housing law passed three years ago promises a possible supply of below-market-rate homes, but has failed to encourage increased housing production and is unlikely to affect prefix = st1 /San Francisco's poorest families. Barbara, 44, who came to The City in 1970, have been trying to pick herself up from the bottom, where she and her children started out with just the clothes on their backs-through the kindness of others they got by. They were last homeless in 1999. Since then, Barbara has worked hard to keep from returning to the streets and the shelters, taking advantage first of transitional housing, then a rent assistance, and studying for a job as a nursing assistant and a home health aide. However the cost for housing has made it difficult for her to _ . She can't afford proper housing. Even an improper shelter costs as much as 1,200 for rent. She has to spend every night in a dining room. In this respect, she is not alone. There are hundreds of thousands of San Franciscans who are in the same boat with her. Since 2000, she's been providing health care in the homes of charity , and relying on an assistance program to pay the rent for her two-bedroom apartment in the Lower Height. A few months ago she lost her full-time job due to budget cuts, just as she had hoped to get a permanent post that would allow her to cover her 1,700 monthly rent. Now she works three or four hour shifts six days a week for 10.50 an hour, taking the bus around from client to client and worrying that in February, when her rent assistance is gone, she could end up on the streets with her family again.

Premise: \\"A large crowd of people are seated outdoors.\\" This statement tells us that there is a significant gathering of people who are sitting in an outdoor area. The premise does not provide any specific information about what the crowd is doing or what event they are attending. Hypothesis: \\"A large crowd is watching a ball game outside.\\" The hypothesis suggests that the crowd mentioned in the premise is watching a ball game outdoors. It proposes a specific activity that the people in the crowd are engaged in. Now, to see if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, we need to determine if the premise necessarily implies that the crowd is attending a ball game. The premise only mentions that a large crowd is seated outdoors, but it does not provide any information about the reason for the gathering or the activity being observed. There are many possible reasons for a large group of people to be seated outdoors, such as a concert, a protest, or a public speech, among others. Thus, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis—people attending a ball game outdoors—is directly entailed by the premise. In conclusion, we do not know that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, as there is not enough information provided in the premise to definitively support the specific activity mentioned in the hypothesis."},{"question":"Which is an appropriate title for this article?

They say patience is a virtue seldom found in women and never in men. This may or may not be true, but it's fair to say that there is nobody on the earth who couldn't benefit from more patience. Patience is necessary for success. It is said that \\"all good things come to those who wait\\". Many of the great scientists have remarked that their scientific discoveries came only through patient perseverance . Edison said, \\"Genius was 99% perspiration and only 1% inspiration.\\" Patience teaches us to value the effort and not just the success. It is a mistake to think that happiness can only be obtained through achievements. Patience brings peace of mind. When we desire certain outcomes , we'll have no peace of mind. Even if one desire is filled, the nature of desire is that more will appear in its place. There is no end to human desires. Patience means we will work with an attitude of detachment . Patience can transform suffering into joy. Throughout life we suffer injustice; the best healer is patience. Through being patient and accepting our situation, it's quite possible for our suffering to be transformed.

Q: Passage: In selecting his crew, De Long's priority was men with Arctic experience. For his second-in-command he chose lieutenant Charles W. Chipp, who had served with him on the Little Juniata adventure. Another veteran of the Polaris rescue mission, George W. Melville, was appointed as ship's engineer. Other experienced Arctic hands were William F. C. Nindemann, a Polaris survivor, and the ice pilot William Dunbar, who had many years' experience in whalers.The appointment of the expedition's navigating officer was problematic; John W. Danenhower, a young naval officer from a well-connected Washington family, was recommended to Bennett by the former president Ulysses S. Grant. Such sponsorship won Danenhower his place, despite a history of depression that had seen him briefly incarcerated at the Government Hospital for the Insane. On Bennett's request, Danenhower accompanied De Long on the voyage from Le Havre to San Francisco, during which he confided details of his medical history. The navigator's competent performance persuaded De Long that such troubles were in the past.The ship's surgeon, James Ambler, was assigned to the expedition by the Navy's Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, only because he was next on the list of medical officers available for sea duty. Ambler deduced from Danenhower's medical records that a probable cause of the navigator's medical lapses was syphilis, but Danenhower's influential connections ensured that he kept his place on the expedition.Two others from Jeannette's voyage from Le Havre, carpenter Albert Sweetman and boatswain John Cole, were enlisted, as was the Herald's meteorologist, Jerome Collins. Dubbed \\"chief scientist,\\" he was in charge of the Edison apparatus and of a rudimentary telephone system that De Long hoped to utilize. The remaining places were filled from a long list of applicants; the cook and steward were recruited by Danenhower from San Francisco's Chinatown.

[Getty Images] Translate to English","response":"\\"I believe that the Republic of Montenegro will play an important role in consolidating stability and integrating the Western Balkans into European and Euro-Atlantic structures,\\" said Bulgarian Foreign Minister Ivailo Kalfin on Monday (June 12th) [Getty Images]. In this statement, Bulgarian Foreign Minister Ivailo Kalfin expresses his belief that the Republic of Montenegro holds a significant position in contributing to the overall stability and integration of the Western Balkans region into European and Euro-Atlantic institutions. The Western Balkans is a term used to describe the countries located in the southeastern part of Europe, which includes countries such as Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia, and Serbia. This integration process is essential for the political, economic, and social development of the region, as it creates a strong connection and cooperation between the Western Balkans countries and the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Both organizations are considered crucial for fostering a sense of unity among the countries, while also promoting regional stability and security. Expanding on Kalfin's statement, the Republic of Montenegro is deemed to play an essential role in the consolidation of these countries' stability for several reasons. First, Montenegro has demonstrated its commitment to aligning with European and Euro-Atlantic values by joining NATO as the 29th member in 2017. By becoming a part of this international organization, Montenegro has strengthened the united defense and security initiatives within the region. Second, Montenegro has been actively working on meeting the conditions required to join the EU. The country has made significant progress in opening and closing chapters within the accession negotiations and has implemented numerous reforms to help adapt its national policies and legislation to the EU's standards. In turn, this would lead to increased economic and political stability not only in Montenegro but also in the surrounding countries. Lastly, Montenegro's strategic geographical location contributes to its central role in facilitating a stronger connection between the countries in the Western Balkans region. The country has been actively investing in transport and communication infrastructure, promoting both regional cooperation and trade. By enhancing these connections, Montenegro contributes to reducing tensions in the region and encouraging collaboration between the different countries. In conclusion, Bulgarian Foreign Minister Ivailo Kalfin's statement highlights the crucial role that the Republic of Montenegro can play in the integration and stability of the Western Balkans region. By joining NATO, actively working towards EU membership, and investing in transport and communication infrastructure, Montenegro has the potential to make significant contributions to both the political and economic development of the region, while fostering peace, stability, and cooperation among the diverse countries."},{"question":"Boys and girls between the ages of 9 and 13 should get 9 mg of iron every day. Girls between the ages of 14 and 18 should get 15 mg of iron every day. Boys between the ages of 14 and 18 should get 11 mg of iron every day. Pregnant women need the most iron—27 mg daily. Good sources of iron include shellfish, such as clams and oysters. Red meats, such as beef, are also a good source of iron. Non-animal sources of iron include seeds, nuts, and legumes. Breakfast cereals often have iron added to them in a process called fortification. Some good sources of iron are listed below ( Table below ). Eating vitamin C along with iron-containing food increases the amount of iron that the body can absorb.

's plenty to enjoy","response":"The given phrase, \\"s plenty to enjoy,\\" can be considered positive. To better understand the reasoning behind this classification, let's first break down the phrase and analyze its components. 1. 's: This is a contraction of the verb \\"is,\\" which implies a state or condition. 2. plenty: This word denotes an ample amount, suggesting that there is more than enough of something. 3. to enjoy: This phrase indicates an opportunity for deriving pleasure or satisfaction from something.

This statement reflects a positive outlook, as it highlights many reasons for taking pleasure in whatever is being described. Now, let's see how this phrase would function in a sentence: \\"Despite the challenges faced, there's plenty to enjoy in a new city.\\" In this example, the phrase serves as a positive counterpoint to the mention of challenges, emphasizing that there are still numerous enjoyable aspects to be found in the new city.

M: Today on mind matters, I'm talking to Dr Ann Winters, an expert on human memory.. Ann, welcome to the program. Now, I suppose the first question everyone would ask is: what exactly is human memory? W: Well, like so many easy questions, the answer isn't very simple. Basically, human memory is a compartment in people's brains where they store images rather like the hard disc drive in a computer. And like a hard disc drive, our memories can become infected or even wiped out by accidents. But the comparison breaks down when we consider that we can train our memories to expand and work better which computers can't manage yet. M: When you talk about memory being infected, do you mean by a disease? W: Yes. For instance, people suffering from a physiological disease like Alzheimer: forget things that happened in the past. And they also forget how to perform simple tasks like tying their shoelaces. The good news is that brain exercises can help keep the brain young.

Then put the shaped leather in the oven for about 10 minutes.; B). Cool the leather to 40 degrees. Then put the shaped leather in the refrigerator for about 10 minutes.;","response":"A). Heat the oven to 400 degrees. Then put the shaped leather in the oven for about 10 minutes. The goal is to harden the leather, and heating it at a high temperature can help achieve this. When leather is heated, the fibers and proteins in the material become more rigid, resulting in a harder and stiffer texture. This process is commonly used for creating items such as armor or stiff leather accessories. On the other hand, cooling the leather in the refrigerator (option B) will not achieve the desired result of hardening the leather. Leather doesn't respond to cold temperatures in the same way as it does to heat. Cooling may temporarily stiffen the leather due to the solidification of oils and waxes used to treat it, but once it returns to room temperature, the leather will soften again, and thus it is not a suitable method for permanently hardening leather."},{"question":"Definition: In this task, you're given a question, along with a context passage which has extra information available on certain terms mentioned in it.

Context: Cerberus just stared at me. The dog didn't blink, he didn't pant, he didn't move. He just sat in the passenger seat as I drove, relaxed, mouth hanging slightly open, looking at me the way someone examines a menu but can't decide on the chicken or the veal. The desert sky was on fire when the city came into view. Cerberus turned away from me and stuck his head out from the side of the jeep, his giant tongue flapping in the eighty mile an hour wind while I dialed Luna's number.

He retired from professional cycling in September 2009 to take up a non-racing role with the team . - The UCI ProTour was a series of road bicycle races in Europe, Australia and Canada organised by the UCI (International Cycling Union). Created by Hein Verbruggen, former president of the UCI, it comprises a number of 'ProTour' cycling teams, each of whom are required to compete in every round of the series. It was initially the basis of a season long competition for rankings points, created for 2005 to replace the UCI Road World Cup series, which ended at the end of the 2004 season (although the World Cup did not include any stage races). The ProTour was the subject of continuing disputes involving the UCI, cycling teams, and the organizers of the world's most prominent bicycle races (most notably, the Grand Tours), and in 2009 and 2010 the ranking element of the ProTour was superseded by the UCI World Ranking. For 2011, the ProTour and World Ranking were fully merged into the UCI World Tour. ProTour status for teams relabelled UCI ProTeams will continue as the highest level of registration, and will carry the right and obligation to participate in all World Tour races. - The UCI Road World Cup was a season-long road bicycle racing competition comprising ten one-day events. The competition was inaugurated in 1989, and replaced the Super Prestige Pernod International. In the first three years, the competition was sponsored by Perrier. The competition determined a winning individual, and a winning team - A cycling team is a group of cyclists who join a team or are acquired and train together to compete in bicycle races whether amateur or professional and the supporting personnel. Cycling teams are most important in road bicycle racing, which is a team sport, but collaboration between team members is also important in track cycling and cyclo-cross. - The UCI World Tour (20092010: \\"UCI World Ranking\\") is the premier annual male elite road cycling tour.

Movie title: Big House Bunny Context: It's rabbit season, and Bugs is frantically fleeing from hunters who want to make hasenpfeffer out of him. He quickly hides in a hole, and makes it to Sing Song Prison (\\"No hanging around\\"). Upon exiting the hole, Bugs is mistaken for a prisoner by guard Sam Schultz (that is, Yosemite Sam). He is brutally beaten and forced to crack rocks with a hammer (under the prisoner number 3½).Bugs fools Sam into letting him escape by stuffing his leg iron into a cannon and being fired over the prison wall. Sam quickly retrieves Bugs, and throws him in a cell. Bugs convinces Sam that he's been locked outside the cell, and when the two switch places, Bugs locks Sam in the cell. Sam escapes and vows to give Bugs solitary confinement for 99 years. Bugs tells him, \\"You wouldn't be so tough if you weren't wearing that uniform!\\" They both take their uniforms off and prepare to fight, but Bugs decides not to, deciding Sam really is tough without the uniform. Sam puts on the prisoner uniform, and Bugs puts on the guard uniform, leading to Sam being beaten by other guards and thrown in a cell.Sam yells to be let out, demanding a mouthpiece and \\"habus corpeas\\". Bugs slips by and gives Sam an escape kit disguised as a loaf of bread. Sam digs his way out of the cell, and emerges in a section of lush greenery. This turns out to be the prison warden's potted plant collection, and the warden berates Sam for his actions.Sam chases Bugs onto the gallows, where Bugs pushes a button and takes an elevator down the gallows. Sam tries the same, but he is hung from the rope. As he inaudibly swears while trapped in the rope, the warden screams for Sam to come to his office. The warden turns out to be Bugs in disguise, who offers Sam a cigar and tells him to sit down (in an electric chair). When Bugs goes to give Sam a light, he turns on the chair, electrocuting Sam. Bugs then blows his disguise when his fake mustache slips onto his cigar, and Sam chases him again. This chase culminates in Sam hitting the real warden over the head with a club.... A:","response":"In the movie \\"Big House Bunny,\\" Bugs Bunny disguises himself as the warden of Sing Song Prison to fool and manipulate Yosemite Sam. Throughout the movie, Bugs tries to escape from the prison, where Sam is a guard, by using his wit and cunning. Bugs Bunny manages to fool Sam in various instances, such as making him believe that he's the one locked outside the cell, causing Sam to switch places and get locked up instead. Later, they both take off their uniforms, with Sam putting on a prisoner uniform and Bugs putting on a guard uniform. This results in Sam getting beaten by other guards and being thrown in a cell. Bugs Bunny provides Sam with an escape kit disguised as a loaf of bread. Sam then digs his way out of the cell and emerges in a section of lush greenery, only to discover that he has destroyed the warden's potted plant collection. Sam gets chased by Bugs onto the gallows, where Bugs takes an elevator down, leaving Sam to be hung by the rope. The crucial moment when Bugs disguises himself as the warden happens when Sam is called to the warden's office. Bugs appears as the warden, offering Sam a cigar and telling him to sit down in what turns out to be an electric chair. Bugs then goes to give Sam a light, but instead, he turns on the chair, electrocuting Sam. Bugs accidentally blows his disguise when his fake mustache slips onto his cigar, and Sam realizes the deception, leading to another chase scene. In conclusion, Bugs Bunny disguises himself as the warden in the movie \\"Big House Bunny\\" to outsmart Yosemite Sam and make various attempts to escape the prison. The clever and resourceful Bugs uses his quick thinking, humor, and ability to impersonate authority figures to his advantage, enabling him to escape captivity and evade his captors."},{"question":"What is the most logical next event?

A mild-mannered Midwestern intellectual, World War II combat hero and son of a Methodist minister, he became the leading edge of a storm promising (or threatening, depending on your point of view) transformative change on a wide range of issues including foreign policy, the electoral process and the rights of women. It was a storm that gathered intense support and equally intense opposition in the senator's run for president against incumbent Richard Nixon in 1972. While the nation's younger and more highly educated rallied to McGovern's standard, the \\"silent majority\\" were deeply troubled by much of what they believed to be the McGovern agenda. George McGovern, an unabashed liberal voice, dies. Ultimately, much of what George McGovern campaigned for in 1972 came to pass. Both major political parties have a system of nominating a president that is far more transparent, accountable and democratic than the systems that existed prior to 1972. McGovern was instrumental in rewriting the rules for selecting Democratic convention delegates to include women, minorities and young people. (Women, minorities and gays now have far more rights and protections than they did in 1972.) But the cutting edge of the 1972 campaign was about how America dealt with the rest of the world, how it chose and challenged its adversaries, and in particular, how it would resolve the Vietnam War. By gaining the Democratic nomination, McGovern became the leading opponent of the war; he challenged the usefulness of the 25-year strategy of containing the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China and any other nation committed to or influenced by Communism. McGovern and many other political leaders in both parties argued that in opposing Communism or other types of totalitarianism, the U.S. had to be far more strategic -- that fighting in places like Vietnam, where the outcome would have little real consequence on our nation's global struggle against a failed ideology, squandered American lives and treasure. Greene: McGovern a strong man who overcame defeat. While the Nixon administration and conservative Republicans lambasted McGovern for those views, Nixon eventually signed a peace agreement that ended the war on terms no more favorable than would have been granted had the McGovern-Hatfield Amendment been adopted in 1970 -- an amendment that proposed a complete withdrawal of troops from Vietnam and would have saved thousands of American combat casualties. Here is part of the passionate speech -- bracingly relevant today -- that McGovern delivered on the Senate floor before the vote defeating the amendment:. \\"Every senator in this chamber is partly responsible for sending 50,000 young Americans to an early grave. This chamber reeks of blood. Every senator here is partly responsible for that human wreckage at Walter Reed and Bethesda Naval and all across our land â€” young men without legs, or arms, or genitals, or faces or hopes. \\"There are not very many of these blasted and broken boys who think this war is a glorious adventure. Do not talk to them about bugging out, or national honor or courage. It does not take any courage at all for a congressman, or a senator, or a president to wrap himself in the flag and say we are staying in Vietnam, because it is not our blood that is being shed. But we are responsible for those young men and their lives and their hopes. And if we do not end this damnable war, those young men will some day curse us for our pitiful willingness to let the executive carry the burden that the Constitution places on us. \\"So before we vote, let us ponder the admonition of Edmund Burke, the great parliamentarian of an earlier day: 'A contentious man would be cautious how he dealt in blood.'\\" Highlights of George McGovern's life. Today, American businesses are seeking to broaden our commercial relationships with Vietnam, and American military advisers meet with the Vietnamese to suggest strategies that will help that country protect the territory it claims in the South China Sea from possible Chinese aggression. George McGovern never fully recovered from the drubbing he received at the polls in November of 1972. But the path that he pointed to was ultimately the path the country took, and the movement he founded drew thousands of men and women, who committed their lives to public service and who continue to contribute to their communities and their country 40 years later. George McGovern was never the extremist his opponents tried to characterize him as being. His subsequent electoral success in South Dakota was evidence enough of that fact. But he was a man of great vision and grace. He helped to educate a generation about the failures of a rigid and untextured accounting of our allies and our enemies, and about the importance of making smart choices when dealing with dangerous adversaries. Those are lessons as important today as they were in 1970. Politicians pay tribute. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Scott Lilly.

His father, Maurice, took work wherever he could find, which led to jobs at a local knitwear company and at Murphy's Irish Stout brewery, among others. His family were keen on sport, football especially, and many of his relatives had played for junior clubs in Cork, including Rockmount. Keane took up boxing at the age of nine and trained for a number of years, winning all of his four bouts in the novice league. Despite the then-record transfer fee, there was no guarantee that Keane would go straight into the first team. Paul Ince and Bryan Robson had established a formidable partnership in the centre of midfield, having just inspired Manchester United to their first league title since 1967. Robson, however, was 36 years old and in the final stages of his playing career, and a series of injuries kept him out of action for most of the 1992-93 season and into the 1993-94 season. As a result Keane had an extended run in the team, scoring twice on his home debut in a 3-0 win against Sheffield United, and grabbing the winner in the Manchester derby three months later when United overturned a 2-0 deficit at Maine Road to beat Manchester City 3-2. Keane had soon established himself as a first choice selection, and by the end of the season he had won his first trophy as a professional as United retained their Premier League title. Two weeks later, Keane broke his Wembley losing streak by helping United to a 4-0 victory over Chelsea in the FA Cup Final, sealing the club's first ever \\"double\\". The following season was less successful, as United were beaten to the league title by Blackburn Rovers and beaten 1-0 in the FA Cup final by Everton. He received his first red card as a Manchester United player in a 2-0 FA Cup semi-final replay win against Crystal Palace, after stamping on Gareth Southgate, and was suspended for three matches and fined PS5,000. This incident was the first of 11 red cards Keane would accumulate in his United career, and one of the first signs of his indiscipline on the field. The summer of 1995 saw a period of change at United, with Ince leaving for Internazionale, Mark Hughes moving to Chelsea and Andrei Kanchelskis being sold to Everton. Younger players such as David Beckham, Nicky Butt and Paul Scholes were brought into the team, which left Keane as the most experienced player in midfield. Despite a slow start to the 1995-96 campaign, United pegged back title challengers Newcastle United, who had built a commanding 12-point championship lead by Christmas, to secure another Premier League title. Keane's second double in three years was confirmed with a 1-0 win over Liverpool to win the FA Cup for a record ninth time. The next season saw Keane in and out of the side due to a series of knee injuries and frequent suspensions. He picked up a costly yellow card in the first leg of the Champions League semi-final against Borussia Dortmund, which ruled him out of the return leg at Old Trafford. United lost both legs 1-0, but this was compensated for by winning another league title a few days later.

One day he was making some boxes for the clothes his church was sending to an orphanage in Egypt. On his way home, he reached into his shirt pocket to find his glasses, but they were gone. He drove back to the church, but his search turned out to be fruitless. Suddenly, he realized what happened. The glasses had slipped out of his pocket and fallen into one of the boxes, which he had nailed shut. His new glasses were heading for Africa! Grandpa had six children and he had paid twenty dollars for the glasses that morning. \\"It's not fair,\\" he told God as he drove home. \\"I've been very faithful in giving my time and money to YOUR work.\\" Several months later, the director of the orphanage was on holiday in the United States. He wanted to visit all the churches that helped him in Egypt, so he came to speak on Sunday night at my grandfather's small church in Chicago. \\"But most of all,\\" he said, \\"I must thank you for the glasses you sent last year. You see, I had just broken my glasses. Then your boxes arrived. To my surprise, I found a pair of glasses in it and it fit me very well!\\" The people listened, happy for the amazing glasses, but thought that the man must have confused their church with another.

Several months later, the director of the orphanage visited Grandpa's church in Chicago to thank them for their help and support. During his speech, he mentioned the glasses that he found in one of the boxes and how they miraculously fit him perfectly. However, the people in the church were not aware of this incident, as there were no glasses mentioned on the list of items that were being sent overseas. They listened to the director's story, happy for the incredible turn of events, but they thought that the man must have confused their church with another one that had intentionally sent the glasses. They had no idea that the glasses belonged to Grandpa and that they had been sent accidentally due to his misfortune.

The Council introduced significant liturgical reforms and promoted ecumenism, acknowledging the validity of other Christian denominations. Additionally, John XXIII was a strong advocate for peace and disarmament, urging world leaders to approach international conflicts with diplomacy and dialogue. Beyond his initiatives within the Church, Pope John XXIII became a symbol of hope and inspiration for millions of people around the world who admired his commitment to social justice and his dedication to promoting peace. His influence extended to people of all faiths and backgrounds, as he was seen as a champion for unity and understanding among different cultures and religions.

She loaned out 15 to her friend. How much will Lizzy have if her friend returned the money with an interest of 20%? Think carefully first, then make a decision:","response":"Let's break down the problem step by step. 1. Lizzy initially has 30. 2. She loans out 15 to her friend. 3. Her friend returns the money with a 20% interest. To calculate the interest, we can use the formula: Interest = Principal amount * Interest rate. In this case: - Principal amount = 15 (the loaned amount) - Interest rate = 20% or 0.2 (as a decimal) Interest = 15 * 0.2 = 3 Now that we have the interest, we can add it to the returned principal amount (15) to find out the total amount returned by her friend. Total amount returned = Principal amount + Interest Total amount returned = 15 + 3 = 18 So, her friend returned 18 to Lizzy. Now we need to add this returned amount to Lizzy's remaining money: Lizzy's remaining money (after lending to her friend) = Initial money - Loaned amount Lizzy's remaining money = 30 - 15 = 15 Lizzy's money (after her friend returns the loan with interest) = Lizzy's remaining money + Total amount returned Lizzy's money = 15 + 18 = 33 After her friend returns the money with a 20% interest, Lizzy will have 33."},{"question":"Given the question: The exercise is to decide whether the question accepts the proposed suggestion as a correct answer.

I grew up in North Central Indiana, about 50 miles south of South Bend. It was common to have frequent snow accumulation in the winter and blustery, freezing temps. It seems like this was particularly true during my childhood in the 70’s and 80’s. My family was blue collar through and through. We lived in the heartland in a town of just a few hundred with a sawmill and an on again off again gas station as our only two businesses. My dad worked in a factory for roughly 45 years. He apparently started that job right out of high school. My mom was an incredibly hard worker and Still is to this day. She did factory work, restaurant management and everything in between. It was this Protestant work ethic that led to one of the frequent tasks that my brother and I had to do which was not fun but ultimately was a very good deed. As I said, winters were often snowy and harsh. So my mom would make my brother and me shovel driveways and sidewalks for a couple of elderly residents. We did this of course, after we did our own driveway. Some people had motorized snowblowers but we did not. Standard snow shovels were our tools. I remember us whining about the chore, wishing we could just play in the snow or get out of it altogether. I don’t remember being overly conscious of the relief this provided for our elderly neighbors. I just remember that Mom would be disappointed if we didn’t do a good job. Later in life I would have great appreciation for the things required of me by my parents. Factory work and summer farm jobs helped us learn the value of hard work and would set us on a road to appreciation of future job opportunities that were less taxing. I still remember hating shoveling snow. But I’m forever grateful that I did it. When did the person shovel the sidewalks?

It shares its maritime limits with Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, Jamaica, the Dominican Republic and Haiti. It is a unitary, constitutional republic comprising thirty-two departments. The territory of what is now Colombia was originally inhabited by indigenous peoples including the Muisca, the Quimbaya and the Tairona. - Sub Marine Explorer is a submersible built between 1863 and 1866 by Julius H. Kroehl and Ariel Patterson in Brooklyn , New York for the Pacific Pearl Company . It was hand powered and had an interconnected system of a high - pressure air chamber or compartment , a pressurized working chamber for the crew , and water ballast tanks . Problems with decompression sickness and overfishing of the pearl beds led to the abandonment of Sub Marine Explorer in Panama in 1869 despite publicized plans to shift the craft to the pearl beds of Baja California . - The Pacific Pearl Company was incorporated in the American state of New York on November 18, 1863. Principal officers included John Chadwick as President, George Wrightson as Treasurer, and Julius H. Kroehl as Chief Engineer. Other shareholders included William Henry Tiffany, Charles D. Poston and William M.B. Hartley. The company was a venture to harvest pearls and pearl shells in the Pacific Ocean. The first site chosen was Panama, in particular the Pearl Islands. After Kroehl recovered sufficiently from malaria he contracted while serving the Union Navy during the Vicksburg Campaign, he began designing and building a vessel at Ariel Patterson's Shipyard near the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Also being built nearby was the Intelligent Whale under the direction of Scovel S. Merriam. There were many companies active in submarine salvage at this time. - A submarine is a watercraft capable of independent operation underwater. It differs from a submersible, which has more limited underwater capability. The term most commonly refers to a large, crewed vessel. It is also sometimes used historically or colloquially to refer to remotely operated vehicles and robots, as well as medium-sized or smaller vessels, such as the midget submarine and the wet sub. Used as an adjective in phrases such as \\"submarine cable\\", \\"submarine\\" means \\"under the sea\\". The noun \\"submarine\\" evolved as a shortened form of \\"submarine boat\\" (and is often further shortened to \\"sub\\"). For reasons of naval tradition, submarines are usually referred to as \\"boats\\" rather than as \\"ships\\", regardless of their size. - A vehicle (from ) is a mobile machine that transports people or cargo. Typical vehicles include wagons, bicycles, motor vehicles (motorcycles, cars, trucks, buses), railed vehicles (trains, trams), watercraft (ships, boats), aircraft and spacecraft. - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east. - Baja California, officially the Free and Sovereign State of Baja California, is a state in Mexico. It is the northernmost and westernmost of the 31 states which, with Mexico City, comprises the 32 Federal Entities of Mexico. Before becoming a state in 1953, the area was known as the North Territory of Baja California (\\"El Territorio Norte de Baja California\\"). It has an area of , or 3.57% of the land mass of Mexico and comprises the northern half of the Baja California Peninsula, north of the 28th parallel, plus oceanic Guadalupe Island. The mainland portion of the state is bordered on the west by the Pacific Ocean, on the east by Sonora, the U.S. State of Arizona, and the Gulf of California (also known as the \\"Sea of Cortez\\"), and on the south by Baja California Sur. Its northern limit is the U.S. state of California. What is the relationship between 'sub marine explorer' and 'united states navy'?","response":"The Sub Marine Explorer was a submersible built between 1863 and 1866 by Julius H. Kroehl and Ariel Patterson in Brooklyn, New York for the Pacific Pearl Company. Although the Sub Marine Explorer was not directly related to the United States Navy, its design and technology influenced the development of submarines and submersibles in the years that followed, including those used by the US Navy. In addition, Julius H. Kroehl, the engineer behind the Sub Marine Explorer, had served the Union Navy during the American Civil War, further connecting the story of this early submersible to the US Navy."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: I was introduced to the amazing range of handmade products from Okoii back in July and intended to post reviews in early September; however, was struck down with a particularly potent uterine parasite that left me comatosed on the couch each evening by about 8.00pm, so blogging had to take a massive back step. Now that my energy levels are returning I though that it is about time I told you about these amazing products! Okoii products are handmade by Yoko, formally from Japan, now living in Australia. Her aim was to introduce Australian women to traditional natural ingredients from Japan and Asia that they may not previously have been aware of. Some of these ingredients have been used in Japan for upwards of 1000 years, and recently the benefits of such ingredients have been scientifically proven. When you place an order with Okoii, your products are then made by hand, one by one, so you know that they are as fresh as they can possibly be. Other than Lush' Fresh Face Masks, I can't think of any other product that would be as fresh as Okoii. I find it quite exciting to know that when I purchase a product from Okoii, that it hasn't been sitting on the shelf of a warehouse for months, slowly deteriorating. It is recommended that the products be kept in the fridge to maintain their freshness and the all come with a recommended used by date that is between 3-6 months from when it was made. The first product that I am going to introduce you to is the Luxury Rice Bran Face Soap. I decided to review this one on its own for two reasons. Firstly, it was my absolute favourite of all the Okoii products I tried; and secondly, it was actually the product that I was most fearful of trying. Why? Well, the first beauty rule that is drummed into every girls head is to NEVER USE SOAP ON YOUR FACE and I was being forced to break this rule (I am a first born goodie goodie who NEVER breaks the rules - this was tough for me to do!).

Article: In a certain store where they sell puddings, a number of these delicious things are laid out in a row during the Christmas season. Here you may select the one which is most to your taste, and you are even allowed to sample them before coming to a decision. I have often wondered whether some people, who had no intention of making a purchase, would take advantage of this privilege. One day I asked this question of the shop girl, and I learned it was indeed the case. \\"Now there's one old gentleman, for instance,\\" she told me, \\"he comes here almost every week and samples each one of the puddings, though he never buys anything, and I suspect he never will. I remember him from last year and the year before that, too. Well, let him come if he wants it, and welcome to it. And what's more, I hope there are a lot more stores where he can go and get his share. He looks as if he needed it all right, and I suppose they can afford it.\\" She was still speaking when an elderly gentleman limped up to the counter and began looking closely at the row of puddings with great interest. \\"Why, that's the very gentleman I've been telling you about,\\" whispered the shop girl. \\"Just watch him now.\\" And then turning to him: \\"Would you like to sample them, sir? Here's a spoon for you to use. \\"The elderly gentleman, who was poorly but neatly dressed, accepted the spoon and began eagerly to sample one after another of the puddings, only breaking off occasionally to wipe his red eyes with a large torn handkerchief. \\"This is quite good\\". \\"This is not bad either, but a little too heavy\\". All the time it was quite evident that he sincerely believed that he might eventually buy one of these puddings, and I am positive that he did not for a moment feel that he was in any way cheating the store.

Analyzing the first question: \\"How should I live a happy and satisfied life?\\" This question seeks guidance or advice on living a life filled with happiness and satisfaction. It asks for a method, approach, or steps to achieve this state in life. 2. Analyzing the second question: \\"What is the best way to remain happy and satisfied with life?\\" This question is looking for the optimal method to maintain a state of happiness and satisfaction in life. It focuses on how to maintain or preserve that state once it's achieved. 3. Comparing the two questions: Both questions are fundamentally concerned with achieving and maintaining happiness and satisfaction in life. However, the first question seems to emphasize finding ways to create happiness and satisfaction, while the second question puts more focus on preserving and maintaining that happiness and satisfaction once it's achieved. Considering these subtle differences, the two questions are not exactly the same, but they have a close resemblance in meaning as they both address happiness and satisfaction in life.

Daily Mail Reporter. Danger: A study found pregnant women who take antibiotics could be tampering with their child's immune system. Pregnant women who take antibiotics could be putting their unborn children at risk of disease. Researchers have found that drugs used to beat infections can interfere with a baby’s immune system. By contrast mothers can help to kick-start a child’s ability to avoid illness by passing on certain germs. A study by the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in the US showed that bacteria in the gut play a crucial role in fostering the rapid production of infection-fighting white blood cells. They found that, as with humans, mice have a surge of white blood cells around birth, but this response is reduced when their mothers are exposed to antibiotics. This left the creatures much more vulnerable to deadly E. coli infections, especially when they were born prematurely. The researchers showed that signalling mechanisms within the gut’s vast colony of micro-organisms regulate the production of white blood cells in baby mice. Exposing both the mothers and babies to antibiotics reduced the diversity of gut bacteria, many of which are beneficial, and also impaired resistance to infection in the newborn. Critically ill babies are often treated with antibiotics as a precaution, without proof of infection. The study appeared in the journal Nature Medicine. Hitesh Deshmukh, first author of the study, said: 'At birth, newborns move from a largely sterile environment to one full of microorganisms. 'Animals and humans adapt to this new situation by ramping up the production of granulocytes within the first days of life.' Doctors advised unborn babies benefit from bacteria which builds up their strength, rather than medication. A similar procedure in humans, called a fecal transplant, has recently been successful in treating severe bacterial infection in adults. However, such transplants have not been performed in newborns, and the scientists warn that a lot more research is needed before they can determine what implications these animal results may have in guiding human treatment. Despite the findings, babies will continue to be treated with antibiotics as it is very difficult to determine whether newborns are infected with bacteria. But the research urged clinicians to strive to decrease antibiotic use as a long-term goal.","response":"This article says that taking antibiotics while pregnant may risk a baby's health. Researchers found that antibiotics can interfere with a baby's immune system. Instead, when moms share some germs, it helps babies avoid getting sick. A study showed that having bacteria in the gut helps make white blood cells that fight off infections. When moms have antibiotics, it makes it harder for the baby to fight against bad germs, like E. coli. Doctors say it's better for babies to build up strength from good bacteria instead of taking medicines. While more research is needed, the study suggests that using fewer antibiotics might be a good goal for the long-term."},{"question":"Here is a premise: but uh still i i question the ability of some of the teachers to uh really do a bang-up job and yet others i know are just wonderful Here is a hypothesis: Some teacher are bad and some are good.

They're hard working, respectful but strange sometimes. If you don't understand the culture, you will get some problems with them. Asian people are different from any other cultures if you think you know them, you might want to think again. How are they different? When it comes to most Asian culture, respect is everything. You can do anything you want but don't disrespect an Asian man. You will get some real consequences afterward and especially if he is your boss. It's something called \\" _ \\" in the Asian culture. It's ridiculous sometimes but it's their culture. Sometimes their culture can come in between their relationship at work. Asian people might expect a lot of respect from their co-workers when their co-workers just see them as an equal. Americans are very different from Asian people. If you're Asian, you might want to understand the American culture and even adapt to their culture if you work with them. It will be easier for you since you're in their countries. Imagine an American working in China, expecting Chinese co-workers to get along with him when he criticizes them straight out on every single matter in front of everyone. I think they will take him outside and take care of him. It just doesn't work that way with Asian people. If you're an American boss giving your Asian employee a review, you will see that they will have a problem with your negative remarks. They will think that you don't like them, disrespectful, and want to get rid of them; when in fact, you're just doing your job. Of course, it's not fair for you as an American boss but just expect that it can be something that is on your Asian employee's mind. The Americans can't get along well with the Asians probably because _ . A) their cultures are different B) they don't like each other C) both of them are too proud D) they have different political views Answer:","response":"The primary reason that Americans and Asians may find it difficult to get along with each other is A) their cultures are different. Cultural differences can create misunderstandings, misinterpretations, and challenges in communication between individuals from different backgrounds. When working together, people from different cultures often have expectations of how relationships are built, how decisions are made, and how problems are solved, which can lead to confusion and conflict if not managed effectively. One significant difference between Asian and American cultures is their approach to communication. Many Asian cultures adhere to a high-context communication style, where meaning is conveyed through non-verbal cues, tone of voice, and context. This contrasts with the low-context communication style often found in Western cultures like the United States, where direct speech and explicit information are expected and appreciated. Another cultural difference is related to the concept of face, referred to as \\"mianzi\\" in Chinese culture and \\"cheon\\" (천) in Korean culture among others. This concept plays a vital role in building and maintaining interpersonal relations and social status in many Asian societies. Saving face is critical in these cultures, and any perceived disrespect may lead to loss of face and damaged relationships. In contrast, American culture values more direct and open communication, often leading to misunderstanding or unintentional disrespect when communicating with someone from an Asian background. Moreover, the American emphasis on individualism may conflict with the collectivism that is deeply rooted in many Asian cultures. In collectivist societies, the needs and interests of the family or group are prioritized over that of the individual. This difference in values may cause rifts between coworkers or supervisors, as Asian employees might prioritize harmony and group cohesion, while Americans may place importance on personal achievement and self-expression. In conclusion, both Americans and Asians need to make an effort to understand and respect each other's cultural backgrounds to establish successful and harmonious working relationships. Appropriately communicating and adjusting behaviors can aid in overcoming cultural barriers. It is important to recognize that while cultural differences can be challenging, they also provide an opportunity for individuals to learn, grow, and develop stronger connections with others from diverse backgrounds."},{"question":"This is a test of commonsense.

The album was later mastered at Sterling Sound and Masterdisk. During the sessions, Morton had Johansen record his vocals several times and incorporated sound effects such as gongs, gunshots, and feminine choruses. In a report on the album's progress for Melody Maker, journalist Lenny Kaye wrote that they were taking more time than they had on their first record, \\"bringing in occasional strings and horns, following Shadow's advice not 'to settle'.\\" Morton and the band shared an affinity for each other, as he found the group's energy in the studio refreshing, while Johansen was fond of Morton and the \\"looser\\" feel he provided for their music. \\"That man is completely unpretentious\\", Johansen said of the producer. \\"He doesn't think he ever did a marvellous thing in his life.\\" The New York Dolls and Morton produced little original material together. To complete the album, they had to record cover songs and re-record some of the band's earlier demos; \\"Babylon\\", \\"Who Are the Mystery Girls?\\", \\"It's Too Late\\" and \\"Human Being\\" had been recorded by the band in March 1973 as demos for Mercury before the label signed them. They had also recorded demos of two songs written by guitarist Sylvain Sylvain, \\"Teenage News\\" and \\"Too Much Too Soon\\", before working with Morton, but neither was considered for the album. Sylvain said he confronted Morton about this decision, recalling he had been in a rush: \\"He was too quick with me and said that he'd been told only to listen to David Johansen and Johnny Thunders. He didn't want to tell me who had told him that but obviously it was the managers. I just walked out, it was all driving me nuts.\\"According to journalist Tony Fletcher, Morton would have been more productive on Too Much Too Soon had it not been for his alcoholism and the lifestyles of the band members—bassist Arthur Kane was also an alcoholic, while Thunders and drummer Jerry Nolan had heroin addictions. Robert Christgau... contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the band member who was an alcoholic in the band that recorded Too Much Too Soon?, what is it ?

The Reverend Rider (Tate) and his sister Mary (Robson) attempt to defuse the increasing consternation of the villagers by pointing out that the letters are motivated by malice and a desire to stir up trouble, and should be ignored as the nonsense they are.

One of them asserts that out of all the different realms of the world, America has no mythological character that grants wishes. Their conversation is interrupted by a man (Wayne Robson) who claims that they are wrong, and that such a character does exist. The man goes on to explain that this character is a man named O.W. Grant, the son of a Leprechaun and a Cheyenne Indian. The man explains that O.W. is more so apt to play tricks on people, but that every so often, he takes a shine to some of them. When the two men ask this stranger just what O.W. Grant looks like, the fellow replies that he wears a red bow tie, and smokes a pipe carved in the shape of a monkey-head. As the man leaves the two, he mentions that O.W. can be found along Interstate 60. The two men go to a nearby map, and after looking over the roadways, think the guy they were talking to must have been pulling there leg, as there is no Interstate 60.The scene then cuts to real-as-life O.W. Grant (Gary Oldman), wearing a red bow tie, and smoking a pipe carved in the shape of monkey-head (just as the guy described). Going down a street, a guy in a parked car to his right opens the driver's side door, not realizing O.W. is about to pass alongside. O.W. falls from his bike, breaking the jaw on his monkey-head pipe. As the man apologizes and attempts to help him up, a truck comes along, running over Grant's bike, and destroying the man's cellular phone. The destruction of the cellphone causes the man to break into a fury, cursing how he wishes the incident had never happened. Grant asks if the man means the wish, and when the angered fellow replies positively, Grant places his pipe in his mouth, and green smoke envelopes the two of them.The scene begins again, with Grant riding along the same path (though his monkey-head pipe is now broken). Just before Grant reaches the car, he stops. The man on the phone inside, gets out of the car... and steps right... The answer to this question is:","response":"The old man at the bar said that O.W.

It means \\"rebirth\\". It's a strange name for a period of history. What was exactly \\" reborn\\" during the Renaissance? To answer this question, we need to look back at the time of the Roman Empire. At this time Roman artists, scientists and writers influenced by Greek ideas were the world's most advanced. They had become skilled observers of the natural world around them, and had become experts in studying animals, plants, the human body or the stars and planets. They wrote down their ideas about what they saw, and based their theories about the world on their observations. During the fourth and fifth centuries the Roman Empire slowly broke down. Many of the Romans' art and sculptures were destroyed and some manuscripts were lost as well. But most importantly, some of the ancient attitudes were lost. A questioning approach to the world was replaced by an unquestioning one. Why did this happen? One reason was to do with the influence of the Christian Church. Through the thousand years following the fall of the Roman Empire, the Church controlled many aspects of life including education and learning. The Church ran all the universities and thought that the aim of a university should be to teach old ideas more clearly, not to introduce new ones. The scholars in the universities were expected to study God and heaven from the Bible and ancient books, rather than the world around them. Take medicine for example. The main textbook for doctors had been written by a Greek doctor called Galen more than a thousand years earlier. But when Roger Bacon, a thirteenth-century priest , said that a new approach to medicine was needed --- doctors should do their own original research instead of reading writers from the past such as Galen-the Church put him in prison. By the time of the fourteenth century, however, some parts of the Christian Church were becoming less strict about their ideas and there was a new state of mind among artists, doctors and scientist. People wanted to find out more about... Roger Bacon was put in prison because he _ .

We have the equation: 0 = 58 * m - 54 * m + 16 Imagine that m means \\"marshmallows.\\" So, 58 marshmallows minus 54 marshmallows, then add 16. Now, let's see how many marshmallows we have: Step 1: Subtract the number of marshmallows: 58 * m - 54 * m = (58 - 54) * m = 4 * m Now, our equation looks like this: 0 = 4 * m + 16 Step 2: Now, let's move the 16 to the other side of the equation by subtracting 16 from both sides: 0 - 16 = 4 * m -16 = 4 * m Step 3: Lastly, let's find out how many marshmallows we have (which is m) by dividing both sides by 4: -16 / 4 = m -4 = m So, m equals -4. This means we need -4 marshmallows to make the equation true. Since we can't have negative marshmallows, that's just a funny way to say that our answer is m = -4."},{"question":"Please answer the following question by reasoning step-by-step.

He'll no can do it, can he?","response":"The next sentence, \\"He'll no can do it, can he?\\" is not syntactically and semantically acceptable in standard English. Let's break down the problems in the sentence from both a syntactic and semantic perspective: Syntactic Issues: 1. The contraction \\"He'll\\" stands for \\"He will\\" and is followed by \\"no can do it.\\" It creates confusion as \\"will\\" should be followed by the base form of a verb. The correct phrase should be \\"He will not\\" or the contraction \\"He won't.\\" 2. The phrase \\"no can do\\" is a colloquialism and is not grammatically correct in standard English. Colloquialisms are informal expressions that are more appropriate in casual conversations, and they should not be used in formal writing or speech. A better alternative to express the same meaning would be \\"cannot do\\" or \\"is not able to do.\\" Semantic Issues: 1. The phrase \\"no can do\\" is not consistent with the formal construction of the rest of the sentence. Mixing colloquial phrases with formal language compromises the clarity and effectiveness of communication. 2. The tag question at the end, \\"can he?\\" is meant to seek confirmation or a response from the listener. However, the combination of the initial statement with the colloquialism \\"no can do\\" makes the whole sentence unclear and hard to understand. A syntactically and semantically acceptable version of the sentence would be: \\"He won't be able to do it, will he?\\" or \\"He cannot do it, can he?\\" Both of these alternatives are grammatically correct and convey the intended meaning clearly. They use standard English syntax and maintain consistent language throughout. Additionally, the tag questions are appropriate for the statements that precede them, making the sentences easier to understand."},{"question":"Westbury Senior High School is a ninth-through-12th-grade school of the Westbury Union Free School District (USFD No. 1), the district covering the village of Westbury, New York, USA.

The Giants needed just 0:51 seconds to score. After a 4-yard run by Rashad Jennings, Eli Manning hit Odell Beckham Jr. on 87-yard catch-and-run for a touchdown. After both teams went three-and-out, the Patriots drove all the way to the Giants 8, but on 3rd-and-4 Brady was sacked by Craig Dahl for a 5-yard loss and Gostkowski gave the Patriots the lead with a 31-yard field goal. On the ensuing drive, the Giants drove all the way to the Patriots 16, but Manning was strip-sacked by Chandler Jones with Justin Coleman recovering at the Patriots 16. After a Patriots three-and-out, the Giants drove all the way to the Patriots 11, but settled for a 29-yard field goal by Josh Brown, tying the game 10-10. After a Patriots punt, the Giants engineered a 7 play, 74-yard drive, scoring on a 1-yard touchdown pass to Dwayne Harris, giving the Giants a 17-10 lead with 0:13 left in the half. Brady took a knee and the game went to halftime. The Giants took the opening kick of the second half and marched 60 yards to the Patriots 20 and Brown extended the Giants lead to 20-10 on a 38-yard field goal. Later, after forcing the Giant to a three-and-out, Amendola returned the punt 82 yards to the Giants 7. Three plays later, scoring on a 1-yard touchdown run by Blount, trimming the deficit to 20-17. The Giants countered, driving all the way to the Patriots 35 with Brown draining a 53-yard field goal increasing the lead to 23-17. On the first play of the fourth quarter, Brady was strip-sacked by Jasper Brinkley with Markus Kuhn returning it 8 yards to the Patriots 31. Ninkovich sacked Manning for a 13-yard loss on the first play and the Patriots forced the Giants to a three-and-out. Starting at their own 14, two completions moved the Patriots to the 24. On the next play, Brady hit Gronk on a 76-yard catch-and-run for a touchdown, giving the Patriots a 24-23 lead. After a Giants three-and-out, facing a 3rd-and-4, Brady hit LaFell on a 54-yard bomb to the Giants 15. Four plays later, Blount scored on a 1-yard touchdown run, but the play was nullified by a holding penalty on David Andrews. Three plays later, Brady was intercepted at the Giants 1 by Trumaine McBride who returned it 2 yards to the 3. The Giants drove to the Patriots 5 and Manning hit Beckham for the go-ahead touchdown, but after official review, it was ruled that he stepped out of bounds before becoming a runner, and it was ruled an incomplete pass. After an incomplete pass, Manning was sacked for a 6-yard loss. Brown kicked a 29-yard field goal, giving the Giants a 26-24 lead with 1:47 remaining in the game. On the very first play, Brady was seemingly intercepted by Landon Collins on a deep pass attempt for Aaron Dobson, but Collins didn't maintain control and it was ruled an incomplete. After two straight incomplete passes, Brady hit Amendola for a 12-yard gain on 4th-and-10. The Patriots drove to the Giants 36, and Gostkowski made the 54-yard field goal after the kick seemed to be sailing right, giving the Patriots a 27-26 lead with&#160;:01 left. The Giants tried a lateral on the ensuing kick, but Beckham was knocked out of bounds at the Giants 11 and the Patriots escaped, keeping their undefeated season alive. With the win, the Patriots improved to 9-0 for the first time since their undefeated regular season of 2007, and snapped their three-game losing streak against the Giants.

This is followed by a pre-credits sequence of a tomato rising out of a woman's garbage disposal unit. Her puzzlement turns into terror as the tomato draws her into a corner. Following the credits, the police investigate her death. One officer discovers that the red substance she is covered with is not blood, but tomato juice. A series of attacks perpetrated by tomatoes occur (including a man dying by drinking tomato juice made from a killer tomato, a boy heard being gobbled up by a killer tomato, and a sequence where the tomatoes attack innocent swimmers, in a parody of Jaws). While the President's press secretary Jim Richardson tries to convince the public that there is no credible threat, the president puts together a team of specialists to stop the tomatoes led by a man named Mason Dixon. Dixon's team includes Sam Smith, a disguise expert who is seen at various points dressed as, among other things, George Washington, Abraham Lincoln and Adolf Hitler; Navy diver Greg Colburn; Olympic swimmer Gretta Attenbaum; and parachute-toting soldier Wilbur Finletter. Smith is sent out to infiltrate the tomatoes at a campfire, eventually blowing his cover while eating a hamburger and asking if anyone could \\"pass the ketchup.\\" Colburn and Gretta are sent to sectors, while Finletter stays with Mason.

The answer to this question is:","response":"The Pope referred to as Saint John Paul the Great by some Catholics, or Pope John Paul II, whose real name was Karol Józef Wojtyła, was the head of the Roman Catholic Church from 1978 until his death in 2005. During his papacy, he appointed numerous cardinals who played significant roles in the church. In 1983, one of the most notable appointments made by Pope John Paul II was the creation of Joseph Aloisius Ratzinger as a Cardinal. Joseph Aloisius Ratzinger, born on April 16, 1927, in Marktl, Germany, is a prominent theologian and a highly respected figure within the Catholic Church. Before becoming a cardinal, Ratzinger held various roles, including serving as a professor of theology at different universities, such as the University of Bonn, the University of Münster, and the University of Regensburg. He was also involved in the Second Vatican Council as a theological consultant from 1962 to 1965. As the Archbishop of Munich and Freising, Ratzinger was elevated to the rank of cardinal by Pope John Paul II on February 27, 1983. He was appointed to the Cardinal-Priest of Santa Maria Consolatrice al Tiburtino. Soon after his appointment as a cardinal, Ratzinger was named as Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, a position he held until his election as Pope Benedict XVI in 2005. In this role, Ratzinger was in charge of upholding the doctrine and theological teachings of the Catholic Church, becoming an influential figure in its doctrinal matters. During his time as a cardinal and Prefect, Cardinal Ratzinger worked closely with Pope John Paul II and contributed significantly to the development of many important Church documents, teachings, and encyclicals. These include the Catechism of the Catholic Church, which was published in 1992 and serves as a comprehensive guide to the teachings and beliefs of the Catholic faith, as well as Veritatis Splendor, a 1993 encyclical focused on the moral teachings of the Church. Pope John Paul II's appointment of Joseph Ratzinger as a cardinal in 1983 would ultimately prove to be a significant decision for the Catholic Church's subsequent development and direction. In 2005, following the death of Pope John Paul II, Cardinal Ratzinger was elected as his successor and took the name Pope Benedict XVI. As the 265th Pope of the Catholic Church, Benedict XVI continued to build upon the work and legacy of his predecessor, focusing on issues such as the sanctity of human life, social justice, interfaith dialogue, and the importance of maintaining a strong connection with tradition and doctrine. In conclusion, Pope John Paul II, often referred to as Saint John Paul the Great by some Catholics, created Joseph Aloisius Ratzinger as a cardinal in 1983. This appointment had lasting effects on the Roman Catholic Church, as Ratzinger would later become Pope Benedict XVI and continue to influence and shape the Church's teachings and doctrine."},{"question":"Instructions: In this task, you are given a sentence in Spanish and your task is to translate it into English.

Chunky yarn is only one term used to identify yarn types within the broader \\"bulky yarn\\" category. Many yarn brands will label the yarn as \\"chunky yarn,\\" but there are a few other terms that brands may use to describe the yarn. These terms include \\"craft\\" and \\"rug\\" yarn. Check the label to be sure that a yarn is chunky. Another way to identify chunky yarn is by its yarn weight symbol. The symbol for chunky yarn and all other forms of bulky yarn is \\"5.\\" A thicker yarn category is category 6, which is \\"super bulky.\\" Some yarns in this category might be called \\"super chunky.\\" Super chunky yarn and chunky yarn are not quite the same, so you should keep that in mind when making your yarn selection. Yarns can be made from different fibers, even yarns of a single thickness. Each fiber will have a different texture and appearance. Experiment with different fibers until you find one that you like. As a general tip, consider the intended use of the project when picking out a fiber material. A blanket or scarf will need a softer yarn fiber than a rug or handbag would probably need. Acrylic wool is a mix of natural and synthetic fibers. It tends to be inexpensive and durable, making it ideal for projects like rugs and purses. It can also be used for sweaters and scarves but may not be soft enough for those with sensitive skin. Cotton wool is soft, durable, and natural. It is generally preferred for sweaters and scarves but may still be too rough for those with very sensitive skin, like infants and toddlers. The softest wools are cashmere, silk, mohair, lambs, and alpaca. Cashmere and silk wools are typically used for scarves, shawls, and wraps, but they are more delicate and require more care. Mohair, lambswool, and alpaca wool tend to be used for blankets and sweaters, but they also require special care. This step applies to any yarn you shop for, and chunky yarn is no exception. You'll need to figure out which color or colors you want to use for your project. Use any color that you like or that will meet the needs of your project. Once you figure it out, buy the number of skeins you will need. It's better to have too many than too few. The dye can be slightly different from batch to batch, so buying the same hue by name at two different times can result in having two slightly different shades. You can avoid this problem if you buy the yarn all at once. To be on the safe side, you should also check the \\"lot\\" or \\"dye lot\\" number on the back label of each skein. Make sure that the dye lot number on each skein is the same before you buy them. Otherwise, you may still end up with different shades. The right crochet hook to use can vary by project and yarn type. If you are using a pattern, then the hook size might be indicated in the pattern. If you are not using a pattern, then check the yarn label for a recommendation. If you are not sure what hook size to use, choose a hook size that falls within the standard recommended range. Larger hooks tend to be best for chunky yarn. In U.S. sizes, look for a hook between K-10-1/2 and M-13. In metric sizes, look for a hook between 6.5 and 9 mm. If you end up picking a super chunky yarn, the recommended hook size is M-13 and up in U.S. sizes or 9 mm and up in metric sizes. Summary:","response":"To identify chunky yarn, look for the label that indicates it as \\"chunky yarn\\" or terms like \\"craft\\" and \\"rug\\" yarn. Check for the yarn weight symbol \\"5\\" on the label. Be mindful of the difference between chunky yarn (category 5) and super chunky yarn (category 6). Experiment with different fibers, keeping in mind the intended use of your project and the softness or durability required. Choose the desired color and make sure to purchase enough skeins of the same dye lot to avoid different shades. For choosing the right crochet hook, consult the pattern or yarn label for recommendations. Typically, chunky yarn works best with larger hooks (U.S. sizes K-10-1/2 to M-13, or metric sizes 6.5 mm to 9 mm). For super chunky yarn, consider even larger hooks (U.S. sizes M-13 and up, or metric sizes 9 mm and up)."},{"question":"Tom wants to make the world's largest dough ball. He needs 500 pounds of flour and he can buy 50-pound bags of flour for 20. He also needs 10 pounds of salt and salt cost .2 a pound. He also spends 1000 promoting everything. He then sells tickets for 20 each and sells 500 tickets. How much money did he make? Let's answer step by step:","response":"I'll break it down step by step as you requested: 1. Calculating the cost of flour: Tom needs 500 pounds of flour, and 50-pound bags are available for 20 each. To calculate the number of bags and the total cost of the flour, we can use the following equations: Number of bags = (Total pounds of flour needed) / (Pounds per bag of flour) Number of bags = 500 / 50 Number of bags = 10 Total cost of flour = (Number of bags) * (Cost per bag) Total cost of flour = 10 * 20 Total cost of flour = 200 2. Calculating the cost of salt: Tom needs 10 pounds of salt, which costs 0.2 per pound. The total cost of the salt can be calculated as follows: Total cost of salt = (Pounds of salt needed) * (Cost per pound) Total cost of salt = 10 * 0.2 Total cost of salt = 2 3. Calculating the total cost of making the dough ball: We already know the cost of flour (200), the cost of salt (2), and the promotion cost (1000). We can calculate the total cost by adding these up: Total cost = (Cost of flour) + (Cost of salt) + (Promotion cost) Total cost = 200 + 2 + 1000 Total cost = 1202 4. Calculating the income from ticket sales: Tom sells 500 tickets at 20 each. To calculate the total income from this, we can use the following equation: Total income = (Number of tickets sold) * (Ticket price) Total income = 500 * 20 Total income = 10,000 5. Calculating the profit Tom made: Finally, we can calculate the profit Tom made by subtracting the total cost from the total income: Profit = (Total income) - (Total cost) Profit = 10,000 - 1202 Profit = 8,798 So, Tom made a profit of 8,798 from making and promoting the world's largest dough ball."},{"question":"canadian rocker avril lavigne said tuesday she considered mexican audiences some of the best she ever performed in front of _ but that she has no plans to record a spanish-language album .

Given this reasoning, the statement \\"Chipmunk constructs extensive burrows which can be more than 3.5m in length with several well-concealed entrances.\\" can be considered factual, as it is plausible that chipmunk burrows can reach such lengths, and they do have multiple entrances. Therefore, the answer is: - yes"},{"question":"Question. Given the sentence \\"A man in an orange raincoat is discussing something with another man wearing work clothes near a sewer manhole.\\" is it true that \\"A man in an raincoat is talking with another man.\\"? Answer. yes What step-by-step reasoning justifies that answer?","response":"Answer: Yes, it is true that \\"A man in a raincoat is talking with another man.\\" Step-by-step reasoning: 1. The original sentence provides a description of the two individuals involved in the interaction: \\"A man in an orange raincoat\\" and \\"another man wearing work clothes.\\" 2. The sentence also indicates that these two men are taking part in a conversation, as they are \\"discussing something.\\" 3. While the original sentence contains additional visual and locational details (orange, work clothes, near a sewer manhole), these aspects are not essential to confirm that the two men are talking with each other. 4. Simplifying the original sentence, we can still recognize the core elements that define the interaction between the men: \\"A man in a raincoat\\" and \\"talking\\" (synonym for \\"discussing\\") with \\"another man.\\" 5. Therefore, the simplified statement, \\"A man in a raincoat is talking with another man,\\" accurately represents the interaction described in the original sentence, making it true."},{"question":"Creatively image a question and justification for this answer: no","response":"Question: Is it possible for humans to breathe underwater without any kind of assistance or equipment? Justification for Answer: The answer is no. Humans, unlike certain aquatic animals, are not equipped with gills or other mechanisms for extracting oxygen from water. Our respiratory system is specifically designed to breathe air, which has vastly different characteristics than water. The human body relies on an ample and constant supply of oxygen in the air to fuel cellular respiration. Trying to breathe underwater without any assistance or equipment would lead to a lack of oxygen (hypoxia) and drown as a result. However, through the use of various forms of technology and equipment, such as scuba gear, humans can experience the underwater environment for exploration, research, and recreational purposes. These specially designed apparatuses provide a sufficient supply of oxygen and allow for prolonged periods of underwater activity. Yet, strictly speaking, humans themselves are not capable of breathing underwater naturally."},{"question":"Write the next sentence.

Smiling and waving as she rolled through South London, the Queen was spotted by the woman and two children as she rolled past the steps of their home on her way to an inner city riding centre. Joined by daughter-in-law the Duchess of Cornwall, the monarch, still a keen rider herself at 87, was visiting the Ebony Horse Club and Community Riding Centre in gang-ridden Brixton. He added: 'I’m really surprised she [the Queen] is coming to","response":"Brixton, especially considering the challenges this area has faced, but it's a testament to her commitment to supporting local communities and fostering a love for equestrian activities among the younger generation.' The visit was a rare, yet deeply meaningful, event for the residents of Brixton, an area that has long struggled with issues of crime and violence. The presence of the Queen, accompanied by the Duchess of Cornwall, demonstrated their willingness to bring attention to and encourage opportunities for youth in underprivileged areas. As the royal entourage approached the Ebony Horse Club and Community Riding Centre, a palpable sense of excitement and anticipation filled the air. The facility, which provides recreational and educational activities for disadvantaged children and young people, has become a beacon of hope for the Brixton community. The Queen and the Duchess of Cornwall were welcomed by a lively crowd of cheering children and staff members, all eager to demonstrate their equestrian skills and share their personal stories of growth and resilience. Guided by the dedicated staff, the Queen and the Duchess of Cornwall toured the facility, taking the time to engage with the eager young riders, asking questions about their experiences at the club and offering words of encouragement. The duo also met with the hardworking volunteers, without whom the club would not be able to operate. They expressed their gratitude for the valuable services provided by the staff and emphasized the importance of supporting community projects such as these. One poignant moment during the visit occurred when a young rider named Kadija, who faced significant personal challenges before joining the club, presented the Queen with an original drawing of a horse she had created as a token of appreciation. Visibly moved by Kadija's gesture, the Queen thanked her and praised her artistic abilities and determination to overcome her struggles. The exchange symbolized the transformative power of community programs like the Ebony Horse Club, which can foster positive change and offer hope to those in need. As the visit concluded, the Queen and the Duchess of Cornwall addressed the gathered crowd. The Queen acknowledged the incredible work being done by the Ebony Horse Club staff and reiterated her commitment to supporting similar initiatives throughout the United Kingdom. She also commended the young riders for their dedication and hard work, encouraging them to continue pursuing their passions and to never allow their circumstances to define who they are. The Queen's visit to the Ebony Horse Club and Community Riding Centre in Brixton may have been an exceptional day for the institution and the community, but the lasting impact of her presence will undoubtedly resonate with the residents and inspire hope for a brighter future. The determination of the Brixton community and the efforts of the staff and volunteers at the centre serve as a powerful reminder of the critical role that supportive community initiatives play in transforming lives and building a stronger and more unified society."},{"question":"How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? Open a can of tuna.","response":"Opening a can of tuna may seem like a simple task, but it requires a bit of technique and the right tools to do it safely and efficiently. The following is a detailed, step-by-step guide to help someone go about accomplishing this goal: 1. Gather the necessary tools and materials: To open a can of tuna, one would need a can opener (manual or electric), a bowl to empty the contents into, a fork to flake the tuna, and a cloth or paper towel to clean up any spills. 2. Prepare the workspace: Ensure the workspace is clean, stable, and has enough lighting. Place the can, can opener, bowl, fork, and cloth or paper towel within easy reach. 3. Inspect the can: Before opening the can, inspect it for any dents, leaks, or bulging. If the can appears damaged, it may not be safe to consume the contents. In that case, discard the can and use another one. 4. Position the can opener: If using a manual can opener, place the opener on the top of the can, aligning the cutting wheel with the inner edge of the can's lid. For an electric can opener, follow the manufacturer's instructions on how to properly position the can. 5. Begin cutting: For a manual can opener, apply even pressure to the top of the can while turning the handle clockwise. This process will cause the cutting wheel to pierce the lid and begin cutting along the edge. For an electric can opener, the process is similar, but the unit will do the work of cutting while the user holds the can in position. 6. Continue cutting around the edge: Keep turning the handle (or holding the can in position for electric openers) until the cutting wheel has made a full rotation around the entire edge of the can's lid. 7. Carefully lift the lid: Using the can opener's built-in lid lifter or a fork, carefully lift the lid away from the can. Be cautious, as the edge of the lid may be sharp. 8. Drain the liquid: Most cans of tuna have some type of liquid in them, either oil or water. Hold the can over the sink while using the partially detached lid as a strainer to drain the liquid from the can. Press the lid gently against the tuna to squeeze out any excess liquid. 9. Remove the lid completely: Once the liquid has been drained, carefully remove the lid entirely from the can, using a fork or the lid lifter on the can opener. Dispose of the lid safely, being mindful of the sharp edges. 10. Transfer the tuna to a bowl: Using a fork, scoop the tuna out of the can and into the bowl. Flake the tuna apart, if desired. 11. Clean up: Wipe down the workspace with the cloth or paper towel to clean up any spills, and wash the can opener, fork, and any other utensils used. 12. Enjoy your opened can of tuna: The tuna is now ready to be consumed or used for recipes such as sandwiches, salads, or casseroles. Remember, safety is important when using sharp tools like a can opener, so always handle them with care and focus on the task at hand."},{"question":"What kind of task would test someone's ability to perform physical reasoning?","response":"Imagine you have a bunch of differently shaped blocks, like a square, a triangle, and a circle.

She was born in London on January 9th, 1810. She entered the Royal Academy of Music at the age of 14. Seven years later, just after her first show, Anna married Sir Henry Bishop, who was 24 years her senior. Her reputation as a singer grew rapidly, based largely on her tours with Sir Henry and harpist Nicholas Bochsa. After a tour of Dublin, Edinburgh, and London, Anna Bishop deserted her husband and three children and ran away with Bochsa. From then on, Madame Bishop--as she continued to be known--traveled and sang as if her life depended on it. Between 1839 and 1843 she traveled to every major town in Europe, where she sang in 260 concerts. In the course of two years in Naples, she performed in 20 operas. In 1855 she and Bochsa sailed for Sydney, Australia. He died there the following year, and Anna went on to tour South America before returning to New York, where she married a diamond merchant. Then she began what proved her most dangerous adventure. After another American tour in 1866, she and her husband set sail across the Pacific. They were shipwrecked on a small coral reef, and for more than a month they drifted in a small boat before they finally reaching Guam.

Options: - expansion - relaxation - soap - revenge - loss of heat Explain why a human would choose \\"revenge\\" to answer the question above: A:","response":"A human would choose \\"revenge\\" to answer the question above for the following reasons: 1. Contextual understanding: The context of the question involves Lance's emotional state and behavior, specifically about him being a hothead and trying to improve. In this context, \\"revenge\\" is the option that is most directly related to emotions and behaviors. 2. Eliminating irrelevant options: Each of the other provided options can be considered irrelevant or less relevant to the core issue at hand, which centers around Lance's emotional state and actions as a hothead. a. Expansion: This term is likely unrelated to the context, as it is more likely to refer to growth or enlargement of a non-emotional concept, such as a business or object. b. Relaxation: While relaxation may contribute to Lance's ability to cool off, the question implies that he already removed himself from the situation and spent time cooling off. Thus, relaxation isn't directly connected to what he didn't need. c. Soap: This option seems irrelevant, as it is a physical object typically used for cleaning and has no direct connection to Lance's emotional state or actions. d. Loss of heat: This term could be interpreted literally (as in losing physical heat), making it irrelevant to the context, or metaphorically (as in not being upset anymore). However, since Lance has already taken actions to cool off, the loss of heat isn't directly relevant to what he didn't need in this case. 3. Understanding human emotions: Humans typically choose revenge as a response to negative emotions such as anger or perceived injustice. In the context of Lance's situation, the fact that he was a hothead and removed himself from the situation to cool off implies that revenge is the most suitable option he didn't need to improve his emotional state or control his hotheaded tendencies. 4. Relating to the process of improvement: The question highlights Lance's efforts to improve by removing himself from the situation and cooling off. Choosing revenge as something he didn't need emphasizes his progress and implies that he is making an effort to move away from destructive behaviors like seeking revenge on others."},{"question":"Paragraph: Electric charge is a physical property. It occurs between particles or objects. It causes them to attract or repel each other. They do not even have to touch. This is unlike the typical push or pull you may be familiar with. All electric charge is based on the protons and electrons in atoms. A proton has a positive electric charge. An electron has a negative electric charge. Forces on Charged Objects Most atoms are balanced electrically. They have the same number of positive and negative charges. Therefore, the number of protons equals the number of electrons. Neutrons do not matter as they have no charge. When an object loses some electrons, it becomes positively charged. There are now more protons than electrons inside the atom. The lost electrons may remain free. Or, they may attach to another object. The new object now has more electrons than protons. It then becomes negatively charged.

They are a continuous range of highlands along the western edge of South America. This range is about long, about wide (widest between 18° south and 20° south latitude), and of an average height of about . The Andes extend from north to south through seven South American countries: Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina and Chile. - Bolivia (; ), officially known as the Plurinational State of Bolivia, is a landlocked country located in western-central South America. It is bordered to the north and east by Brazil, to the southeast by Paraguay, to the south by Argentina, to the southwest by Chile, and to the northwest by Peru. One-third of the country is the Andean mountain range, with one of its largest cities and principal economic centers, El Alto, located on the Altiplano. Bolivia is one of two landlocked countries (the other is Paraguay) that lie outside Afro-Eurasia. Bolivia is the largest landlocked country in the Americas. - Sullana is the name of the capital of the Sullana Province, in the north-western coastal plains of Peru on the Chira valley. - Ecuador, officially the Republic of Ecuador (which literally translates as \\"Republic of the Equator\\"), is a representative democratic republic in northwestern South America, bordered by Colombia on the north, Peru on the east and south, and the Pacific Ocean to the west. Ecuador also includes the Galápagos Islands in the Pacific, about west of the mainland. - The Amazon River (or ; Spanish and ) in South America is the largest river by discharge of water in the world, and according to some experts, the longest in length. The headwaters of the Apurímac River on Nevado Mismi had been considered for nearly a century as the Amazons most distant source, until a 2014 study found it to be the Cordillera Rumi Cruz at the headwaters of the Mantaro River in Peru. The Mantaro and Apurímac confluence, and with other tributaries form the Ucayali River, which in turn confluences with the Marañón River upstream of Iquitos, Peru, to form what countries other than Brazil consider to be the main stem of the Amazon. Brazilians call this section the Solimões River above its confluence with the Rio Negro to form what Brazilians call the Amazon at the Meeting of Waters at Manaus, the river's largest city.

Florida millionaire on trial for wife's death But prosecutors painted a very different picture, casting doubt on Ward's unruffled demeanor and what they characterized as his ever-changing story of what happened. \\"This case is about the fact that it was Bob Ward that shot her almost dead between the eyes,\\" said Assistant State Attorney Robin Wilkinson in her opening statement. She brought up the 911 call, placed at 7:50 p.m. that night, in which Ward called and flatly said, \\"I just shot my wife.\\" But later in the call, according to Wilkinson, he started to change his story: \\"It becomes an accident and he doesn't know what happened ... Diane just ended up on the floor.\\" According to the arrest affidavit from Orange County Sheriff's Office, the victim was found in the master bedroom -- \\"a large pool of blood at the top of her head (and) a .357 Magnum hand gun (in) the top drawer of a nightstand next to the bed.\\" Ward told police that the couple were the only ones in the house at the time, besides their four dogs. Wilkinson also brought up how Ward acted upon arriving at the police station, during which investigators described him as \\"calm, polite and not really in distress.\\" In several videos from an interrogation room -- which the prosecutor promised would be played in court -- Ward offered an array of stories in phone conversations with family and friends, from \\"It was a tragic accident\\" to \\"Diane killed herself.\\" The next day, medical examiner Joshua Stephany determined preliminarily that the mother of two college-age children had been killed in a homicide. Prosecutors, in opening statements, highlighted the financial troubles facing Ward -- who, along with his wife, had been set to testify in bankruptcy proceedings related to one of his companies a few days before the shooting.

Authorities have lost contact with an Air Algerie aircraft updated 07/24/2014 at 11:05 AM EDT An Air Algerie flight carrying 116 people from Burkina Faso to Algeria's capital disappeared from radar early Thursday over northern Mali and \\"probably crashed,\\" according to the plane's owner and government officials in France and Burkina Faso. that in a Twitter message, Air Algerie said that Flight 5017 apparently went down in the Tilemsi area, about 45 miles from the southeastern city of Gao. The airline also Tweeted that those onboard included 50 passengers from France, 27 from Burkina Faso, eight Lebanese, six Algerians, five Canadians, four Germans, two from Luxembourg, one from Mali, one Cameroonian, one Belgian, one Ukrainian, one Romanian and one Swiss. Air navigation services lost track of the MD-83 about 50 minutes after takeoff from Ouagadougou, the capital of Burkina Faso, at 0155 GMT (9:55 p.m. EDT Wednesday), the official Algerian news agency APS said. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said Air Algerie Flight 5017 had \\"probably crashed.\\" Fabius said \\"no trace\\" of the plane had been found. Two French fighter jets are among aircraft scouring the rugged north of Mali for the plane, which was traveling from Burkina Faso's capital, Ouagadougou, to Algiers, the Algerian capital. More than 50 French were onboard the plane along with 27 Burkina Faso nationals and passengers from a dozen other countries. The flight crew was Spanish. The flight was being operated by Spanish airline Swiftair, the company said in a statement. The Spanish pilots' union said the plane belonged to Swiftair. The plane sent its last message around 0130 GMT (9:30 p.m. EDT), asking Niger air control to change its route because of heavy rains in the area, Burkina Faso Transport Minister Jean Bertin Ouedraogo said. The disappearance of the Air Algerie plane comes after a spate of aviation disasters. Fliers around the globe have been on edge ever since Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared in March on its way to Beijing. Searchers have yet to find a single piece of wreckage from the jet with 239 people on board. Last week, a Malaysia Airlines flight was shot down by a surface-to-air missile while flying over a war-torn section of Ukraine. Nothing indicates the jet was the target, but two back-to-back disasters involving Boeing 777s flown by the same airline was too much of a coincidence for many fliers. Then this week, U.S. and European airlines started canceling flights to Tel Aviv after a rocket landed near the city's airport. Finally, on Wednesday, a Taiwanese plane crashed during a storm, killing 48 people. French Transport Minister Frederic Cuvillier said the Air Algerie flight vanished over northern Mali. He spoke Thursday from a crisis center set up in the French Foreign Ministry. Cuvillier didn't specify exactly where the plane disappeared over Mali, or whether it was in an area controlled by rebels. But Algerian Prime Minister Abdelmalek Sellal said on Algerian state television said that 10 minutes before disappearing, it was in contact with air traffic controllers in Gao, a city essentially under the control of the Malian government, though it has seen lingering separatist violence. The plane had been missing for hours before the news was made public. It wasn't immediately clear why airline or government officials didn't make it public earlier. The flight path of the plane from Ouagadougou to Algiers wasn't immediately clear. Ouagadougou is in a nearly straight line south of Algiers, passing over Mali where unrest continues in the north. Northern Mali fell under control of ethnic Tuareg separatists and then al-Qaida-linked Islamic extremists following a military coup in 2012. A French-led intervention last year scattered the extremists, but the Tuaregs have pushed back against the authority of the Bamako-based government. A senior French official said it seems unlikely that fighters in Mali had the kind of weaponry that could shoot down a plane. The MD-83 is part of a series of jets built since the early 1980s by McDonnell Douglas, a U.S. plane maker now owned by Boeing Co. The MD-80s were the workhorse of domestic air travel in the U.S. and are used for a flights of a few hours over land elsewhere. What is a short summary of the above article?","response":"An Air Algerie flight carrying 116 people disappeared from radar and probably crashed over northern Mali while traveling from Burkina Faso to Algeria's capital. The airline reported that passengers onboard included individuals from multiple countries, such as France, Burkina Faso, Lebanon, Algeria, Canada, Germany, Luxembourg, Mali, Cameroon, Belgium, Ukraine, Romania, and Switzerland. The plane lost contact 50 minutes after takeoff and had requested a route change due to heavy rains in the area.

Sign up here.** Buzz Cut: • Trump goes nuclear on Carson, Fiorina • Walker joins fall fashion trend with re-boot • Panic Time: Bernie now leads Hillary in Iowa and N.H. • Pressure mounts for more Dem debates • His Ben & Jerry’s flavor: Rocky Road Rage TRUMP GOES NUCLEAR ON CARSON, FIORINA Donald Trump has prospered as the conservative insurgencies human wrecking ball, smashing into establishment favorite Jeb Bush. But how will he fare in his fresh feuds with fellow outsiders Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina? A week ago Trump said he hoped Carson would “hit” him, because Trump “love[s] to counterpunch.” Does he ever. Carson, who is gaining fast on frontrunner Trump in a new poll today, took a mild shot at what Trump’s self-described “big league” Christian faith. Pressed by reporters during a campaign stop in Anaheim, Calif., to respond to Trump’scriticisms that Carson isn’t qualified to be president, the retired neurosurgeon initially declined. But when asked to contrast himself with the New York billionaire, Carson responded, “…I realize where my success has come from, and I don’t any way deny my faith in God,” said Carson. Carson went on to cite favorite scriptures that “humility and fear of the Lord are riches in honor and life,” saying that he didn’t get “that impression with” Trump. That was a swipe at Trump who bragged that he likely hadn’t ever felt the need to ask God’s forgiveness. On CNN today, Trump unloaded on Carson: “Look at his faith and you’re not going to find so much. And you look at his views on abortion which were horrendous, and that’s I think why I’m leading with all the evangelicals. I’m leading Ben Carson by a lot I’m almost double his numbers.” “But I don’t know Ben Carson, perhaps – you know – an okay doctor…we’re not talking about a great – he was an okay doctor.” “And now, because he’s a doctor and he hired one nurse, he’s going to end up being president of the United States?” “For him to read from the Bible in his memory, it looked like it memorized it about two minutes before he went on stage.” But Carson isn’t the only target of Trump’s wrath. Businesswoman Carly Fiorina, who also gained ground on Trump in CNN’s poll out today, got a dose too. In an interview with Rolling Stone Trump mocked Fiorina’s appearance: “‘Look at that face!’ he cries. ‘Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?!’ The laughter grows halting and faint behind him. ‘I mean, she’s a woman, and I’m not s’posedta say bad things, but really, folks, come on. Are we serious?’” Fiorina declined to respond in kind during an interview on “The Kelly File” saying instead, “I’m not going to spend a single cycle wondering what Donald Trump means. But maybe just maybe I’m getting under his skin a little bit because I’m climbing in the polls.” In a phone call to “Fox & Friends” today, Trump claimed he was not referring to her appearance but instead, “about persona.” But as Trump’s own comments to Rolling Stone make clear any disparagement of women’s appearances is a fraught subject for the GOP frontrunner. Trump did not, however, shy away from continuing to attack Fiorina’s record as a businesswoman and her qualifications to be president. Given the strong favorable views of Republicans voters towards Fiorina and Carson, Trump’s attack-dog approach with his fellow outsiders looks to be a much riskier gambit than his ceaseless trolling of the beleaguered Bush. WALKER JOINS FALL FASHION TREND WITH RE-BOOT AP: “Republican Scott Walker plans to talk about ‘wreaking havoc’ on Washington D.C. with a Thursday speech at the alma mater of former President Ronald Reagan. Walker's presidential campaign on Tuesday released excerpts of his speech to be delivered at Eureka College in Illinois. Walker is also expected to release weekly ‘day one’ promises that describe action he would plan to take on his first day as president. Walker has already said he will end the Iranian arms deal and propose repealing and replacing the federal health care law on his first day in office. The speech and weekly release of ‘day one’ promises comes as Walker is trying to regain ground after being among the top tier of Republican candidates, only to see his standing drop in recent polls.” [The Atlantic’s Molly Ball goes back to where it all began to look for Walker’s path forward: “For the past four years, Walker has dominated Wisconsin. His bold agenda shattered the status quo, he shocked the left and united the right, and he couldn’t be beat. Recalled in 2012, challenged in 2014, he kept on fighting and kept on winning. … For Wisconsinites accustomed to Walker’s dominance, his fall from glory nationally has been disorienting and out of character. Back home, he has always been focused, disciplined, on-message to a fault.”] Jeb gets a little Trump-y in tax plan - NYT: “Former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida challenged some long-held tenets of conservative tax policy on Wednesday by proposing to curtail valuable deductions that benefit businesses and the wealthy and eliminate a loophole that has benefited hedge fund and private equity managers for years. That an establishment Republican candidate has embraced such changes not only highlights how income inequality has altered the tenor of the presidential debate for the party, but also indicates the ideological pull Donald J. Trump’s candidacy is having on the Republican field after he made similar proposals.” [Bush will talk about his tax policy and hold a town hall in New Hampshire today.] Koch group applauds - Conservative group Freedom Partners praised the GOP candidates who have come out with detailed tax reform plans. President Marc Short said in a statement, “We applaud Governor Jeb Bush, as well as Senators Rand Paul and Marco Rubio, for providing detailed plans to lower rates, reduce corporate welfare and simplify the tax code.” Freedom Partners supports reducing tax rates, and ending corporate loopholes.

David Wildstein, a former Port Authority official and high-school classmate of Christie, pleaded guilty in May...

National Geographic brings today’s biggest science story of two recreational cave divers stumbling upon a new species of human ancestor called Homo naledi. Steven Tucker and Rick Hunter found a cave outside Johannesburg looking for a new adventure in an area known for fossil discoveries, and research. Although much of the area has been trodden over, Tucker and Hunter were hoping to find a new path or a less-explored area. In a narrow cave, barely big enough to fit them through, they found they would be far from disappointed, discovering what appeared to be a vast collection of human bones. But how did this cave collect so many bones? Is it possible that this species buried their dead in some way? Check out this deep read for an account of their findings here.

THE JUDGE’S RULING: TWO WRONGS DON’T MAKE A RIGHT Though he believes that the decision to incarcerate Kentucky court clerk Kim Davis wasn’t the right course of action, Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano says Davis’s argument in refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples because of her religious convictions is flawed: “The Free Exercise Clause guarantees individuals the lawful ability to practice their religion free from government interference. It does not permit those in government to use their offices to deny the rights of those who reject their beliefs. That is the lesson for Kim Davis.” Read here.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process The answer is:","response":"Indirectly impacting a step of the process. Step-by-step justification: 1. The given question states that if rocks break up less, it would lead to more soil erosion. This implies a change in the amount of rock breakdown. 2. Reviewing the process, the steps involve a plant growing near or on a rock, the plant roots growing and breaking apart the rock, plant acids dissolving parts of the rock, and erosion starting to occur as rocks break into more pieces. 3. The supposed perturbation is changing the amount of rock breakdown, which would impact the steps 'Break apart the rock' and 'The rocks are broken into more and more pieces'. However, these impacts aren't directly impacting erosion. 4. The connection between the perturbation and the outcome (more soil erosion) is indirect, as the change in rock breakdown affects later steps in the process that, in turn, affect erosion. The perturbation isn't completely unrelated to the process, as it still affects the rock breakdown and erosion steps, but the impact is through a multi-step dependency. 5.

He served as the governor from 1779 to 1781. During his term as governor, he faced several challenges, including invasions by the British. He was also pivotal in leading the effort of moving the state capital from Williamsburg to Richmond. Despite the contemporaneous difficulty, which later led to a political investigation, Jefferson managed to accomplish noteworthy societal reforms throughout his governorship. These included the abolishment of entail and primogeniture - inheritance laws that deeply favored the gentry - and the relaxation of naturalization laws to promote immigration. Thomas Jefferson's governorship preceded his presidency. After his term as governor, he went on to serve as U.S. minister to France before eventually becoming the third President of the United States. Notably, during his presidency, he authorized the famous Louisiana Purchase, which significantly expanded the territory of the United States. His influence and popularity were such that a newly-formed county in Kentucky chose to name it after him in 1780, a true testament to his long-standing impact on the nation. Thus, yes, Thomas Jefferson was indeed the Governor of Virginia."},{"question":"In this task, you are given a sentence from the Bible in Persian, and your task is to translate it into English. از عروعیر که بر کناره وادی ارنون است، و شهری که در وسط وادی است، و تمامی بیابان میدبا تا دیبون.","response":"To complete this task, I will first break down the sentence into smaller segments, identify the keywords, and then find their English equivalents.

Question: suppose more rocks available happens, how will it affect more cocoon hatches. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect The answer is:","response":"C: No effect The process of a larva transforming into a butterfly, also known as metamorphosis, comprises several distinct stages: the larval stage (caterpillar), the formation of a cocoon or chrysalis (pupa), and the eventual emergence of the adult butterfly. This remarkable natural occurrence is solely dependent on various biological and environmental factors essential for the insect's survival and growth. The presence or absence of rocks in the environment bears no direct influence on the number of cocoons a caterpillar forms or on the number of butterflies that emerge from these cocoons. This is because the primary factors affecting the butterfly's metamorphosis are the availability of food, temperature, and overall habitat quality. During the larval stage, the caterpillar consumes large amounts of food to grow and gather essential nutrients for the pupal stage. The quality and availability of food, mainly leaves from host plants, play a crucial role in the caterpillar's successful development. If there were an insufficient food supply, the caterpillar might not have enough energy to create a cocoon or survive the pupal phase. Once the caterpillar reaches its maximum size, it forms a cocoon or chrysalis to protect itself during the pupal stage. This is a highly vulnerable phase in which the insect experiences a dramatic transformation as its body reorganizes to form the adult butterfly. During this stage, proper environmental conditions such as stable temperature and humidity levels are vital, as extreme temperature fluctuations or desiccation could result in the death of the organism. Lastly, a suitable habitat is also critical for the adult butterfly's survival and eventual reproduction. A well-preserved habitat with an abundance of nectar-rich flowers provides the nourishment a butterfly needs to thrive, find a mate, and lay eggs, thereby completing the life cycle. In summary, the presence or absence of rocks in the caterpillar's environment has no direct impact on the number of cocoons formed or the number of hatched butterflies. Instead, factors such as the availability of food, proper environmental conditions, and a suitable habitat play a more significant role in determining the overall success of the butterfly's life cycle."},{"question":"Foradultmales,usingsexualboostcapsulesareapopulartechniquetoadvancesexualproblems.

But the Brackley-based outfit are happy with their current line-up and have no intention of breaking it up for the foreseeable future. Mercedes bosses also point out that, during his trip to the car factory, Zetsche stated he felt his team had the best driver line-up in F1 but that this was not reported by the media. Although Alonso, a double world champion, is widely admired as arguably the most complete driver in F1, many senior figures consider that he is difficult to work with and a potentially disruptive influence in a team. Alonso's relationship with Ferrari has been going through a strained period because of their failure to win the World Championship following the 32-year-old Spaniard's transfer from Renault in 2010. Mercedes have won every race in Formula 1 this season after producing a dominant car under the new rules that have introduced turbo-hybrid engines and a fuel-efficiency based set of regulations to the sport. Hamilton has won four races to Rosberg's one, but they are only separated by three points going into this weekend's race in Monaco. Reacting to the news, BBC F1 co-commentator David Coulthard told BBC Radio 5 live: \\"Nico's being rewarded for not only helping build the stability in the team over the last couple of seasons but also it gives him a platform to really have a clear head and take this World Championship battle head to head with his team-mate.\\" However, Coulthard believes Hamilton remains the team's number one driver. He explained: \\"The reality is you can only have one of your drivers standing on the top spot of the podium. \\"Lewis Hamilton has been brought in as a former world champion, as the one that they would have expected to really be leading the charge for another championship. \\"No disrespect to Nico but we've seen Lewis and Fernando go head to head before at McLaren and it didn't work. \\"We've seen Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost within a team together as well and that didn't work. \\"Ideally you have two number ones but there's always going to be one of them that's slightly stronger.\\" Monaco Grand Prix full coverage details What is a summary of this text?","response":"This is a story about a race car driver named Nico Rosberg. He is 28 years old and he signed a new contract with his team, Mercedes. That means he will stay with the team for more years. The team is very happy with Nico and another driver named Lewis Hamilton. They have both won many races and helped the team become very good. Some people thought Mercedes might try to get another driver named Fernando Alonso, but the team is happy with Nico and Lewis as their drivers."},{"question":"Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context (see options)?

The following aspects contribute to this perception: 1. The term \\"endless assault\\" implies that the script is filled with an unceasing barrage of sex jokes, likely to the point of discomfort or annoyance for the reader or audience. The word \\"assault\\" itself carries negative connotations, suggesting that the jokes are intrusive and unwelcome. 2. The use of the adverb \\"embarrassingly\\" adds another layer of negativity, indicating that the sex jokes are not just excessive, but also cringe-worthy. This further suggests that they are poorly executed or may make the audience uncomfortable. 3. The compound modifier \\"ham-fisted\\" reinforces the negative sentiment. This term implies that the jokes are awkwardly or clumsily constructed, lacking in subtlety or finesse. It suggests incompetence on the part of the scriptwriter and adds to the overall impression that the sex jokes are poorly executed and inappropriate. 4. The focus on \\"sex jokes\\" as the principal subject of the sentence contributes to the negative sentiment as well. By highlighting this specific type of humor, the writer emphasizes the script's reliance on crude, lowbrow humor, instead of more sophisticated or clever comedic elements. In summary, the sentence would be perceived as expressing a highly negative sentiment towards the script it is referring to. The combined effect of the phrase \\"endless assault,\\" along with the adjectives \\"embarrassingly\\" and \\"ham-fisted,\\" paint a picture of a script that is excessively reliant on poorly executed and inappropriate sex jokes, likely resulting in an overall negative experience for the audience."},{"question":"Q: A piece of text from one of these 5 languages - French, English, Dutch, Somali, Tagalog is given.

This Burke did in April 1791 when he published A Letter to a Member of the National Assembly. Burke called for external forces to reverse the revolution and included an attack on the late French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, as being the subject of a personality cult that had developed in revolutionary France. Although Burke conceded that Rousseau sometimes showed \\"a considerable insight into human nature\\" he mostly was critical. Although he did not meet Rousseau on his visit to Britain in 1766–7 Burke was a friend of David Hume, with whom Rousseau had stayed. Burke said Rousseau \\"entertained no principle either to influence of his heart, or to guide his understanding—but vanity\\"—which he \\"was possessed to a degree little short of madness\\". He also cited Rousseau's Confessions as evidence that Rousseau had a life of \\"obscure and vulgar vices\\" that was not \\"chequered, or spotted here and there, with virtues, or even distinguished by a single good action\\". Burke contrasted Rousseau's theory of universal benevolence and his having sent his children to a foundling hospital: \\"a lover of his kind, but a hater of his kindred\\".\\" Answer:","response":"To assess the extent of Jean-Jacques Rousseau's vanity, it is essential to consider Edmund Burke's criticisms and observations as outlined in the given context. Step 1: Analyze Burke's critique of Rousseau - Burke asserts that Rousseau was mostly driven by vanity, which was so excessive that it bordered on madness. - According to Burke, Rousseau lacked principles to influence his heart or guide his understanding. - Burke refers to Rousseau's \\"Confessions\\" as evidence of a life filled with \\"obscure and vulgar vices\\" and devoid of virtues or good actions. Step 2: Consider the influence of Rousseau's personality cult - Revolutionary France saw the rise of a personality cult around Rousseau, which could have contributed to an inflated sense of self-importance. Step 3: Evaluate Rousseau's actions in light of his philosophical theories - Burke mentions the contradiction between Rousseau's theory of universal benevolence and his decision to send his children to a foundling hospital, which suggests a disconnect between his beliefs and actions. Step 4: Consider potential biases in Burke's viewpoint - It is necessary to acknowledge that Burke had a strong opposition to the French Revolution and thus could have had a biased perspective towards Rousseau, a figure embraced by revolutionary France. - Burke was a friend of David Hume, with whom Rousseau had a tumultuous relationship. This connection might have influenced Burke's perspective on Rousseau. Taking these factors into account, it can be concluded that Jean-Jacques Rousseau exhibited a significant degree of vanity, as evidenced by Burke's criticisms and the personality cult that developed around him. However, it is essential to keep in mind that Burke's perspective may have been influenced by his opposition to the French Revolution and his connection to David Hume, potentially affecting the extent to which Rousseau's vanity is portrayed."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: This article's plot summary may be too long or excessively detailed.

(August 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In 1966, numerous pirate radio stations broadcast to the United Kingdom from ships anchored in international waters, specialising in rock and pop music that is not played on BBC Radio. Seventeen-year-old Carl (Tom Sturridge), recently expelled from school, is sent to stay with his godfather Quentin (Bill Nighy), who runs the station \\"Radio Rock\\" anchored in the North Sea. The eclectic crew of disc jockeys and staffers, led by the brash American DJ \\"The Count\\" (Philip Seymour Hoffman), quickly accept Carl as one of their own. At the start of the film Doctor Dave (Nick Frost) and Carl conspire to have Carl lose his virginity. Dave has his girlfriend get naked and lie in bed for him while he turns off the lights and goes into the bathroom, where has has Carl hidden. Carl then gets naked and walks into the dark room in an attempt to deceive Dave's girlfriend. However she turns the lights on and sees who was really about to have sex with her, and Carl gets embarrassed and leaves. In London, government minister Sir Alistair Dormandy (Kenneth Branagh) resolves to shut down pirate radio stations due to their commercialism and low morals, instructing his subordinate Twatt (Jack Davenport) to find legal loopholes that will serve this end. They attempt to cut off the stations' revenue by prohibiting British businesses from advertising on unlicensed radio stations. Quentin counters this by bringing massively popular DJ Gavin Kavanagh (Rhys Ifans) out of retirement and onto Radio Rock, enticing his advertisers to work around the law by paying their bills from abroad. Gavin's popularity creates a rivalry between himself and The Count, who was initially brought to Radio Rock as Gavin's replacement.

Seeing the value in critical feedback and the lessons that failure can offer is a tough pill to swallow. For those confident in their capabilities, their social standing (in their companies/communities etc), and their abilities, the pill goes down a little easier. For those who experience imposter syndrome, feel insecure about their work, or are new in their careers, it is more difficult. Here’s the thing: these are not binary personalities. While some people are overly confident about themselves, and some people are overly insecure about themselves, most people have a blend of both. As such, even the most confident people can feel the sting when they get critical feedback or screw something up. This is a guide with some things I have learned over the years about how to turn feedback and failure to your advantage. In my not-so-humble opinion, the perfect blend of a human being is confidence in their ability to execute and accomplish their goals, but with a healthy dose of awareness of their current limitations. Let’s face it, overly confident people are often not just at risk of being swallowed up by ego, but can also lack the empathy to understand other folks they need to work with who don’t share the same confidence. An understanding of our current limitations is healthy. When we understand we are not great at something, but we are eager to learn and improve, it opens us up to counsel and tuition. The confidence piece plays an important role in helping us to remember: “I might suck now, but I am going to learn and get better”. When we have this in our heads it makes the journey more palatable: we know that our failure to succeed right now is temporary and it will improve. The writer believes that - people should learn - people should isten - not enough information - people should take feedback Answer:","response":"Embracing failure and accepting critical feedback play a crucial role in personal and professional growth. The right balance between self-confidence and the awareness of one's limitations is essential to make the most out of such opportunities for self-improvement. Here's how feedback and failure can be turned into advantages: 1. Cultivate a growth mindset: A growth mindset emphasizes the belief that skills and abilities can be improved over time. By adopting this perspective, you will be more open to learning from your mistakes and using feedback as a catalyst for growth. 2. Practice active listening: When receiving feedback, listen carefully without being defensive. This will allow you to genuinely understand the other person's perspective and take their advice into account in your future work. 3. Reflect on your experiences: Take the time to ponder on feedback you've received or past failures. Analyze what went wrong, identify areas for improvement, and develop a plan to address these shortcomings. 4. Focus on your strengths: Recognize your strengths and leverage them to overcome your weaknesses. By focusing on your strong points, you can develop the confidence needed to tackle your limitations and be more receptive to critical feedback. 5. Develop resilience: Understand that failure is a natural part of the learning process. By building resilience, you'll be able to bounce back more quickly from setbacks and maintain your motivation to keep learning and growing. 6. Foster a supportive and open environment: Encourage open communication within teams to promote the sharing of ideas, constructive criticism, and opportunities for learning. This will create a culture where feedback is not only welcome but actively sought after. 7. Manage your emotions: It's easy to feel hurt by negative feedback or failure. However, learning to manage your emotions and respond positively to such situations can help you stay focused on your goals and continue to grow. 8. Seek mentorship: Find experienced professionals who can provide guidance, support, and constructive criticism as you progress in your career. Their advice and feedback will be invaluable in helping you improve your skills and navigate challenges. By employing these techniques, you can make feedback and failure work to your advantage. Combining self-confidence with an understanding of your limitations creates a productive environment for learning and improvement, fostering personal and professional growth."},{"question":"Denny asked: Given the sentence \\"A boy is jumping off the side of a running stone water fountain in front of a building.\\" can we conclude that \\"The building is tall.\\"?

(T) is refining its retail strategy with its first flagship store, a location on Chicago’s Michigan Avenue that goes beyond phones and tablets to show services such as fitness applications and “smartcar” features. The 10,000-square-foot (929-square-meter) store, opening Sept. 1 in the shopping mecca known as Chicago’s “Magnificent Mile,” is three times larger than the average of the company’s 2,300 retail outlets. Located across the street from Coach Inc. and Cartier Ltd. stores, it has cement floors, white plastic and reclaimed teak furniture with more than 100 video displays. With the loss of its exclusive agreement to sell Apple Inc. (AAPL)’s iPhone and a saturated wireless market that makes it hard to find new subscribers, Dallas-based AT&T is planning to use its stores to gain an edge against Verizon Wireless, Sprint Nextel Corp. (S) and T-Mobile USA Inc. The move also pits AT&T against the standard-bearer in consumer-electronics retail, Apple itself. “We are very different than Apple,” Paul Roth, AT&T’s president of retail sales and services, said in an interview. “In their stores, the product is the hero. This store is all about the experience.” The second-biggest U.S. wireless carrier is looking for ways to show investors it’s a bargain. Investors are getting a 29 percent discount for AT&T compared to its telecommunications peers on a price-to-earnings basis, up from 18 percent at the end of last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. AT&T shares fell 0.4 percent to 36.69 today in New York. No Shadowing Roth’s plan is to blend the hands-on approach of Apple stores with a visually dazzling environment. He’s requiring sales staff to greet visitors within 10 seconds or 10 feet after they’ve entered the store, to make them welcome without shadowing them, he said. Emulating Apple doesn’t guarantee success. Nike Inc. (NKE), Nokia Oyj (NOK1V), Microsoft Corp. and Sony Corp. have each tested the brand- centered retail approach, with mixed results. Nokia, the Espoo, Finland-based mobile-phone maker, has shut stores in New York, Chicago, London and Mexico City in the past three years after starting its own retail chain in 2005. AT&T has tried to give its store a customer-friendly makeover before. In 2007, it opened its first “AT&T Experience” store, a 5,000-square-foot Houston location with sales kiosks and product demonstrations. App Lounge The Chicago flagship goes beyond the Experience concept, which AT&T has dropped. At the front of the new store is an 18- foot wall of video screens and an App Lounge where people can use 55-inch monitors to test apps for Apple products or for Google Inc.’s Android system. The shop’s open layout has a series of “boutiques” where customers can see demonstrations on how to prepare for the Chicago Marathon or examine the texting safety features on a Nissan Leaf. “Customers are overwhelmed by technology,” Roth said. “They want to know less about the device and more about what it can do for them.” The store has 40 employees with as many as 30 on the sales floor at one time, Roth said. There are no cash registers, with staff using tablets or smartphones to make sales. Flagship stores help companies immerse their customers in everything they have to offer, said Michael Cote, a wireless strategist with the Cote Collaborative in Chicago. “These are branding opportunities more than retail outlets,” Cote said. “And what’s important here is that AT&T will be the first carrier to have an ‘experiential’ flagship store on the Magnificent Mile.” Verizon Overhaul Verizon Wireless, which has a store about two blocks away from AT&T on Michigan Avenue, has started an overhaul of its stores to keep up with the trend in retail toward giving customers more access to sample devices. The nation’s largest wireless carrier plans to have 60 stores outfitted this year with a new look featuring white interiors with blond wood, fewer counters separating staff from customers and products displayed on tables instead of walls, said Thomas Pica, a Verizon Wireless spokesman. The Basking Ridge, New Jersey-based company hasn’t designated a flagship store, he said. Sprint has had a flagship site in New York, prominently located on the first floor of the angular Flatiron Building, since 1997. Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) unit T-Mobile’s flagship is also in New York, near Times Square. The model for success with a self-branded store is Cupertino, California-based Apple, said Lee Peterson, executive vice president of creative services at WD Partners, a retail strategy and design company based in Dublin, Ohio. “There’s no magic bullet,” said Peterson, whose clients include Best Buy Co. and Samsung Electronics Co. “Gimmickry doesn’t work. Lounges don’t work. We try to convince clients that it’s what the salesperson knows about the customer and the product that matters.” Apple, which had 372 stores around the world at the end of June, is preparing to introduce the next version of the iPhone on Sept. 12, two people with knowledge of the company’s plans said last month.

There was a time when AT&T controlled the world–or at least iPhones. Before too long, however, AT&T had lost its exclusive on Apple’s category-crushing product, and a loosely organized association of Android phones clouded consumer preference again. So what does AT&T do now? They’re no longer the only carrier with the most coveted phone. Their net income is up and customer churn has been low, but its biggest tactical advantage has been squandered. Now it’s time to take this battle to the street. Specifically, Chicago’s busy Michigan Avenue. That’s where, this weekend, following a few years of planning, AT&T is opening its first ever flagship store. There, as 60,000 people per day pass by Cartier, Louis Vuitton, and Coach, they’ll see AT&T’s new 10,000-square-foot retail mecca, a store that AT&T hopes to “bring life to the brand,” according to store manager Christina Cheng. View the Tour Here Upon entering the store, you’ll first see an atrium ringed with LEDs. Employees will be on hand to greet all the customers, I’m told, because AT&T’s focus groups have discovered that it’s personal greetings that make customers feel welcome–not architectural bells and whistles. Even customers carrying phones from Verizon and T-Mobile can play with a nearby touchscreen table loaded with AT&T’s favorite apps. Just click a category, preview the page, and then download it on your smartphone through Bluetooth, QR code, or a simple URL. advertisement Tucked in a corner nearby, a stage backed by a small tower of LCDs allows customers to play head-to-head, Kinect-style motion games. Does this have much of anything to do with AT&T itself? Not really, but it supports “a vibe of exploration” Cheng tells me. This stage will double as a place for both product announcements and presentations from local app developers. That area is just an iPhone’s throw from a (shorter) electronics table featuring apps and gadgets for kids. The App Bar is in the same vicinity, staffed by App Tenders. Unlike Apple’s Genius Bar–the clear line of inspiration here–these staffers don’t handle any serious problems. Rather, they suggest apps based on your tastes, “like your local barista would recommend something for you,” Cheng says. Again, it reinforces the casualness of the store–it’s so casual, in fact, that it doesn’t even have a checkout counter. Employees ring up customers at mobile terminals. The deeper diagnostic work is tucked in the back, a series of cozy tables for one-on-one conversations, all wrapped in a studio space filled with large splash walls of Chicago designers who’ve designed limited edition, custom cases only available at AT&T’s flagship. It’d be easy to simply label the whole experience an Apple Store clone. And indeed, you do feel Cupertino’s influences, from the App Bar to the expansive open tables full of electronics. But if the Apple Store feels like a modern museum that you’re free to touch, AT&T’s flagship feels more like a rich person’s basement loaded with toys. The store is one wood-burning oven away from doubling as a high-end pizza and wine bar. I’m also reminded a bit of REI as I walk past the Lifestyle Boutiques–tables dedicated to particular interests, like health and fitness, productivity, and photography/sharing. Cheng tells me that she’s staffing these tables with knowledgeable experts (much like the staff at REI always seems to be scraping the mud off their boots before walking into work). A former photojournalist will introduce shoppers to their photography peripherals. A certified personal trainer will be discussing Fitbits and tablet connectivity. Across the store, AT&T has set up its Experience Platform, which is pretty much a big budget CES booth come to life. Each space represents part of a consumer’s life, from a Nissan Leaf parked in the corner, which shoppers can enter and play with in-car phone connectivity, to a model kitchen outfitted with AT&T’s beta home automation software, to a four-couched living room set up, filled with Xbox 360s and AT&T U-verse. advertisement “If you don’t have this area, [our services are] just a list,” Cheng explains. “For this much a month you can do this, or for this much a month you can do that.’” Instead, shoppers can actually sit on a couch, try out fiber-optic cable and beam content to sample phones and tablets that they’re simply handed, completely untethered, to test out and try new techniques. To the skeptic, it’s a lot of empty demo space in a premium retail strip that rents for 450 a square foot. “Our main focus is not sales,” Cheng explains. “Our traditional metrics may not work for here, but we’ll be successful in other ways.” She may be right. It’s in the Experience Platform–this floor space-swallowing digital mise en scene–that you really see AT&T’s plan with its flagship, to sell their current and future services, not as a promise of another new iPhone and faster data, but as platform-agnostic interconnectivity. It’s driving to work. It’s making dinner. It’s digital idealism free from the bounds of any phone, but very closely tied to AT&T itself. So imagine my surprise when I’ve circled the mega boutique store and notice, for the first time, all of AT&T’s actual phones are on display. They’re sitting on a series of tables, splitting the grand room right down the middle–positioned in an obvious yet surely overlooked spot, the physical and metaphorical backbone of the store. Check out more images of AT&T’s Chicago flagship store here. |||||Summary:","response":"AT&T is opening its first flagship store on Chicago's Michigan Avenue, shifting the retail experience to go beyond selling phones and tablets to showcasing services such as fitness applications and \\"smartcar\\" features.

Originally entitled Bitter Life , it was published when the author was 16 . It is the follow - up to In the Forests of the Night , which she wrote at the age of 13 . The title refers Edgar Allan Poe 's poem \`\` Alone '' , which appears in the beginning of the book . The novel was an ALA Quick Pick . The Bulletin of the Center for Children 's Books remarked that it is \`\` A fast - paced vampire novel '' , while Publishers Weekly has said that \`\` readers will drain ... in one big gulp \`\` . The Bulletin calls it '' a fast - paced vampire novel with an anti-Buffy heroine and a studly vampire who are n't going to let a little thing like death stand between them . \`\` - The vrykolakas (Greek , pronounced ), variant vorvolakas or vourdoulakas, is a harmful undead creature in Greek folklore. It has similarities to many different legendary creatures, but is generally equated with the vampire of the folklore of the neighbouring Slavic countries. While the two are very similar, blood-drinking is only marginally associated with the \\"vrykolakas\\". - Shroud usually refers to an item, such as a cloth, that covers or protects some other object. The term is most often used in reference to \\"burial sheets\\", mound shroud, grave clothes, winding-cloths or winding-sheets, such as the famous Shroud of Turin or \\"Tachrichim\\" (burial shrouds) that Jews are dressed in for burial. Traditionally, mound shrouds are made of white cotton, wool or linen, though any material can be used so long as it is made of natural fibre. Intermixture of two or more such fibres is forbidden, a proscription that ultimately derives from the Torah, \\"viz.\\", Deut. 22:11. - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction. - Detective fiction is a subgenre of crime fiction and mystery fiction in which an investigator or a detectiveeither professional or amateurinvestigates a crime, often murder. - A novel is a long narrative, normally in prose, which describes fictional characters and events, usually in the form of a sequential story. - A vampire is a being from folklore who subsists by feeding on the life essence (generally in the form of blood) of the living. In European folklore, vampires were undead beings that often visited loved ones and caused mischief or deaths in the neighbourhoods they inhabited when they were alive. They wore shrouds and were often described as bloated and of ruddy or dark countenance, markedly different from today's gaunt, pale vampire which dates from the early 19th century. Although vampiric entities have been recorded in most cultures, the term \\"vampire\\" was not popularized in the West until the early 18th century, after an influx of vampire superstition into Western Europe from areas where vampire legends were frequent, such as the Balkans and Eastern Europe, although local variants were also known by different names, such as \\"shtriga\\" in Albania, \\"vrykolakas\\" in Greece and \\"strigoi\\" in Romania. This increased level of vampire superstition in Europe led to mass hysteria and in some cases resulted in corpses actually being staked and people being accused of vampirism. - Romania is a sovereign state located in Southeastern Europe. It borders the Black Sea, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Hungary, Serbia, and Moldova. It has an area of and a temperate-continental climate. With 19.94 million inhabitants, the country is the seventh-most-populous member state of the European Union. The capital and largest city, Bucharest, with its 1,883,425 inhabitants is the sixth-largest city in the EU. - Edgar Allan Poe (born Edgar Poe; January 19, 1809 October 7, 1849) was an American writer, editor, and literary critic. Poe is best known for his poetry and short stories, particularly his tales of mystery and the macabre. He is widely regarded as a central figure of Romanticism in the United States and American literature as a whole, and he was one of the country's earliest practitioners of the short story. Poe is generally considered the inventor of the detective fiction genre and is further credited with contributing to the emerging genre of science fiction. He was the first well-known American writer to try to earn a living through writing alone, resulting in a financially difficult life and career. - Amelia Holt Atwater-Rhodes (born April 16, 1984), known professionally as Amelia Atwater-Rhodes, is an American author of fantasy and young adult literature. - In the Forests of the Night is a vampire novel written by Amelia Atwater-Rhodes, and published in 1999. Originally entitled White Wine, she wrote it at the age of thirteen. The book was published on May 11, 1999, about a month after she turned fifteen. It is the first novel in the Den of Shadows. It tells the story of a three-hundred-year-old vampire named Risika and her struggles throughout her life, both before and after she was transformed. The novel is told in first-person narrative by the protagonist, Risika. It was well received by critics. - Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction. - Folklore is the body of expressive culture shared by a particular group of people; it encompasses the traditions common to that culture, subculture or group. These include oral traditions such as tales, proverbs and jokes. They include material culture, ranging from traditional building styles to handmade toys common to the group. Folklore also includes customary lore, the forms and rituals of celebrations like Christmas and weddings, folk dances and initiation rites. Each one of these, either singly or in combination, is considered a folklore artifact. Just as essential as the form, folklore also encompasses the transmission of these artifacts from one region to another or from one generation to the next. For folklore is not taught in a formal school curriculum or studied in the fine arts. Instead these traditions are passed along informally from one individual to another either through verbal instruction or demonstration. The academic study of folklore is called folkloristics. - The undead are beings in mythology, legend, or fiction that are deceased but behave as if alive. A common example of an undead being is a corpse re-animated by supernatural forces, by the application of the deceased's own life force, or that of another being (such as a demon). The undead may be incorporeal like ghosts, or corporeal like vampires and zombies. The undead are featured in the belief systems of most cultures, and appear in many works of fantasy and horror fiction. The term is also occasionally used for putative non-supernatural cases of re-animation, from early experiments like Robert E. Cornish's to future sciences such as cryonics and chemical brain preservation. What object entity has the relation of 'series' with the subject 'demon in my view'?

Look for an increase in anxiety-related behaviors. It's common for children to start having difficulty with everyday life after experiencing a trauma. They may resist things like bedtime, attending school, or spending time with friends. Their performance in school might slip and they may experience behavioral regression. Take note of anything that's become a problem after a traumatic event. The child may feel lost without a person they trust, or a favorite object like a toy, blanket, or stuffed animal. A traumatized child may become extremely upset if this person or object is not with them, because they feel unsafe. Children who have experienced a trauma may develop separation anxiety from parents or caregivers and fear being apart from them. Some children withdraw and \\"disconnect\\" from family or friends instead, preferring to be alone. Children who have been traumatized may have difficulty falling or staying asleep, or resist bedtime. They may be afraid to sleep alone at night, with the light off or in their own room. They may have an increase in nightmares, night terrors, or bad dreams. The child may ask questions about if it will happen again, or ask about taking steps to prevent it (such as repeatedly asking people to drive safely after a car accident). Reassurance from adults is unlikely to soothe their fears. Some children may obsess over preventing the event in the future, such as constantly checking the smoke alarm after a house fire. This may turn into Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. Children might replay the event repeatedly in their art or play, like drawing the event over and over again, or repeatedly crashing toy cars into things. Adults were not able to protect them in the past, so they might reason \\"who can?\\" and decide that nobody can keep them safe. They may not believe adults who try to assure them. If a child has been traumatized, they may have difficulty trusting others as a defense mechanism, as they're unable to view other people or places as safe. A child who was abused by an adult may start fearing other adults. For example, a girl who was hurt by a tall, blond man may be afraid of her tall, blond uncle because he looks similar to the man who hurt her. If a child experienced a traumatic event in a specific location, they may avoid or become fearful of the place in question. Some children may be able to tolerate it with help from a loved one or security object, but be unable to bear being left there alone. For example, a child abused by a therapist may scream and cry if they see the therapy building, and may panic if they even hear the word \\"therapy.\\" The child may blame themselves for the traumatic event because of something they did, said, or thought. These fears are not always rational; the child may blame themselves for a situation in which they did nothing wrong, and could not have made things any better. This may lead to obsessive-compulsive behavior. For example, maybe a boy and his sister were playing in the dirt when the traumatic event happened, and now he feels the need to keep everyone perfectly clean and away from dirt. A traumatized child may feel alienated, and may be uncertain how to interact normally with others, or not interested. Or, they may want to talk about or replay the traumatic event, which could annoy or upset other children. A child who has been traumatized may struggle with friendships and appropriate dynamics. They may become extremely passive towards their peers, or try to control or bully them. Other children withdraw, feeling unable to connect to their peers. Children who have been sexually abused may try to mimic the abuse in their play, so it's important to watch how a child plays with peers after trauma. Trauma can result in hypervigilance and the child may always be \\"on guard\\". A child may become afraid of wind, rain or sudden loud noises, or seem fearful or aggressive if someone gets too close to them. Children who have been traumatized tend to develop new fears, and may talk or worry about them extensively. It may seem like nothing can soothe the fear and reassure them that they're safe. For example, if the child experienced a natural disaster or is a refugee, the child may talk about worries that their family will not be safe, or will not have anywhere to live. A traumatized child may obsess over their family's safety and try to protect their family. A suicidal child may start talking a lot about death, give away items, withdraw from social activities, and talk about what you will do after they are dead. After a trauma, some children fixate on death and may talk or read about it excessively, even if they aren't necessarily suicidal. If there was a death in the family, talking about death isn't always a sign of suicidality. Sometimes, it's just a sign that they're trying to understand death and mortality. Still, if it is happening a lot, it may be worth investigating if something is wrong. If you think there may be problems, take your child to a psychologist or psychiatrist. Watch your child's eating habits, sleep, mood, and concentration. If any of these change dramatically or seem unusual, it's best to investigate it. Trauma can mimic other conditions. For example, some children become hyper, impulsive, and unable to concentrate after experiencing a trauma, which is frequently mistaken for ADHD. Others may seem defiant or aggressive, which can be misconstrued as simple behavioral problems. If something's wrong, get a professional involved.","response":"When a kid goes through something really scary or bad, we call it a trauma. After that event, they can act very different than before. They might get more worried and scared, even when doing regular stuff like going to bed or playing with friends. They also might not do as well in school and want to be by themselves. They might keep playing the scary event over and over with their toys or drawings, and they might not feel safe anymore, even with grown-ups around. They might get really nervous being apart from their parents or caregivers, and get really scared about doing different things. They might have trouble sleeping and have lots of bad dreams. Sometimes they'll keep asking about the scary event, asking if it'll happen again or how to stop it from happening. Sometimes, they get really scared of certain things that remind them about the trauma, like people who look like someone who hurt them, or places where something bad happened. They might also start feeling that they did something wrong and it was their fault that the bad thing happened, even if it wasn't. After a trauma, a kid might feel different even when playing with friends. They might act very passive or might try to control their friends. Sometimes, they become really alert, and they might get scared from things like loud noises. They may worry a lot about their family's safety, and sometimes, even start talking a lot about death. So, if your kid experienced a trauma and started acting very different, it's important to get help from a doctor or a psychiatrist. They could tell you if your kid is having trouble because of the trauma or if it's something else.

IT’S not hard to understand why Puritan settlers in Connecticut slapped the Devil’s name on so many ridges, rivers and gorges. These barren areas were probably so difficult to farm or even traverse that they might have seemed cursed. The settlers of Weston, a town in Fairfield County 50 miles from Manhattan, appear to have been similarly motivated in naming Devil’s Den, a section near Redding. Yet although the rolling terrain might once have engendered superstition, it is now embraced as a sprawling 1,720-acre preserve hugely popular with hikers. Early European arrivals were also responsible for many of the 50 or so dams in Weston, which they used to mill grain and lumber. The waterfall from one cascades down the West Branch of the Saugatuck River by the terrace of the Cobb’s Mill Inn, one of the town’s few businesses until its recent closure. There is another waterfall on a stony slope at the corner of Weston and River Roads. A third, resembling a veil, can be seen along Old Redding Road. Picturesque as they are, however, today the dams are viewed as a potential environmental hazard. They present a barrier to the spawning grounds of certain indigenous fish — alewife, for instance, which swim upstream to lay their eggs. As a result, a partnership led by the state Nature Conservancy and made up of officials from Weston and nearby towns, the state Department of Environmental Protection and the local water company has embarked on a mission to remove some of the dams or equip them with fish channels. One of these detours is in Weston, with another planned for Hasen Pond Dam on Lyons Plain Road, which once provided power for the Bradley Edge Tool Company, a maker of axes. Rob Denkin, who recently relocated to Weston from California, appreciates this kind of conservation-mindedness — especially as it has influenced the town to preserve about 5 of its 21 square miles of land as open space. Part of the reason for his move to the East Coast, Mr. Denkin said, was so that his daughter, Sierra, could be closer to her grandparents, who live in nearby Westport. (Sierra got her name from the Sierra Nevada mountains, where her father and mother, Jennifer, fell in love.) He picked Weston over other enclaves because of its generous two-acre zoning. On the West Coast, he treasured his frequent camping trips to other Sierra mountains, near Lake Tahoe, and an overly paved suburb was the last thing he wanted, he said. Yet when Mr. Denkin, a psychologist, first saw his four-bedroom Weston contemporary house up close, he recalls it as having almost too much nature going on. Because the house was in foreclosure and had sat empty for months, the branches of a tree had been left to all but envelop the roof. “I guess I’m crazy, but I was able to see past all of it,” said Mr. Denkin, who paid 430,000 for the property in 2009 and then spent 100,000 to replace cracked tiles and leaking sunroom windows, and remove that errant tree. And the investment seems smart. Last year, while Mr. Denkin prepared for his move back East, he rented out the house, during which time somebody was impressed enough with it to make a 700,000 offer. When there are so many trees in a place removing a few can sometimes be beneficial, particularly if selling the wood can help out poorer members of the community, said Dawn Egan, a resident who heads the nonprofit Weston Warm-Up Fund. The fund defrays heating bills for people who can’t afford to pay them, Ms. Egan said, adding that this winter it dispersed 100,000 in aid to 52 homes. One way the fund raises money is to cut down oak trees on Ms. Egan’s 22-acre property so that they can be sold as firewood, last year netting 8,000. Ms. Egan has sworn off heating oil for her own custom-built 10,000-square-foot Queen Anne-style house, relying instead on eight geothermal wells. They did represent a substantial chunk of the 5.5 million cost of the home, she acknowledged. But putting them in was “the right thing to do, and good for the environment.” Unlike many communities in Fairfield County, Weston lacks a central town green, as its first European residents, who came from nearby Fairfield, generally lived on scattered farms. And change comes slowly. Its population is 10,200 — almost the same as it was a decade ago. Despite its abundance of streams and rivers, the town never was a place of large-scale manufacturing like nearby Georgetown or Danbury. The housing stock reflects its agricultural past: the style of choice is the stoic white colonial, set back behind loose-fitting stone walls, though often outfitted with modern amenities like three-car garages.

The people who first lived there named a section of the town \\"Devil's Den\\" because the land was not good for farming. Today, a big part of the land has been preserved as open space, with lots of trees and trails for people to enjoy. Some of the old dams in the town have been changed to help protect the environment and the fish that live there. The people in Weston care about their community and try to help each other, like helping families who can't pay their heating bills during winter.

Initial Statement: \\"A man with stretched earlobes wearing a black hat stands in front of a display of food for sale.\\" Core Components: 1. A man 2. Stretched earlobes 3. Wearing a black hat 4. Stands in front of a display 5. Display of food for sale (food display) Derived Statement: \\"A man stands by a food display.\\" Core Components: 1. A man 2. Stands by a display 3. Food display Let's analyze the relationship between the initial statement's components and the derived statement's components. 1. \\"A man\\" is present in both statements, confirming that the subject of the situation is, indeed, a man. 2. \\"Stretched earlobes\\" and \\"wearing a black hat\\" are descriptors of the man's appearance in the initial statement. However, these details are irrelevant to the conclusion that a man is standing by a food display. The derived statement's focus is on the man's placement by the food display, not his appearance. 3. The initial statement mentions that the man \\"stands in front of a display of food for sale.\\" This phrasing indicates the man's position relative to the food display. The derived statement simplifies this by stating the man \\"stands by a food display.\\" Although the derived statement does not explicitly say \\"for sale,\\" it can still be inferred, as it does not contradict the initial statement. 4. Finally, the core component \\"food display\\" is present in both statements. It denotes the object with which the man is interacting – he is standing near or by the food display. In summary, the initial statement's core components are aligned with the derived statement, albeit with a few minor changes to simplify the passage. The derived statement \\"A man stands by a food display\\" maintains the primary focus on the man's position near the food display, making this a logically sound conclusion based on the given information."},{"question":"Parliament will only decide how much money is available in a particular administrative area.

Parlamentin, kuten Suomen eduskunnan, keskeinen rooli on säätää lakeja ja budjetteja. Päätökset budjettivarojen käytöstä tehdään yleensä vuosittain, ja ne kattavat esimerkiksi valtion menot ja tulot, rahan jakautumisen eri hallinnon aloille ja painopistealueille sekä mahdolliset veromuutokset. Tämän prosessin aikana parlamentti päättää myös siitä, kuinka paljon rahaa on käytettävissä tietyllä hallinnollisella alueella, kuten maakunnassa tai kunnassa. Parlamentin budjettipäätöksiä laadittaessa otetaan huomioon monia eri tekijöitä, kuten poliittiset päämäärät, taloudellinen kehitys, kansalaisyhteiskunnan tarpeet ja hallituksen strategiset linjaukset. Luonnollisesti eri puolueilla ja poliitikoilla on erilaisia näkemyksiä siitä, mihin rahaa tulisi käyttää ja kuinka paljon kukin alue tai sektori tarvitsee. Kun parlamentti on tehnyt päätöksensä budjetista, se välitetään hallitukselle ja siitä vastaaville ministeriöille, jotka puolestaan ohjaavat rahan jakamista eri projekteihin, palveluihin ja investointeihin. Parlamentin budjettityö jatkuu kuitenkin senkin jälkeen, sillä sen on seurattava ja arvioitava rahan käytön tehokkuutta, tuloksellisuutta ja vaikuttavuutta eri alueilla.

Smith criticized mercantilism, advocating a system of free trade with division of labour. He postulated an \\"invisible hand\\" that regulated economic systems made up of actors guided only by self-interest. Karl Marx developed an alternative economic theory, called Marxian economics. Marxian economics is based on the labor theory of value and assumes the value of good to be based on the amount of labor required to produce it. Under this assumption, capitalism was based on employers not paying the full value of workers labor to create profit. The Austrian school responded to Marxian economics by viewing entrepreneurship as driving force of economic development. This replaced the labor theory of value by a system of supply and demand.

In spite of the name, it is not a true drum but an idiophone, usually carved or constructed from bamboo or wood into a box with one or more slits in the top. Most slit drums have one slit, though two and three slits (cut into the shape of an \\"H\\") occur. If the resultant tongues are different width or thicknesses, the drum will produce two different pitches. It is used throughout Africa, Southeast Asia, and Oceania. In Africa such drums, strategically situated for optimal acoustic transmission (e.g., along a river or valley), have been used for long-distance communication. - The Agung a Tamlang is a type of Philippine slit drum made of hollowed out bamboo in imitation of the real agung . Pitch is determined by the length and depth of the slit . The agung a tamlang is used as practice for the real agung : players either use either one agung a tamlang ( hold it with one hand and using the other to strike it with a beater ) or using two agung a tamlangs where the other agung is held with one 's feet . - The agung is a set of two wide-rimmed, vertically suspended gongs used by the Maguindanao, Maranao, Sama-Bajau and Tausug people of the Philippines as a supportive instrument in kulintang ensembles.

There is usually a \\"resonance head\\" on the underside of the drum, typically tuned to a slightly lower pitch than the top drumhead. Other techniques have been used to cause drums to make sound, such as the thumb roll. Drums are the world's oldest and most ubiquitous musical instruments, and the basic design has remained virtually unchanged for thousands of years. - Mindanao is the second largest and southernmost major island in the Philippines.

The sentence provided discusses the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and North Korea's declaration of intention, as well as the UN Secretary-General's response about withdrawal provisions. To answer the original question, I need to identify the two factors that determine whether it is possible to withdraw from a treaty. Step 1: Analyze the question. The question asks about two factors that determine the possibility of withdrawing from a treaty. Step 2: Identify the two factors. Based on general knowledge, there are two main factors that determine whether it is possible to withdraw from a treaty: 1. Withdrawal provisions within the treaty: If the treaty itself explicitly includes clauses or provisions that allow for withdrawal under specific conditions, then a party can withdraw in accordance with those provisions. 2. Permissible under customary international law: If the treaty does not have explicit withdrawal provisions, it may still be possible to withdraw if it is permissible under customary international law. Customary international law may allow for withdrawal under certain circumstances, such as a fundamental change in circumstances or a violation of the treaty terms by another party. In conclusion, the two factors that determine whether it is possible to withdraw from a treaty are the withdrawal provisions within the treaty itself and the permissibility under customary international law."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Build a movie plot around this: To whom April apologizes?

In her early 20s, she accidentally caused a car accident that led to the death of a young child named Sandino Ramirez. Consumed with guilt and unable to move on, April has been living in isolation, slowly unravelling and letting her once-promising art career slip away. As she tries to cope with her grief, she discovers a way to channel her pain and commemorate Sandino's short life. She begins to work on a large mural of a magical landscape on the side of a humble building in the heart of the town, pouring her heart and soul into this masterpiece. While working on the mural, April meets Carlos Ramirez, an aspiring writer, and a gentle soul. Unbeknownst to her, he is Sandino's older brother who is deeply grieving over his sibling's death. As the two artists grow closer, working together in the creation of the mural, a deep connection forms between them. Carlos becomes April's emotional anchor, while April reignites a passion for life in Carlos. They find solace in shared memories of Sandino, and for the first time, April opens up about her role in the accident that changed both of their lives. With the completion of the mural, a beautiful tribute to Sandino's life is unveiled to the town. Before a crowd of residents, including Sandino's parents, April tearfully apologizes for her actions, admitting and taking responsibility for the pain she has caused everyone, especially Carlos and their parents. She then accepts the need to face the consequences of her actions. However, nurtured by their time together and the unique love that formed through the shared memory of Sandino, Carlos realizes that April's apology is sincere, and she has wholly devoted herself to honoring the memory of his brother. In an emotional climax, Carlos forgives her, understanding that there is no way to change the past but pledging to build a better future together. As they embark on a journey of healing, both Carlos and April find redemption by continuing to use their artistic talents to help others heal from grief and pain. Together, they start a non-profit organization in honour of Sandino, where they teach art and storytelling to disadvantaged children, helping them express themselves and transform their own lives.

As we explained, both were involved during 1998 and 1999 in preparing to attack a ship off the coast of Yemen with a boatload of explosives. They had originally targeted a commercial vessel, specifically an oil tanker, but Bin Laden urged them to look for a U.S.warship instead. In January 2000, their team had attempted to attack a warship in the port of Aden, but the attempt failed when the suicide boat sank. More than nine months later, on October 12,2000, al Qaeda operatives in a small boat laden with explosives attacked a U.S. Navy destroyer, the USS Cole. The blast ripped a hole in the side of the Cole, killing 17 members of the ship's crew and wounding at least 40. The plot, we now know, was a full-fledged al Qaeda operation, supervised directly by Bin Laden. He chose the target and location of the attack, selected the suicide operatives, and provided the money needed to purchase explosives and equipment. Nashiri was the field commander and managed the operation in Yemen. Khallad helped in Yemen until he was arrested in a case of mistaken identity and freed with Bin Laden's help, as we also mentioned earlier. Local al Qaeda coordinators included Jamal al Badawi and Fahd al Quso, who was supposed to film the attack from a nearby apartment. The two suicide operatives chosen were Hassan al Khamri and Ibrahim al Thawar, also known as Nibras. Nibras and Quso delivered money to Khallad in Bangkok during Khallad's January 2000 trip to Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok. In September 2000, Bin Laden reportedly told Nashiri that he wanted to replace Khamri and Nibras. Nashiri was angry and disagreed, telling others he would go to Afghanistan and explain to Bin Laden that the new operatives were already trained and ready to conduct the attack. Prior to departing, Nashiri gave Nibras and Khamri instructions to execute the attack on the next U.S.warship that entered the port of Aden.

And then come out of that phase with a degree of visions that continue to be shaped. Nothing is ever written in stone. Bernie is the CEO, so Bernie is going to lead it and I will work with Bernie to establish some kind of strategic plan to where you want to go.\\" Ecclestone, who is renowned for his distaste for working with other people and likes to have control in his affairs, told Sky Sports: \\"If, by chance, things aren't going the way I think would be the right way then I will disappear for sure.\\" But he added: \\"There is going to be no problem with Chase. We will work together. He has got expertise that I haven't. We need to be in America. He knows America, he knows television and he can help us a lot.\\" Liberty believes it can expand F1's global reach and revenues by exploiting new avenues. Carey has singled out expansion in the US, Americas and Asia, and a more effective use of digital media. F1 has historically struggled to maintain a consistent presence in the US market, which many have said is a result of Ecclestone's business model of demanding such large fees from circuits for the rights to hold the race that they struggle to establish a workable business plan. Carey said: \\"It is too early to have a clear plan, but we clearly will have a plan to develop America, to be in the right market. \\"There is a big untapped audience in the US. I don't want to criticise the efforts in the past, because I don't know the efforts in the past. \\"Formula 1 is a great premium brand and that means to me that you want to be at a location like Los Angeles, New York or Miami. Ideally in the great cities in the world.\\" Chase said another of his targets was to \\"widen the core television experience to today's needs\\". He added: \\"I believe that a good digital product makes the television product more rewarding. \\"Marketing the sport, in telling the story of the stars and heroes and the incredible machines. Then strengthen it geographically. \\"So there is not 'the cash cow', but there is growth possibility in every area.\\" Summary:","response":"A man named Carey has been given a big job by a company called Liberty Media.

I've been watching it for years now and to me it still don't look right somehow. Maybe it's just me thinking it, sending myself doolally after what I've done. But I swear every morning it creeps up and it's looking at me, all knowing like. And when you reckon the sun's acting like that over you there isn't a right lot you can do about it, beyond burying yourself away like a mole in the soil. That's what I've been doing more or less in the score or so years that have gone by since. But however tight I shut them curtains to stop that damn sun lighting me up, it still don't stop the inside of my head from pounding out the truth. No way it's ever going to stop harassing me neither, not unless the deaf and dumb lass was to happen right back on my doorstep and give me the chance to tell her that it wasn't never meant to work out this way. The deaf and dumb lass went by the name of Mitzi Barker. Her being deaf and dumb, she was the kind of lass you went up the lane with if you didn't want no-one shouting their gob off about it after. Funny but it's the small things I recall best about her, like the way her hair reeked of bonfires and how that little old checkered dress of hers rode right up her thigh with no help from me. After we'd finished our business we'd head over the trout farm and I'd hunker down and poach us up a couple of rainbows for our tea. That Mitzi Barker, she was thin as an ear of barley and I always figured a good nosh-up was the least I could do for her troubles. Question: The narrator and Mitzi would eat trout: === The answer to the above question is","response":"Yes, the narrator and Mitzi would eat trout after their encounters. The narrator describes their routine of going up the lane together and spending time with each other, and how he would poach a couple of rainbow trouts for them to share as a meal afterwards. He mentions that Mitzi was very thin, and he felt that providing her with a good meal was the least he could do in return for her company and the moments they shared. The narrator's description of Mitzi and their time together reveals a great deal about their relationship and the circumstances surrounding it. It shows that, despite her being deaf and mute, Mitzi and the narrator shared a deep connection, one that was perhaps strengthened by their simple, shared experiences, such as enjoying a meal of trout by the trout farm. These memories, however, haunt the narrator as he keeps reflecting on that fateful day when something went wrong between them. The sun, in its daily appearance, constantly reminds him of what he has done and how he has failed Mitzi. No matter how hard he tries to escape and hide from the truth, it remains in his mind, tormenting him with the knowledge that if Mitzi were to come back, he could never truly make amends for the harm he has caused. The story of the narrator and Mitzi Barker is one of regret, guilt, and a longing for closure that may never come. It is a poignant reminder of the weight of our actions and how the choices we make can haunt us for years to come."},{"question":"iran 's foreign minister met with the head of russia 's nuclear energy agency for talks on the long-delayed bushehr nuclear power plant , as moscow reportedly pushes tehran for more openness on the state of past atomic activities .

It is important to provide a comprehensive and detailed answer to ensure a proper understanding of the topic. The three primary mental states in psychology include conscious, preconscious, and unconscious. 1. Conscious: The conscious mind represents our current awareness and thoughts. It includes everything that we are currently aware of, such as our sensations, perceptions, emotions, and thoughts. The conscious mind is responsible for processing the information we receive from our external environment and internal responses. 2. Preconscious: The preconscious mind contains accessible information that is not currently in our conscious awareness but can be easily brought to the forefront if needed. For example, memories and knowledge that we have stored throughout our lives can be accessed through the preconscious mind when required. 3. Unconscious: The unconscious mind consists of thoughts, feelings, and memories that are hidden away from our conscious awareness. These psychic contents may influence our behavior and decision-making without us realizing it. Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, believed that the unconscious mind plays a significant role in shaping human behavior and is the reservoir for repressed and unacceptable desires, thoughts, and feelings.

The Tang Emperors also had Xianbei maternal ancestry, from Emperor Gaozu of Tang's Xianbei mother, Duchess Dugu. Li Yuan was Duke of Tang and governor of Taiyuan, modern Shanxi, during the Sui dynasty's collapse, which was caused in part by the Sui failure to conquer the northern part of the Korean peninsula during the Goguryeo–Sui War. He had prestige and military experience, and was a first cousin of Emperor Yang of Sui (their mothers were sisters). Li Yuan rose in rebellion in 617, along with his son and his equally militant daughter Princess Pingyang (d. 623), who raised and commanded her own troops. In winter 617, Li Yuan occupied Chang'an, relegated Emperor Yang to the position of Taishang Huang or retired emperor, and acted as regent to the puppet child-emperor, Yang You. On the news of Emperor Yang's murder by General Yuwen Huaji on June 18, 618, Li Yuan declared himself the emperor of a new dynasty, the Tang.Li Yuan, known as Emperor Gaozu of Tang, ruled until 626, when he was forcefully deposed by his son Li Shimin, the Prince of Qin. Li Shimin had commanded troops since the age of 18, had prowess with bow and arrow, sword and lance and was known for his effective cavalry charges. Fighting a numerically superior army, he defeated Dou Jiande (573–621) at Luoyang in the Battle of Hulao on May 28, 621. In a violent elimination of royal family due to fear of assassination, Li Shimin ambushed and killed two of his brothers, Li Yuanji (b. 603) and Crown prince Li Jiancheng (b. 589), in the Xuanwu Gate Incident on July 2, 626. Shortly thereafter, his father abdicated in his favor and Li Shimin ascended the throne. He is... The answer to this question is:","response":"The three names of the Daoist founder are Laozi, Li Dan, and Li Er. Laozi is his honorific title, while Li Dan and Li Er are his personal names.

Mason recalled that the sessions were trouble-free. Smith disagreed, stating that Barrett was unresponsive to his suggestions and constructive criticism. EMI-Columbia released The Piper at the Gates of Dawn in August 1967. The album peaked at number 6, spending 14 weeks on the UK charts. One month later, it was released under the Tower Records label. Pink Floyd continued to draw large crowds at the UFO Club; however, Barrett's mental breakdown was by then causing serious concern. The group initially hoped that his erratic behaviour would be a passing phase, but some were less optimistic, including Jenner and his assistant, June Child, who commented: \\"I found [Barrett] in the dressing room and he was so ... gone. Roger Waters and I got him on his feet, [and] we got him out to the stage ... The band started to play and Syd just stood there. He had his guitar around his neck and his arms just hanging down\\".Forced to cancel Pink Floyd's appearance at the prestigious National Jazz and Blues Festival, as well as several other shows, King informed the music press that Barrett was suffering from nervous exhaustion. Waters arranged a meeting with psychiatrist R. D. Laing, and though Waters personally drove Barrett to the appointment, Barrett refused to come out of the car. A stay in Formentera with Sam Hutt, a doctor well established in the underground music scene, led to no visible improvement. The band followed a few concert dates in Europe during September with their first tour of the US in October. As the US tour went on, Barrett's condition grew steadily worse. During appearances on the Dick Clark and Pat Boone shows in November, Barrett confounded his hosts by not responding to questions and staring off into space. He refused to move his lips when it came time to mime \\"See Emily Play\\" on Boone's show. After these embarrassing..., what would be the answer ?

For every five years, eight village youths are stolen from their families to the capital of the Minos Empire and placed in the underground labyrinth to be a sacrifice to the Minotaur, the Minoan god. Theo, haunted by the loss of his love, Fion, in an earlier sacrifice, is convinced that the beast is not a deity and that his love still lives within the labyrinth.

However, Theo intends to kill the Minotaur.

However, Theo is aided by Deucalion's sister, Queen Raphaella, who reveals that her mother gave herself to the most disturbing actions to create a living god, the Minotaur. As the Minotaur grows, so does its appetite when it murdered Deucalion's brother, resulting with the human sacrifices to appense the Minotaur while ensuring Minos's surival.Theo along the way discovers the labyrinth is connected to an underground vent and Tyro tempts the Minotaur to crash into one of the vents but is unsuccessful as the Minotaur eats him alive. Theo then tempts the Minotaur and in the process, the Minotaur breaks his left horn, but continues to charge after Theo. As Theo ran back towards the enlarged vent, he scratches the walls and generates a spark that ignites the whole labyrinth, and dives into a pond of water where Raphaella was waiting for him. They emerge from the water as the flames die out, but the beast is still alive and attempts to charge at them again. Theo takes the horn out of the rubble from where the vent was, and just as the beast attempts to kill him, stabs the Minotaur through the mouth and continues on charging until it hits a collapsed rock formation which impales the...

Article: I grew up with a fat dad--450 pounds at his heaviest.Every week he would try a new diet,and my family ended up eating whatever strange food he was trying at that moment. After my thirdgrade year,my dad landed a lifechanging job in Manhattan.My mom,my little sister and I had to move away from our hometown,Chicago,and leave my grandmother and her beautiful food behind. Leaving my grandmother was far more frightening than the move to New York City.There would be no more special weekends at my grandmother's house,the only place I can remember feeling happy,safe and nourished .It was what I desired.In this new city,I felt extremely alone and lost,and I missed my grandmother terribly. My grandmother knew just how I felt--And she knew the _ .Every week,she would send me a card with a 20 bill,a recipe and a list of what to buy at the market.It kept us bonded,and her recipes filled my body and soul. Over the years,I have grown to better understand my father's struggles with weight and the toll it took on him and those who love him.I have come to realize he was driven not by vanity or selfishness as much as by a deep pain.And in spite of growing up in such an unhealthy eating environment (or perhaps because of it),as an adult I found a passion and a career as a nutrition consultant. Today,my father weighs 220 pounds and is a vegan .How he got there is a story I hope to share in the coming weeks.More importantly,food is no longer a barrier that keeps us apart,but a bridge that keep us connected.There is nothing my dad enjoys more than talking with me about dietary theories and his weightloss victories.And now I am the one regularly sending recipe cards to my father's house,just as my grandmother did for me.

If you have experienced such feelings and worse on a regular basis, then you most probably are a victim of anxiety attacks. All of us, to some extent, have experienced anxiety at different levels. There are somethings you may know about anxiety, and some things that you may not be familiar with. So in order to be prepared for your unexpected feeling of anxiety, you need to get to know what anxiety is before it _ into a panic attack. Anxiety is simply the feeling of discomfort, uneasiness or fear of what may eventually happen resulting from an imagined, or a real threatening condition. On the extreme end panic attacks can occur due to heightened feelings of anxiety. There are two main symptoms during an anxiety / panic attack and these are physical and emotional symptoms. Physical symptoms include difficulty in breathing, shaking, direct feeling of heat, rapid heartbeat and tiredness while emotional symptoms deal with worrying, depression, fear, and lack of focus. In spite of the negative impression we have for anxiety, it is not dangerous in any way whatever. The feeling of anxiety is not bad, in fact it's more of a defensive feeling which protects us from possible danger by engaging a response within us in fight or fight situations. So it's not the \\"bad guy\\", you just have to learn how to control it. Panic attacks, however, are far more dangerous and should be a concern to your health. Panic can sometimes result in blurred vision, difficulty in breathing due to a tight chest. The best way to different anxiety from any serious illness is to ask a medical expert for advice on a regular basis. A:","response":"Which of the following best describes anxiety as explained in the article? a) A dangerous and harmful feeling that should be avoided at all costs b) A feeling of discomfort, uneasiness, or fear resulting from an imagined or real threatening condition c) A rare emotion that only a select few individuals experience d) Always a precursor to a panic attack, and therefore should be treated as an emergency"},{"question":"Summarize this article in one sentence. Duncan McCausland was arrested 18 months ago and was questioned for three days. He has now been told he will not face any charges. He said he volunteered to co-operate and complained that the decision to arrest him was disproportionate. He also plans to lodge a formal complaint with the Police Ombudsman. The former officer was one of seven men questioned in June 2014 about the awarding of police vehicle contracts. He had strenuously denied any wrongdoing, and on Tuesday, his solicitor received a letter from the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) informing him that his client will not face any charges. \\"This matter can be resolved very quickly in an easy way if Chief Constable George Hamilton, who I know personally, is prepared to offer his regrets for what happened,\\" Mr McCausland told BBC Radio Ulster. \\"But I have to consider everything because my reputation has been damaged.\\" He said the allegations against him were not founded on any evidence. \\"The police have a unique power, which is to remove someone's liberty, and that should be as a last resort,\\" he said. \\"There was absolutely no need to remove my liberty or anyone else's liberty, because people were prepared to fully co-operate with the police.\\" Responding to Mr McCausland's remarks, the PSNI chief constable said he is \\"wholly content\\" with the way in which the police dealt with the case. Welcoming the fact that the process had concluded, George Hamilton said he fully respected the direction made by the PPS. \\"I am wholly content that the PSNI fulfilled their legal obligations in response to this investigation and reported all available evidence to the PPS,\\" he said. \\"I am also entirely satisfied with the integrity and professionalism of the investigation. \\"Prosecutorial decisions are a matter for the PPS\\". Detectives were investigating allegations of bribery and misconduct in public office in the awarding of contracts for police vehicles. Mr McCausland had criticised his former employer for arresting him, because he had volunteered to assist the investigation. The Public Prosecution Service said in its letter to Mr McCausland's solicitor that, based upon evidence currently available, the test for prosecution had not been met. Mr McCausland was one of the most high profile PSNI officers before retiring in March 2011, under the Patten redundancy scheme. The owner of one of Northern Ireland's largest car dealerships, who was also among the seven men questioned in 2014, has also been told he will not face any charges. Terence Donnelly, of Donnelly Brothers, had always maintained that he would be completely exonerated in relation to all allegations arising from the investigation. In a statement to the BBC, his solicitor said Mr Donnelly welcomed the decision by the PPS. In April this year, a former PSNI officer who had gone on to lead an English police force was told he would not face charges as a result of the same investigation. Mark Gilmore was suspended as chief constable of West Yorkshire Police in June 2014 after being questioned by the PSNI. His suspension was lifted in May after the PPS informed him it would not be pressing charges. However, he has not resumed his role as chief constable.","response":"Former Northern Ireland police officer, Duncan McCausland, who was arrested 18 months ago in relation to alleged bribery and misconduct in the awarding of contracts for police vehicles, will not face charges and plans to lodge a formal complaint with the Police Ombudsman."},{"question":"See the multi-choice question below: Sentence 1: you know uh we sit there and and we think that they think the way we think Sentence 2: We should realize that they are different from us in a lot of ways. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true? Choices: (A). yes (B). it is not possible to tell (C). no","response":"Based on the provided information in both sentences, the correct answer would be (B). It is not possible to tell. To elaborate, let's break down both sentences and see how they relate to each other: Sentence 1: \\"You know uh we sit there and and we think that they think the way we think.\\" In this sentence, the speaker is expressing the notion that \\"we\\" (presumably referring to a group of people) tend to believe that \\"they\\" (another group of people) think in the same way as \\"we\\" do. This suggests that there might be an assumption that the thought processes or perspectives of one group are similar to those of another group. Sentence 2: \\"We should realize that they are different from us in a lot of ways.\\" This sentence is expressing the idea that \\"they\\" are actually quite distinct from \\"us\\" in many ways. It serves as a reminder that despite any possible similarities, there are also significant differences between the two groups. Now, let's consider how these two sentences relate to the question of whether Sentence 2 would be true if Sentence 1 is true. In other words, if it is accurate that \\"we\\" generally assume that \\"they\\" think the same way as \\"we\\" do, does that necessarily mean that it is also true that \\"they\\" are different from \\"us\\" in many ways? In this case, the truth or falsity of Sentence 1 does not definitively determine the truth or falsity of Sentence 2. It is quite possible that \\"they\\" do, in fact, think similarly to \\"us\\" but still differ in numerous other ways. However, it is also possible that \\"they\\" differ from \\"us\\" not only in their thought processes but in other respects as well. Given the information presented in the two sentences, we cannot determine with certainty whether Sentence 2 is true or false based solely on the truth or falsity of Sentence 1.

As you stand on the scooter, lift your non-dominant hand away from the handlebars and spin them towards your body with your dominant hand. Keep rotating the bars as far as you can move them. To keep your scooter still while you practice, you can put the back wheel up against a wall. Alternately, you can just stand on the brake on the back of your scooter to keep it from moving. You could also position the scooter so that the front wheel is over a curb and isn't touching the ground. Once you have rotated the bars as far around as you can with your dominant hand, reach your non-dominant hand under the dominant one to grab the other handle as it comes. Keep spinning the bars towards their starting position, rotating your dominant hand back to a normal, forward-facing grip as you do. Keep on practicing until you can do this one smooth motion. It’ll be much easier to do the trick when you can spin your handlebars without thinking about it. Once you’ve got the movement sorted, you can practice spinning while the scooter is moving. Stand with your legs shoulder-width apart and swing your scooter between them so it moves front to back. When the scooter reaches it’s highest point in front of you, try and spin the handles. This is the best way to mimic a real barspin without you having to leave the ground. In order to do a barspin, you’ll need to get some air with a bunny hop. Start riding your scooter at a comfortable speed and then jump straight up in the air. As you do, hold onto the handlebars of the scooter and lift it up with your body. Practice doing a bunny hop until you can jump easily and as high as possible. The higher you jump, the more time you’ll have to get your barspin perfect and regain control of the handlebars before you hit the ground. See how high you can bunny hop. Make sure you keep your feet firmly planted on the deck of your scooter and keep your front wheel straight when you land your bunny hop. Start riding on your scooter at a comfortable speed and do a bunnyhop, keeping your scooter level. As you reach the highest point of the hop, use the hand movement you practiced to spin the bars around and catch them again. Hold on tightly to the handlebars and bend your knees slightly as you land to give you more control over the scooter when you’re back on the ground. If you’re worried about crashing, you can practice on a softer surface like grass first.

Erin was always scared to use a public toilet unlike Cynthia because","response":"Cynthia was fearless. It was an odd fear for Erin to have, but it plagued her throughout her entire life – the fear of public restrooms. It began when she was just five years old. She had walked into a public restroom with her mother and unknowingly stepped on a piece of gum. Her mother's angry scolding left her scarred and anxious, associating public restrooms with a sense of danger and contamination. Years passed and Erin tried her best to work through her fear. She always tried to schedule outings with breaks built in, so she could return to her safe home bathroom. Despite her quirks, Erin managed to build a strong bond with Cynthia during their college years. Cynthia, on the other hand, had an uncanny ability to adapt to any surrounding – from the most pristine of restrooms to the dingiest of public stalls. She had a certain level of confidence that Erin had always admired, and she hoped that some of it would rub off on her. One day, Cynthia invited Erin to the annual cultural fair held downtown. It was an event filled with music, dance, food, and craft stalls – an atmosphere Cynthia loved and knew Erin would enjoy too. Despite the excitement in her heart, Erin's mind began to panic: how would she manage to avoid the dreaded public restrooms with all the food and drink available? Despite her concerns, Erin took a deep breath and decided to say yes to her friend's invitation. She couldn't let this fear control her life. On the day of the fair, they set off early in the morning, the sun shining brightly and the smell of delicious food wafting through the air. Cynthia sensed Erin's anxiety but was determined to help her friend conquer her fears. As the day went by, the two friends had a great time exploring numerous stalls, trying various dishes, and dancing together. However, as fate would have it, nature called. Erin felt the familiar pang of panic rise in her chest. Seeing the look on her friend's face, Cynthia understood what was going on. Cynthia took Erin's hand and led her to the public restroom area. \\"Erin, listen to me. I know you're scared, and that's okay. But I'll be right here with you, and I'll make sure nothing goes wrong. You have to face this fear and realize that it's only a part of your mind playing tricks on you. Are you with me?\\" With Cynthia's unwavering support, Erin found herself breathing more easily. Steeling her resolve, she nodded. \\"Okay, I'm with you. Let's do this.\\" Hand in hand, they approached the restrooms. The old fear began to creep up on Erin, but Cynthia continued to encourage her. With every step, Erin became stronger, more determined to defeat her fear. Once they reached the entrance, Cynthia squeezed Erin's hand and smiled. \\"You're not alone, remember that.\\" Erin walked into the restroom, feeling her heartbeat quicken. The echo of footsteps and the sound of running water were all she could hear. In a distant corner, she noticed a cleaning cart – a sign that the place had been recently cleaned. As she entered a stall and locked the door, she tried to concentrate on her breathing. A few minutes later, her task was finally done. When Erin exited the restroom, she was greeted with a big smile and a hug from Cynthia. \\"I'm proud of you. You faced your fear, and you're still standing.\\" While their adventure at the cultural fair continued, Erin felt an overwhelming sense of accomplishment. Indeed, she was still standing after facing her biggest fear. As they walked hand in hand towards the next exciting exhibit at the fair, Erin couldn't help but feel more vibrant and alive than ever. Erin's journey to overcome her fear of public restrooms wasn't an easy one, but with the help of her friend Cynthia and the strength she found within herself, she took a significant step forward. From that day on, Erin's fear began to lessen, and she found herself embarking on new adventures with a newfound sense of confidence."},{"question":"Q: Lee and Skylar got into an argument earlier that day so Lee turned Skylar's help away.

After a war, a tentative peace usually faces numerous challenges and uncertainties in the rebuilding process. People may have a desire to move forward, but there are many obstacles in the way. Often, there is a sense of chaos and confusion, as well as lingering resentment and mistrust among different factions who were once at war. This unsettling environment can make it difficult for a lasting and stable peace to take root. While the other options presented also present plausible scenarios, they do not accurately describe the primary issue causing doubt on the longevity of the tentative peace. A. Love and understanding, while essential for healing, would not be the primary reason for skepticism about the lasting peace. B. Fighting, although a possibility, would not be the main cause for skepticism, especially if a peace agreement is in place. C. Hostility does exist after a war, but it is just one aspect of the larger problems during the rebuilding phase, and as such, not the complete reason for people doubting the peace. D.

(2). no.","response":"Yes, the statement \\"Avicenna believed his \\"Floating Man\\" thought experiment demonstrated that the soul is a substance, and claimed humans cannot doubt their own consciousness, even in a situation that prevents all sensory data input\\" is a good answer to the question \\"What was the soul according to Avicenna?\\" To provide a more detailed explanation, Avicenna, a Persian polymath from the Islamic Golden Age, made significant contributions to various fields, including philosophy, medicine, and astronomy. One of his accomplishments in the field of philosophy was his exploration of the soul and self-awareness through his famous thought experiment known as the \\"Floating Man.\\" The thought experiment, also referred to as the \\"Flying Man\\" or \\"Falling Man,\\" is a scenario in which a person is created without any sensory input (e.g., sight, sound, touch, smell, and taste) and is suspended in the air. According to Avicenna, this person would still have an immediate awareness of his or her existence, despite the lack of any sensory data. Avicenna used this experiment to argue that the soul is a substance that exists independently of the body and sensory input. According to his views, the soul comprises the intellect (reason), perception (sensory experiences), and desire (motivation and intentions). He also distinguished between the \\"vegetative soul\\" (responsible for growth and reproduction), the \\"sensitive soul\\" (responsible for perception and movement), and the \\"rational soul\\" (responsible for thinking and understanding). Through the \\"Floating Man\\" experiment, Avicenna attempted to demonstrate that human consciousness is innately grounded in self-awareness. Even without any external sensory input, a person can still be conscious of their existence. Thus, the soul is a real and independent entity – a substance – that cannot be doubted or reduced to merely a bundle of sensory experiences or biological processes. In summary, yes, the given statement accurately captures the essence of Avicenna's view on the soul. His \\"Floating Man\\" thought experiment serves as a key point in understanding his belief that the soul is a substance, and that human consciousness is inherently self-aware, even in the absence of sensory data input."},{"question":"What is the version of the following sentence with correct punctuation?

President Hamid Karzai requested that Mr. Obama write the letter in exchange for softening his opposition to letting American forces raid Afghan homes after the coalition's mandate expires in December 2014, said his spokesman, Aimal Faizi. If made, this American gesture would be reciprocated by Kabul's agreement to permit these raids in circumstances when American lives are at risk, he said. Enlarge Image Afghan policemen check a vehicle in Kabul on Tuesday, two days before a meeting to weigh a security deal. European Pressphoto Agency More Lull in Taliban Action Not Expected In Washington, White House and State Department officials wouldn't confirm whether Mr. Obama would send such a letter. White House press secretary Jay Carney said he wouldn't comment on a \\"letter that hasn't been written.\\" Mr. Faizi said the compromise decision was made in a phone call between Messrs. Karzai and Secretary of State John Kerry on Tuesday. Mr. Kerry initially offered to write the letter himself, but Mr. Karzai insisted it must come from Mr. Obama, Mr. Faizi said. The developments came just ahead of Thursday's inauguration of the Loya Jirga, a traditional assembly that would consider the so-called bilateral security agreement between the two countries. A senior State Department official said Mr. Karzai requested the \\"reassurances, including the option of a letter from the administration.\\" The official said there was no agreement on a letter yet but that one that states the government's position was under discussion. U.S. officials said they believe that conflicting accounts of the call reflect last-minute political posturing by Mr. Karzai ahead of the Loya Jirga. In the call with Mr. Karzai, Mr. Kerry didn't specify any intention to issue a letter in which the U.S. would apologize for American conduct in the war, U.S. officials said. But the officials said they could envisage issuing a letter in which the U.S. expresses \\"regret\\" for civilian casualties in past military operations, in line with previous U.S. statements. In the U.S., Republican lawmakers have criticized Mr. Obama for what they see as a willingness to apologize for American military action abroad, and any letter to Mr. Karzai could carry political overtones. The security agreement, which would provide for a limited American training and counterterrorism force in Afghanistan after 2014, is crucial for continuing international aid, the main source of funding for the Afghan army and police that are facing a resilient Taliban insurgency. Mr. Obama's letter to Mr. Karzai and the Afghan people is supposed to \\"mention that there were mistakes made in the conduct of military operations by U.S. forces in the past decade, and that the Afghan people have suffered, and we understand their pain, and therefore can give assurances that these mistakes will not be repeated,\\" said Mr. Faizi. He added that Mr. Obama's letter would be presented to the Loya Jirga together with the security deal. Susan Rice, Mr. Obama's national security adviser, said Tuesday that the president has no intention of apologizing. \\"There's no such discussion of an apology,\\" she said on PBS. \\"So let's take that off the table. That's not in the cards.\\" She added that the talks on a security agreement are \\"very close to completion,\\" but added it was \\"possible\\" the two sides won't reach a deal on remaining details. The U.S. spent hundreds of billions of dollars in Afghanistan since the 2001 invasion, losing 2,922 American lives in the war so far. Mr. Karzai has repeatedly condemned the U.S. forces for inflicting civilian casualties. U.S. officials said in recent weeks that they had believed that the draft text of the agreement was ironed out during marathon talks between Messrs. Karzai and Kerry in Kabul in October. Mr. Karzai, however, reopened some of the most contentious issues in recent days. The dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, Vali Nasr, a former senior State Department official dealing with Afghanistan, said Mr. Karzai was shoring up his nationalistic credentials in this latest confrontation with Washington as U.S. troops withdraw. \\"He has to be viable as a nationalist leader,\\" Mr. Nasr said. \\"He is definitely playing a domestic game.…The Loya Jirga right now puts added pressure on him to appear not to be an American cat's paw.\\" Mr. Karzai's most-pointed demand to revise the security agreement was his insistence that American troops would no longer be allowed to enter Afghan homes under any circumstances, not even when accompanied by Afghan security forces, after 2014. Such a blanket ban would severely constrain, if not scuttle altogether, the counterterrorism mission that the U.S. hopes to maintain in Afghanistan to target al Qaeda. It would make it impossible for U.S. personnel to gather intelligence and evidence inside al Qaeda's hide-outs, and would even outlaw rescue missions to recover kidnapped or injured U.S. personnel. Retired U.S. Army Lt. Gen. David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan and now is a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security in Washington, said counterterrorism raids are \\"the area where the United States is going to be particularly sensitive to restrictions,\\" adding, \\"Forces in combat, under fire, are going to require a little bit of that flexibility.\\" During Tuesday's phone call with Mr. Karzai, Mr. Kerry suggested that the Americans may be permitted to enter Afghan homes in \\"exceptional circumstances\\" when American troops' lives are at risk, Mr. Faizi said. Mr. Karzai initially replied by saying he wanted to add both the Afghan proposal and the American language in the draft agreement to be submitted to the Loya Jirga, and let its 2,500 delegates decide. He also invited Mr. Kerry to come to Kabul and try persuading the delegates to accept the American version in a speech to the assembly, an offer the U.S. rejected, Mr. Faizi said. The Loya Jirga, most of whose delegates were selected by provincial authorities, and whose membership list was approved by Mr. Karzai, is highly unlikely to do anything against the wishes of the Afghan president. As an alternative, Mr. Faizi said, Mr. Karzai also suggested the U.S. could sign the deal with a new government that is slated to be elected in April. At the end of the phone call, however, the Afghan president agreed to the \\"exceptional circumstances\\" request in exchange for a letter from Mr. Obama, Mr. Faizi said. The exact wording of that clause in the security agreement will be determined by negotiators from the two countries before the Loya Jirga considers the document, he said. Mr. Obama's letter should also guarantee that these exceptions \\"will not be misused\\" and \\"strictly defined,\\" Mr. Faizi said. It is possible, Mr. Faizi acknowledged, that the Loya Jirga may come up with \\"new suggestions\\" to amend the security agreement, requiring a new round of negotiations in coming weeks. U.S. military commanders initially pressed for the security agreement to be reached by October, saying they needed to start planning for any new post-2014 force as soon as possible. Any further delays would make this planning even more difficult, American officials have said. —Dion Nissenbaum contributed to this article. Write to Yaroslav Trofimov at yaroslav.trofimov@wsj.com and Nathan Hodge at nathan.hodge@wsj.com ||||| KABUL, Afghanistan — Months of fraught negotiations and public posturing over how a long-term American military force could remain in Afghanistan have suddenly come down to a demand for a single personal gesture: a display of contrition by President Obama for military mistakes that have hurt Afghans. Afghan officials said Tuesday that in return for such a letter from Mr. Obama, President Hamid Karzai would end his vehement opposition to American counterterrorism raids on private Afghan homes — one of the most contentious issues between allies over a costly dozen-year war — clearing the way for an agreement to keep a smaller American troop force in the country past the 2014 withdrawal deadline. As described by Mr. Karzai’s spokesman, Aimal Faizi, the letter would be tantamount to an apology, though he did not use that word. But not even that would be enough to ensure the final passage of a security agreement the United States had pressed to have in hand before next year. The Afghans have made final approval subject to an Afghan grand council of elders, a loya jirga, that is to begin meeting on Thursday, and aspects of the security deal remain deeply unpopular with the public. The White House spokesman, Jay Carney, would not confirm details on Tuesday, but he nodded to the potential deal-breaking potential of the meeting. “There are ongoing negotiations,” he said. “I would simply say this agreement is not reached until it goes through the loya jirga.” The 11th-hour discussions were the latest lurch in a start-and-stop negotiation process that has exposed raw feelings between allies, and has also highlighted Mr. Karzai’s taste for public brinkmanship. Just two days ago, Afghan officials said that the raid issue had created a stubborn impasse. Afghan and American officials said that the potential for breakthrough was opened by a phone call from Secretary of State John Kerry to Mr. Karzai on Tuesday. According to Mr. Faizi, Mr. Kerry offered to write a letter assuring the importance of an agreement and acknowledging American mistakes, and Mr. Karzai issued a counteroffer: He would compromise if the letter was from Mr. Obama instead. Mr. Faizi said Mr. Kerry agreed to those terms. But Susan E. Rice, the national security adviser, flatly denied in an interview with CNN on Tuesday night that there would be any presidential apology. “No such letter has been drafted or delivered,” Ms. Rice said. “There is not a need for the United States to apologize to Afghanistan. Quite the contrary. We have sacrificed and supported them in their democratic progress and in tackling the insurgency and Al Qaeda.” A senior State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss continuing negotiations, was more noncommittal, saying that a letter acknowledging past issues like civilian casualties was a possibility being weighed. “We will consider his request for reassurances, including the option of a letter from the administration stating our position,” the official said. Under the Afghan description, in return for the letter, Mr. Karzai would then accept wording that allowed American Special Operations raids to search and detain militants within Afghan homes, but only under “extraordinary circumstances” to save the lives of American soldiers. That would seem to greatly hamper the American intent behind those operations, which commanders have said are critical to taking the fight directly to Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups. Among members of the Afghan public, though, foreign raids on private homes are seen as deeply offensive, and the prospect of continued American commando operations after 2014 is unlikely to receive a warm reception from the roughly 3,000 delegates to the loya jirga. But Mr. Faizi said that a letter from Mr. Obama would help win critics over. And Afghan political observers have noted that Mr. Karzai, who despite his harsh negotiation tactics has repeatedly mentioned the importance of a lasting security deal with the United States, had the power of approval over the delegate list, making it more likely he could sway the council. Mr. Faizi made it clear that the Afghans had a very detailed understanding of what they expected a letter from Mr. Obama to say, and without that there would be no deal. The letter would clarify what was meant by “extraordinary circumstances” justifying home raids, and go beyond that as well. “The idea was to indeed mention that there were mistakes made in the conduct of military operations in the past, in the conduct of military operations by United States forces in the last decade, and that Afghans have suffered, and that we understand the pain and therefore we give assurances and make sure those mistakes are not repeated,” Mr. Faizi said. Afghan officials said they expected to see the text of the letter by Wednesday before Mr. Karzai signs off on the security agreement. With one day remaining to finalize the wording of the security agreement before the loya jirga meets, Mr. Faizi said that was the remaining issue in talks, carried out in their last phase by Mr. Karzai with the American ambassador, James B. Cunningham, and the American military commander, Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr. “The rest, everything is solved,” Mr. Faizi said. He also said that the Afghan side had agreed to acquiesce on another sticking point: the American requirement that the United States retain legal jurisdiction over its soldiers in Afghanistan. In essence, that would make United States military personnel immune to Afghan prosecution for their actions in the country, though they would remain subject to American prosecution. A similar requirement led to the collapse of talks with Iraq to establish a long-term security deal, and an immediate final withdrawal of American troops from that country in 2011. In recent weeks, American officials have mentioned that the result in Iraq could be duplicated, and that the 2014 military withdrawal from Afghanistan could be made complete and final if their terms on home raids and legal jurisdiction were not met. ||||| Summary:","response":"The US and Afghan governments are getting closer to a deal regarding the continued presence of US troops in Afghanistan after the coalition's mandate expires in December 2014. Although there have been some differences between the two sides, such as whether an acknowledgment letter from President Barack Obama on past mistakes committed by the US during the war should be sent, progress has been made and both sides have shown a willingness to compromise. President Hamid Karzai softened his opposition to American forces raiding Afghan homes after 2014 in exchange for Obama's letter, which would signify an understanding of the Afghan people's suffering and guarantee that past mistakes would not be repeated. The security agreement, providing for a limited American training and counterterrorism force in Afghanistan after 2014, is essential for maintaining international aid to the country as it faces a resilient Taliban insurgency."},{"question":"If \\"A couple of men in hats posing for a picture by a gas station.\\" does that mean that \\"Men after work.\\"? Options: - yes - it is not possible to tell - no Let's solve step-by-step:","response":"First, let's analyze the two phrases: 1. \\"A couple of men in hats posing for a picture by a gas station.\\" This phrase describes two men wearing hats who are posing for a photograph near a gas station. 2. \\"Men after work.\\" This phrase describes men who have finished their work. Now, let's compare the two phrases and check if they are related.

Its overall goal is to make such structures more resistant to earthquakes. An earthquake (or seismic) engineer aims to construct structures that will not be damaged in minor shaking and will avoid serious damage or collapse in a major earthquake. Earthquake engineering is the scientific field concerned with protecting society, the natural environment, and the man-made environment from earthquakes by limiting the seismic risk to socio-economically acceptable levels. Traditionally, it has been narrowly defined as the study of the behavior of structures and geo-structures subject to seismic loading; it is considered as a subset of structural engineering, geotechnical engineering, mechanical engineering, chemical engineering, applied physics, etc. However, the tremendous costs experienced in recent earthquakes have led to an expansion of its scope to encompass disciplines from the wider field of civil engineering, mechanical engineering and from the social sciences, especially sociology, political science, economics and finance. - In the United States, same-sex marriage has been legal in all states, Washington, D.C., as well as all U.S. territories except American Samoa, but not on Indian lands, since June 26, 2015, when the United States Supreme Court ruled in \\"Obergefell v. Hodges\\" that state-level bans on same-sex marriage are unconstitutional. The court ruled that the denial of marriage licenses to same-sex couples and the refusal to recognize those marriages performed in other jurisdictions violates the Due Process and the Equal Protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. The ruling overturned a precedent, \\"Baker v.

In other words, a column is a compression member. The term column applies especially to a large round support (the \\"shaft\\" of the column) with a capital and a \\"base\\" or pedestal and made of stone, or appearing to be so. A small wooden or metal support is typically called a post, and supports with a rectangular or other non-round section are usually called piers. For the purpose of wind or earthquake engineering, columns may be designed to resist lateral forces. Other compression members are often termed \\"columns\\" because of the similar stress conditions. Columns are frequently used to support beams or arches on which the upper parts of walls or ceilings rest. In architecture, \\"column\\" refers to such a structural element that also has certain proportional and decorative features.

This gives you a chance to slow down, assess the situation and prepare to fix the jam. Jamming signs to be watchful for include a slowing down of the paper moving through the shredder, an outright stop, and a whirring, \\"straining\\" noise that should be readily obvious. One reason that shredders sometimes jam is that there isn't anywhere for the paper to go once it is shredded because the wastebasket is full. If your wastebasket is full, try emptying it and re-trying which may be enough to resolve your jam. If the jam still won't clear, proceed to the following steps. Because jamming is a common problem, most modern shredders come with a built-in option to run in reverse. Switch the shredder to its \\"reverse\\" option (usually there is a well-marked button on the top of the shredder) before plugging it back in. Ensure your fingers or any other tools are not near the shredder opening when you plug it in. Reversing the shredder will usually clear a minor jam in a matter of seconds. However, in especially bad cases, the shredder may jam again when it runs in reverse. In this case, unplug the shredder again, switch it to \\"auto\\" or \\"forward\\" (the precise option may vary on your shredder) and plug it back in. Be prepared to alternate between auto and reverse as needed. A jam that's bad enough to gum up your shredder when it runs in reverse may be bad enough to jam it yet again when it runs forward for the second time. However, by switching between forward and reverse, it's almost always possible to gradually work your paper out of a jammed shredder. One of the most common reasons for a shredder jam is simply that too much paper was fed into the shredder at once. Once you clear your jam, try shredding a smaller amount of paper if this was the cause for the jam, the smaller second load should pass through with less difficulty. If you still can't seem to get your jam to clear after alternating between reverse and auto/forward, you may have an extra-severe jam that needs to be cleared manually. Never fear, consult the section below for further help.","response":"The passage provides steps for clearing a paper jam in a shredder. The first signs of a jam might include slowing down of paper movement, an outright stop, or straining noises. The cause of the jam could be an overfilled wastebasket or overfeeding of paper. The initial resolution steps involve stopping the shredding, assessing the situation, emptying the wastebasket if full, and retrying. If unsuccessful, the built-in reversing function can be used to clear minor jams. If the jam recurs even in reverse mode, alternating between auto/forward and reverse modes might work. Reducing the quantity of paper shredded at once can help avoid future jams. Extra-severe jams might require manual clearing, for which further help should be sought."},{"question":"Creating a self portrait is not your typical selfie! When I taught in the traditional classroom, creating self portraits was something I had students do whether they were four or nine. In fact, I’d have them draw one on the first day of school and one toward the end of the year and to see the change over time was always so interesting. At least once during the year, likely toward the beginning, I would center a lesson around self portraits. In younger classes, there would be more than one. Creating a self portrait teaches students to be aware of themselves. Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs? It also teaches children spatial awareness.

A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself. I am going to start with my head.” Use your hands to show your actual head on yourself so students are aware of what you talking about. The visuals also help English Language Learners (if you’re teaching in an English speaking classroom.) and build vocabulary for all students.

Seven-segment LED displays were in widespread use in the 1970s and 1980s, but rising use of liquid crystal displays, with their lower power needs and greater display flexibility, has reduced the popularity of numeric and alphanumeric LED displays.\\" Answer: Answer:","response":"The alphanumeric LEDs utilize tiny pieces that converge to display numbers and letters. These tiny pieces could be segments (in seven-segment and starburst format) or pixels (in dot-matrix format). Step 1: Understand the question and context - The question is asking about a system that uses small parts to create a larger display of letters and numbers, and the context given focuses on different formats of alphanumeric LED displays. Step 2: Identify potential answer within the context - The three formats of LED displays mentioned (seven-segment, starburst, dot-matrix) use small individual elements to create the larger display. Step 3: Formulate the answer - This conveys that alphanumeric LEDs utilize tiny pieces or elements to create a larger display. The format determines what these tiny pieces are: segments or pixels. Step 4: Confirm that answer fits the question and context - The answer accurately reflects the content outlined in the context statement and directly answers the question. Hence, \\"The alphanumeric LEDs utilize tiny pieces that converge to display numbers and letters. These tiny pieces could be segments (in seven-segment and starburst format) or pixels (in dot-matrix format).\\" is the best answer to the question."},{"question":"Generate a context and a hypothesis.","response":"Context: In recent years, the demand for organic food has risen significantly, both in developed and developing countries. Organic food is produced through agricultural practices that are free from synthetic pesticides, chemical fertilizers, genetically modified organisms (GMOs), antibiotics, and hormones. People's motivation for choosing organic food over conventionally-grown products often stems from the perception of it being healthier, more nutritious, and better for the environment. Research studies have focused on evaluating whether organic food consumption has any significant impact on human health and the environment. Hypothesis: The consumption of organic food has a positive impact on human health and promotes environmental sustainability compared to conventionally-grown food. To test this hypothesis, it is essential to review relevant studies focusing on various aspects of the relationship between organic food consumption and human health, as well as the environmental benefits of organic farming practices. The analysis should encompass the following key points: 1. Nutritional content: Investigate the differences in nutritional content between organic and conventionally-grown food products, including the levels of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Determine if organic food offers considerably higher nutritional value than non-organic alternatives. 2. Health impacts: Examine the potential health benefits associated with consuming organic food, including lower risk of exposure to pesticide residues, minimized intake of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and a reduced possibility of ingesting GMOs. Assess the long-term effects on overall health and the risk of developing chronic diseases. 3. Environmental sustainability: Evaluate the environmental implications of organic farming practices, such as reduced use of synthetic chemicals, lower energy consumption, improved soil quality, and enhanced biodiversity. Compare the ecological footprint of organic agriculture to that of conventional farming systems. 4. Socio-economic factors: Consider the economic aspects of organic food production and the role of consumer preferences, purchasing power, and market trends in influencing the expansion of organic farming. Investigate the relationship between local and global food systems and how public policies can support the growth of organic agriculture as a means of promoting health and environmental sustainability. By carefully evaluating these factors and gathering evidence, we can establish whether the hypothesis that the consumption of organic food has a positive impact on human health and promotes environmental sustainability holds true. If supported, this could lead to greater public awareness, more sustainable agricultural practices, and positive changes in consumer behavior, ultimately contributing to improved human health and a more ecologically-balanced world."},{"question":"She married twice , first in 1749 with Prince Antoni Lubomirski and the second time with Prince Kasimierz Poniatowski on 21 January 1751 .

Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment? Answer:","response":"The product review conveys a predominantly negative sentiment. The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with the complexity of some moves in the workout DVD and considers them unnecessarily complex. They recommend another DVD (10 Minute Solution: Pilates) as they feel it provides the same level of challenge and burn with less maneuvering. Additionally, the reviewer mentions that they did not feel challenged by the workout on this DVD, except during the ab workout. The 10-minute duration of the workout sessions does not seem to be sufficient for the reviewer's needs, which implies that it might not be suitable for individuals with similar expectations. Although the reviewer acknowledges that there are new moves they haven't tried before and had no difficulty performing them, the overall sentiment remains negative as those moves did not provide the expected results. Furthermore, they explicitly state that they would not recommend this DVD for people wanting to tone their legs. The only somewhat positive aspect of the review is the suggestion that the DVD might be suitable for people who are tight on time and simply want to maintain their shape.

Please write the text above using proper case.","response":"\\"Verse 2: And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and behold, it was not toward him as before.\\" This verse is taken from the ancient religious texts, and features Jacob and Laban, both central figures within these stories. Here, a notable shift in their relationship is being highlighted. The narrative suggests that Jacob has observed a significant change in Laban's countenance, or facial expression, which is seemingly indicative of his overall feelings or attitudes. 'Behold' this is an archaic term often used in these texts to emphasize an important observation or discovery. In this context, it underscores the change Jacob has noted in Laban’s demeanour. The phrase 'it was not toward him as before' suggests a change in the way Laban is directing his attention or attitude towards Jacob, namely that it's not as it previously was. The specifics of this change, whether it's a more hostile, less caring, or simply a different attitude, would be clarified within the broader context of their story. But in general, this verse captures a moment of change and possible tension between these two figures, paving the way for subsequent developments in their relationship."},{"question":"Write an article that answers the following question: how many points did marshall gain?","response":"Title: Decoding Marshall's Points Gain: An In-Depth Analysis Introduction The question \\"How many points did Marshall gain?\\" requires some context to provide an accurate and comprehensive answer. Since Marshall is a fairly common name, we must first identify which Marshall we are discussing: a sports player, a character from a story or TV show, or any other context in which points are involved. In this article, we will explore several scenarios in which a person named Marshall could potentially gain points and provide an in-depth analysis of each situation. Scenario 1: Marshall Faulk, American Football Player Marshall Faulk is a former American football player who played in the NFL as a running back for the Indianapolis Colts and the St. Louis Rams. He is widely regarded as one of the best running backs in the league's history. To determine Faulk's points gain, we would need to review his career statistics and calculate the number of touchdowns he scored. In his career, Faulk had 136 total touchdowns, including 100 rushing, 36 receiving touchdowns, and 2 punt returns. In American football, a touchdown is worth six points. Hence, Marshall Faulk gained a total of 816 points (136 touchdowns x 6). Scenario 2: Marshall Eriksen, Fictional Character from \\"How I Met Your Mother\\" Marshall Eriksen is a fictional character from the popular TV show \\"How I Met Your Mother.\\" Though there isn't a specific \\"points system\\" in the show for the characters, we can examine a pivotal moment in one of the show's episodes where Marshall takes part in a drinking game called \\"Edward Forty-Hands.\\" In this game, a person has two 40-ounce bottles taped to their hands and must finish them to win. While there is no exact points system for this game, we can consider Marshall's gain as a successful completion of the challenge and award him an arbitrary 1 point for his achievement. Scenario 3: Marshall Lee, Character from \\"Adventure Time\\" Marshall Lee is a fictional character from the animated TV show \\"Adventure Time.\\" He is the gender-swapped version of the character Marceline, a vampire queen, and a bass-playing musician. There is no established points system for this character in the series. However, if we were to create a point system for the musical performances of Marshall Lee, we could analyze his singing and playing skills in various episodes and assign points accordingly based on an adopted rating scheme (e.g., quality, style, voice, and melody). For this scenario, we would need to devise a clear evaluation system and review each individual performance to determine his points gain accurately. Conclusion The question \\"How many points did Marshall gain?\\" cannot be answered without proper context. As we explored various scenarios with characters named Marshall, we observed different points systems in each situation. Additionally, several contexts may not have any established point systems, requiring the creation of an evaluation method to determine their points gain. In conclusion, to answer this question accurately and comprehensively, the context surrounding Marshall and the point system must first be identified."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Question: What is the ful capacity of aircraft?

His friend Frank Mahoney (Bartlett Robinson) guards his hotel room door from reporters. Unable to sleep, Lindbergh reminisces about his time as an airmail pilot. Flying to Chicago in winter, Lindbergh lands his old de Havilland biplane in a small airfield to refuel. Despite the bad weather, he takes off, unaware the Chicago landing field has closed due to snow. After running out of fuel, Lindbergh bails out. Recovering mail from the crashed DH-4, he continues his journey by train and meets a suspender salesman who tells Lindbergh that two airmen just died competing for the Orteig Prize awarded to the first to fly nonstop from New York City to Paris. [N 1] From a diner, Lindbergh calls Columbia Aircraft Corporation in New York, pretending to represent a group of prominent businessmen. Quoted the price of 15,000 (equal to 204,339 today) for a Bellanca aircraft, Lindbergh lobbies St. Louis financiers, with a plan to fly 40 hours in a stripped-down, single-engine aircraft. Excited by his vision, the backers dub it Spirit of St. Louis. The Bellanca deal falls apart when the company demands their own pilot will fly the aircraft. Lindbergh then approaches Ryan Aeronautical Company in San Diego, California. Mahoney, the president of the company, promises to build him an aircraft in just 90 days. With Ryan's chief engineer Donald Hall (Arthur Space), a design is begun. To decrease weight, Lindbergh refuses to install radios or heavy equipment, even a parachute, and plans to navigate by \\"dead reckoning\\". [N 2]. Workers at the factory agree to work 24-hour shifts to complete the aircraft on time. Lindbergh flies his new aircraft to St. Louis, and on to New York.

By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon. Now, I have a new situation: In the Kenya-Tanzania border Kenyan grassland gradually merges into Tanzanian forest. Though they had similar soil to start with millions of years ago, today they are two different habitats. At present, Kenya has one of the largest contiguous grassland in Africa.

It was released to critical acclaim, but Brooks was given a hard time because of the album's cover, which was considered outrageous for the time. It came before a run of 16 albums in 25 years, starting with Two Days Away (1977), produced by the songwriting duo Leiber & Stoller, who had also worked with Elvis Presley and many others. Brooks also wrote some tracks with them. The hits \\"Pearl's a Singer\\" and \\"Sunshine After the Rain\\" came from this album. The albums Shooting Star (1978) and Live and Learn (1979) also saw success along with the singles \\"Lilac Wine\\" and \\"Don't Cry Out Loud\\". However, her polished, powerful cover of Gallagher and Lyle's \\"The Runaway\\", with the Scottish singer-songwriters themselves on backing vocals, was only a minor chart entry. In 1980, Brooks performed at the Knebworth Festival with the Beach Boys, Santana and Mike Oldfield. Pearls, released in 1981 achieved the biggest success of her career. \\"Fool (If You Think It's Over)\\" was a hit for Brooks taken from this album, written by Chris Rea. Pearls II (1982), Minutes (1984) and Screen Gems (1984), were all UK chart hits. In 1986, she sang the title song for the BBC television series \\"A Very Peculiar Practice\\". The song, written by Dave Greenslade, was never released as a commercial recording. In early 1987, the song \\"No More the Fool\\" became her biggest hit single to date while the parent album reached the top five. This led to her achieving a career peak, as she had two albums and a single in the top ten all on the same week. Following chart success ensued with the albums The Very Best of Elkie Brooks (1986), Bookbinder's Kid (1988), Inspiration (1989), Round Midnight (1993), Nothin' but the Blues (1994), Amazing (1996) and The Very Best of Elkie Brooks (1997).

They address different situations and require separate responses. First question: \\"How do I handle a verbal fight in the workplace (it just happened), knowing this person will mark me as an 'enemy' and I will probably meet this person in the same 'work community' later?\\" To handle a verbal fight in the workplace, follow these steps: 1. Find a safe space to cool down: After the argument, it's essential to distance yourself from the person involved and calm your emotions to think objectively about the situation. 2. Reflect on the conflict: Spend some time considering what led to the fight and analyze your emotions, reactions, and the words exchanged. 3. Seek advice from a trusted colleague or mentor: Discuss the situation with someone who understands the dynamics of your workplace and can provide guidance and insight. 4. Apologize if necessary: If you find that you were responsible for the escalation, an apology to the other person involved can go a long way in mending the relationship. 5. Talk to your supervisor or HR: If the conflict affects your ability to work effectively, it's essential to have a discussion with your supervisor or HR to mediate the situation. 6. Develop a plan to improve communication: To prevent future conflicts, take the initiative to establish better communication methods with the person involved and maintain a professional demeanor. 7. Practice active listening: When in meetings or interactions with this person, focus on truly understanding their perspective and ask questions for clarity instead of reacting defensively. 8. Maintain a positive attitude: Try not to let the conflict affect your work or your relationships with other colleagues. Be cooperative and stay focused on your tasks. Second question: \\"How do I know a long distance relationship will work in person?\\" Determining whether a long distance relationship will work in person can be challenging, but you can look for the following signs: 1. Strong communication: If you and your partner have maintained regular, open, and honest communication during your long-distance relationship, it's a good sign that you two can work well in person. 2. Similar values and expectations: Ensure both of you have shared values and expectations regarding your relationship, future goals, and personal boundaries. 3. Trust and support: A strong foundation of trust and willingness to support each other emotionally, and in your individual pursuits, indicate that your relationship may thrive when you're physically together. 4. Conflict resolution skills: Every relationship experiences disagreements, but if you and your partner can resolve conflicts respectfully and constructively even from afar, it bodes well for your relationship in person. 5. Shared vision of the future: Discuss your long-term personal and relationship goals, and make sure you're both on the same page about where you see yourselves in the future. 6. Enjoy each other's company: During your virtual or in-person interactions, pay attention to how much you enjoy spending time with your partner. High levels of positive engagement usually mean that your relationship will continue to be enjoyable when you're together. 7. Plan visits: Schedule in-person visits whenever possible, as spending physical time together will allow you both to get a better sense of how your relationship performs in person. 8. Follow your instincts: Trust your intuition and listen to what your gut is telling you about the relationship. If you feel a strong connection and believe that you can make it work in person, chances are you're right.

He is taken for interrogation to the Schloss Adler, a fortress high in the Alps of southern Bavaria. A team of Allied commandos, led by British Major John Smith (Richard Burton) and U.S. Army Ranger Lieutenant Morris Schaffer (Clint Eastwood), is briefed by Colonel Turner (Patrick Wymark) and Admiral Rolland (Michael Hordern) of MI6. Their mission is to parachute in, infiltrate the castle, and rescue General Carnaby (Robert Beatty) before the Germans can interrogate him. MI6 Agent Mary Elison (Mary Ure) accompanies the mission in secret, her presence known only to Major Smith. Early in the mission, two of the operatives are mysteriously killed, but Major Smith is unperturbed, keeping Lt. Schaffer as a close ally and secretly updating Rolland and Turner on developments by radio. After seeming to give up and allowing themselves to be captured, Smith and Schaffer (being officers) are separated from the three remaining members of the group â Thomas (William Squire), Berkeley (Peter Barkworth) and Christiansen (Donald Houston). Smith and Schaffer kill their captors, blow up a supply depot, and prepare an escape route for later use before hitching a ride on top of a cable car â the only approach to the castle. Mary, posing as a maid, is brought into the castle by Heidi (Ingrid Pitt), a deep-cover agent working as a barmaid in the nearby village; Major von Hapen (Derren Nesbitt), a Gestapo officer whom Heidi has been cultivating, becomes infatuated with Mary. Mary sets a rope through one of the castle windows for Smith and Schaffer to climb. Carnaby's interrogation, carried out by General Rosemeyer (Ferdy Mayne) and Colonel Kramer (Anton Diffring), is underway when the three other prisoners arrive and reveal themselves to be German double agents. Smith and Schaffer intrude, weapons drawn, but Smith then forces Schaffer to disarm...

A:","response":"Step 1: Identify the period of time when the steam engine was initially introduced in the English empire. Justification: Knowing the timeframe will help us better understand the context of the question and will allow us to focus on the relevant industry or commodity in that period. Step 2: Research the industries prevalent during the initial period of the steam engine's introduction. Justification: Gaining knowledge of the industries in that time period will help us narrow down the possible commodities that may have benefited from the steam engine. Step 3: Analyze the impact of the steam engine on these industries, focusing on which industry experienced the most significant growth or change as a result of the steam engine. Justification: The industry that saw the most growth or change will likely be the one that benefited the most from the steam engine during its initial introduction. Step 4: Identify the primary commodity produced by this industry. Justification: Understanding the most significant product of the industry will help us provide a specific answer to the user's question. So, based on these steps: Step 1: The steam engine was initially introduced in the English empire in the early 18th century, with key inventions made by Thomas Savery and Thomas Newcomen, and later improved by James Watt in the 1760s and 1770s. Step 2: The main industries during this period were textile, mining, iron, and agriculture. Step 3: The steam engine had a significant impact on many industries, but the mining and textile industries saw the greatest benefits during the initial period. The steam engine allowed for greater productivity and efficiency by pumping water out of mines, and the textile industry benefited from spinning and weaving machines powered by steam engines. Step 4: The primary commodity produced by the mining industry was coal, and the primary commodity produced by the textile industry was cotton. Conclusion: The commodity that benefited most by the steam engine initially in the English empire was coal. Coal was the primary commodity produced in the mining industry, which saw significant improvements in efficiency and productivity due to the introduction of the steam engine for pumping water out of mines."},{"question":"Question: Read the below conversation. M: Today on mind matters, I'm talking to Dr Ann Winters, an expert on human memory.. Ann, welcome to the program. Now, I suppose the first question everyone would ask is: what exactly is human memory? W: Well, like so many easy questions, the answer isn't very simple. Basically, human memory is a compartment in people's brains where they store images rather like the hard disc drive in a computer. And like a hard disc drive, our memories can become infected or even wiped out by accidents. But the comparison breaks down when we consider that we can train our memories to expand and work better which computers can't manage yet. M: When you talk about memory being infected, do you mean by a disease? W: Yes. For instance, people suffering from a physiological disease like Alzheimer: forget things that happened in the past. And they also forget how to perform simple tasks like tying their shoelaces. The good news is that brain exercises can help keep the brain young. Research has shown that people who have better educations and more mentally active jobs have a lower risk of developing the disease. M: And how can someone exercise his brain? By thinking a lot? W: In a way, yes. But you can also practice using your memory which not only exercises your brain but also improves you ability to remember things. Unfortunately, a lot of devices in modern life are designed to make sure we don't forget things which can make our brains more idle and weaken our memories.

The ceremony was attended by Lennon's son Julian and his first wife Cynthia in a park overlooking the River Mersey in this northwest English city, where the singer-songwriter and his fellow Beatles launched their careers. \\"We come here with our hearts to honour Dad and to pray for peace and say 'thank you' to each and every one of you, and everybody involved in the celebrations today,\\" said Julian Lennon, 47. His 71-year-old mother Cynthia, who met Lennon at Liverpool Art College, added that people should not mourn him but should enjoy his life. \\"Don't be morbid, enjoy the joy that he had and what we all have from his music,\\" she told the crowd of dignitaries and fans from all over the world who gathered in the city's Chavasse Park for the unveiling ceremony. It was one of a number of events planned worldwide to celebrate Lennon's birthday and his legacy, 30 years after he was shot dead outside his Manhattan apartment in December 1980. His widow, Yoko Ono, took part in celebrations in Iceland -- even though she admitted Lennon had never liked to mark the progress of time. \\"The last birthday, he told me: 'I can't quite believe I'm going to be 40'. I don't think he liked that part,\\" she said in an interview published in The Times newspaper Saturday. \\"I don't think of him as 70. He was always that sort of strutting around, very, very energetic guy, and to me he's still like that,\\" she continued, adding: \\"I think he would have aged well, he had a good bone structure.\\" The 77-year-old was due to light up the \\"Imagine Peace Tower\\" in the Icelandic capital Reykjavik later Saturday, before performing with her Ono Plastic Band and her son Sean Lennon at an evening concert in the capital. The tower, a three-year-old art installation composed of a strong, vertical beam of light which can reach up to 4,000 meters (13,100 feet), is lit up every year and stays lit until December 8, the anniversary of his death. Organisers of the Liverpool monument hope their new sculpture can provide an alternative base for Lennon's fans. Designed by US artist Lauren Voiers and commissioned by a US arts organisation, the Global Peace Initiative, it comprises a globe with multicoloured symbols of peace and musical references swirled above it. There are two hands outstretched to the sky, doves of peace, a keyboard and a white feather, which Julian Lennon said was a symbol of his father's spirit. \\"One of the things my father said to me was that should he pass away, if there was some way of letting me know he was going to be OK, it was by, in some shape or form, presenting me with a white feather,\\" he said. Asked how her husband would have faced the modern world today, Yoko Ono said he would have loved computers and would have used them to make music and communicate around the world. Lennon would also have remained a peace activist, she said: \\"He would have been very, very angry that violence and war are still going on.\\" Copyright © 2010 AFP. All rights reserved.

Terms sometimes used synonymously but with more precise meanings are: cryptic species for two or more species hidden under one species name, sibling species for two cryptic species that are each other's closest relative, and species flock for a group of closely related species living in the same habitat. As informal taxonomic ranks, species group, species aggregate, and superspecies are also in use. - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. - The International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN) is the set of rules and recommendations dealing with the formal botanical names that are given to plants, fungi and a few other groups of organisms, all those \\"traditionally treated as algae, fungi, or plants\\". It was formerly called the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN); the name was changed at the International Botanical Congress in Melbourne in July 2011 as part of the \\"Melbourne Code\\" which replaces the \\"Vienna Code\\" of 2005. As with previous codes, it took effect as soon as it was ratified by the congress (on Saturday 23 July 2011), but the documentation of the code in its final form was not finished until some time after the congressional meeting. Preliminary wording of some of the articles with the most significant changes has been published in September 2011. - Botany, also called plant science(s), plant biology or phytology, is the science of plant life and a branch of biology. A botanist or plant scientist is a scientist who specialises in this field. The term \\"botany\\" comes from the Ancient Greek word (\\"botan\\") meaning \\"pasture\\", \\"grass\\", or \\"fodder\\"; is in turn derived from (\\"boskein\\"), \\"to feed\\" or \\"to graze\\". Traditionally, botany has also included the study of fungi and algae by mycologists and phycologists respectively, with the study of these three groups of organisms remaining within the sphere of interest of the International Botanical Congress. Nowadays, botanists study approximately 400,000 species of living organisms of which some 260,000 species are vascular plants and about 248,000 are flowering plants. - Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia (also called Metazoa). The animal kingdom emerged as a basal clade within Apoikozoa as a sister of the choanoflagellates. Sponges are the most basal clade of animals. Animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently at some point in their lives. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later in their lives. All animals are heterotrophs: they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance. - The plural (abbreviated ), in many languages, is one of the values of the grammatical category of number. Plural of nouns typically denote a quantity other than the default quantity represented by a noun, which is generally one (the form that represents this default quantity is said to be of \\"singular\\" number). Most commonly, therefore, plurals are used to denote two or more of something, although they may also denote more than fractional, zero or negative amounts. An example of a plural is the English word \\"cats\\", which corresponds to the singular \\"cat\\". - Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), they are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix. - FOSSIL is a standard protocol for allowing serial communication for telecommunications programs under the DOS operating system. FOSSIL is an acronym for \\"Fido Opus SEAdog Standard Interface Layer\\". \\"Fido\\" refers to FidoBBS, \\"Opus\\" refers to Opus-CBCS BBS, and \\"SEAdog\\" refers to a Fidonet compatible mailer. The standards document that defines the FOSSIL protocol is maintained by the Fidonet Technical Standards Committee. - In ecology, a niche is a term with a variety of meanings related to the behavior of a species living under specific environmental conditions. The ecological niche describes how an organism or population responds to the distribution of resources and competitors (for example, by growing when resources are abundant, and when predators, parasites and pathogens are scarce) and how it in turn alters those same factors (for example, limiting access to resources by other organisms, acting as a food source for predators and a consumer of prey). \\"The type and number of variables comprising the dimensions of an environmental niche vary from one species to another [and] the relative importance of particular environmental variables for a species may vary according to the geographic and biotic contexts\\". - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - In biology, offspring are the young born of living organisms, produced either by a single organism or, in the case of sexual reproduction, two organisms. Collective offspring may be known as a brood or progeny in a more general way. This can refer to a set of simultaneous offspring, such as the chicks hatched from one clutch of eggs, or to all the offspring, as with the honeybee. - Biology is a natural science concerned with the study of life and living organisms, including their structure, function, growth, evolution, distribution, identification and taxonomy. Modern biology is a vast and eclectic field, composed of many branches and subdisciplines. However, despite the broad scope of biology, there are certain general and unifying concepts within it that govern all study and research, consolidating it into single, coherent field. In general, biology recognizes the cell as the basic unit of life, genes as the basic unit of heredity, and evolution as the engine that propels the synthesis and creation of new species. It is also understood today that all the organisms survive by consuming and transforming energy and by regulating their internal environment to maintain a stable and vital condition known as homeostasis. - In biological classification , rank is the relative level of a group of organisms ( a taxon ) in a taxonomic hierarchy . Examples of taxonomic ranks are species , genus , family , class , kingdom , etc. A given rank subsumes under it less general categories , that is , more specific descriptions of life forms . Above it , each rank is classified within more general categories of organisms and groups of organisms related to each other through inheritance of traits or features from common ancestors . The rank of any species and the description of its genus is basic ; which means that to identify a particular organism , it is usually not necessary to specify ranks other than these first two . Consider a particular species , the red fox Vulpes vulpes : its next rank , the genus Vulpes , comprises all the ' true foxes ' . Their closest relatives are in the immediately higher rank , the family Canidae , which includes dogs , wolves , jackals , all foxes , and other caniforms ; the next higher rank , the order Carnivora , includes feliforms and caniforms ( lions , tigers , bears , hyenas , wolverines , and all those mentioned above ) , plus other carnivorous mammals . As one group of the class Mammalia , all of the above are classified among those with backbones in the Chordata phylum rank , and with them among all the animals in the Animalia kingdom rank . Finally , all of the above will find their earliest relatives somewhere in their domain rank Eukarya . The International Code of Zoological Nomenclature defines rank as : The level , for nomenclatural purposes , of a taxon in a taxonomic hierarchy ( e.g. all families are for nomenclatural purposes at the same rank , which lies between superfamily and subfamily ) - In biology, phylogenetics (Greek: , - \\"phylé\\", \\"phylon\\" = tribe, clan, race + - \\"genetikós\\" = origin, source, birth) is the study of the evolutionary history and relationships among individuals or groups of organisms (e.g. species, or populations). These relationships are discovered through phylogenetic inference methods that evaluate observed heritable traits, such as DNA sequences or morphology under a model of evolution of these traits. The result of these analyses is a phylogeny (also known as a phylogenetic tree) a diagrammatic hypothesis about the history of the evolutionary relationships of a group of organisms. The tips of a phylogenetic tree can be living organisms or fossils, and represent the \\"end,\\" or the present, in an evolutionary lineage. Phylogenetic analyses have become central to understanding biodiversity, evolution, ecology, and genomes. - In biology, a taxon (plural taxa; back-formation from \\"taxonomy\\") is a group of one or more populations of an organism or organisms seen by taxonomists to form a unit. Although neither is required, a taxon is usually known by a particular name and given a particular ranking, especially if and when it is accepted or becomes established. It is not uncommon, however, for taxonomists to remain at odds over what belongs to a taxon and the criteria used for inclusion. If a taxon is given a formal scientific name, its use is then governed by one of the nomenclature codes specifying which scientific name is correct for a particular grouping. - Ecdysozoa is a group of protostome animals, including Arthropoda (insects, chelicerata, crustaceans, and myriapods), nematoda, and several smaller phyla. They were first defined by Aguinaldo \\"et al.\\" in 1997, based mainly on phylogenetic trees constructed using 18S ribosomal RNA genes. A large study in 2008 by Dunn \\"et al.\\" strongly supported the Ecdysozoa as a clade, that is, a group consisting of a common ancestor and all its descendants. - In biology, a phylum (plural: phyla) is a taxonomic rank below kingdom and above class. Traditionally, in botany the term division was used instead of \\"phylum\\", although from 1993 the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants accepted the designation \\"phylum\\". Depending on definitions, the kingdom Animalia contains approximately 35 phyla, Plantae contains about 12, and Fungi contains around 7. Current research in phylogenetics is uncovering the relationships between phyla, which are contained in larger clades, like Ecdysozoa and Embryophyta. - Nomenclature codes or codes of nomenclature are the various rulebooks that govern biological taxonomic nomenclature, each in their own broad field of organisms. To an end-user who only deals with names of species, with some awareness that species are assignable to families, it may not be noticeable that there is more than one code, but beyond this basic level these are rather different in the way they work. - In biological classification, subspecies (abbreviated \\"subsp.\\" or \\"ssp.\\"; \\"plural\\": \\"subspecies\\") is either a taxonomic rank subordinate to species, or a taxonomic unit in that rank. A subspecies cannot be recognized independently: a species will either be recognized as having no subspecies at all or at least two (including any that are extinct). - Sexual reproduction is a form of reproduction where two morphologically distinct types of specialized reproductive cells called gametes fuse together, involving a female's large ovum (or egg) and a male's smaller sperm. Each gamete contains half the number of chromosomes of normal cells. They are created by a specialized type of cell division, which only occurs in eukaryotic cells, known as meiosis. The two gametes fuse during fertilization to produce DNA replication and the creation of a single-celled zygote which includes genetic material from both gametes. In a process called genetic recombination, genetic material (DNA) joins up so that homologous chromosome sequences are aligned with each other, and this is followed by exchange of genetic information. Two rounds of cell division then produce four daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes from each original parent cell, and the same number of chromosomes as both parents, though self-fertilization can occur. For instance, in human reproduction each human cell contains 46 chromosomes, 23 pairs, except gamete cells, which only contain 23 chromosomes, so the child will have 23 chromosomes from each parent genetically recombined into 23 pairs. Cell division initiates the development of a new individual organism in multicellular organisms, including animals and plants, for the vast majority of whom this is the primary method of reproduction. - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies. What is the relationship between 'taxonomic rank' and 'taxonomy'? The answer to this question is:","response":"Taxonomic rank is a level or position in the hierarchical system of biological classification, while taxonomy is the science and practice of classifying organisms into groups based on their shared characteristics and relationships. Taxonomic ranks include species, genus, family, order, class, phylum, and kingdom, among others. Taxonomy involves the identification, naming, and grouping of organisms into categories (taxa) based on their shared characteristics, and these categories are given specific taxonomic ranks within the classification system. Thus, taxonomic rank is a component of taxonomy, representing the various levels of organization within the overall system of classification."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: Where does Martha live?

It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States, such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music), and blues music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas. According to Lindsey Starnes, the term \\"country music\\" gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term \\"hillbilly music\\"; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term \\"country music\\" is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States. - \\"Something About a Woman\\" is a song co-written and recorded by American country music artist Jake Owen.

In French, \\"this\\" can be translated to either \\"ce\\", \\"cet\\", \\"cette\\" or \\"cela\\" depending on gender or number context and the distance implied. However, in this particular case, since we are talking about a general object or service being repaired, it's more appropriate to use \\"cela\\". 4. \\"for\\" is translated to \\"pour\\" in French which is used to indicate the price or cost. 5. \\"5 €\\" remains the same as it represents the currency (Euros). 6. \\"per day\\" can be translated to \\"par jour\\".

When iron gives up its 2 outer 4s electrons and also gives up an inner 3D electron? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","response":"No, these two questions are not paraphrases of each other. They address two completely different topics. The first question deals with rectifying a date of birth error in a birth certificate, while the second question pertains to the process of ionization in Iron atoms. Regarding the first question, in order to rectify the date of birth in a birth certificate, you should follow these steps: 1. Gather supporting documents: Collect all the necessary supporting documents that show your correct date of birth. These can include school records (such as SSLC marks card, as you mentioned), affidavits sworn by your parents, or any other valid identification documents. 2. Contact the issuing authority: Locate the office that issued your birth certificate. This is typically the municipal or civic authority in the area where you were born. In some cases, it could be the hospital where your birth took place. 3. Fill out an application form: Obtain the necessary application form for correcting the date of birth in your birth certificate. Fill it out accurately, and attach photocopies of your supporting documents. 4. Submit the application: Once you have completed the application form and gathered your supporting documents, submit the application to the relevant issuing authority. You may be required to pay a nominal fee for processing the application. 5. Await a response: After submitting your application, you will need to wait for the issuing authority to review it and make the necessary changes to your birth certificate. This process may take some time, so be patient. 6. Obtain your corrected birth certificate: Once the issuing authority has approved your application and made the necessary changes, you will be issued a new, corrected birth certificate. Ensure that you keep this document in a safe place for future reference. For the second question, when an iron atom loses its three electrons, it forms a 3+ cation (Fe³⁺). The process is as follows: 1. Ionization of 4s electrons: Initially, Iron has two 4s electrons in its outer shell. Upon ionization, these two 4s electrons are removed, resulting in an Fe²⁺ cation. 2. Ionization of 3d electron: After losing the two 4s electrons, Iron still has five 3d electrons in an inner shell. To become the Fe³⁺ ion, it loses one more electron from the 3d orbital. The process of an iron atom losing its 2 outer 4s electrons and also giving up an inner 3d electron describes how Iron forms the Fe³⁺ cation. This process occurs because of the energy required to remove the electrons (ionization energy), and the stability achieved by forming a 3+ cation."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: A recent survey of 2000 parents in Britain showed that they are often afraid of science questions asked by their curious children only because they have no idea what the answer is. Here is a list of some simple questions that you can ask your parents to see if they know the answers. Q: Why is the sky blue? A: You probably know white sunlight is made up of seven colors. While it moves in a straight line when going through space, it starts to divide as it hits \\"raised area\\" in the atmosphere. The ones with longest wavelengths pass through easily. The blue , however , can be taken in by the gas molecules because it has a shorter wavelength , which in turn scatters it in different directions. That's why when you look up at the sky, it appears to be blue. Q:Why does the moon sometimes appear during the daytime? A: The simple answer to that is because just like any other object it is being lit by the sun. As long as it is around 45 degrees or even 90 degrees off the sun, it will receive light and be able to be seen. The only time it is not able to be seen during its 28-day orbit around the earth is when it is right between the earth and the sun. That's because its back , which is not lit by the sun, is facing us. Q: Where do birds/ honeybees go in winter? A: While the bird part is quite easy, since a lot of them get together and travel, the honeybee part is likely to puzzle your parents. It turns out that these busy insects stop being that active when the temperature drops below 50degF. Instead ,they get together in the lower central area of the hive and form a ball around their queen. This helps keep both warm enough to survive the cold winter months. A:","response":"Which statement best explains the reason behind the sky appearing blue? a) The sky appears blue because sunlight is made up of seven colors and blue has the shortest wavelength. b) The gas molecules in the atmosphere absorb and scatter blue light in different directions, making the sky appear blue. c) The sky appears blue only during daytime due to the sun's position in the sky. d) The blue color is an optical illusion caused by the way our eyes perceive light. Answer: b) The gas molecules in the atmosphere absorb and scatter blue light in different directions, making the sky appear blue."},{"question":"Information: - New Guinea (or, historically, \\"\\") is a large Island in the South West Pacific region. - Indonesia (or ; Indonesian: ), officially the Republic of Indonesia, is a unitary sovereign state and transcontinental country located mainly in Southeast Asia with some territories in Oceania. Situated between the Indian and Pacific oceans, it is the world's largest island country, with more than seventeen thousand islands. At , Indonesia is the world's 14th-largest country in terms of land area and world's 7th-largest country in terms of combined sea and land area. It has an estimated population of over 260 million people and is the world's fourth most populous country, the most populous Austronesian nation, as well as the most populous Muslim-majority country. The world's most populous island of Java contains more than half of the country's population. - A stratovolcano, also known as a composite volcano, is a conical volcano built up by many layers (strata) of hardened lava, tephra, pumice, and volcanic ash. Unlike shield volcanoes, stratovolcanoes are characterized by a steep profile and periodic explosive eruptions and effusive eruptions, although some have collapsed craters called calderas. The lava flowing from stratovolcanoes typically cools and hardens before spreading far due to high viscosity. The magma forming this lava is often felsic, having high-to-intermediate levels of silica (as in rhyolite, dacite, or andesite), with lesser amounts of less-viscous mafic magma. Extensive felsic lava flows are uncommon, but have travelled as far as . - New Ireland Province, formerly New Mecklenburg, is the most northeastern province of Papua New Guinea. - Basalt (, , , or ) is a common extrusive igneous (volcanic) rock formed from the rapid cooling of basaltic lava exposed at or very near the surface of a planet or moon. Flood basalt describes the formation in a series of lava basalt flows. - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east. - Lihir Island (a.k.a. Niolam Island) is the largest island in the Lihir group of islands, 22 km long and 14.5 km wide, in Papua New Guinea's New Ireland Province. It consists of a complex of several overlapping basaltic stratovolcanoes rising 700 m above sea level. While the volcanoes are not currently active, geothermal activity is still present. The island is in what was the forearc basin associated with the subduction of the Pacific Plate beneath the North Bismarck Plate. Subduction stopped about 10 million years ago with the collision of the Ontong Java plateau with the subduction zone. - Subduction is a geological process that takes place at convergent boundaries of tectonic plates where one plate moves under another and is forced or sinks due to gravity into the mantle. Regions where this process occurs are known as \\"subduction zones\\". Rates of subduction are typically in centimeters per year, with the average rate of convergence being approximately two to eight centimeters per year along most plate boundaries. - Lihir Island Airport is an airport in Londolovit on Lihir Island in Papua New Guinea . The airport has a short unpaved runway long enough to handle a small jet . All flights leave at approximately 4 - 7am . The airport has significantly upgraded its facilities , which now includes air conditioning , x-ray machines and a renovated waiting area . It is assumed that this is because of the introduction of a new international flight to Cairns , Australia , operated by Airlines PNG . - The North Bismarck Plate is a small tectonic plate located in the Bismarck Sea off the northeast coast of New Guinea. - Melanesia is a subregion of Oceania (and occasionally Australasia) extending from the western end of the Pacific Ocean to the Arafura Sea, and eastward to Fiji. - The Pacific Plate is an oceanic tectonic plate that lies beneath the Pacific Ocean.

Its capital, located along its southeastern coast, is Port Moresby. The western half of New Guinea forms the Indonesian provinces of Papua and West Papua. - A forearc is the region between an oceanic trench and the associated volcanic arc. As such, forearc regions are found at convergent margins, and include any accretionary wedge and forearc basin that may be present. Due to tectonic stresses as one tectonic plate rides over another, forearc regions are sources for great thrust earthquakes - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney. - Oceania (or ), also known as Oceanica, is a region centred on the islands of the tropical Pacific Ocean. Opinions of what constitutes Oceania range from its three subregions of Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia to, more broadly, the entire insular region between Southeast Asia and the Americas, including Australasia and the Malay Archipelago. - The Ontong Java Plateau (OJP) is a huge oceanic plateau located in the south-west Pacific Ocean, north of the Solomon Islands. The OJP was emplaced 120 Ma with a much smaller volcanic event 90 Ma. Two other south-west Pacific plateaus, Manihiki and Hikurangi, now separated from the OJP by Cretaceous ocean basins, are of similar age and composition and probably formed as a single plateau and a contiguous large igneous province together with the OJP. When emplaced this Ontong Java-Manihiki-Hikurangi plateau covered 1% of Earth's surface and represented a volume of of basaltic magma. This \\"Onotong Java event\\", first proposed in 1991, represents the largest volcanic event of the past 200 million years, with a magma emplacement rate estimated at up to /year over three million years, several times larger than the Deccan Traps.

The actress best known for her roles in the West End and Oliver frequented a Music Hall registered for what? Answer:","response":"The actress best known for her roles in the West End and in the musical Oliver! is undoubtedly Georgia Brown. Born as Lillian Claire Laizer Getel Klot in 1933, Georgia Brown was an esteemed English actress and singer. She rose to stardom for her portrayal of Nancy, a key character in the stage musical Oliver!, which premiered in the West End in 1960. Brown's performance earned her critical acclaim and solidified her status as a luminary in the world of theatre. In the context of Georgia Brown frequenting a Music Hall, it is crucial to understand the significance and prominence of Music Halls in London during the era in which Brown thrived. Music Halls were popular entertainment venues prevalent in the 19th and early-to-mid 20th century, particularly in the United Kingdom. These establishments hosted a variety of live music, comedy, and other performances, often showcasing a diverse array of artists and acts. Returning to the question at hand, it is essential to pinpoint which Music Hall Georgia Brown might have frequented that was also \\"registered for\\" a specific purpose. While we do not have any concrete evidence of her patronage at a particular establishment, it is entirely plausible that Brown attended various historic music halls that were prevalent in London during her time in the West End. Renowned venues such as Wilton's Music Hall, Hoxton Hall, and Collins' Music Hall, all of which were registered, were likely to have been among her haunts. As for what purpose a Music Hall might have been registered, there are several possibilities, with the most plausible being for public entertainment licenses. Music halls were required to apply for licenses for music, singing, and dancing, a process overseen by the local authorities. Furthermore, they may have needed to be registered for alcohol serving permits, catering to the demands of their clientele who would often drink during performances. Lastly, the registration could pertain to affiliations with entertainment guilds and associations, as these organizations frequently held sway over the running of music halls in that era. In summary, Georgia Brown, best known for her roles in the West End and the musical Oliver!, may have often visited various historical music halls in London, famous for their live performances.

Bristol was founded by 1000; by about 1020, it was a trading centre with a mint producing silver pennies bearing its name. By 1067 Brycgstow was a well-fortified burh, and that year the townsmen beat off a raiding party from Ireland led by three of Harold Godwinson's sons. Under Norman rule, the town had one of the strongest castles in southern England. Bristol was the place of exile for Diarmait Mac Murchada, the Irish king of Leinster, after being overthrown. The Bristol merchants subsequently played a prominent role in funding Richard Strongbow de Clare and the Norman invasion of Ireland. The port developed in the 11th century around the confluence of the Rivers Frome and Avon, adjacent to Bristol Bridge just outside the town walls. By the 12th century Bristol was an important port, handling much of England's trade with Ireland, including slaves. There was also an important Jewish community in Bristol from the late 12th century through to the late 13th century when all Jews were expelled from England. The stone bridge built in 1247 was replaced by the current bridge during the 1760s. The town incorporated neighbouring suburbs and became a county in 1373, the first town in England to be given this status. During this period, Bristol became a shipbuilding and manufacturing centre. By the 14th century Bristol, York and Norwich were England's largest medieval towns after London. One-third to one-half of the population died in the Black Death of 1348–49, which checked population growth, and its population remained between 10,000 and 12,000 for most of the 15th and 16th centuries.

The shoes- named Square Eyes- contain an electronic pressure sensor and a tiny computer chip to record how many steps the wearer has taken in a day. A wireless transmitter passes the information to a receiver connected to a television, and this decides how much evening viewing time the wearer deserves , based on the day's efforts. The design was inspired by a desire to fight against the rapidly ballooning waistlines among British teenagers, says Gillian Swan, who developed Square Eyes as a final year design project at Brunel University in London, UK. \\"We looked at current issues and childhood overweight really stood out,\\" she says. \\"And I wanted to tackle that with my design.\\" Once a child has used up their daily allowance gained through exercise, the television automatically switches off. And further time in front of the TV can only be earned through more steps. Swan calculated how exercise should translate to television time using the recommended daily amounts of both. Health experts suggest that a child take 12,000 steps each day and watch no more than two hours of television. So, every 100 steps recorded by the Square Eyes shoes equals exactly one minute of TV time. Existing pedometers normally clip onto a belt or slip into a pocket and keep count of steps by measuring sudden movement. Swan says these can be easily tricked into recording steps through shaking. But her shoe has been built to be harder for lazy teenagers to cheat. \\"It is possible, but it would be a lot of effort,\\" she says. \\"That was one of my main design considerations.\\" Options: A They control a child's evening TV viewing time.

If he initially had 80 white cookies, how many cookies are remaining within the cookie jar altogether? Thoughts? Step-by-step reasoning:","response":"Let's solve this problem step by step. 1. Initially, Cristian has 80 white cookies in his cookie jar. 2. He has 50 more black cookies than white cookies. 3. Therefore, he has 80 white cookies + 50 = 130 black cookies. 4. Cristian eats half of the black cookies, which means he eats (1/2) * 130 black cookies = 65 black cookies. 5. After eating 65 black cookies, he has 130 - 65 = 65 black cookies remaining in the cookie jar. 6. Cristian eats 3/4 of the white cookies, which means he eats (3/4) * 80 white cookies = 60 white cookies. 7. After eating 60 white cookies, he has 80 - 60 = 20 white cookies remaining in the cookie jar. 8. Finally, the total number of cookies remaining in the cookie jar is the sum of the remaining black and white cookies, which is 65 black cookies + 20 white cookies = 85 cookies in total.

With a population of over 1.381 billion, it is the world's most populous country. The state is governed by the Communist Party of China, and its capital is Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau), and claims sovereignty over Taiwan. The country's major urban areas include Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Tianjin and Hong Kong. China is a great power and a major regional power within Asia, and has been characterized as a potential superpower. - Salyut 5 (meaning \\"Salute 5\\"), also known as OPS-3, was a Soviet space station. Launched in 1976 as part of the Salyut programme, it was the third and last Almaz space station to be launched for the Soviet military. Two Soyuz missions visited the station, each manned by two cosmonauts. A third Soyuz mission attempted to visit the station, but failed to dock, whilst a fourth mission was planned but never launched. - Vitaly Mikhaylovich Zholobov (born 18 June 1937) is a retired Soviet cosmonaut who flew on Soyuz 21 space flight as the flight engineer. - Human spaceflight (also referred to as manned spaceflight) is space travel with a crew or passengers aboard the spacecraft. Spacecraft carrying people may be operated directly, by human crew, or it may be either remotely operated from ground stations on Earth or be autonomous, able to carry out a specific mission with no human involvement. - The Almaz (\\"Diamond\\") program was a highly secretive Soviet military space station program, begun in the early 1960s. - Mir (; lit. \\"peace\\" or \\"world\\") was a space station that operated in low Earth orbit from 1986 to 2001, run by the Soviet Union and later by Russia. \\"Mir\\" was the first modular space station and was assembled in orbit from 1986 to 1996. It had a greater mass than any previous spacecraft. At the time it was the largest artificial satellite in orbit, succeeded by the International Space Station after Mir's orbit decayed. The station served as a microgravity research laboratory in which crews conducted experiments in biology, human biology, physics, astronomy, meteorology and spacecraft systems with a goal of developing technologies required for permanent occupation of space. - The International Space Station (ISS) is a space station, or a habitable artificial satellite, in low Earth orbit. Its first component launched into orbit in 1998, and the ISS is now the largest artificial body in orbit and can often be seen with the naked eye from Earth. The ISS consists of pressurised modules, external trusses, solar arrays, and other components. ISS components have been launched by Russian Proton and Soyuz rockets, and American Space Shuttles. - Tiangong-2 is a Chinese space laboratory and part of the Project 921-2 space station program. Tiangong-2 was launched on 15 September 2016, 22:04:09 (UTC+8). - A low Earth orbit (LEO) is an orbit around Earth with an altitude between (orbital period of about 88 minutes), and (about 127 minutes). Objects below approximately will experience very rapid orbital decay and altitude loss. - Soyuz 5 (\\"Union 5\\") was a Soyuz mission using the Soyuz 7K-OK spacecraft launched by the Soviet Union on 15 January 1969, which docked with Soyuz 4 in orbit. It was the first-ever docking of two manned spacecraft of any nation, and the first-ever transfer of crew from one space vehicle to another of any nation, the only time a transfer was accomplished with a space walk two months before the US Apollo 9 mission performed the first ever internal crew transfer. - Tiangong-1 is China's first prototype space station, serving as both a manned laboratory and an experimental testbed to demonstrate orbital rendezvous and docking capabilities. Launched unmanned aboard a Long March 2F/G rocket on 29 September 2011, it is the first operational component of the Tiangong program, which aims to place a larger, modular station into orbit by 2023. Tiangong-1 was initially projected to be deorbited in 2013, to be replaced over the following decade by the larger Tiangong-2 and Tiangong-3 modules, but as of October 2016 it was still aloft, though in a decaying orbit. - A spacecraft is a vehicle, or machine designed to fly in outer space. Spacecraft are used for a variety of purposes, including communications, earth observation, meteorology, navigation, space colonization, planetary exploration, and transportation of humans and cargo. - Boris Valentinovich Volynov (born 18 December 1934) is a Soviet cosmonaut who flew two space missions of the Soyuz programme: Soyuz 5, and Soyuz 21. He was the first halakhic (by mother) Jewish cosmonaut. - The Soyuz programme (or meaning \\"Union\\") is a human spaceflight programme that was initiated by the Soviet Union in the early 1960s, originally part of a Moon landing project intended to put a Soviet cosmonaut on the Moon. It was the third Soviet human spaceflight programme after the Vostok and Voskhod programme. - Landing is the last part of a flight, where a flying animal, aircraft, or spacecraft returns to the ground. When the flying object returns to water, the process is called alighting, although it is commonly called \\"landing,\\" \\"touchdown\\" or \\"splashdown\\" as well. A normal aircraft flight would include several parts of flight including taxi, takeoff, climb, cruise, descent and landing. - A space station, also known as an orbital station or an orbital space station, is a spacecraft capable of supporting crewmembers, which is designed to remain in space (most commonly as an artificial satellite in low Earth orbit) for an extended period of time and for other spacecraft to dock. A space station is distinguished from other spacecraft used for human spaceflight by lack of major propulsion or landing systems. Instead, other vehicles transport people and cargo to and from the station. three space stations are in orbit: the International Space Station, which is permanently manned, China's Tiangong-1 (defunct) and Tiangong-2 (launched 15 September 2016, not permanently manned). Previous stations include the Almaz and Salyut series, Skylab, and most recently \\"Mir\\". - Soyuz 21 ( Russian : 21 , Union 21 ) was a 1976 Soviet manned mission to the Salyut 5 space station , the first of three flights to the station . The mission 's objectives were mainly military in scope , but included other scientific work . The mission ended abruptly with cosmonauts Boris Volynov and Vitaly Zholobov returning to earth after 49 days in orbit . The precise reason for the early end of the mission was the subject of much speculation , but was reported to be an emergency evacuation after the Salyut atmosphere developed an acrid odor . - Skylab was the United States' first space station, orbiting Earth from 1973 to 1979, when it fell back to Earth amid huge worldwide media attention. Launched and operated by NASA, Skylab included a workshop, a solar observatory, and other systems necessary for crew survival and scientific experiments. It was launched unmanned by a modified Saturn V rocket, with a weight of . Lifting Skylab into low earth orbit was the final mission and launch of a Saturn V rocket (which was famous for carrying the manned Moon landing missions). Skylab was not simply a place of habitation; it was a place of massive science experiments for which when the bulk of data was returned, such as on films that had to be physically returned to Earth began the process of analyzing scientific and engineering data as each mission was completed. Skylab's solar observatory was one major aspect of study, and solar science was significantly advanced by the telescope; it observed the Sun as it never before.

This allows for a smoother cut without having jagged edges. It also helps prevent kickback if you’re using an electric saw. Ensure you’re using a blade meant for cutting plastic. Use a thicker blade so the plastic does not melt and stick back together. If you are trying to cut out smaller windows in larger sheets or making small handheld crafts, use a craft blade to chip away small bits of plastic. Drill holes to use as starting points for the blade and shave away the plastic until you reach the guide lines. Clamp a piece of straight wood across the plastic with the line you intend to cut hanging slightly over the edge to cut a straight line. Guide the saw through the plastic sheet, keeping your hand on the wide portion of the saw shoe. Jigsaws allow for better mobility as you make curved cuts into the plastic. Using a blade with 10 teeth per inch, turn the plastic to make the shapes you need. Drill holes in the plastic along the guide lines so your blade has places to start and stop easily. Make straight relief cuts from the outside of the plastic to the curves. This will help prevent the plastic from warping and shortens the cutting distance. Leave room between the guide lines you’ve drawn and where you cut. You can always file these down later. This type of saw makes cuts only when you pull it, unlike other hand saws that cut when you push and pull it. A pull saw helps make a cleaner, smoother line in your plastic and may be easier for making shorter straight cuts than an electric saw. Use your thumb to guide the blade when you make the initial cut. From there, place the saw into the line you’ve made and pull the saw through.

Article: Many animal and plant species have become extinct and many more are in critical danger. Finding ways to protect the earth's wildlife and conserve the natural world they inhabit is now more important than ever. Dodo The Dodo is a classic example of how human caused damage to the earth's biology. The flightless Dodo was native to the Island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean. It lived off fruit fallen from the island's trees and lived unthreatened until humans arrived in 1505. The easily controlled bird became a source of food for sailors and was attacked by animals introduced to the island by humans such as pigs, monkeys and rats. The population of Dodos rapidly decreased and last one was killed in 1681. Rhinos The Rhino horn is a highly priced item for Asian medicine. This has led to the animal being hunted in its natural habitat. Once widespread in Africa and Eurasia, most rhinos now live in protected natural parks and reserves . Their numbers have rapidly decreased in the last 50 years, and the animals remain under constant threat from poachers . The Giant Panda The future of the World Wildlife Fund's symbol is far from certain. As few as 1000 remain in the wild. The Chinese government has set up 33 panda reserves to protect these beautiful animals and made poaching them punishable with 20 years in prison. However, The panda's distinct black and white patched coat fetches a high price on the black market and determined poachers still pose one of the most serious threats to the animals continued existence. Whales The International Whaling Commission is fighting to ensure the survival of the whale species. Despite the fact that one-third the world's oceans have been declared whale sanctuaries , 7 out of 13 whale species remain endangered. Hunted for their rich supply of oil, their numbers have decreased to just 300. Collisions with ships, poisonous pollution and being caught in fishing nets are other major causes of whale deaths.

The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with the work being reviewed, suggesting that the author, Morris, manipulates the facts in order to support their argument. Additionally, the reviewer recommends an alternative resource, John Larson's \\"Summer for the Gods,\\" as a more evenhanded account, implying that the work by Morris is not balanced or fair in its representation of the subject matter. There are several key elements in the review that indicate its negative tone: 1. The use of the term \\"very slanted\\" in the title suggests a strong bias in the work reviewed, indicating that it does not present a well-rounded, objective view of the topic. 2. The phrase \\"Morris, as ever, twists the facts around to make his case\\" implies that the author has a history of manipulating information to pursue their agenda, which is a negative criticism of their writing and argumentative style. 3. The statement \\"it doesn't hold together\\" indicates that the reviewer believes the work's overall argument is weak and lacks coherence. 4. The comparison of the work to John Larson's \\"Summer for the Gods\\" highlights the reviewer's preference for what they perceive as a more balanced and well-researched alternative. The mention of the Pulitzer Prize-winning status of the alternative work aims to further emphasize the reviewer's dissatisfaction with Morris's work and bolster the credibility of their criticism.

Lennon met Cynthia Powell (1939–2015) in 1957, when they were fellow students at the Liverpool College of Art. Although Powell was intimidated by Lennon's attitude and appearance, she heard that he was obsessed with the French actress Brigitte Bardot, so she dyed her hair blonde. Lennon asked her out, but when she said that she was engaged, he screamed out, \\"I didn't ask you to fuckin' marry me, did I?\\" She often accompanied him to Quarrymen gigs and travelled to Hamburg with McCartney's girlfriend to visit him. Lennon was jealous by nature and eventually grew possessive, often terrifying Powell with his anger and physical violence. Lennon later said that until he met Ono, he had never questioned his chauvinistic attitude toward women. He said that the Beatles song \\"Getting Better\\" told his own story, \\"I used to be cruel to my woman, and physically – any woman. I was a hitter. I couldn't express myself and I hit.

Is there something that can travel faster than light? Would you say that these questions are the same?","response":"1. To answer the first question, \\"Is anything in the universe faster than light?\\" Step 1: Research the speed of light and the current understanding of physics. Justification: Understanding the speed of light and its significance in physics is crucial for answering the question. Step 2: Investigate if there are any known or theorized phenomena that could potentially be faster than light. Justification: This step helps to identify if anything in the universe has been discovered or hypothesized to be faster than light. Step 3: Evaluate the credibility of the sources and the scientific consensus on these phenomena. Justification: In order to provide a reliable answer, it is necessary to ensure that the information is based on credible sources and widely accepted scientific theories. Based on the current understanding of physics, especially Einstein's Theory of Relativity, the speed of light (approximately 299,792 kilometers per second) is considered the ultimate speed limit in the universe. Nothing with mass is known to travel faster than light. 2. To answer the second question, \\"Is there something that can travel faster than light?\\" Using the justifications and steps above, the answer remains the same as the first question: based on our current understanding of physics, there is no known phenomena or object that can travel faster than light. 3. To answer the third question, \\"Would you say that these questions are the same?\\" Although the questions are phrased differently, they fundamentally ask the same thing: whether there is something in the universe that can surpass the speed of light.

Aaliyah purposely stayed away from reviews of the film to \\"make it easier on\\" herself, but she heard \\"that people were able to get into me, which is what I wanted.\\" In contrast, some critics felt there was no chemistry between her and Jet Li, as well as viewing the film was too simplistic. This was echoed by Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times, who wrote that while Aaliyah was \\"a natural\\" and the film was conceived as a spotlight for both her and Li, \\"they have so little chemistry together you'd think they're putting out a fire instead of shooting off sparks.

By the time he entered Livermore High School, he was a star in baseball and basketball. In 1982, as a senior, he struck out 121 batters in 66 innings, and threw a perfect game in his last high school start. He also played on a Bercovich team that assembled top players from throughout California. Johnson was sidelined throughout much of the 1996 season with a back injury, but he rebounded in 1997 with a 20-4 record, 291 strikeouts, and a 2.28 ERA (his personal best). Between May 1994 and October 1997, Johnson had gone 53-9, including a 16-0 streak that fell one short of the AL record. Johnson had two 19-strikeout starts in 1997, on June 24 and August 8. Another colorful All-Star Game moment proceeded in the 1997 edition involving former Expos teammate Larry Walker, at that point with the Colorado Rockies. When Johnson had started an interleague game versus the Rockies on June 12, Walker chose not to play, explaining that \\"I faced Randy one time in spring training and he almost killed me.\\" In the All-Star Game, Walker batted against Johnson, who theatrically threw over his head. Ever adaptable, Walker placed his batting helmet backwards and switched sides in the batters' box to stand right-handed for one pitch. He ended the at bat by drawing a walk. The incident momentarily drew mirth and laughter from players in both dugouts, fans and announcers, and, of course, comparisons to the at bat with Kruk in the 1993 All-Star Game. In spite of garnering a reputation of avoiding Johnson, Walker batted .393 (11 hits in 28 at bats) against him in his career, nearly double the rate of all left-handed batters at .199. When the 1998 season began, Johnson was upset the Mariners would not offer him a contract extension, given his contract was expiring after the season. Though the Mariners initially wanted to keep Johnson, turning down a trade offer from the Los Angeles Dodgers, they fell out of contention, going 8-20 in June. Minutes before the non-waiver trade deadline, on July 31, the Mariners traded Johnson to the Houston Astros for three minor leaguers, Freddy Garcia, Carlos Guillen, and John Halama.

His course took him to the north coast of Honduras. After founding Puerto de Caballos, Gil Gónzalez sailed west along the coast to the Amatique Bay, and founded a Spanish settlement somewhere near the Dulce River, within modern-day Guatemala, which he named San Gil de Buena Vista. He launched a campaign of conquest in the mountainous region dividing Honduras from Guatemala. González left some of his men under the command of Francisco Riquelme at San Gil de Buena Vista, and sailed back east along the coast to Honduras.

It shares the same 2-oxo-pyrrolidone base structure with pyroglutamic acid. Piracetam is a cyclic derivative of GABA (gamma-Aminobutyric acid). Presently piracetam is used in many European countries, Asia and South America. In the United States, it is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for any medical use and it is not permitted to be sold as a dietary supplement. In the UK, piracetam is prescribed mainly for myoclonus, but is used off-label for other conditions. Evidence to support its use for many conditions is unclear. - Levetiracetam, marketed under the trade name Keppra among others, is a medication used to treat epilepsy. It is used for partial onset, myoclonic, or tonic-clonic seizures. It is the S-enantiomer of etiracetam. - Phenylpiracetam (INN: fonturacetam, brand names Phenotropil, Carphedon), also called is a phenylated analog of the drug piracetam which was developed in 1983 in Russia where it is available as a prescription drug. Research on animals has indicated that phenylpiracetam may have anti-amnesic, antidepressant, anticonvulsant, antipsychotic, anxiolytic, and memory enhancement effects. - Anticonvulsants (also commonly known as antiepileptic drugs or as antiseizure drugs) are a diverse group of pharmacological agents used in the treatment of epileptic seizures. Anticonvulsants are also increasingly being used in the treatment of bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder, since many seem to act as mood stabilizers, and for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Anticonvulsants suppress the rapid and excessive firing of neurons during seizures. Anticonvulsants also prevent the spread of the seizure within the brain. Some investigators have observed that anticonvulsants themselves may cause reduced IQ in children. However these adverse effects must be balanced against the significant risk epileptic seizures pose to children and the distinct possibility of death and devastating neurological sequelae secondary to seizures. Anticonvulsants are more accurately called antiepileptic drugs (abbreviated \\"AEDs\\"), and are often referred to as antiseizure drugs because they provide symptomatic treatment only and have not been demonstrated to alter the course of epilepsy. - Etiracetam is a chemical compound belonging to the racetam family, which was developed as a nootropic drug. It is racemic; its biologically active enantiomeric form is levetiracetam, now marketed as an antiepileptic drug. - Stimulants (also referred to as psychostimulants) is an overarching term that covers many drugs including those that increase activity of the body, drugs that are pleasurable and invigorating, or drugs that have sympathomimetic effects. Due to their rendering a characteristic \\"up\\" feeling, stimulants are also occasionally referred to as \\"uppers\\". Depressants or \\"downers\\", which decrease mental and/or physical function, are in stark contrast to stimulants and are considered to be the functionally opposite drug class. Stimulants are widely used throughout the world as prescription medicines as well as without a prescription (either legally or illicitly) as performance-enhancing or recreational drugs. The most frequently prescribed stimulants as of 2013 were lisdexamfetamine, methylphenidate, and amphetamine. It is estimated that the percent of the population that has abused amphetamines, cocaine and MDMA combined is between .8% and 2.1%. - Motivation is a theoretical construct used to explain behaviour. It gives the reasons for people's actions, desires, and needs. Motivation can also be defined as one's direction to behavior, or what causes a person to want to repeat a behavior and vice versa. A motive is what prompts the person to act in a certain way, or at least develop an inclination for specific behavior. According to Maehr and Meyer, \\"Motivation is a word that is part of the popular culture as few other psychological concepts are.\\" - Nootropicsalso called smart drugs or cognitive enhancersare drugs, supplements, or other substances that improve cognitive function, particularly executive functions, memory, creativity, or motivation, in healthy individuals. The use of cognition-enhancing drugs by healthy individuals in the absence of a medical indication is one of the most debated topics among neuroscientists, psychiatrists, and physicians which spans a number of issues, including the ethics and fairness of their use, concerns over adverse effects, and the diversion of prescription drugs for nonmedical uses, among others. Nonetheless, the international sales of cognition-enhancing supplements exceeded billion in 2015 and the global demand for these compounds is still growing rapidly. - In medicine, an adverse effect is an undesired harmful effect resulting from a medication or other intervention such as surgery. - Epilepsy is a group of neurological diseases characterized by epileptic seizures. Epileptic seizures are episodes that can vary from brief and nearly undetectable to long periods of vigorous shaking. These episodes can result in physical injuries including occasionally broken bones. In epilepsy, seizures tend to recur, and have no immediate underlying cause. Isolated seizures that are provoked by a specific cause such as poisoning are not deemed to represent epilepsy. People with epilepsy in some areas of the world experience stigma due to the condition. The cause of most cases of epilepsy is unknown, although some people develop epilepsy as the result of brain injury, stroke, brain tumors, infections of the brain, and birth defects. Known genetic mutations are directly linked to a small proportion of cases. Epileptic seizures are the result of excessive and abnormal nerve cell activity in the cortex of the brain. The diagnosis involves ruling out other conditions that might cause similar symptoms such as fainting and determining if another cause of seizures is present such as alcohol withdrawal or electrolyte problems. This may be partly done by imaging the brain and performing blood tests. Epilepsy can often be confirmed with an electroencephalogram (EEG), but a normal test does not rule out the condition. Epilepsy that occurs as a result of other issues may be preventable. Seizures are controllable with medication in about 70% of cases. Inexpensive options are often available. In those whose seizures do not respond to medication, then surgery, neurostimulation, or dietary changes may be considered. Not all cases of epilepsy are lifelong, and many people improve to the point that treatment is no longer needed. As of 2013 about 22 million people have epilepsy. Nearly 80% of cases occur in the developing world. In 2013 it resulted in 116,000 deaths up from 112,000 deaths in 1990. Epilepsy is more common in older people. In the developed world, onset of new cases occurs most frequently in babies and the... - A drug is any substance (other than food that provides nutritional support) that, when inhaled, injected, smoked, consumed, absorbed via a patch on the skin, or dissolved under the tongue, causes a physiological change in the body. - Oxiracetam (ISF 2522) is a nootropic drug of the racetam family and very mild stimulant. Several studies suggest that the substance is safe even when high doses are consumed for a long period of time. However, the mechanism of action of the racetam drug family is still a matter of research. Oxiracetam is not approved by Food and Drug Administration for any medical use in the United States. - Executive functions (collectively referred to as executive function and cognitive control) are a set of cognitive processes including attentional control, inhibitory control, working memory, and cognitive flexibility, as well as reasoning, problem solving, and planning that are necessary for the cognitive control of behavior: selecting and successfully monitoring behaviors that facilitate the attainment of chosen goals. Executive functions gradually develop and change across the lifespan of an individual and can be improved at any time over the course of a person's life. Similarly, these cognitive processes can be adversely affected by a variety of events which affect an individual. Neuropsychological tests are used to measure executive functions, and are usually performed as part of a more comprehensive assessment to diagnose neurological and psychiatric disorders. - Racetams are a class of drugs that share a pyrrolidone nucleus. Some, such as piracetam, are considered nootropics. Some such as oxiracetam and phenylpiracetam are also stimulants. Others such as levetiracetam and seletracetam are anticonvulsants. - Etiracetam is a nootropic drug of the racetam family . It is racemic ; its biologically active enantiomeric form is levetiracetam . - Seletracetam (UCB 44212) is a pyrrolidone-derived drug of the racetam family that is structurally related to levetiracetam (trade name Keppra). It was under development by UCB Pharmaceuticals as a more potent and effective anticonvulsant drug to replace levetiracetam but its production has been halted. - In chemistry, an enantiomer, also known as an optical isomer, is one of two stereoisomers that are mirror images of each other that are non-superposable (not identical), much as one's left and right hands are the same except for being reversed along one axis (the hands cannot be made to appear identical simply by reorientation). Organic compounds that contain a chiral carbon atom usually have two non-superposable structures. These two structures are mirror images of each other and are, thus, commonly called enantiomorphs (\\"enantio\\" = opposite ; \\"morph\\" = form), hence this structural property is now commonly referred to as enantiomerism.

An 11-year-old girl was banned from a school trip because she had taken one day off to go to her mum’s funeral. Staff at St Giles’ Junior School in Bedworth, Warwickshire, told Maddie Stevens she couldn’t go on the trip to Frankie & Benny’s on Tuesday because she did not have 100 per cent attendance. The schoolgirl’s mother Gail Stevens died of breast cancer in January this year following a two year battle with the disease. Maddie Stevens, 11, who was not allowed to go on the '100 per cent attendance' trip, with her father Andy. Her father Andy Stevens, 48, a finance manager, did not find out about the her exclusion until Tuesday evening, which was after the trip had taken place and too late for him to appeal. He said: ‘It’s just so insensitive after everything she has been through. ‘Maddie has been absolutely amazing since her mum died. ‘She took only one day off to go the funeral, because we wanted to keep things as normal for her as we could. But even if she’d taken a week off I’d be saying this. Maddie's mother Gail had battled breast cancer for two years before she passed away in January this year. Maddie did not tell her father Andy (pictured on trip to London) about the trip until after it had happened. He added: ‘She got very upset when Gail passed away and at the funeral, but she’s just tried to get on with things. And after all that, she gets this kick in the face. ‘Her school should be celebrating what she’s achieved not saying “you can’t come on the school outing because your mum died”. ‘It’s not even about Frankie & Benny’s - my wife and I have said we’ll take her anytime - it’s the principle.’ Maddie said: ‘It made me feel sad not to be able to go because a few of my friends went. ‘It would have been a nice treat. Helping my mum out for the past two years has been hard.’ Gail, who was divorced from Mr Stevens, lived only a few streets away from her ex-husband and his current wife Deborah’s home Road in Exhall, Warwickshire. By Christmas last year Maddie was staying at her dad’s more often to get used to the transition she would soon have to make. Maddie pictured outside her school bus today, on her last day at St Giles' Junior School in Bedworth. Mr Stevens said: ‘In November, we were told it would be a matter of months before Gail would die. ‘We were really hoping it wouldn’t be at Christmas, and we tried to do our best for Maddie. ‘Gail’s birthday was on Boxing Day, so she was allowed out of Myton Hospice for that, but she was so sick she could hardly get off the settee. ‘When she went back in again after that, that was it - she didn’t come back out.’ Maddie’s very last Christmas present from her mother was the ice-skating lessons she had asked for. Since. her death, Maddie has dedicated herself to her skating, and has been. accepted into the Coventry Blaze’s Ice Hockey Academy. It is Maddie's last day at the junior school today and she is preparing to go into secondary school after the summer holidays. Mr Stevens said: ‘It’s a big moment, leaving your junior school and moving on to the somewhere new. ‘It’s obviously a time when Maddie’s mum would have been with her to help. ‘Instead, she’s being punished for going to her mum’s funeral. ‘When she told me about it she was really angry, but I don’t think she really wanted to talk about it. ‘So we’re doing our best to make sure it doesn’t affect her too much. ‘It just makes me furious that the school didn’t think twice about Maddie’s situation. ‘I got more and more angry each time I think about it, and I’m amazed they didn’t apologise to Maddie. It feels like they’re now punishing us for complaining about it.’ A spokesman from St Giles’ Junior School said: ‘Following concerns raised, the rewarding of pupils for 100 per cent attendance has been withdrawn.’ Pupils were taken to a Frankie & Benny's restaurant as a treat (pictured is the nearby Nuneaton branch) St Giles' Junior School in Bedworth, Warwickshire, where staff told Maddie Stevens she couldn't go on the trip because she did not have 100 per cent attendance.

Question: suppose the body is able to resist the bacteria happens, how will it affect the persons body suffers from the infected cells. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","response":"In the scenario where the body is able to resist the bacteria, the steps leading up to potential damage and disease symptoms can be greatly affected. The immune system is designed to protect the body from harmful agents, such as bacteria, and eliminate them before they cause damage. If the body is able to resist the bacteria, it will affect the person's body by limiting the damage caused by the infection, potentially preventing illness altogether. Let's delve into the process of how this potential resistance can influence each stage of the bacterial infection. 1. Infection with bacteria: The body's immune response begins when it detects the presence of the bacterium. Physical barriers such as the skin and mucous membranes, as well as the normal human microbiota, can prevent the bacterium from entering and multiplying. Influence on second effect (bacterial growth and reproduction): Resistance to infection may cause less or no effect on bacterial growth and reproduction depending on the initial efficiency of the immune response in stopping the bacteria. 2. Bacteria growth and reproduction inside cells: When the bacterium enters and multiplies inside the cells, the immune system activates different responses, such as the production of white blood cells (WBCs) and the release of cytokines, which help to mobilize and coordinate the immune response. Influence on second effect (bacterial growth and reproduction): The immune response can have a significant effect in reducing or preventing bacterial growth and reproduction. Activation of white blood cells, cytokines, and other defense mechanisms can either slow down or stop the bacterial growth and reproduction, leading to a lesser effect on the person's body. 3. The dividing bacteria begin to make toxins: In some cases, as bacteria grow and reproduce, they produce toxins that can damage healthy cells. If the immune system is able to resist and eliminate the bacteria before they begin producing toxins, the damage to healthy cells may be minimized or avoided altogether. Influence on second effect (toxin production): If the immune response is successful in stopping the bacteria, the production of toxins can have less or no effect on the person's body. 4. Toxins damage cells: If the immune system cannot eliminate the bacteria before they release toxins, these toxins can damage healthy cells. However, if resistance to the bacteria is effective, the body's immune response may neutralize or eliminate the toxins before they can cause significant damage. Influence on second effect (cell damage): The effectiveness of the body's immune response can lead to less or no effect on cell damage, preventing or reducing the overall harm caused by bacterial toxins. 5. Disease symptoms may begin: The final stage of bacterial infection is the presentation of disease symptoms due to the cell damage resulting from the toxins. In the case of a successful immune response resisting the bacteria, the symptoms may be milder or potentially non-existent depending on the efficiency of the body's defense mechanisms. Influence on second effect (disease symptoms): An effective immune response can lead to less or no effect of the disease symptoms, contributing to a healthier outcome for the person. In summary, a person's body being able to resist a bacterial infection can lead to less or no effect on bacterial growth and reproduction, toxin production, cell damage, and disease symptoms. This resistance is primarily attributed to the efficiency and coordination of the immune response, which plays a significant role in preventing and limiting the damage caused by the infection."},{"question":"Premise: \\"A young girl in a light blue dress scares away a flock of seagulls as she runs towards them on the shoreline of a beach.\\" Based on this premise, can we conclude that the hypothesis \\"The girl did not mean to scare away the seagulls.\\" is true?

Expectations had been raised after the team claimed six medals at the 2011 World Championships. But, while they managed 23 finalists in the Aquatics Centre pool, they were unable to convert two fourth and six fifth-placed finishes into medals - something which the review will scrutinise ahead of the new funds being allocated in December. Swimming received a total of £25.1m ahead of London 2012 and was in the same funding bracket as cycling, rowing and sailing, which have all exceeded their medal expectations this summer. One of the biggest disappointments for British Swimming was that the times delivered by its athletes did not always match expectations. Other than Jamieson, few bettered the performances they delivered at the GB London 2012 trials in March, which was particularly surprising given other nations did not appear to share those struggles. Adlington herself admitted that, at times, she found the home crowd \\"overwhelming\\". Scott, who is contracted for the next Olympic cycle, added: \\"Britain had more finalists than ever before with 23 in the pool, but we were not able to convert the two fourth and six fifth places into medals and that is what we hope to better understand with the performance debrief. \\"In order that we can continue to improve as a swimming nation, this will be done quickly but thoroughly with a view to completing by the end of October.\\" This article was about:","response":"This article discusses the underperformance of the British swimming team in the 2012 Olympic Games, falling short of UK Sport's target of 5-7 podium finishes, and the consequences of this, such as potential funding cuts.

Looking for a harder-hitting rock sound than that of All That You Can't Leave Behind, U2 began recording their eleventh studio album, How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb, in February 2003 with producer Chris Thomas. After nine months of work, the band had an album's worth of material ready for release, but they were not satisfied with the results; Mullen said that the songs \\"had no magic\\". The group subsequently enlisted Steve Lillywhite to take over as producer in Dublin in January 2004. Lillywhite, along with his assistant Jacknife Lee, spent six months with the band reworking songs and encouraging better performances. Several other producers received credits on the album, including Lanois, Eno, Flood, Carl Glanville, and Nellee Hooper; Bono acknowledged that the involvement of multiple producers affected the record's \\"sonic cohesion\\". Released in November 2004, How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb received favourable reviews from critics. The album featured lyrics touching on life, death, love, war, faith, and family. It reached number one in 30 countries, including the US, where first-week sales of 840,000 copies nearly doubled those of All That You Can't Leave Behind, setting a personal best for the band.

The answers are important enough that they will be a discussion topic of this year's Senior Day at 9 a.m. March 25 in the House Chamber at the Capitol. The following is a preview of some of the answers for review: We can all agree that older Oklahomans need medical care. But even the best care is worthless if an older patient can't drive to the doctor for ongoing treatment because his or her car has been wrongfully seized in a debt dispute. Therefore, lawyers are part of the prescription for regular medical care for many of the 600,000 Oklahomans age 60 and older. Another example: if a doctor treats an elderly patient for a lung ailment, the doctor's treatment will be undone and he will see the patient again and again, if the patient is sent home to an unheated apartment. Lawyers know how to make landlords heat apartments so the medical treatment can stick. (By the way, a May 16, 2001, article in The New York Times reports on a program at Boston Medical Center providing a walk-in legal clinic in the hospital to help fight their patients' legal and administrative battles.) We also can agree that older Oklahomans - like all citizens - have rights to control their health care until they become incapacitated or these rights are transferred to another by legal document or process. \\"Old\\" is not a legal classification that results in automatic loss of these rights. Moreover, having an old parent does not automatically confer on children the right to make the parents' health care choices. It follows that an important role lawyers provide for aging Oklahomans is not only to create rights - transferring documents such as durable powers of attorney and guardianship orders, but also to monitor their use. In family situations, for example, lawyers must ensure that powers of attorney and guardianships are used to serve only the person transferring or losing rights. They are not to be used to help a family \\"manage\\" their mother or help a doctor or nursing home get permission for a pill or procedure they feel is in the best interest of a patient. Good news: Oklahoma now has a Public Guardianship Program, albeit unfunded, that will supply lawyers to perform this rights-monitoring process Oklahoma grandparents should be able to enjoy their grandchildren, not raise them. But owing to the social problems of divorce and drug use, grandparents are increasingly being called on to raise their grandchildren because of missing parents. Adding to the physical, emotional and financial burden they take on, grandparents face legal problems.

If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\". Question: Who played Jack's father? Movie plot title: The Tree of Life Movie plot: Tree of Life is a period piece centered around three boys in the 1950s. The eldest son (Hunter McCracken none SAG) of two characters (Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain) witnesses the loss of innocence.The movie, which exists as a metaphysical meditation and a lyrical poem, focuses at a microcosmic level on the story of Jack, a jaded, middle aged man (played by Sean Penn) scarred by the memories of an oppressive upbringing by his father (Brad Pitt), as well as the untimely death of his younger brother.We trace the evolution of an eleven-year-old boy in the Midwest, Jack, one of three brothers. At first all seems marvelous to the child. He sees as his mother does, with the eyes of his soul. She represents the way of love and mercy, where the father tries to teach his son the world's way, of putting oneself first. Each parent contends for his allegiance, and Jack must reconcile their claims. The picture darkens as he has his first glimpses of sickness, suffering and death. The world, once a thing of glory, becomes a labyrinth.Framing this story is that of adult Jack, a lost soul in a modern world, seeking to discover amid the changing scenes of time that which does not change: the eternal scheme of which we are a part. When he sees all that has gone into our world's preparation, each thing appears a miracle precious, incomparable. Jack, with his new understanding, is able to forgive his father and take his first steps on the path of life.The story ends in hope, acknowledging the beauty and joy in all things, in the everyday and above all in the family -- our first school -- the only place that most of us learn the truth about the world and ourselves, or discover life's single most important lesson, of unselfish love.

Ian Drury. and Tim Shipman. David Cameron refused to rule out military action yesterday as he rebuked Argentina over its grab for the Falkland Islands. The Prime Minister vowed the UK would ‘do everything’ to protect the interests of the territory after Buenos Aires demanded he hand power to them. He said the sovereignty of the Falklands would be up to those who lived there when they hold a referendum in March. He added it was ‘really important’ for countries around the world to ‘sit up and notice’ the result – certain to be overwhelmingly in favour of retaining ties with Britain. War of words: President of Argentina, Cristina. Fernandez de Kirchner, pictured left, accuses Britain of stealing the. Falkland Islands in an open letter addressed to Prime Minister David. Cameron. The remarks came after Argentina’s president Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner launched a fresh attack by insisting her nation was ‘forcibly stripped’ of the Falklands in a ‘blatant exercise of 19th century colonialism’ – a claim branded ‘crazy’ by Whitehall officials. In an open letter to Mr Cameron, published as an advert in Left-wing newspapers on the 180th anniversary of the alleged January 1833 takeover, she accused the UK of defying United Nations resolutions by refusing negotiations over the Falklands. But in a strong message which risked angering Buenos Aires, Number 10 made clear Britain would respond with force if threats to the islands emerged. A source said: ‘This is not a military situation but there is no doubt that we can defend the islands. The people of the Falkland Islands should be just left alone.’ Falkland Islanders last night issued their own open letter addressed to the Argentinean president. In. the 1830s Britain was arguably at the height of its colonial power. The. jewel in the crown was India while Canada, Australia as well as key. parts of Africa including Egypt and the Cape Colony were all under the. Union Flag. In. South America, Britain captured three colonies from the Dutch in 1796. which were officially ceded in 1814, and consolidated into a single. colony, known as British Guiana in 1831. The. period between 1815 and 1914, is often referred to as Britain's. 'imperial century' with around 10,000,000 square miles of territory and. roughly 400 million people were added to the British Empire. After the defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, Britain's only serious international rival was Russia. Overwhelming. naval supremacy led to a state of affairs known as 'Pax Britannica',. with Britain adopting the role of global policeman and enjoying a. foreign policy dubbed 'splendid isolation'. Because. Britain exerted such influence in world trade, the economies of. countries such as China and Argentina were effectively controlled from. London. The term 'informal empire', is used by historians to describe. this state of affairs. A group labelling themselves Falklands United said: ‘We look forward to our referendum in March and failure on your part to accept the outcome will prove to the world that there is only one colonial power in the region.’ The letter added: ‘We have never been prouder of our association with the United Kingdom and our unique relationship. Any decision to change that would be OUR and not YOUR choice.’ Britain has four warships, four RAF fighter-bombers and a 1,000-strong garrison on the Falklands, which are still claimed by Argentina despite their crushing defeat in the 1982 war which cost 255 British lives. Mr Cameron insisted the islanders should be granted the right to self-determination under the UN. He said: ‘They’re holding a referendum this year and I hope the president of Argentina will listen to that referendum and recognise it is for the Falkland Islanders to choose their future.’ Dick Sawle, a member of the Falklands’ Legislative Assembly, said: ‘The letter sent by president Kirchner is not only historically inaccurate but fails to mention the most significant aspect of our recent history – the attempt by Argentina to take away our home by military force when they invaded.’ Diplomatic friction between Britain and Argentina has increased since 2010, when the Government authorised oil exploration in the waters near the islands. Last year Buenos Aires accused the UK of ‘militarising’ the South Atlantic after Prince William’s posting as an RAF search-and-rescue helicopter pilot. Diplomats believe president Kirchner is using sovereignty claims to deflect attention from unpopular social and economic policies. The International Monetary Fund has also threatened to expel the country for cloaking in secrecy its inflation and growth data. Britain's Foreign Office rejected. Fernandez's call for negotiations, sticking to London's long-established. stance that the approximately 3,000 people of the Falkland Islands had. chosen to be British. 'There are three parties to this. debate, not just two as Argentina likes to pretend. The islanders can't. just be written out of history,' the Foreign Office said. 'As such, there can be no. negotiations on the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands unless and until. such time as the islanders so wish.' The British Task force reached the South. Atlantic in May 1982 and retook South Georgia before preparing to. retake the main Islands. The Argentinean Air force sank several British ships, and Exocet. missiles sank the destroyer HMS Sheffield and the Atlantic Conveyor. A copy of Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner's letter to David Cameron. The Falklands: Diplomatic friction between Britain and Argentina has intensified since 2010, when the Government authorised oil exploration in the waters near the islands. Many other ships were damaged, some badly with considerable loss of. life, but the sinking of Argentinean Cruiser the General Belgrano by a. British Submarine was considered a turning point. The British fought. their way across the island with an Argentine surrender on June 14,. 1982. The British lost 250 men and took more than 10,000 prisoners of war,. while the Argentines lost 746, of which 368 had been on the Belgrano. when it sank. Fernandez said her open letter was. timed to coincide with the 180th anniversary of the day when Argentina. was 'forcibly stripped' of the islands in what she called a 'blatant. exercise of 19th century colonialism'. Noting that the islands were located. 14,000 km (8,700 miles) from London, Fernandez accused Britain of. expelling Argentines from the islands and carrying out a 'population. implantation process'. Britain disputes that version of. history. It says no civilian population was expelled from the Falklands. on or after Jan. 3, 1833. Fernandez's allegations were made in an open letter addressed to David Cameron and UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. They are the latest in a string of. inflammatory rants over the islands’ future and come less than ten weeks. before around 1,500 eligible islanders hold the first ever vote on. whether they want to remain British. The referendum set for March 10-11,. overseen by international observers, is widely expected to send a clear. message to Argentina to keep its hands off. That. would be a humiliation for President Kirchner who has used sovereignty. claims to deflect attention from unpopular social and economic policies. The sinking of the Belgrano: Crewmen of the Argentine Cruiser General Belgrano escape in life rafts when it was sunk on May 2nd 1982 a key moment in the Falklands War. President Fernandez shows a plaque with the name 'Islas Malvinas' (left) and a man sets fire to an effigy of Prince William during a commemoration of the 30th anniversary of the Falklands War in April last year. It would also underpin the UN principle of ‘self-determination’ for the people of the Falklands. In. the letter, President Kirchner said Argentina was ‘forcibly stripped’ of the islands it calls Las Malvinas in a ‘blatant exercise of 19th. century colonialism’. She added that ‘Argentines on the islands were. expelled and the UK began a population implementation process similar to. that applied to other territories under colonial rule’. Recipient: The President's letter was also addressed to UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. She added: ‘Since then, Britain, the colonial power, has refused to return the territories to the Argentine Republic.’ The Foreign Office ‘strenuously denied’ the claims and accused Argentina of trying to ‘write the Falkland islanders out of history’. Whitehall sources said the Government could order Sir Mark Lyall Grant, Britain’s ambassador to the UN, to rebut the ‘crazy’ allegations. In a speech to the UN last year, Sir Mark criticised Argentina’s ‘aggressive territorial aspirations’ over the Falklands and said its claims were ‘without foundation’. He said: ‘No civilian population was expelled on 3 January 1833 and the United Kingdom has never implanted any civilian population.’ Diplomatic friction between Britain and Argentina has intensified since 2010, when the Government authorised oil exploration in the waters near the islands. The letter was published in the Guardian and the Independent newspapers. It appears to have provoked an angry reaction from some islanders. Several messages have appeared on Twitter purporting to be from islanders condemning the papers' decision to publish them. One message to the Guardian read: 'Any particular reason why you continue to publish literature from someone that refuses to accept our existence?'

Platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter have grown to establish themselves as crucial channels for information dissemination, communication, and social interaction. These advancements have, however, raised concerns among mental health professionals, parents, and users, pertaining to the possible negative impact of social media on mental well-being, particularly among the younger population. Effects such as anxiety, depression, addiction, and decreased self-esteem have been reported, posing a challenge to policymakers and mental health experts in addressing these issues. Hypothesis: Increased exposure to social media platforms is directly correlated to a decline in mental well-being among teenagers and young adults. The relationship between social media usage and mental health deterioration may be attributed to several factors, including unrealistic expectations generated through the consumption of certain content, constant comparisons to others, cyberbullying, addiction, and negative experiences leading to decreased self-esteem and increased feelings of isolation. In order to test this hypothesis, a comprehensive study may be conducted to determine if prolonged and continuous exposure to social media platforms results in declines in mental well-being for teenage and young adult users. This study would involve the collection of mental health data, which could entail self-reporting measures, professional assessments, or a combination of both, along with the detailed tracking of social media usage patterns over a specified period. The collected mental health data and social media usage patterns could then be analyzed to identify potential correlations or trends. If the findings support the hypothesis, there might be a need for further investigation to understand the mechanics of the relationship and determine the threshold for what constitutes safe social media usage. Ultimately, if the hypothesis is proven to be true, this information could aid mental health professionals and policymakers in developing targeted interventions, strategies, and policies that mitigate the negative mental health impact of social media usage among teenagers and young adults. Additionally, these findings might help parents, educators, and users themselves in fostering a more mindful approach to social media consumption, promoting healthier habits, and encouraging more positive online experiences."},{"question":"Instructions: You are given a sentence in Hebrew.

The military men are then all killed by the gangsters, who in turn are wiped out by another intervening party. Its leader murders Sartana while Machete is arrested by corrupt Sheriff Doakes (William Sadler) and Deputy Clebourne (Samuel Davis). Doakes unsuccessfully tries to hang Machete but the President of the US, Rathcock (Charlie Sheen), intervenes. Machete is brought to the White House, where the president offers him US citizenship if he eliminates Marcos Mendez (DemiÃ¡n Bichir), a psychopath who is threatening to fire a nuclear missile at Washington, D.C. if the American government does not intervene to stop the rampant drug cartels in Mexico and the corruption of its government. Machete agrees and travels to San Antonio, where he meets his handler Blanca Vasquez (Amber Heard), an undercover beauty pageant competitor. She sends him to Acapulco to meet a young woman, Cereza (Vanessa Hudgens), who can lead him to Mendez. Machete finds her in a brothel run by her mother, Madame Desdemona (SofÃ­a Vergara), who attempts to kill Machete before he escapes with Cereza. She takes him to Mendez's associate, Zaror (Marko Zaror), who kills Cereza before taking Machete to Mendez's base of operations. There, Machete learns that Mendez has wired the missile's launch device to his heart and triggered its launch in 24 hours. If he dies, the missile fires. After killing Zaror he captures Mendez, intending to escort him to US and find a way to disarm the missile. Machete learns that Mendez is an ex-secret agent who tried to expose his corrupt superiors, only to be betrayed and forced to watch his family being tortured.

Answer:","response":"In the movie \\"Machete Kills,\\" the character Voz, played by Mel Gibson, is the main antagonist. He is a wealthy and powerful arms dealer who wants to manipulate the world for his own gain with his immense wealth and influence. Voz is described as a brilliant and eccentric businessman with a twisted vision for the future of humanity. Voz is in league with several characters throughout the film, including corrupt government officials and the Mexican drug cartels. He supplies weapons to these factions to create chaos and profit from the conflicts. This alliance allows him to further his own agenda and expand his influence in the region. Furthermore, it is revealed that he is also in league with Marcos Mendez, the psychopath who wants to launch a nuclear missile at Washington, D.C. Voz has masterminded this plan to force the US government to take action against the Mexican drug cartels and address the corruption issue in Mexico. By doing so, Voz intends to manipulate the situation to his advantage and increase his power. As the plot unfolds, Machete (Danny Trejo) is tasked with stopping Mendez and Voz's plan. He encounters various obstacles, including the assassins sent by Madame Desdemona, a brothel owner who has connections with Voz. Machete also faces Voz's henchmen, such as Zaror, who attempts to kill Machete and keep him from capturing Mendez. In the final confrontation, Machete goes up against Voz and his henchmen to stop the missile launch and save the day. Ultimately, Machete manages to foil Voz's plan, but the movie sets up a potential sequel with \\"Machete Kills Again... in Space\\" as Voz tries to escape to a space station.

Tom and Kate receive an e-mail from the kidnappers demanding 2,000,000. Tom calls the FBI, who begin operating from his New York City penthouse under Special Agent Lonnie Hawkins. In private, Tom voices his belief that a union machinist, Jackie Brown, who is in prison following one of Mullen's business scandals, may have been behind it. They visit Brown in prison, but he angrily denies any involvement with the kidnapping. Tom agrees to the FBI's instructions for delivering the ransom.

Review: The lowest quality headset I've ever owned, but what can you say for 2.00. Just save that 2.00 and put more with it for something better. Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment? Answer:","response":"This product review conveys a negative sentiment towards the headset being reviewed. The reviewer explicitly states that it is the lowest quality headset they have ever owned, which strongly implies dissatisfaction and disappointment with the product. Additionally, the suggestion to save the 2.00 and invest in something better emphasizes the lack of value that this low-cost headset provides. The reviewer acknowledges the low price of the headset but does not believe it justifies the poor quality of the product. This indicates that they consider the product to be a poor investment even at such a low cost. This sentiment, in turn, could also serve as a warning for potential buyers to avoid purchasing this headset as they may be similarly disappointed with its performance and quality. In conclusion, the sentiment expressed in this product review is undeniably negative, as the reviewer advises against purchasing the headset and instead recommends saving money for a better alternative. The dissatisfaction with the product's quality and the suggestion that it's a waste of money further reinforce this negative impression."},{"question":"I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

Plot title: The Siege Movie plot: Following the bombing of an American military installation in the Middle East (the film shows footage from the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing), the U.S. government orchestrates the capture of the mastermind believed to be behind the attack, Sheikh Ahmed bin Talal. In New York City FBI Special Agent Anthony Hubbard (Washington) and his Lebanese-American partner Frank Haddad (Shalhoub) are told of a hijacked bus, fully loaded with passengers and containing an explosive device. The bomb turns out to be a paint bomb and the terrorists manage to escape. The FBI receives demands to release the sheikh. Hubbard eventually comes into conflict with CIA agent Elise Kraft (Bening). Hubbard takes a terrorist suspect into custody and arrests Kraft. Afterwards another terrorist threat is made and an MTA bus is bombed, though the children on-board are permitted to leave before the bus is destroyed. When the FBI captures a person of interest named Samir Nazhde he admits to signing the visa application of one of the suicide bombers in the course of signing many applications for student visas in his job as a lecturer. However, Kraft insists that Samir is not a terrorist and that his continued freedom is vital to the investigation. The FBI eventually identifies and storms a safehouse belonging to terrorists who are associated with the bombings. However, days later, new terror cells launch more devastating attacks, starting with the bombing of the New Victory Theater in Times Square during an evening performance.

Fire investigators think a bird nicked a smouldering cigarette butt and dropped it into a nest in the roof area, causing it to catch light. Fire investigation officer Matt Cullen, who examined the scene, said: “When we got up into the roof, we were baffled as there were no obvious ignition sources – no one had been up to there for a long time and there were no electrics that could have sparked a blaze. We looked everywhere, but the smoking gun was found when we discovered a partially burnt birds nest. Neighbours told us they often saw birds flying in and out of a hole in the roof. We believe that one of the birds picked up a cigarette butt that was still smouldering and dropped it into the nest, causing it to catch fire and set the roof alight. “The incident is a great example of why it’s important to put your cigarettes out fully – you never know what might become of your smouldering butts! Luckily for the residents, their neighbours saw the smoke and raised the alarm, so fire crews could get in quickly and bring it under control.” Four fire engines and 21 firefighters and officers went to the blaze on Landor Road in Stockwell. The Brigade was called at 2223 and the fire was under control at 0039. The fire damaged around a fifth of the roof area but no one was hurt. Nine people escaped the building before crews arrived. ||||| Image copyright London Fire Brigade Image caption Birds had often been seen flying into a hole in the roof A bird carrying a lit cigarette to its nest has been blamed for starting a fire in a building in south London.

Shadow Cabinet minister Angela Eagle looked shocked as a BBC Question Time audience turned on her when she demanded that welfare reform minister Lord Freud should resign or be sacked. She insisted the peer had been ‘offensive’ in remarks secretly recorded by a Labour official at a fringe meeting of last month’s Conservative Party conference. Scroll down for video. Shadow Cabinet minister Angela Eagle on Question Time when she demanded Lord Freud be sacked. Lord Freud was responding to a councillor with a severely disabled daughter who suggested that people with mental health problems may be unable to work because employers are unwilling to pay them the statutory minimum. Lord Freud suggested that some disabled workers were seen as ‘not worth’ the £6.50 minimum wage and mused on whether the Government might be able to top up their wages to enable more to get into workplaces. Labour leader Ed Miliband ambushed David Cameron with a transcript of the recording at Prime Minister’s Questions this week, also insisting the minister should be sacked. He has remained in his job after apologising, but Miss Eagle insisted on Thursday night: ‘I do think he should resign. I think what he said… has caused a great deal of offence to disabled people. ‘There are 50 per cent of people with disabilities who are not in work at the moment. The answer to that isn’t to somehow weaken the minimum wage and make them work for less than the minimum wage.’ Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said on the programme it was clear Lord Freud had been talking about the state ‘topping up’ the incomes of disabled people. Lord Freud suggested that some disabled workers were seen as ‘not worth’ the £6.50 minimum wage. One audience member agreed: ‘I think Angela Eagle is being extremely disingenuous. I think we all knew what he meant, even though he said it clumsily.’ Another person in the audience in Newbury, Berkshire, told Miss Eagle: ‘What you are doing is hypocritical point scoring and it’s disgusting.’ A young woman said: ‘I just wanted to see whether you [Eagle] would use this as a political football and you have done – thanks Angela.’ Yesterday a Conservative MP also defended Lord Freud, insisting that the minimum wage was having a detrimental impact on disabled people’s chances of finding work. Jackie Doyle-Price, a member of the Commons public accounts committee, said the way Lord Freud’s remarks had been twisted by Labour and parts of the charitable sector was ‘frankly disgusting’. It emerged the charity Mencap, which has led criticism of Lord Freud, itself warned an estimated 1,000 people with severe learning disabilities had part-time jobs or had their working hours cut as a direct result of the national minimum wage. In 2000, it called for an urgent revision of the rules to enable ‘low output work’ to be exempted from the rules. It now says the system to support disabled people into work has been transformed in the last 15 years and debate has moved on, ‘as has our position’. Conservative MP Henry Smith said: ‘Certain charities have seemed quick to make political attacks on what is a very serious and complex issue. Charities should not be acting as mouthpieces for Labour’s political point scoring.’ Former Tory chairman Lord Tebbit, whose wife Margaret was badly disabled in the Brighton bomb, said the attacks on Lord Freud were a ‘disgusting spectacle’. ‘What Lord Freud was being asked about was whether there are handicapped people who cannot produce enough to justify in purely economic terms a wage of £6 an hour. My wife was capable of earning her pay as an experienced nurse until the sadistic criminals of IRA/Sinn Fein crippled her. She is worth no less today, but she could not justify a pay rate of £6 an hour. Lord Freud was mulling over how to help such people.’ Labour's Department for Trade and Industry published guidance in 2003 on when and where it might be acceptable to pay disabled people far less than the minimum wage. The department, then run by Patricia Hewitt, said the minimum wage applied to all workers – able-bodied or disabled. However, disabled people could be exempted from the minimum wage when they did work-related activity for therapeutic reasons, with no contractual obligation to work. The guidance gave various examples of when that could apply, after the Government consulted with organisations including Scope, Mencap and the TUC. It gave the example of a farm where people develop social skills through involvement in agriculture, horticulture, caring for animals and training. Other examples included a charity running a workshop for people with mental health problems, which it suggested, could pay them as little as £4 per day. A third example was a trust running a facility for mental health outpatients which does activities such as packing and assembly. They could be paid varying amounts up to just £20 per week.

Kids usually get toys from \\"Santa\\" on Christmas Day, but it's also customary to give gifts to others you love. Presents don't have to be big or expensive. Even giving a chocolate bar, baked goods, or small handmade gifts is welcome. It's also a good time of year to offer gifts to those in need. For instance, you can give toys to toy drives for families who are down on their luck or send packages to troops overseas. For a bit of fun, try opening 1 gift on Christmas Eve. Books or pajamas make good Christmas Eve gifts. However, while gift-giving is fun, there's no reason to go into debt for it. Make sure you spend only what you can afford. Sending Christmas cards is a tradition this time of year, and it's a way to let people know you care. Include a little note about how you're thinking of the person and wish them well. You can also send Christmas cards to nursing homes or troops overseas to let them know they're remembered at Christmas. Charity is a hallmark of Christmas, and one way you can participate in that is to pick a charity to give money to. Some common ones that people give to this time of year include food banks, homeless shelters, and other charities that serve those who are down on their luck. You won't have to look hard to find someplace to give, as many charities put up donation centers and boxes this time of year. You could also buy groceries anonymously for a family you know is struggling. You don't have to give money to help out this time of year. Offer to hang Christmas decorations for a neighbor who can't do it or send them baked goods. Collect food, blankets, coats, or other supplies for local charities, or volunteer at a homeless shelter or soup kitchen on Christmas Day.
