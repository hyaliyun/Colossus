If the question isn't answerable, please output \\"Can't answer\\". Question: Who rushes to the aid of Becker? Title: Screamers Movie plot: The year is 2078. The planet Sirius 6B, once a thriving mining hub, has been reduced to a toxic wasteland by a civil war between the mining company, known as the New Economic Bloc (NEB), and the Alliance, a group of former mining and science personnel. Five years into the war, Alliance scientists created and deployed Autonomous Mobile Swords (AMS) â artificially intelligent self-replicating machines that hunt down and kill NEB soldiers on their own. They are nicknamed \\"screamers\\" because of a high-pitched noise they emit as they attack. Screamers track targets by their heartbeats, so Alliance soldiers wear \\"tabs\\" which broadcast a signal canceling out the wearer's heartbeat and rendering them \\"invisible\\" to the machines. A fragile stalemate is in effect between the two exhausted, poorly supplied, and undermanned armies. A message guaranteeing safe passage through NEB territory to discuss a truce is recovered from a dead NEB soldier, killed by screamers as he approached the Alliance compound. When Alliance commanding officer Joe Hendricksson (Weller) reports this development to his Earth-based superiors, he is told that such a meeting won't be necessary; peace negotiations are already underway on Earth. Not true, says Private \\"Ace\\" Jefferson (Andrew Lauer), newly arrived from Earth. Hendricksson is not surprised, as he suspects that both sides have simply written off Sirius 6B and abandoned their armies. Hendricksson decides that the only realistic chance of survival for himself and his soldiers is to accept the NEB truce offer. He sets out for a meeting with the NEB commander, accompanied by Jefferson. While traveling through a destroyed city they come upon a war orphan, a young boy named David (Michael Caloz), clutching a teddy bear. Unwilling to abandon a defenseless civilian, they bring the boy along. The following night they are attacked by a reptilian screamer that they have never before encountered. Hendricksson is alarmed that their Alliance tabs did not protect them. As the group nears the NEB...

Babylonian astronomers had developed arithmetical techniques for calculating astronomical phenomena; Greek astronomers such as Hipparchus had produced geometric models for calculating celestial motions. Ptolemy, however, claimed to have derived his geometrical models from selected astronomical observations by his predecessors spanning more than 800 years, though astronomers have for centuries suspected that his models' parameters were adopted independently of observations. Ptolemy presented his astronomical models in convenient tables, which could be used to compute the future or past position of the planets. The Almagest also contains a star catalogue, which is a version of a catalogue created by Hipparchus. Its list of forty-eight constellations is ancestral to the modern system of constellations, but unlike the modern system they did not cover the whole sky (only the sky Hipparchus could see). Across Europe, the Middle East and North Africa in the Medieval period, it was the authoritative text on astronomy, with its author becoming an almost mythical figure, called Ptolemy, King of Alexandria. The Almagest was preserved, like most of extant Classical Greek science, in Arabic manuscripts (hence its familiar name). Because of its reputation, it was widely sought and was translated twice into Latin in the 12th century, once in Sicily and again in Spain. Ptolemy's model, like those of his predecessors, was geocentric and was almost universally accepted until the appearance of simpler heliocentric models during the scientific revolution. His Planetary Hypotheses went beyond the mathematical model of the Almagest to present a physical realization of the universe as a set of nested spheres, in which he used the epicycles of his planetary model to compute the dimensions of the universe. He estimated the Sun was at an average distance of 1,210 Earth radii, while the radius of the sphere of the fixed stars was 20,000 times the radius of the Earth. Ptolemy presented a useful tool for astronomical calculations in his Handy Tables, which tabulated all the data needed to compute the positions of the Sun, Moon and planets, the rising and setting of the stars, and eclipses of the Sun and Moon. Ptolemy's Handy Tables provided the model for later astronomical tables or zijes. In the Phaseis (Risings of the Fixed Stars), Ptolemy gave a parapegma, a star calendar or almanac, based on the hands and disappearances of stars over the course of the solar year. Answer this question \\"Did the rulers use his knowledge\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","response":"Yes, the rulers used Ptolemy's knowledge during the Medieval period across Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa. The Almagest, which contained Ptolemy's astronomical models, tables, and star catalogue, served as the authoritative text on astronomy at the time. This made Ptolemy an almost mythical figure, known as \\"Ptolemy, King of Alexandria.\\" His work provided the foundation for later astronomical tables or zijes and was crucial in helping rulers, astronomers, and scholars carry out astronomical calculations and observations."},{"question":"Two months before filming, Lori Petty, Reeves and Swayze trained with former world class professional surfer Dennis Jarvis on the Hawaiian island of Kauai. Jarvis remembers, \`\`Patrick said he'd been on a board a couple of times, Keanu definitely had not surfed before, and Lori had never been in the ocean in her life.'' Shooting the surfing sequences proved to be challenging for both actors with Swayze cracking four of his ribs. For many of the surfing scenes he refused to use a stunt double as he never had one for fight scenes or car chases. He also did the skydiving scenes himself and the film's aerial jump instructor Jim Wallace found that the actor was a natural and took to it right away. The actor ended up making 55 jumps for the film. Swayze actually based aspects of his character after one of his stunt doubles, Darrick Doerner, a top big wave surfer. After learning to surf for the film, Reeves took a liking to it and took it up as a hobby. Choose your answer: Is the following statement correct based on the text did patrick swayze surf in the movie point break OPT: -no. -yes.","response":"-yes. The text mentions that Patrick Swayze trained with a professional surfer and based aspects of his character on a top big wave surfer. Additionally, it indicates that he refused to use a stunt double for many of the surfing scenes. Therefore, it can be inferred that Patrick Swayze did surf in the movie Point Break.

It is not synonymous with the phrase \\"I disagree with that.\\" which clearly represents disagreement or disapproval. To better understand and contextualize the two statements, let us consider the implications of both. 1. \\"Quite right, monsieur.\\" This statement indicates that the speaker is in agreement with the other person's claim or perspective. The use of \\"monsieur,\\" a French term of respect and politeness, suggests that the speaker might be addressing someone with whom they are not very familiar or want to display courtesy. Consequently, the speaker is agreeing with the other person's opinion and respectfully acknowledging its validity. 2. \\"I disagree with that.\\" This statement, on the other hand, reveals a discrepancy between the speaker's own perspective and that of the other person. It communicates the speaker's disapproval, opposition, or contradiction to the other person's claim or argument. The phrase reflects that the speaker has evaluated the other person's perspective and found it unconvincing or incorrect. Comparing these two phrases, it is clear that \\"Quite right, monsieur.\\" and \\"I disagree with that.\\" denote opposite reactions to a statement, situation, or opinion. While the former implies agreement and validation, the latter suggests disapproval and contradiction. Therefore, it is incorrect to conclude that \\"Quite right, monsieur.\\" is equivalent to \\"I disagree with that.\\" To put this in context, imagine a conversation where Person A and Person B are discussing a topic: Person A: \\"I believe that this new technology will drastically improve our lives.\\" Person B: \\"Quite right, monsieur.\\" (This means Person B agrees with Person A's statement.) On the contrary, if Person B were to say, \\"I disagree with that,\\" it would mean that Person B does not concur with Person A's standpoint and may have a different opinion on the matter. In conclusion, \\"Quite right, monsieur.\\" cannot be equated with \\"I disagree with that.\\" as they signify contrary responses to assertions and opinions. Furthermore, each phrase serves its unique purpose in a conversation by either validating and supporting someone's viewpoint or expressing dissent and opposition."},{"question":"Produce a long descriptive sentence that uses all these words: ALV X-1, diameter, 1.524 (metres); ALV X-1, failedLaunches, 1; ALV X-1, rocketStages, 2.

Sentence 2: Telling them to leave the house will cause family problems. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true? Possible answers: a). yes b). it is not possible to tell c). no","response":"Although both sentences revolve around the subject of asking someone to leave the house and its impact on family relationships, they alone don't provide enough context to determine if one statement being true makes the other statement true. Therefore, I will provide a nuanced explanation for each answer choice before concluding. a) Yes: If we strictly look at the content of these two sentences, we could argue that sentence 2 is an extension of sentence 1. Sentence 1 asks a question about how to tell someone to leave without causing family problems. It implies that there is already a concern about causing family problems. Sentence 2 straightforwardly states that telling them to leave will result in family problems. In that sense, one could argue that they are aligned and can both be valid. b) It is not possible to tell: As mentioned earlier, the context is not clear. It would be helpful to know more about the situation or the relationships involved to determine whether telling someone to leave will actually cause problems. In some scenarios, it could be possible to find a more delicate approach (as suggested by sentence 1) that would prevent the occurrence of family issues. So, without greater context or more information, making a definite decision isn't possible. c) No: One could argue that these sentences may not necessarily be concurrently true simply based on their content. Sentence 1 implies that there might be an amicable solution that wouldn't result in problems, while sentence 2 claims that family problems will undeniably arise. However, without further context, this connection might be a stretch since sentence 1 is uncertain about the outcome. In conclusion, based on given information, the most appropriate answer would be: b). it is not possible to tell The lack of context and background information hinders a confident assessment about whether sentence 2 is true if sentence 1 is true. It would be beneficial to take into account the specific family dynamic, the reason someone is being asked to leave, and other factors that might influence the development of family problems."},{"question":"Heidät on saatava oikeuden eteen.

A man looking at a carving could pertain to various scenarios, such as admiring art, contemplating a purchase, or simply passing time. 5.

Acknowledge that, while the information given in the statement is not enough to conclude that the man is planning a robbery, it is also not sufficient to imply that the man is not planning a robbery. There could be other reasons for a person to look at a carving, and planning a robbery could still be an option, albeit a less likely one. 7.

At the college, he met Barbara Hepworth, a fellow student who would also become a well-known British sculptor, and began a friendship and gentle professional rivalry that lasted for many years. In Leeds, Moore also had access to the modernist works in the collection of Sir Michael Sadler, the University Vice-Chancellor, which had a pronounced effect on his development. In 1921, Moore won a scholarship to study at the Royal College of Art in London, along with Hepworth and other Yorkshire contemporaries. While in London, Moore extended his knowledge of primitive art and sculpture, studying the ethnographic collections at the Victoria and Albert Museum and the British Museum. The student sculptures of both Moore and Hepworth followed the standard romantic Victorian style, and included natural forms, landscapes and figurative modelling of animals. Moore later became uncomfortable with classically derived ideals; his later familiarity with primitivism and the influence of sculptors such as Constantin Brâncuși, Jacob Epstein, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska and Frank Dobson led him to the method of direct carving, in which imperfections in the material and marks left by tools became part of the finished sculpture. Having adopted this technique, Moore was in conflict with academic tutors who did not appreciate such a modern approach. During one exercise set by Derwent Wood (the professor of sculpture at the Royal College), Moore was asked to reproduce a marble relief of Domenico Rosselli's The Virgin and Child by first modelling the relief in plaster, then reproducing it in marble using the mechanical aid known as a \\"pointing machine\\", a technique called \\"pointing\\". Instead, he carved the relief directly, even marking the surface to simulate the prick marks that would have been left by the pointing... contains an answer for the question: What did Moore do instead of using a machine when asked to reproduce The Virgin and Child?, what is it ?

What is this text about?","response":"This text is about a remarkable soccer moment featuring Steven Gerrard, a famous English professional footballer, who played as a midfielder and served as the captain for both the Liverpool Football Club and the English national team. In this specific incident, Gerrard scored an impressive goal against the Olympiakos team during a match that took place on a Wednesday night. The goal was so outstanding that Sven-Goran Eriksson, the then head coach of the English national team, spent a considerable amount of time in his Soho Square office rewatching the goal multiple times. Gerrard's skillful strike not only highlights his individual talent as a midfielder but also serves as a testament to his overall impact on the sport of soccer. His goal against Olympiakos likely contributed to his team's standing in the match or tournament. Such outstanding moments in a player's career can elevate them to legendary status, and Gerrard has often been celebrated for his remarkable performances on the field. Considering the fact that Sven-Goran Eriksson was watching the replay of Gerrard's goal multiple times, it suggests that there was a level of admiration and recognition for Gerrard's ability as a soccer player. Moreover, this also implies that Eriksson might have been analyzing Gerrard's gameplay to further understand and utilize his skills when coaching the English national team in future tournaments or matches. In conclusion, the text describes a memorable moment in soccer history where Steven Gerrard showcased his extraordinary abilities by scoring a glorious goal against Olympiakos. This event caught the attention of national team coach Sven-Goran Eriksson, who watched it repeatedly, reflecting the impact of Gerrard's performance on the soccer community and the admiration he garnered for his skillset."},{"question":"Definition: In this task, you are given product reviews about dvds. The goal is to classify the review as \\"POS\\" if the overall sentiment of the review is positive(the reviewer is satisfied) or as \\"NEG\\" if the overall sentiment of the review is negative(the reviewer is not satisfied). Input: Lies! . It is obvious that this movie is full of lies. Although I have not actually seen it, I know this to be true because I have seen many discussions on the movie on the Fox news channel (God bless them!). The way he attacks poor Mr. Heston is deplorable. Can't Michael Moore tell from the comments Charlton made at the rallies that he doesn't have his faculties about him? I am also unsure that Mr. Heston even said the things that the movie shows him saying. The ability of Hollywood to manipulate and edit sound is truly amazing, making it appear that My President (Heston) is an uncaring, babbling idiot by simply using his own words - shame on you Michael! And as for the way he got the gun from the bank, I agree with the other posters that the entire point of a bank giving away free guns is completely nullified by the fact that they didn't give him the gun the minute he walked into the bank. Bravo to those who figured that out. Also, Michael Moore is fat. Take that Pinkie Output:","response":"NEG Justification: The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with the movie, stating that it is full of lies. They criticize Michael Moore for attacking Charlton Heston and question the movie's editing to paint a negative image of Heston. The reviewer also agrees with other negative comments about the movie and adds a personal attack on Michael Moore at the very end. Overall, the sentiment is negative."},{"question":"First Thoughts: The Four Years War So these insurance cancellation notices. I hear a lot about them. What's the deal? Let's start with the very basics here. About 15 million people purchase health insurance policies on the individual market. That's about 5 percent of the population. When they do so, they typically purchase a 12-month contract with an insurance company. And when that contract runs out, both the individual and the insurance plan have an escape hatch. The individual can decide to no longer purchase the plan -- and the insurance company can decide to no longer offer the plan. Most individuals don't stay in the individual market very long: One study, published in the journal Health Affairs, found that 17 percent of individual market subscribers purchased the same plan for two straight years or longer. There are some restrictions on how insurance companies can terminate products. HIPAA, a health law passed in the 1990s, does require that insurance companies offer subscribers the opportunity to renew their policy, so long as they continue to pay monthly premiums. If they want to discontinue a subscriber's policy, the insurance plan must provide 90 days notice and \\"the option to purchase any other individual health insurance coverage currently being offered by the issuer for individuals in that market.\\" And these are the notices that insurance plans are sending out right now, to hundreds of thousands of subscribers: notices saying that they do not plan to offer the policy anymore, and information about what policies will be available. So why is this happening right now? Some -- or maybe even most -- of the plans offered on the individual insurance market right now don't meet certain requirements in the health-care law. They may not offer preventive care without co-payment, for example, or leave out coverage of maternity care, one of the health-care law's 10 essential benefits. Some of these plans have stuck around for a little bit. The health law allowed plans that existed back in March 2010, when it became a law, to keep selling coverage. These are known as \\"grandfathered plans:\\" They don't meet the health law's requirements, but as long as they don't change much, insurers can keep offering them. Insurance companies typically do like to change their insurance plans, making changes to cost-sharing or the benefits they offer. That means that grandfathered plans have disappeared. We don't have great data about how quickly this is happening in the individual market, but we do see it in this Kaiser Family Foundation survey of the employer market. These cancellations are, essentially, a lot of grandfathered plans exiting the insurance marketplace. From an insurance company's vantage point, grandfathered plans are a bit of a dead end: They can't enroll new subscribers and are really constrained in their ability to tweak the benefit package or cost-sharing structure. There's not a whole lot of business sense, for a managed care company, in maintaining a health plan that doesn't meet the health law's new requirements. How many people are going to get cancellation notices? It's hard to put an exact number on this, given that insurance plans are the ones who decide whether or not to continue offering an insurance product. Experts haveestimated that somewhere between half and three-quarters of those who currently buy their own policies will not have the option to renew coverage, which works out to around 7 to 12 million people. What does this have to do with Obamacare? Pretty much everything: Since the health-care law required insurance companies to change their plans, this is a direct result of the Affordable Care Act. What do they look like? Michelle Malkin posted a copy of her notice last month, which you can take a look at here. In general, these are pretty much the dull, bureaucratic forms that you would imagine an insurance plan sending out. The federal government did draft some sample language for them to use, although it doesn't really address the fact that the insurance plan isn't being renewed. How did nobody see this coming? President Obama has repeatedly said, since the health law passed, that if people like their insurance they could keep it. Which is a weird promise to make when one of the key goals of the health-care law is to change individual market insurance coverage. There are lots of insurance policies, especially on the individual market, that are really bare bones. Some argue they shouldn't even be called insurance coverage, because their coverage is too sparse to insure against financial ruin. One report from the Obama administration, issued in 2011, found that 62 percent of individual market plans don't offer maternity care. Eighteen percent do not cover mental health benefits and 9 percent do not pay for prescription drugs. The health-care law requires insurance plans to cover all of those things, and then some. This includes spending at least 80 percent of subscriber premiums on medical care (leaving 20 percent for administration and profits), covering 10 benefit categories and providing preventive care without any co-payment. That means insurance companies cannot, under the Affordable Care Act, keep selling the plans that they used to sell -- the ones that don't cover prescription drugs and maternity care. And that means that some people who liked purchasing coverage without maternity care and prescription drugs won't be able to keep those plans. The cancellation notices are a feature of the Affordable Care Act, not a bug. The idea was to make insurance coverage more robust -- and that means cancelling policies that offer less thorough coverage. Who thought that was a good idea? The drafters of the Affordable Care Act! The whole idea of the insurance expansion isn't to get Americans to purchase anything called \\"insurance.\\" It's to get them to purchase a specific kind of insurance, a plan that is relatively comprehensive and helps protect against financial ruin. If Americans were going to be required to buy a product, the reasoning goes, it should be one that can actually do some good. Of course, not everyone agrees with this; some contend that shoppers should be able to continue buying less robust insurance policies and have the option of taking on more financial risk. Does a cancellation mean I'm going uninsured? Nope -- as mentioned earlier, insurance plans are required by law to tell you about other options they offer if they discontinue their policy. That's what the sample language from the administration, above, essentially does. Individuals with discontinued policies will have the option to purchase through the new insurance marketplaces (well, if they start working a little better) or they can do so outside the new marketplaces, pretty much like they have in years past. This will vary a lot from person to person. Some people who are buying a bare-bones plan right now will likely see higher premiums under Obamacare. They'd be getting more benefits -- but paying more in premiums. Some people will get financial help buying that more robust insurance; people who earn less than 400 percent of the federal poverty line (about 45,000 for an individual) can use a tax subsidy to purchase their plan. For more on premiums under the Affordable Care Act, you should read this great piece from Ezra. What is a short summary of the above article?","response":"The Four Years War is about health insurance cancellation notices, which are being sent to millions of people who have insurance plans that don't meet the requirements of the Affordable Care Act (also known as Obamacare). The health law has certain requirements that insurance plans must follow, like covering preventive care without co-payments and including coverage for essential benefits such as maternity care. Many existing plans don't meet these requirements, so they're being canceled and replaced with new plans that do meet the requirements. This is happening because the goal of the Affordable Care Act is to improve insurance coverage and make it more comprehensive, even though it may mean some people will have to pay more for their insurance. If your insurance plan is canceled, you'll have the option to purchase a new one that meets the requirements, either through the new insurance marketplaces or outside of them."},{"question":"Bobike is a manufacturer of fun bike seats and safe child seats but also offers a range of wind screens child handlebars head rests cushion sets mounting spares foo Can you repeat this sentence, but add in punctuation?","response":"Sure, sweetheart!

These moths are narrower winged than Copromorphidae , with less rounded forewing tips . Males often have conspicuous patches of scales on either surface ( Dugdale et al. , 1999 ) . The mouthparts are quite diagnostic , usually with prominent , upcurved \`\` labial palps '' , the third segment long ( especially in females ) , and the second segment covered in large scales . Unlike Copromorphidae , the \`\` M2 '' and sometimes \`\` M1 '' vein on the hindwings is absent . The relationship of Carposinidae relative to Copromorphidae needs further investigation . It is considered possible that the family is artificial , being nested within Copromorphidae ( Dugdale et al. , 1999 ) . The Palearctic species have been revised by Diakonoff ( 1989 ) . - A pupa (Latin \\"pupa\\" for doll, plural: \\"pupae\\" or \\"pupas\\") is the life stage of some insects undergoing transformation. The pupal stage is found only in holometabolous insects, those that undergo a complete metamorphosis, going through four life stages: embryo, larva, pupa and imago. - The Lepidoptera is an order of insects that includes moths and butterflies (both called lepidopterans). 180,000 species of Lepidoptera are described, in 126 families and 46 superfamilies, 10% of the total described species of living organisms. It is one of the most widespread and widely recognizable insect orders in the world. The term was coined by Linnaeus in 1735 and is derived from Ancient Greek (scale) and (wing). The Lepidoptera show many variations of the basic body structure that have evolved to gain advantages in lifestyle and distribution. Recent estimates suggest the order may have more species than earlier thought, and is among the four most speciose orders, along with the Hymenoptera, Diptera, and Coleoptera. - Caterpillar is the common name for the larvae of members of the order Lepidoptera (the insect order comprising butterflies and moths). - Copromorphoidea, the \\"fruitworm moths\\" is a superfamily of insects in the lepidopteran order. These moths are small to medium-sized (1050 mm. in wingspan) and are broad-winged bearing some resemblance to the superfamilies Tortricoidea and Immoidea. The antennae are often \\"pectinate\\" especially in males, and many species of these well camouflaged moths bear raised tufts of scales on the wings and a specialised fringe of scales at the base of the hindwing sometimes in females only; there are a number of other structural characteristics (Common, 1990; Dugdale et al., 1999) . The position of this superfamily is not certain, but it has been placed in the natural group of \\"Apoditrysia\\" \\"Obtectomera\\" (Minet, 1991), rather than with the superfamilies Alucitoidea or Epermenioidea within which it has sometimes previously been placed, on the grounds that shared larval and pupal characteristics of these groups have probably evolved independently. It has been suggested that the division into two families should be abandoned (e.g. Holloway et al., 2001). - Camouflage is the use of any combination of materials, coloration, or illumination for concealment, either by making animals or objects hard to see (crypsis), or by disguising them as something else (mimesis). Examples include the leopard's spotted coat, the battledress of a modern soldier, and the leaf-mimic katydid's wings. A third approach, motion dazzle, confuses the observer with a conspicuous pattern, making the object visible but momentarily harder to locate. The majority of camouflage methods aim for crypsis, often through a general resemblance to the background, high contrast disruptive coloration, eliminating shadow, and countershading. In the open ocean, where there is no background, the principal methods of camouflage are transparency, silvering, and countershading, while the ability to produce light is among other things used for counter-illumination on the undersides of cephalopods such as squid. Some animals, such as chameleons and octopuses, are capable of actively changing their skin pattern and colours, whether for camouflage or for signalling. - Copromorphidae, the \\"tropical fruitworm moths\\" is a family of insects in the lepidopteran order. These moths have broad, rounded forewings, and well-camouflaged scale patterns. Unlike Carposinidae the mouthparts include \\"labial palps\\" with the second rather than third segment the longest. The position of the enigmatic New Zealand genus \\"Isonomeutis\\" in this family in uncertain, as it lacks the flimsy cuticle of the pupa characteristic of other Copromorphoidea. With other unusual structural characteristics of the caterpillar and adult, it could represent the sister lineage of all other extant members of this superfamily (Dugdale et al., 1999). The genus \\"Sisyroxena\\" from Madagascar is also notable for its unusual venation and wing scale sockets (Dugdale et al., 1999). - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. - Madagascar, officially the Republic of Madagascar, and previously known as the Malagasy Republic, is an island country in the Indian Ocean, off the coast of Southeast Africa. The nation comprises the island of Madagascar (the fourth-largest island in the world), and numerous smaller peripheral islands. Following the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana, Madagascar split from the Indian peninsula around 88 million years ago, allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative isolation. Consequently, Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot; over 90% of its wildlife is found nowhere else on Earth.

Thad Cochran's ailing wife, who is suffering from dementia. \\"It's the worst,\\" says the narrator of a new Cochran campaign ad airing in the final stretch before the June 3 primary, not so subtly pointing the finger at his GOP Senate challenger, Chris McDaniel, trying to stir up voter disgust. This race, one of the nastiest so far this election year, has gotten even deeper in the Mississippi mud than that. Cochran supporters argue the reason the blogger and tea party activist took Mrs. Cochran's picture was to feed questions about the senator and his longtime aide, Kay Webber.

This Republican primary was supposed to be about the big struggle of ideas within the GOP: a 36-year Senate veteran being challenged by a young tea party-backed opponent who calls the senator a big-spending, out-of-touch Republican too entrenched in Washington.

So with all due respect I would suggest they join me in this fight because they've been silent far too long,\\" he told us. \\"He and I are very different with our ideology. He's a guy that believes in big government. He believes in big spending. He believes in increasing taxes. He believes in increasing his own pay. I am not that guy,\\" McDaniel said. For the tea party movement nationwide -- after a string of primary losses this election year from Kentucky to Idaho -- McDaniel has been its great hope of 2014, the candidate with the best chance of toppling an establishment Republican. Things were looking good for McDaniel earlier this year, especially after Cochran stumbled by telling a local reporter here that \\"the tea party is something I don't really know a lot about.\\" Millions of dollars pouring into Mississippi against Cochran come from a who's who of national tea party groups nationwide: Citizens United, Club For Growth, Senate Conservatives Fund, Tea Party Patriots and Freedomworks. The Sunlight Foundation, a nonprofit group that tracks money in politics, says outside groups have spent 7.6 million on the race, much of it for McDaniel and against Cochran. 2014 midterms: Key races. Fighting back against tea party challenges. But like other Republican incumbents this year, Cochran and his allies are fighting back hard. Henry Barbour, nephew of former Mississippi governor and RNC chairman Haley Barbour, formed a super PAC called Mississippi Conservatives to help Cochran. They have been airing aggressive ads slamming McDaniel as extreme, inconsistent and out of touch with Mississippi's needs. Other traditional GOP groups like the Chamber of Commerce have also come in with ads supporting Cochran, like they have for GOP incumbents in other states this year. Still, Cochran's four decades in Washington have won him loyal supporters. On Memorial Day, Cochran attended an event in Vicksburg. He was invited by the Democratic mayor, George Flaggs, who called him a \\"mentor\\" and \\"great friend.\\" Flaggs told CNN he intends to vote for Cochran in the GOP primary since Mississippi law allows Democrats and others not registered as Republicans to participate. He said Cochran fights hard for Mississippi's needs and calls his seniority -- ranking Republican on the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, a big plus for the state. \\"He's a leader; he's a statesman, and he's what we need in Washington. So stay as long as he wants to stay,\\" Flagg said. Republican Briggs Hopson serves with McDaniel in the Mississippi state Senate, and told CNN he likes McDaniel but that Cochran is the \\"best person for Mississippi right now.\\" \\"Seniority can be a plus. People can lose touch and get lazy and all those things but I don't think that's the case with Senator Cochran. He's been responsive to the needs in Mississippi for many years,\\" Hopson told CNN. 'Those days are over' When we put those bipartisan sentiments to McDaniel he responded with an emphatic, \\"come on!\\" \\"I say name one fight Senator Cochran's lead against Barack Obama. Name one time he's raised his voice in defense of conservatism. Name one time he's fought back the liberal agenda. Name one piece of legislation he's authored in 42 years that benefited the conservative cause. Name one thing that he's been outwardly aggressive about. And they can't name one,\\" McDaniel told CNN. \\"Look, there may have been a time for that in 1973 when he first went to Washington. Maybe when Richard Nixon was president that was the thing people did. Those days are over.\\" We wanted to ask Cochran himself why he thinks he should get another six years, after serving 36 in the U.S. Senate and six before that in the House. But Cochran is trying to run out the clock and avoid unforced errors -- and going to head-scratching extremes to avoid talking to reporters like us. We tried to catch Cochran after his event in Vicksburg, but when an aide came out and saw us waiting, they did a bait and switch -- the car they told us Cochran was getting into screeched away without him, while he snuck out another door and left in another car, leaving reporters in the dust. Special coverage: 2014 midterms. Summarize the highlights of this article.","response":"A conservative blogger got arrested because he tried to take a picture of Senator Cochran's wife, who is not well. This made people very upset and led to arguments between people who support Senator Cochran and people who support a younger politician called Chris McDaniel. The situation became messy and some people questioned whether McDaniel's campaign had anything to do with the picture-taking event. This situation was supposed to be about different ideas within the Republican group but became about the relationship between Senator Cochran and one of his assistants, Kay Webber. McDaniel wants to be like another politician, Ted Cruz, and stick to his principles without compromising. This whole event has gotten in the way of discussing the actual issues and ideas within the Republican group."},{"question":"Please answer the following question by reasoning step-by-step.

These events overlapped, with both happening during the Greek genocide (1914-1922), a period during which, according to various sources, Ottoman and Turkish officials contributed to the death of several hundred thousand Asia Minor Greeks. The resultant Greek exodus from Asia Minor was made permanent, and expanded, in an official Population exchange between Greece and Turkey. The exchange was part of the terms of the Treaty of Lausanne which ended the war.\\" Answer: Answer:","response":"The Greeks reacted to the events in various ways, as the aftermath of the First World War, the Greco-Turkish War of 1919-1922, and the Greek genocide significantly impacted Greek society, politics, and demographics. Their reactions can be categorized into the following aspects: 1. Mourning and Remembrance: The loss of several hundred thousand Asia Minor Greeks during the Greek genocide led to widespread grief and mourning among the Greek population. To remember and honor the victims, various memorials and commemoration ceremonies were established in Greece. Events like the day of remembrance for the Genocide of the Pontian Greeks (May 19) and the day of remembrance for the Asia Minor Catastrophe (September 14) were instituted to honor the memory of those who perished during these tragic events. 2. Demographic Changes: The Greek exodus from Asia Minor and the subsequent population exchange between Greece and Turkey resulted in a significant demographic shift in Greece. Around 1.5 million ethnic Greeks arrived from Asia Minor, while approximately 500,000 Muslims were sent to Turkey. This sudden influx of refugees put a strain on the Greek economy and infrastructure, as the government struggled to provide housing, employment, and social services to the newcomers. Many Asia Minor Greeks faced hardships and discrimination as they tried to integrate into Greek society, but over time, they also contributed to the cultural, economic, and political development of their new homeland. 3. Political Repercussions: The defeat in the Greco-Turkish War and the subsequent Treaty of Lausanne caused a significant political crisis in Greece. Known as the National Schism, the crisis led to the fall of the government headed by Eleftherios Venizelos, a military revolt, the abdication of King Constantine I, and the establishment of a short-lived republic under Pavlos Kountouriotis. Greek politics remained tumultuous during the interwar period, with multiple governments formed and dissolved in quick succession, eventually culminating in the authoritarian Metaxas Regime in 1936. 4. Geopolitical Tensions: The events further strained the relations between Greece and Turkey, leading to mutual hostility and distrust that persisted for decades. Both countries strengthened their respective military capabilities and engaged in a series of territorial disputes, most notably over the sovereignty of Aegean Sea islands. Greece's overall foreign policy shifted to align more closely with Western nations, particularly the United Kingdom and France, in an effort to secure greater protection from potential Turkish aggression. 5. Cultural Impact: The arrival of Asia Minor Greeks in Greece also brought about a cultural exchange that enriched Greek society. The newcomers brought their unique customs, traditions, music, cuisine, and dialects, which were gradually assimilated into Greek culture. This fusion of elements led to the creation of new art forms, styles, and schools, particularly in the fields of music and literature. For example, the Asia Minor Greek influence can be seen in the development of the popular Greek musical genre “Rebetiko.” In conclusion, the Greek reaction to the events that unfolded between 1914 and 1922 was multifaceted, encompassing mourning and remembrance, adaptation to demographic changes, political turmoil, strained international relations, and cultural exchange. These events left a lasting impact on Greek society, shaping the nation's trajectory throughout the 20th century and beyond."},{"question":"Definition: In this task, you will be presented with an English sentence, and you have to translate it into Arabic.

Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","response":"The hypothesis is partly entailed by the premise, although the premise is not well-structured and clear in conveying the complete meaning. Let's analyze both the premise and hypothesis in more detail to further understand why this is the case. Premise: \\"except that it is an accepted place you know it's like any other country you know for whatever reason it's.\\" Based on the premise, we can understand the following concepts: 1. The place being discussed is an accepted place. 2. It is like any other country. 3. There may be reasons for its acceptance, but they are not specified. Although the premise contains ambiguous and repetitive phrases, we can still draw some general conclusions about the place in question. Hypothesis: \\"It is a recognized country.\\" The hypothesis proposes that the place being discussed is a recognized country. The premise states that this place is accepted, which implies some level of recognition. Furthermore, the premise compares this place to other countries, suggesting that it shares similarities with recognized countries in various ways. As a result, the hypothesis is indirectly supported by mentioning acceptance, which is a form of recognition. However, the hypothesis is not fully entailed by the premise, as the premise does not explicitly state that the place is officially recognized or acknowledged in a political context. Recognition could denote acceptance by the broader international community, implying formal acknowledgment of a country's sovereignty and independence by other nations and international organizations. The premise, on the other hand, does not delve into these detailed aspects of recognition and simply states that the place is accepted and shares commonalities with other countries. In summary, while the hypothesis can be seen as partially entailed by the premise due to its indirect support from the accepted place concept and comparisons to other countries, the exact basis for this recognition remains unclear. The premise does not discuss the specificity or broader political implications that such formal international recognition would imply. Therefore, we can conclude that the hypothesis is not fully entailed by the premise, but shares some common ground and can be considered partially supported by the available information."},{"question":"Write highlights for this article: By. Amanda Williams. Michael Green, 84, was dragged from his car and left with a broken hip and needing surgery to a head wound after he was carjacked by a gang of thug.

By the 1970s, Chicago had founded the first feminist art program in the United States. Chicago's work incorporates a variety of artistic skills, such as needlework, counterbalanced with labor-intensive skills such as welding and pyrotechnics. Chicago's most well known work is The Dinner Party, which is permanently installed in the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art at the Brooklyn Museum. In 1970, Chicago decided to teach full-time at Fresno State College, hoping to teach women the skills needed to express the female perspective in their work. At Fresno, she planned a class that would consist only of women, and she decided to teach off campus to escape \\"the presence and hence, the expectations of men.\\" She taught the first women's art class in the fall of 1970 at Fresno State College. It became the Feminist Art Program, a full 15-unit program, in the spring of 1971. This was the first feminist art program in the United States. Fifteen students studied under Chicago at Fresno State College: Dori Atlantis, Susan Boud, Gail Escola, Vanalyne Green, Suzanne Lacy, Cay Lang, Karen LeCocq, Jan Lester, Chris Rush, Judy Schaefer, Henrietta Sparkman, Faith Wilding, Shawnee Wollenman, Nancy Youdelman, and Cheryl Zurilgen. Together, as the Feminist Art Program, these women rented and refurbished an off-campus studio at 1275 Maple Avenue in downtown Fresno. Here they collaborated on art, held reading groups, and discussion groups about their life experiences which then influenced their art. All of the students and Chicago contributed 25 per month to rent the space and to pay for materials. Later, Judy Chicago and Miriam Schapiro reestablished the Feminist Art Program at California Institute of the Arts. After Chicago left for Cal Arts, the class at Fresno State College was continued by Rita Yokoi from 1971 to 1973, and then by Joyce Aiken in 1973, until her retirement in 1992. Chicago is considered one of the \\"first-generation feminist artists,\\" a group that also includes Mary Beth Edelson, Carolee Schneeman, and Rachel Rosenthal. They were part of the Feminist art movement in Europe and the United States in the early 1970s to develop feminist writing and art. Chicago became a teacher at the California Institute for the Arts, and was a leader for their Feminist Art Program. In 1972, the program created Womanhouse, alongside Miriam Schapiro, which was the first art exhibition space to display a female point of view in art. With Arlene Raven and Sheila Levrant de Bretteville, Chicago co-founded the Los Angeles Woman's Building in 1973. This art school and exhibition space was in a structure named after a pavilion at the 1893 World's Colombian Exhibition that featured art made by women from around the world. This housed the Feminist Studio Workshop, described by the founders as \\"an experimental program in female education in the arts. Our purpose is to develop a new concept of art, a new kind of artist and a new art community built from the lives, feelings, and needs of women.\\" During this period, Chicago began creating spray-painted canvas, primarily abstract, with geometric forms on them. These works evolved, using the same medium, to become more centered around the meaning of the \\"feminine\\". Chicago was strongly influenced by Gerda Lerner, whose writings convinced her that women who continued to be unaware and ignorant of women's history would continue to struggle independently and collectively. What did the do there?","response":"At the Feminist Art Program at Fresno State College and later at the California Institute of the Arts, Judy Chicago and her students engaged in a groundbreaking exploration of art from a feminist perspective. They aimed to develop a new approach to art that represented and celebrated women's experiences, histories, and contributions to society. To achieve these goals, they undertook various activities and created impactful artworks that have left a lasting mark on the art world. Here's a brief overview of what they did: 1. Skill Development:Chicago taught various artistic skills including needlework, painting, sculpture, and other traditional and non-traditional art forms to empower her students to express their unique feminine perspectives in their work. They also experimented with labor-intensive skills such as welding and pyrotechnics. 2. Collaborative Art Projects: The students in the program worked together on collaborative projects that highlighted women's shared experiences and challenged the societal norms and expectations surrounding womanhood. One such project was Womanhouse, created in collaboration with Miriam Schapiro, which was the first art exhibition space dedicated to presenting art from a female point of view. 3. Reading and Discussion Groups: Chicago and her students held regular reading and discussion groups focused on women's life experiences, feminist theory, and women's history. These discussions helped inform their artistic expression and deepen their understanding of the female experience. 4. Renovation and Maintenance of the Studio Space: The students and Chicago contributed to the renting and refurbishing of an off-campus studio at 1275 Maple Avenue in downtown Fresno. By collaborating on the creation and maintenance of their workspace, the students in the program established an environment that was truly supportive of women artists. 5. Founding the Los Angeles Woman's Building: In 1973, Judy Chicago, alongside Arlene Raven and Sheila Levrant de Bretteville, co-founded the Los Angeles Woman's Building—an art school, workshop, and exhibition space exclusively for female artists. The establishment of the Woman's Building provided women artists with a supportive and nurturing environment in which to create, learn, and exhibit their work. 6. Developing and Displaying Feminist Art: Under Chicago's guidance and mentorship, students in the program produced a variety of feminist artworks that explored themes such as gender, identity, power, and control. These artworks often incorporated traditional feminine art forms and materials, like needlework and fabric, alongside more conventionally \\"masculine\\" techniques like welding and pyrotechnics. By doing so, the artists effectively subverted traditional gender norms and expectations in the art world. 7. Influencing Future Generations: The Feminist Art Program played a significant role in the broader feminist art movement of the 1970s and, in turn, has left a lasting impact on generations of artists who came after them. The program has inspired and influenced numerous artists and art educators to continue examining the role of women in art, culture, and society."},{"question":"Given the question: Lee completed the work. It was tough and he was tired when he finished. Given the context: What will Lee want to do next? Possible answers: hang around the job longer, get rest, do a good job The answer is:","response":"Based on the context provided, it can be inferred that Lee would most likely want to get some rest after completing the tough task. The question sheds light on Lee's struggle, as the work was challenging and demanding both physically and mentally, leaving him exhausted. This resultantly suggests that he would need to recuperate and regain his energy after the strenuous work. It is rather unlikely that Lee would choose to hang around the job longer or continue putting in more effort, as this would contradict the given context that highlights his exhaustion. Persisting with the work in such a condition may even negatively impact his overall performance and well-being, making it an unreasonable option. Similarly, the suggestion to \\"do a good job\\" seems to have already been addressed, as the question implies that Lee has successfully completed the given task. Taking this into account, the emphasis would now be placed on allowing him to rest and recover. In conclusion, considering the context that outlines Lee's fatigue following the completion of the challenging work, the most plausible option for what he would want to do next is to get some rest. This choice acknowledges his exhaustion and grants him the opportunity to rejuvenate, ultimately enabling him to return to his tasks and responsibilities with renewed energy and focus in the future."},{"question":"Q:I read this background article the other day: Because of human activities, there is more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere today than in the past hundreds of thousands of years. Burning fossil fuels and has released great quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Cutting forests and clearing land has also increased carbon dioxide into the atmosphere because these activities reduce the number of autotrophic organisms that use up carbon dioxide in photosynthesis. In addition, clearing often involves burning, which releases carbon dioxide that was previously stored in autotrophs. I am facing a new situation today: Two cities had different energy source. Big city burned fossil fuels cut forests and cleared land, while Blue city used alternative sources of energy. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which city cleared more lands? A:","response":"From the information provided in the background article and the given situation, it can be deduced that Big City cleared more lands than Blue City. To support this conclusion, let's analyze the activities mentioned for each city: Big City: 1. Burned fossil fuels: When fossil fuels are burned for energy production, they release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, contributing to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions. This indicates that Big City relied heavily on non-renewable energy sources. 2. Cut forests and cleared land: These activities, especially when combined with burning, again contribute significantly to the increase in carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere. By cutting forests and clearing land, Big City decreased the number of autotrophic organisms (such as plants), which actively uptake carbon dioxide during photosynthesis. Blue City: 1. Used alternative sources of energy: Blue City opted for alternative, likely renewable, energy sources, such as solar, wind, or hydro power. These sources produce minimal or no carbon dioxide emissions, and as a result, have less impact on the environment and the atmosphere. Considering these activities, it becomes evident that Big City cleared more lands than Blue City. Their dependence on burning fossil fuels, coupled with the removal of forests and land clearance, are strong indicators that Big City took actions resulting in a higher carbon dioxide output. On the other hand, Blue City's efforts to adopt alternative energy sources reflect a more environmentally friendly approach, which would likely involve minimal or no land clearance."},{"question":"Write the answer: What word commonly follows Trojan or pommel?","response":"The word that commonly follows \\"Trojan\\" or \\"pommel\\" is \\"horse.\\" Both terms are associated with different types of horses, each with unique historical and cultural significance. Trojan Horse: The Trojan Horse is a prominent element in Greek mythology, related to the Trojan War. It is a tale recounted in the epic poem \\"The Iliad\\" by the ancient Greek poet, Homer. According to legends, the Greeks sought to invade the city of Troy, which was securely protected by high, impenetrable walls. To deceive the Trojans, the Greeks came up with an ingenious plan. They constructed a massive wooden horse, in which they hid a small group of soldiers. The Greeks then pretended to sail away, leaving the horse as an apparent offering to the goddess Athena. The Trojans, believing they had won the war, celebrated their victory and brought the horse inside their city. Later that night, the Greek soldiers hidden inside the horse emerged and opened the city gates, allowing the rest of the Greek army to enter Troy undetected. This led to the defeat and ultimate destruction of Troy. The phrase \\"Trojan Horse\\" has now become synonymous with deceptive tactics or strategies employed to gain an advantage over opponents. Pommel Horse: The pommel horse, on the other hand, is a piece of gymnastics apparatus used in artistic gymnastics for male athletes. It consists of a horizontal, elongated body usually made of wood or a combination of wood and metal, covered with foam padding and leather. The body of the pommel horse is supported by two stands, and on its top, there are two handles called pommels. Athletes perform various routines on the pommel horse, which require incredible strength, flexibility, balance, and control. They swing their legs around the apparatus and execute difficult combinations of hand placements, circling movements (such as flairs), and scissor-like maneuvers.

Due to natural selection, organisms with traits that better enable them to adapt to their environment will tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers. Natural selection causes beneficial heritable traits to become more common in a population and unfavorable heritable traits to become less common. For example, a giraffe’s neck is beneficial because it allows the giraffe to reach leaves high in trees. Natural selection caused this beneficial trait to become more common than short necks. Paragraph: Greg and Frank were two friends that studied natural sciences. One day, Greg decided to start reading about natural selection. His friend Frank decided to read more about populations that displayed natural selection more sparingly. They both learned lots of new interesting facts.

Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","response":"The critic is thinking negatively of the movie. In the short movie review, they have pointed out a couple of critical aspects that lead to the negative impression. Firstly, the critic mentions the \\"snail-like pacing\\" of the film, which implies that it is extremely slow-moving and possibly tedious to watch. This is a negative remark, as it suggests that the film's pacing is not engaging and might be frustrating for the audience. Secondly, the review points out a \\"lack of thematic resonance.\\" This suggests that the film fails to convey any meaningful or emotionally impactful themes, which can result in the audience being disinterested or unaffected by the story. A compelling and well-crafted film should convey ideas or emotions that resonate with the viewers, so the lack of thematic resonance is another negative aspect mentioned by the critic. Lastly, the critic describes the film as being \\"more silly than scary,\\" comparing it to a \\"Martha Stewart decorating program run amok.\\" This comparison indicates that, instead of evoking the intended fear or suspense, the movie comes across as ridiculous and disorganized. The use of humor to criticize the ineffectiveness of the film's intended purpose further emphasizes the negative opinion of the critic.

Title: Excalibur Movie plot: The sorcerer Merlin (Nicol Williamson) retrieves Excalibur from the Lady of the Lake for Uther Pendragon (Gabriel Byrne), who secures a brief alliance with Gorlois, the Duke of Cornwall. Uther's lust for Cornwall's wife Igrayne (Katrine Boorman) soon ruins the truce, and Merlin agrees to help Uther to seduce Igrayne on the condition that he gives Merlin whatever results from his lust. Merlin transforms Uther into Cornwall's likeness with the Charm of Making. Cornwall's daughter Morgana senses her father's mortal injury during his assault on Uther's camp; and, while Igrayne is fooled by the disguise and Uther impregnates her, Morgana sees through it, watching Uther as Cornwall dies in battle. Nine months later, Merlin takes Uther's son Arthur. Uther pursues but is mortally wounded by Gorlois' knights. Uther thrusts Excalibur into a stone, crying that \\"None shall wield Excalibur, but me!\\", and Merlin proclaims, \\"He who draws the sword from the stone, he shall be king.\\" Years later Sir Ector and his sons, Kay and Arthur (Nigel Terry) attend a jousting tournament. Sir Leondegrance (Patrick Stewart) wins the chance to try pulling Excalibur from the stone, but he fails. Kay's sword is later stolen, and Arthur pulls Excalibur from the stone while trying to replace the stolen sword. Word spreads, and Merlin announces to the crowd that Arthur is Uther's son and, hence, the rightful ruler. Leondegrance immediately proclaims his support for the new king, but not all are willing to accept. While the others argue, Merlin and Arthur enter the forest, where Merlin tells Arthur that he is the rightful king and that the king and the land are one. Overwhelmed, Arthur falls into a long sleep. When he wakes, Arthur goes to aid Leondegrance, whose castle is under siege by Arthur's enemies, led by Sir Uryens.

Answer:","response":"Nicol Williamson"},{"question":"The U.S. has long had the unenviable distinction of holding the world's largest prison population, in part because of tough-on-crime policies enacted in the 1990s. But sentencing reforms passed in recent years appear to have made a dent, leading to declines in the population over the past eight years. A criminal justice reform organization reported Friday that in 2017, the U.S. prison population dropped below 1.5 million for the first time in more than a decade. The decline, according to the Washington-based Vera Institute for Justice, was driven by a sharp decrease in the number of inmates in federal prisons and decreases in several states with large prison populations. Total U.S. prison population dropped to 1,486,000 last year, a decline of nearly 16,000. The number of federal prisoners fell to 183,000, and the number of inmates in state prisons declined to 1.3 million, according to the report. (The overall figure does not include the more than 600,000 defendants held in local, state and federal jails.) The decline extended an eight-year downward trend in U.S. prison population that has been driven by federal and state sentencing reforms enacted over the past decade. But the Vera institute cautioned that it was unclear whether the trend would continue. \\"Whether criminal justice reform can continue to fuel this sustained decline in the prison population remains to be seen,\\" said Jacob Kang-Brown, senior research associate at Vera. \\"We must continue to do the hard work, as advocates and agents of change, to ensure that all our communities feel the relief of decarceration.\\" The report came as President Donald Trump called on Congress to pass legislation to help former inmates reintegrate into society and avoid going back to prison, as many do. \\"We want former inmates to find a path to success so they can support their families and support their communities,\\" Trump said at a White House summit on prison reform attended by two state governors and Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, who is spearheading... According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What is the topic of the legislation Trump wants to pass?

Question: Many addicts turn to exercise to deal with their addictions, this is because it is a healthy way to do what? Options: A. condition heart B. expend energy C. laugh D. stretch E. weigh A:","response":"B. expend energy Many addicts turn to exercise as a healthy way to deal with their addictions because it provides an effective outlet to expend energy. Engaging in physical activity can serve as a positive coping mechanism that ultimately replaces harmful habits, such as substance abuse or other forms of addiction. Exercise can benefit addicts in several ways. Firstly, it helps in the release of endorphins, which are natural pain and stress fighters; these biochemical substances generate a sense of well-being and can aid in elevating mood. The resulting boost in emotional state can play a significant role in dealing with the psychological aspects of addiction. Secondly, exercise can instill a sense of accomplishment and self-efficacy, providing individuals with the confidence to overcome personal challenges, including addiction. As they see improvements in their physical fitness, they develop a more positive self-image and a greater sense of self-worth. Moreover, engaging in regular physical activity allows addicts to create a structured routine, which is essential for rebuilding stability in their lives. It also enables them to develop a support network of like-minded individuals who may also be using exercise to cope with their own addictions or striving for a healthier lifestyle. This social aspect can foster accountability and encourage more consistent progress in addiction recovery. Finally, exercise can contribute to substantial improvements in physical health. It can help condition the heart, increase physical strength and flexibility, improve sleep quality, and aid in managing stress and anxiety, all of which can further support an individual's journey towards recovery and a healthier life. In conclusion, many addicts turn to exercise to deal with their addictions as it is a healthy way to expend energy, promote emotional well-being, foster a positive self-image, develop a structured routine, and improve overall physical health."},{"question":"Text complete: as they continued their descent in silence , daphne was unwillingly immersed in images of brock -- brock blowing her kisses from across the pool , brock swimming his magnificent butterfly , brock playing chess with joey , brock begging her to please get help . daphne loved him . as soon as she saw him , she loved him . she now saw him , weary-eyed and frowning . \`\` maybe we need a break .

Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary.

The main town and the site of its municipal council is the city of Nyborg. - Faaborg or Fåborg is an old port town located on Faaborg Fjord in Faaborg-Midtfyn municipality on the island of Funen in Denmark. By road, Faaborg is located southwest of Odense, north-northwest of Svendborg, and roughly southeast of Middelfart, depending upon the route. It has a population of 7,178 (1 January 2014). With its busy port, narrow streets and attractive old houses, the town is popular with tourists, particularly in the summer months. Faaborg was formerly the seat of Faaborg municipality. The seat of the new municipality is Ringe. Both municipalities use(d) Faaborg's medieval coat of arms. - A manor house was historically the main residence of the lord of the manor. The house formed the administrative centre of a manor in the European feudal system; within its great hall were held the lord's manorial courts, communal meals with manorial tenants and great banquets. The term is today loosely applied to various country houses, frequently dating from the late medieval era, which formerly housed the gentry. - Odense is the third-largest city in Denmark.

Though physiographically a part of the continent of North America, Greenland has been politically and culturally associated with Europe (specifically Norway and Denmark, the colonial powers, as well as the nearby island of Iceland) for more than a millennium. The majority of its residents are Inuit, whose ancestors migrated began migrating from the Canadian mainland in the 13th century, gradually settling across the island. - An architect is someone who plans, designs, and reviews the construction of buildings. To \\"practice architecture\\" means to provide services in connection with the design of buildings and the space within the site surrounding the buildings, that have as their principal purpose human occupancy or use. Etymologically, \\"architect\\" derives from the Latin \\"architectus\\", which derives from the Greek \\" (\\"arkhi-\\", chief + \\"tekton\\", builder), i.e., chief builder. - Canals and navigations are human-made channels for water conveyance (supply), or to service water transport vehicles. In the vernacular, both are referred to as 'canals', and in most cases, the engineered works will have a series of dams and locks that create areas of low speed current flow. These areas are referred to as\\" 'slack water levels',\\" often just called 'levels'. The main difference between them is that a navigation parallels a river and shares part of its waters, its drainage basin and leverages its resources by building dams and locks to increase and lengthen its long stretches of \\"deep enough\\" slack water levels while staying in its valley. In contrast, a canal cuts across a drainage divide atop a ridge (however humble), generally requiring an external water source above the highest elevation. Many canals have been built at elevations towering over valleys and others water ways crossing far below. Cities need a lot of fresh water and many canals with sources of water at a higher level can deliver water to a destination where there is a lack of water. The Roman Empire's Aqueducts were such water supply canals. - Arable land (from Latin \\"arabilis\\", \\"able to be plowed\\") is, according to one definition, land \\"capable\\" of being ploughed and used to grow crops. In Britain, it was traditionally contrasted with pasturable lands such as heaths which could be used for sheep-rearing but not farmland. - Aarhus (officially spelled Århus from 1948 until 31 December 2010) is the second-largest city in Denmark and the seat of Aarhus municipality. It is located on the east coast of the Jutland peninsula, in the geographical centre of Denmark, northwest of Copenhagen and north of Hamburg, Germany.

Aarhus is the central city in the East Jutland metropolitan area, which had a total population of 1.378 million in 2016. - Denmark is a Scandinavian country in Europe. The southernmost and smallest of the Nordic countries, it is south-west of Sweden and south of Norway, and bordered to the south by Germany. The Kingdom of Denmark is the sovereign state that comprises Denmark proper and two autonomous constituent countries in the North Atlantic Ocean: the Faroe Islands and Greenland. Denmark has a total area of , and a population of 5.7 million. The country consists of a peninsula, Jutland, and an archipelago of 443 named islands, with the largest being Zealand and Funen. The islands are characterised by flat, arable land and sandy coasts, low elevation and a temperate climate. - Borders are geographic boundaries of political entities or legal jurisdictions, such as governments, sovereign states, federated states, and other subnational entities. Some borderssuch as a state's internal administrative border, or inter-state borders within the Schengen Areaare often open and completely unguarded. Other borders are partially or fully controlled, and may be crossed legally only at designated border checkpoints and border zones may be controlled. Mostly contentious, borders may even foster the setting up of buffer zones. A difference has also been established in academic scholarship between border and frontier, the latter denoting a state of mind rather than state boundaries. - Nyborg is a city in central Denmark, located in Nyborg Municipality on the island of Funen and with a population of 16,528 (as of 1 January 2014). Nyborg is one of the 14 large municipalities created on 1 January 2007.

Jutland's terrain is relatively flat, with open lands, heaths, plains and peat bogs in the west and a more elevated and slightly hilly terrain in the east. - In Anglo-Irish history, the lordship of a manor is a lordship emanating from the feudal system of manorialism. In modern England and Wales it is recognised as a form of property, one of three elements of a manor that may exist separately or be combined and may be held in moieties: - A great hall is the main room of a royal palace, nobleman's castle or a large manor house or hall house in the Middle Ages, and continued to be built in the country houses of the 16th and early 17th centuries, although by then the family used the great chamber for eating and relaxing. At that time the word \\"great\\" simply meant big, and had not acquired its modern connotations of excellence. In the medieval period the room would simply have been referred to as the \\"hall\\", unless the building also had a secondary hall, but the term \\"great hall\\" has been predominant for surviving rooms of this type for several centuries, to distinguish them from the different type of hall found in post-medieval houses. Great halls were found especially in France, England and Scotland, but similar rooms were also found in some other European countries. - Glorup is a manor house located between Nyborg and Svendborg in the south - east of the Danish island Funen . Rebuilt to the design of Nicolas - Henri Jardin and his pupil Christian Josef Zuber in 1763 -- 65 , it is considered one of the finest Baroque complexes in Denmark and was included in the 2006 Danish Culture Canon . - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän. - The Nordic countries or Nordics are a geographical and cultural region in Northern Europe and the North Atlantic, where they are most commonly known as Norden (lit., \\"The North\\"). They consist of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden, including their associated territories (Greenland, the Faroe Islands, and the Åland Islands). - The manorial courts were the lowest courts of law in England during the feudal period. They had a civil jurisdiction limited both in subject matter and geography. They dealt with matters over which the lord of the manor had jurisdiction, primarily torts, local contracts and land tenure, and their powers only extended to those who lived within the lands of the manor: the demesne and such lands as the lord had enfeoffed to others, and to those who held land therein. Historians have divided manorial courts into those that were primarily seignorial based on feudal responsibilities and those based on separate delegation of authority from the monarch. There were three types of manorial court: the court of the honour; the court baron; and the court customary, also known as the halmote court. - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund. At , Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area, with a total population of 10.0 million. Sweden consequently has a low population density of , with the highest concentration in the southern half of the country. Approximately 85% of the population lives in urban areas. - An archipelago, sometimes called an island group or island chain, is a chain, cluster or collection of islands. The word \\"archipelago\\" is derived from the Greek \\"- arkhi-\\" (\\"chief\\") and \\" pélagos\\" (\\"sea\\") through the Italian \\"arcipelago\\". In Italian, possibly following a tradition of antiquity, the Archipelago (from medieval Greek \\"*\\" and Latin \\"archipelagus\\") was the proper name for the Aegean Sea and, later, usage shifted to refer to the Aegean Islands (since the sea is remarkable for its large number of islands). It is now used to refer to any island group or, sometimes, to a sea containing a small number of scattered islands. - Funen, with an area of , is the third-largest island of Denmark, after Zealand and Vendsyssel-Thy. It is the 165th-largest island in the world. It is in the central part of the country and has a population of 466,284 (2013). The main city is Odense which is connected to the sea by a seldom-used canal. The city's shipyard, Odense Steel Shipyard, has been relocated outside Odense proper. - Scandinavia is a historical and cultural region in Northern Europe characterized by a common ethnocultural North Germanic heritage and mutually intelligible North Germanic languages. - Svendborg is a town on the island of Funen in south-central Denmark, and the seat of Svendborg Municipality. With a population of 26,672 (1 January 2014), Svendborg is Funen's second largest city.

PUBLISHED:. 16:39 EST, 23 September 2012. |. UPDATED:. 05:07 EST, 24 September 2012. Crammed into small boxes, their heads wedged through tiny holes, the monkeys undoubtedly look terrified. Around them, men in rubber overalls and gas masks arrange a semi-circle of boxes containing guinea pigs on the deck of a sloping pontoon. After the boxes have been laid out, the men disappear below the deck of a ship, and for a while, nothing happens. Scroll down for video. Gruesome: A still from the 1952 film shows a monkey in distress as it is exposed to bubonic plague during the germ warfare tests of the Isle of Lewis. Then, after several minutes, a small bomb placed on a boom a few feet out to sea detonates, and showers the animals in a deadly cloud of bubonic plague. These scenes, which have just been released, appear in a gruesome film showing secret germ warfare experiments on animals carried out by British government scientists sixty years ago. The experiments, which ran from May to September 1952 off the coast of the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides, exposed nearly 3,500 guinea pigs and 83 Rhesus Macaque monkeys to deadly germs such as bubonic plague. Codenamed Operation Cauldron, the secret experiments were part of our nascent biological warfare programme, which at the time was deemed as important as the development of nuclear weapons. Acting in the belief that the Soviets. were producing bacteriological bombs, scientists from Porton Down. laboratory in Wiltshire were briefed to devise similar weapons that. could be used in retaliation against a Russian germ warfare strike. Although. the existence of the 47-minute film has been known about for many. years, it is now available for the world to see on the video-sharing. website YouTube, thanks to the efforts of Mike Kenner, 58, an Open. Government campaigner from Weymouth in Dorset. Trials: A Rhesus Macaque monkey and five guinea pigs await their fates on the deck of the pontoon. Scientists set out the animals in cages on the deck of the pontoon before a small bomb containing bacteriological agents is detonated. ‘This is the only film like it in the world,’ says Mr Kenner, who lobbied the Ministry of Defence to get the film released. ‘As far as I know, it’s the only film that shows animals being exposed to deadly pathogens.’ The MoD was reluctant to release the film, and it is not hard to see why as it is disturbing viewing. Many of the monkeys and guinea pigs exposed to the germs died within a few days, while any that survived were killed and dissected so their organs could be studied for the effects of the deadly germs. Above all, it is the sight of the monkeys’ almost human faces that make the film so shocking.‘Although we see the tests are being carried out on animals,’ says Mr Kenner, ‘when one sees the monkeys, one can’t help but empathise, and realise that these weapons were being designed to be used against people’. Very few of those who took part in Operation Cauldron are still alive. One of the men who can testify to the truth of what happened is Geoffrey Scarlett, 82, who was a petty officer on board the ship the Ben Lomond, which housed the animals and scientists. As the ship’s writer, responsible for sending back reports to the Admiralty, Mr Scarlett well understood the aims of the project. Many of the other sailors only had a vague idea of the experiments being carried out on the nearby pontoon. The terrified monkey are sealed in small boxes in the hold of the pontoon before being brought up on deck in batches to exposed to deadly germs. Fate: Many of the monkeys and guinea pigs exposed to the germs died within a few days, while any that survived were killed and dissected so their organs could be studied. ‘We were simply told that we were. going on a germ warfare trial,’ says Mr Scarlett. ‘But we were not told. where we were going.’ However, the men were informed that taking part. was not compulsory. ‘Right. from the beginning, they let anybody know that if they objected to the. experiments being carried out on animals, then they would be allowed to. drop out and there would be no stain on your record,’ says Mr Scarlett. ‘To. my knowledge, nobody dropped out. You have to remember these were. different times and animal welfare was not such a priority.’ Mr Scarlett also says most saw the necessity for the development of a new type of weapon of mass destruction. ‘It. was the middle of the Cold War,’ he says. ‘You realised that it had to. be done. Most had served in the war, or, like me, had been brought up. during the war. We had seen the atomic bomb, and this was another type. of warfare. ‘In. theory, it was going to be a lot more deadly than nuclear warfare. A. nuclear bomb can take out a city. Germ warfare can take out a country.’ The. utmost care was taken to keep the experiments safe and wind conditions. were carefully monitored before each detonation to avoid spreading the. germs inland. A scientist prepares for an experiment. Around 3,500 guinea pigs and 83 Rhesus Macaque monkeys were exposed to deadly germs. However, there was one accident that could have had disastrous consequences.On the last day of the programme, a trawler, the Carella, sailed through the path of a bubonic plague experiment. ‘The trawler was tailed by two naval vessels for 21 days, waiting for any distress call,’ says bacteriological warfare expert Dr Brian Balmer of University College, London. ‘When none came, almost all records of the incident were burnt.’ Indeed, the crew members only heard about their exposure to the plague when the official records were opened 50 years later. When the scientists involved in the trials returned to Porton Down, they judged the experiments to have been a success. ‘New ground has been broken with plague trials,’ read a report. But the findings of Operation Cauldron were never meant to come to the public’s attention. If the experiments ever did come to light, the then prime minister, Winston Churchill, had prepared a statement justifying what many would have regarded as unethical. ‘The possibility that bacteria may be used in a future war cannot be overlooked,’ the statement read. ‘The researches ... are being pursued so that defensive measures may be taken. The experiments now taking place form part of these researches.’ Today the MoD has sought to distance itself from the experiments. It says it does not recognise the treatment of animals as seen in the film as being in line with modern ethical scientific conduct. Although it is unlikely such creatures are today being exposed to deadly pathogens in the pursuit of military advantage, the release of the film is a chilling reminder of the disquieting lengths Britain went to develop perhaps the most deadly weapons the world had ever seen.

The first book, \\"Doctor Syn: A Tale of the Romney Marsh\\" was published in 1915. The story idea came from smuggling in the 18th century Romney Marsh, where brandy and tobacco were brought in at night by boat from France to avoid high tax. Minor battles were fought, sometimes at night, between gangs of smugglers, such as the Hawkhurst Gang and the Revenue, supported by the army and local militias in the South, Kent and the West, Sussex. - Kent is a county in South East England and one of the home counties. It borders Greater London to the north west, Surrey to the west, East Sussex to the south west, and Essex across the Thames Estuary to the north. The county town is Maidstone. - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved. - Arthur Russell Thorndike (6 February 1885, Rochester, Kent 7 November 1972) was a British actor and novelist, best known for the Doctor Syn of Romney Marsh novels. Less well-known than his sister Sybil but equally versatile, Russell Thorndike's first love was writing and, after serving in World War I, he devoted himself to it. - The Hawkhurst Gang was a notorious criminal organisation involved in smuggling throughout southeast England from 1735 until 1749. One of the more infamous gangs of the early 18th century, they extended their influence from Dorset, where they successfully raided the customs house at Poole, to the Kent coast. After they were defeated in a battle with the Goudhurst militia in 1747, two of their leaders, Arthur Gray and Thomas Kingsmill, were executed in 1748 and 1749. - Romney Marsh is a sparsely populated wetland area in the counties of Kent and East Sussex in the south-east of England.

First, let's look at the equation: 22 * x - 33 * x + 43 * x = 320 Now, let's imagine we have 22 apples, 33 apples, and 43 apples, and we need to find how many apples we have altogether. So first, we add 22 apples and 43 apples to get: 22 apples + 43 apples = 65 apples Now, we'll subtract 33 apples from that: 65 apples - 33 apples = 32 apples Now we know that when we finish with the apples, we have 32 apples. In our equation, each apple is like an \\"x,\\" so we can rewrite it as: 32 * x = 320 Now we need to find the value of x. Since we have 32 times x equals 320, we can ask, \\"How many times do we need to have 32 to make it 320?\\" We can do that by dividing 320 by 32: 320 ÷ 32 = 10 So, x = 10.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is more space rock in space happens, how will it affect the space in the rock gets bigger. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","response":"Step 1: Analyze the given process The original process describes the formation of a cave from water seeping into the ground, interacting with the rock, and gradually carving a cavern as more water rushes through. Process: 1. Water seeps below the soil surface 2. Water comes into contact with rock 3. Rock gets eroded and carved by water over time 4. Space in rock becomes larger and forms a cave 5. As more water rushes through, the cave becomes a cavern Step 2: Understand the perturbation hypothesis The hypothesis states that there is more space rock in space, and questions how it will affect the space in the rock getting bigger. Step 3: Analyze if the perturbation affects the process (directly or indirectly) A. Water seeping below the soil surface The presence of more space rock in space does not directly or indirectly affect the water seeping below the soil surface. Water seepage depends on factors like rainfall and soil porosity, which are not influenced by space rocks. B. Water comes into contact with rock Having more space rock in space does not impact the water coming into contact with the rock below the soil. This interaction depends on the depth and composition of the rock layer, which is not related to space rocks. C. Rock gets eroded and carved by water over time While space rock might affect Earth's overall geological processes, its effect on the local erosion and carving of a specific rock is negligible. The influence of space rocks on Earth's rock erosion is inconsequential compared to the primary factors that cause erosion, such as water and wind. D. Space in rock becomes larger and forms a cave and a cavern The presence or increase of space rocks in space will not have a direct or indirect effect on the formation of caves and caverns. These formations depend on the local geological conditions, such as the type of rock, water flow, and time, which are not affected by space rocks. In conclusion, the proposed perturbation (increase of space rocks in space) does not have a direct or indirect effect on the process of water seeping into the ground, interacting with rocks, and forming caves and caverns. The main factors involved in cave formation (water flow, rock type, and time) are independent of space rocks and their presence in space."},{"question":"You are given a sentence in Portuguese.

However, we can analyze the sentence and explore possible implications to provide a possible informed answer. The term \\"mixed-up\\" can have various interpretations in the context of films. One interpretation is that the film's plot, themes or character developments might be confusing or convoluted, potentially reflecting a negative view of the movie by the reviewer. Another interpretation could be that the film is a hybrid genre, combining elements from different film types or themes, and the reviewer might appreciate the experimentation and find the unconventional mixture to be a positive aspect. Without any further context from the review or information about the critic's tastes and preferences, it is difficult to definitively determine if the movie was seen positively or negatively based on the provided sentence. However, here are two potential scenarios based on the two interpretations mentioned above: Scenario A - Negative: If we assume that the reviewer found the movie to be confusing or convoluted, it is likely that the film failed to deliver a coherent and engaging viewing experience. This could lead to losing the audience's attention and potentially creating frustration. In this case, the phrase \\"mixed-up films\\" suggests that the movie failed to tell its story effectively, thus leading to a negative review. Scenario B - Positive: If we understand \\"mixed-up films\\" as a positive aspect, it could imply that the movie was able to craft a unique and experimental story by blending genres, styles, or themes. In this scenario, the critic might have appreciated the unusual approach to filmmaking and found it refreshing in comparison to traditional storytelling. Consequently, the movie might have received a positive review from the critic.

'' at the door , sybel turned to me one last time and said , \`\` i 'm glad you made it back . i really am . but you 'll find it 's changed out there . it 's no longer the same place . '' \`\` what do you mean , it 's","response":"changed?'' I asked, my curiosity piqued by Sybel's statement. She sighed and looked at me with a mixture of sadness and concern. \`\`Well, where do I start?'' she mused, as she leaned against the door frame. \`\`The world you remember has been altered in many ways. The passage of time, coupled with the events that have taken place while you were away, has caused a shift in the social, political, and economic landscape. People's perspectives and priorities have evolved, and with that, the world has transformed into something quite different from the one you knew before.'' I furrowed my brow in confusion, trying to imagine what could have caused such a metamorphosis. Sybel took a deep breath and continued. \`\`First, the political landscape has altered drastically. Long-standing alliances have crumbled, and new powers have emerged to fill the vacuum left behind. Conflicts between nations have given rise to social unrest, with many people displaced from their homes, seeking refuge in different parts of the world. This has led to a rise in nationalism and xenophobia, as well as increased division within societies.'' \`\`On the other hand, there are also movements focused on unity and cooperation – those who believe in the power of community and solidarity to overcome the many challenges that the world faces. This struggle between opposing ideologies has created a vastly different political climate than the one you remember.'' I listened intently, trying to absorb the enormity of these events. Sybel gave me a moment before continuing. \`\`Economically, the gap between the rich and the poor has widened. Technological advancements have brought about an automation revolution, changing the job market and displacing many workers. This has led to fierce competition for careers and resources, further dividing societies on the basis of wealth and privilege.'' \`\`In many parts of the world, people struggle to access basic necessities like clean water, food, and shelter, while others enjoy lavish lifestyles. This disparity has given rise to social movements that challenge the status quo, seeking to redistribute wealth and establish more equitable systems.'' I could see the weight of these words on her face, the disappointment and frustration she felt with these developments. She pressed on. \`\`The environment has also suffered immensely. Climate change is an ever-present threat, with extreme weather events becoming increasingly common. Disappearing ice caps, rising sea levels, and devastating natural disasters have taken their toll on the world population and ecosystems alike.'' \`\`There are many who have recognized the need for urgent action and are working tirelessly to combat climate change, preserve endangered species and habitats, and promote a more sustainable way of life. But still, there are others who deny the reality of our global crisis, obstructing meaningful change and perpetuating the destructive status quo.'' Sybel paused, her expression a combination of disappointment and determination. She locked her gaze with mine. \`\`It's a lot to take in, I know. The world you return to may not be the same one you left behind, but it's important to remember that with change comes opportunity. There is still beauty, hope, and inspiration out there – it's up to us to seek it, embrace it, and use it to make a difference in our lives and those of others.'' \`\`So, while the world has indeed changed, so, too, can we adapt and contribute to a brighter future. It's up to you to find your place in this new world and be part of the change you wish to see.'' With that, Sybel smiled softly, offering me both encouragement and comfort in the face of such overwhelming revelations. She stepped back from the door, nodding for me to step out and embrace this transformed world. And as I ventured forth, I took her words to heart, vowing to make a difference, no matter how small, in a world that was no longer the same, but still brimming with possibilities."},{"question":"Sentence 1: Rapper Eminem mentions Dr. Dre in his song Guilty Conscience , in which Dee Barnes is featured .

Is the following statement true? \\"Human leg make the body move from place to place.\\"","response":"The statement \\"Human leg make the body move from place to place\\" is true, but it could be better phrased for clarity. A more accurate and grammatically correct version of the statement would be: \\"Human legs enable the body to move from one place to another.\\" Now let's break down the information step by step: 1. Human legs: Humans have two legs, comprising bones, joints, muscles, ligaments, and tendons. These components work together to provide support and mobility. 2. Movement: The primary purpose of human legs is to facilitate movement, such as walking, running, and jumping, as well as maintaining balance and stability. This mobility is achieved through the coordinated contraction and relaxation of different leg muscles. 3. Joints and bones: Major joints in the legs include the hip, knee, and ankle, which allow for a range of motion during various movements. The major bones in the leg include the femur (thigh bone), tibia and fibula (lower leg bones), and the patella (kneecap). 4. Muscles: Several large muscles in the legs contribute to movement, such as the quadriceps, hamstrings, and calf muscles. Additionally, smaller muscles help stabilize the leg and provide balance during movement. 5. Nervous system: The brain and nervous system control the muscles in the legs, sending signals to initiate movement, maintain balance, and stop actions as needed. In conclusion, the human legs play a crucial role in enabling the body to move from one place to another. The legs' bones, joints, and muscles all work together to provide mobility, and the brain and nervous system regulate these movements."},{"question":"The University of Kansas men's basketball team squeaked by Ohio State late Saturday night, setting up an an NCAA tournament championship showdown with top-seeded Kentucky. Hours earlier, Kentucky defeated Louisville in its own semifinal. The Wildcats and the Jayhawks will play Monday night for the title at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans. Both teams squared off earlier in the year with Kentucky pulling off a 75-65 win. Under coach John Calipari, Kentucky posted a 32-2 record over the course of this season -- with its only losses coming at the hands of Indiana and Vanderbilt, the latter coming in the Southeastern Conference tourney. It entered the 68-team NCAA tournament as the No. 1 seed in the South bracket, and the favorite to win it all in the eyes of many pundits. The team was led by Anthony Davis, a freshman who was recently named the Associated Press college basketball player of the year. But a win in Saturday's contest against Kentucky's in-state rival, Louisville, was hardly a given. The Cardinals, for one, had a head coach with a national title to his credits -- Rick Pitino, who ironically won that distinction in 1996 as head coach at Kentucky. Louisville entered the NCAAs with momentum after winning the Big East Tournament. The Cardinals battled the Wildcats tough throughout Saturday's game, tying the score, 49-49, at one point early in the second half. But the Wildcats eventually pulled away, winning by a 69-61 margin. Ohio State and Kansas entered the night's second tilt as No. 2 seeds, having both defeated the top seeds in their brackets -- Syracuse and North Carolina, respectively -- in the Elite Eight. The Jayhawks were paced by forward Thomas Robinson, this season's lone unanimous AP All-American pick. On the other side of the court was the Buckeyes' Jared Sullinger, who himself earned first-team honors for the second straight year. On Saturday night, Ohio State jumped ahead early, carrying a 34-25 advantage into the half. But Kansas stormed back after the intermission, notching the game up at 38-38 with 14 minutes left in the game. The rest of the game was nip-and-tuck, with rarely more than a few points separating the two teams and several lead changes in the final minutes. Kansas edged ahead with just over a minute to go and held on, thanks to some pivotal free throws and an Ohio State lane violation call, for a 64-62 victory. Summarize the highlights of this article.","response":"The University of Kansas men's basketball team won a close game against Ohio State, and now they'll play against top-seeded Kentucky in the NCAA tournament championship. Kentucky won their own game against Louisville earlier. The big basketball game will be on Monday night in New Orleans. Kentucky is a favorite to win the whole thing, and they're led by a really good player named Anthony Davis. In the game between Ohio State and Kansas, the score was very close and both teams played very well, but Kansas won 64-62 at the end."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Given the following passage \\"Chopin's life and his relations with George Sand have been fictionalized in numerous films.

Since it was a Saturday night, everything else was empty for miles. The parking lot was filled with sports cars, hybrids, and shiny suburban tanks. The door facing the parking lot was open, spilling out muted lights and the din of yuppie chatter. It cast a somewhat foreboding aura over the entrance. The first thing I noticed as I approached was the beefy refrigerator in a rented tux blocking the doorway. The second thing was the surveillance camera perched on the wall above his head. I had stopped home and changed first, so I was sure I was dressed mostly appropriately for some rich faux-hipster art party - charcoal gray pinstripe jacket over a TV on the Radio t-shirt, skinny cuffed jeans, Docs, and a black fedora. I certainly didn't look any worse than the other idiots I saw filing in and out of the door. I even had an invitation.

Differences: - The level of whiteness of the dog may differ (white vs. snow-white). - The color of the muzzle is specified in the second sentence (red) but not in the first. - The second sentence includes the action of chasing a cat, which is not mentioned in the first sentence. - The location is described in more detail in the second sentence (grassy field) than in the first (grass). Based on these similarities and differences, we cannot fully conclude that the second sentence is true given the first sentence. While they both involve a white dog with a muzzle running on grass, there are additional details in the second sentence (the intensity of the dog's color, the red muzzle, chasing a cat, and the specific location) that are not mentioned or addressed in the first sentence."},{"question":"What sentence would provide a factual answer to this question: \\"Some animals get caught easily by other animals because they are slow while the predators are\\"","response":"\\"Some animals get caught easily by other animals because they are slow while the predators are fast and agile.\\" Step 1: Identify the missing descriptive term - In this case, the term needed to describe the predators is something that contrasts with the slow-moving animals. Step 2: Determine the appropriate term - The appropriate term in this case needs to emphasize the difference in speed and hunting abilities between the slow animals and their predators. Step 3: Place the term in the sentence - The term \\"fast and agile\\" can be placed at the end of the sentence to effectively describe the predators' speed and hunting abilities in comparison to the slower animals they prey upon. Step 4: Check for accuracy and completion - After inserting the term \\"fast and agile\\" into the sentence, it now provides a factual answer to the question by highlighting the contrasting speeds and abilities between slow-moving prey and their more swift, agile predators."},{"question":"In this task you will be given an answer to a question.

Movie title: Mystic River Movie plot: In 1975, three children - Jimmy, Sean, and Dave - are playing on the streets of Boston when a stranger approaches them. Since the stranger has a badge and is wearing a suit, the children assume that he is a police officer. The stranger orders Dave to enter his car, and Dave obeys. The men lock him inside a basement and sexually abuse him for four days, after which he manages to escape. Twenty-eight years later, the boys are grown and still live in Boston, but they are no longer close friends. Jimmy (Sean Penn) is an ex-convict running a neighborhood store, while Dave (Tim Robbins) is a blue-collar worker. The two are still neighbors and related by marriage. Sean (Kevin Bacon) has become a detective with the Massachusetts State Police. Several months prior, his wife left him before having their child but his wife still sometimes calls him without saying a word. Jimmy's 19-year-old daughter Katie (Emmy Rossum) visits him at the store he owns, and tells her father she will be going out that Saturday night with her friends. Jimmy mentions that the next day is her sister's communion, and as she leaves it is revealed she is secretly dating a boy named Brendan (Tom Guiry), and they reference plans they have for the next day. That night Dave is at a bar where Katie happens to also show up with her friends; Katie and her friends dance on the bar top to the music but Dave continues to watch the TV at the bar. Dave comes home at 3am Sunday morning with an injured hand and blood on his clothes, which his wife Celeste (Marcia Gay Harden) helps him clean, but immediately notices inconsistencies in his story. Dave claims that he fought against a mugger and may have killed him.

However, I can still offer some insight on the movie \\"Mystic River,\\" which you provided a detailed plot summary for. In the movie \\"Mystic River,\\" directed by Clint Eastwood and based on the novel by Dennis Lehane, the main suspects and individuals involved with the investigation are: 1. Dave Boyle (Tim Robbins): As you mentioned in the plot summary, Dave comes home one night with blood on his clothes and an injured hand. His wife, Celeste, notices inconsistencies in his story about fighting a mugger. Due to this suspicious behavior and his history of childhood trauma, Dave becomes a primary suspect in Katie's murder. 2. Brendan Harris (Tom Guiry): Brendan is secretly dating Katie, which makes him a possible suspect as well. The police might investigate him as a potential suspect in the case, especially if they discover that they had secret plans the day after Katie's disappearance. 3. Jimmy Markum (Sean Penn): Although Jimmy is Katie's father, his criminal background and connections to former associates in crime could bring up suspicions about his potential involvement in the murder. 4. Sean Devine (Kevin Bacon): As a detective working on the case, Sean may find himself suspected by his colleagues, especially if they learn about his strained relationship with his wife. They may question whether his personal life is affecting his judgement and the integrity of the investigation. In general, when assessing the investment potential for a film proposal, it is crucial to consider various factors. These factors include the screenplay's quality, the film's genre and potential audience appeal, the production's budget, the attached talent (including actors, director, and producers), and the distribution strategy.

The farm next to lake Montopeke gets rain on a regular basis and so the farmer doesn't need to water his crops as much. The farm that is adjacent to lake Costanza hardly gets any rain at all though. Both farms are able to prosper and do well though despite the different amount of rain they get. and a hint : Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. Please answer this question : Which lake will have less algae? Answer:","response":"Lake Costanza will have less algae. Since this lake is situated in an area that hardly gets any rain, there will be less dissolved fertilizer runoff from the adjacent farm entering the lake. Consequently, there will be less nitrogen available in the water to promote algae growth. On the other hand, Lake Montopeke gets rain on a regular basis, which increases the chances of dissolved fertilizer runoff from the nearby farm, leading to a higher nitrogen concentration in the lake and, therefore, more algae growth."},{"question":"Translate to Finnish: Forty percent of those one thousand complaints are associated with violations of Community environmental law.","response":"Step 1: Read the sentence and understand its meaning I read the sentence given to me by the user and try to understand the meaning.

Long Queue vs Online Tickets You can either wait in line to get in or buy tickets online for specific time slots to bypass the line. Wait times can be anywhere from 30 minutes to 3+ hours and in the summer time, it’s common to wait for hours. I definitely recommend buying a ticket online. Keep in mind that they have a limited number of tickets for each time slot, so don’t wait too long to buy or you may be stuck in that loooooong line. We got quite a few less-then-friendly looks from those in the line when we bypassed the entire queue and went right in. C’est la vie (insert Gallic shrug here). For some inexplicable reason, the site says you must print your tickets if you buy them online. Given that most visitors to the catacombs are tourists with limited or no access to a printer, this seems particularly silly, but what can you do? Luckily, we were in a hotel with a small business center so we printed our tickets there. Online tickets cost quite a bit more (27€ compared to 12€ for adults and 10€ for those age 26 or under).

Considering this, an ideal solution would enhance or at least not hinder its ability to perform this function. Step 2: Evaluate each choice (i) Can be worn as a hat Wearing a broom as a hat does not seem to contribute to the function of cleaning. In fact, it may prove challenging to use the broom for sweeping if it is worn as a hat. (ii) Can have a hat hung on it This choice allows a hat to be hung on the broom, which does not seem to directly enhance the cleaning function. However, it does not hinder the broom's primary function either. It could also help in storing the hat while using the broom for cleaning. Step 3: Determine the better solution Based on the evaluation, choice (ii) can have a hat hung on it, is the better solution for the goal of using a broom. This option does not hinder the primary function of the broom and could even provide additional utility in storing a hat. Meanwhile, choice (i) is likely to interfere with the broom's main purpose."},{"question":"I can use this background: In exercises such as weight lifting, skeletal muscle contracts against a resisting force (see Figure below ).

If you don’t use a muscle, it will get smaller and weaker—so use it or lose it. Now, I have a new situation: Two groups of soldiers started different training programs.

Answer:","response":"The Brown group, which ran 3 miles a day for three months, would not have experienced a significant increase in muscle size compared to the Blue group that performed weight training for the same period. This is because running focuses primarily on improving cardiovascular fitness and endurance, which strengthens the cardiac muscle without significantly increasing the size of skeletal muscles. Weight training, on the other hand, involves resistance exercises that challenge and work the skeletal muscles, leading to increased muscle size and strength.

On average, Mickey mounts six less than twice as many horses per day as does Minnie, while Minnie mounts three more horses per day than there are days in a week. How many horses does Mickey Mount per week? Your thoughts:","response":"To determine the number of horses Mickey mounts per week, we would need to first find out the average number of horses Minnie mounts per day and then apply the given information about Mickey's daily average. Let's break it down step by step. Step 1: Find the average number of horses Minnie mounts per day. Minnie mounts three more horses per day than there are days in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so: Minnie_horses = 7 days + 3 horses = 10 horses. Minnie mounts 10 horses per day on average. Step 2: Find the average number of horses Mickey mounts per day. According to the information, Mickey mounts six less than twice as many horses per day as Minnie: Mickey_horses = (2 * Minnie_horses) - 6 Plugging in the value we found for Minnie_horses: Mickey_horses = (2 * 10) - 6 = 20 - 6 = 14 horses. Mickey mounts 14 horses per day on average. Step 3: Calculate the number of horses Mickey mounts per week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find the number of horses Mickey mounts per week by multiplying the average number of horses he mounts per day by 7: Mickey_horses_per_week = Mickey_horses * 7 days Mickey_horses_per_week = 14 horses * 7 days = 98 horses. Conclusion: Mickey mounts 98 horses per week."},{"question":"Do these mean the same?

He acquired a criminal record and was sentenced to a juvenile reformatory for assault, having stabbed a man when he was 11. Carter escaped from the reformatory in 1954 and joined the Army. A few months after completing infantry basic training at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, he was sent to West Germany. During the new trial, Alfred Bello repeated his 1967 testimony, identifying Carter and Artis as the two armed men he had seen outside the Lafayette Grill. Bradley refused to cooperate with prosecutors, and neither prosecution nor defense called him as a witness. The defense responded with testimony from multiple witnesses who identified Carter at the locations he claimed to be at when the murders happened. Investigator Fred Hogan, whose efforts had led to the recantations of Bello and Bradley, appeared as a defense witness. Hogan was asked on cross examinations whether any bribes or inducements were offered to Bello to secure his recantation, which Hogan denied. His original handwritten notes on his conversations with Bello were entered into evidence. The defense also pointed out the inconsistencies in the testimony of Patricia Valentine, and read the 1967 testimony of William Marins, who had died in 1973, noting that his descriptions of the shooters were drastically different from Artis and Carter's actual appearances. The court also heard testimony from a Carter associate that Passaic County prosecutors had tried to pressure her into testifying against Carter. Prosecutors denied the charge. After deliberating for almost nine hours, the jury again found Carter and Artis guilty of the murders. Judge Leopizzi re-imposed the same sentences on both men: a double life sentence for Carter, a single life sentence for Artis. Artis was paroled in 1981. Carter's attorneys continued to appeal. In 1982, the Supreme Court of New Jersey affirmed his convictions (4-3). While the justices felt that the prosecutors should have disclosed Harrelson's oral opinion (about Bello's location at the time of the murders) to the defense, only a minority thought this was material. The majority thus concluded that the prosecution had not withheld information that the Brady disclosure law required that they provide to the defense. According to bail bondswoman Carolyn Kelley, in 1975-1976 she helped raise funds to win a second trial for Carter, which resulted in his release on bail in March 1976. On a fund-raising trip the following month, Kelley said the boxer beat her severely over a disputed hotel bill. The Philadelphia Daily News reported the alleged beating in a front-page story several weeks later, and celebrity support for Carter quickly eroded, though Carter denied the accusation and there was insufficient evidence for legal prosecution. Mae Thelma Basket, whom Carter had married in 1963, divorced him after their second child was born, because she found out that he had been unfaithful to her.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What was Rubin Carter's second conviction for?","response":"Rubin Carter's second conviction was for the murders at the Lafayette Grill.

Article: Thousands of cities around the globe turned off their lights for an hour to mark Earth Hour 2014, a symbolic show of support for the environment organized by the World Wide Fund for Nature. Since the movement began in Sydney, Australia, in 2007, it has spread to more than 7,000 cities across more than 160 countries. Singapore continues to hold one of the world's largest lights-off events, drawing around 9,000 people this year to Marina Bay Sands, a commercial center typically awash in electricity. To mark the event actors Andrew Garfield, Jamie Foxx, Emma Stone and a group of other famous stars from The Amazing Spider-Man 2 movie were in town. Other iconic landmarks that fell dark included the Petronas Twin Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok's Wat Arun temple, the Empire State Building in New York, the Eiffel Tower in Paris, Sydney Opera House, Red Square in Moscow, the Bird's Nest in Beijing and Hong Kong Harbor. As the movement has grown, more organizations and business have committed to switching off their lights in support of efforts to reduce their environmental footprint. In Singapore, at least 600 organizations and companies agreed to either switch off their lights or participate in movements to use fewer plastic bags, take shorter showers, turn up their air-conditioning units or switch to LED lighting. This year the World Wide Fund for Nature, which first launched worldwide Earth Hour, also launched Earth Hour Blue, a crowdfunding platform aimed at raising money for environmental projects around the globe. On Mar. 26 a project to stop the illegal wildlife trade in Asia by providing assistance to wildlife rangers became the first one to reach its target of 20,000 by relying completely on crowdfunding.

He rented No. 11 Exchange Buildings; a week later Svaars rented number 9 for a month, saying he needed it for storage. The gang were unable to rent number 10, which was directly behind their target, 119 Houndsditch, the jeweller's shop owned by Henry Samuel Harris. The safe in the jeweller's was reputed to contain between £20,000 and £30,000 worth of jewellery; Harris's son later stated the total was only around £7,000. Over the next two weeks the gang brought in various pieces of necessary equipment, including a 60-foot (18.25 m) length of India rubber gas hose, a cylinder of compressed gas and a selection of tools, including diamond-tipped drills.With the exception of Gardstein, the identities of the gang members present in Houndsditch on the night of 16 December 1910 have never been confirmed. Bernard Porter, writing in the Dictionary of National Biography, considers that Sokoloff and Peters were present and, in all likelihood, were two of those who shot the policemen who interrupted their burglary. Porter opines that Peter the Painter was probably not at the property that night, while the journalist J P Eddy suggests that Svaars was among those present. Donald Rumbelow, a former policeman who wrote a history of the events, considers that those present consisted of Gardstein, Smoller, Peters and Dubof, with a second group in case the work needed to continue into the following day, which included among their number Sokolow and Svaars. Rumbelow considers a third group on standby, staying at Hoffman's lodgings, to have comprised Hoffman, Rosen and Osip Federoff, an unemployed locksmith. Rumbelow also considers that present at the events—either as lookouts or in unknown capacities—were Peter the Painter and Nina Vassilleva.On 16 December, working from the small yard behind 11 Exchange Buildings, the gang began to break through the back wall of the..., what would be the answer ?

What is the answer??","response":"To solve the equation 3129*c = -5233*c + 1061974 for c, we will first add the terms with c on one side of the equation and isolate the term without c on the other side. Here are the steps to do that: Step 1: Add 5233*c to both sides of the equation to eliminate the c term from the right side: 3129*c + 5233*c = -5233*c + 5233*c + 1061974 8362*c = 1061974 Step 2: Now, we have an equation in the form of Ac = B, where A = 8362 and B = 1061974. To find the value of c, we will simply divide both sides of the equation by A (8362): c = 1061974 / 8362 By performing the division, we get: c ≈ 126.894 (rounded to three decimal places) So, the solution to the equation 3129*c = -5233*c + 1061974 is c ≈ 126.894."},{"question":"Summarize this article in one sentence.

Its most striking feature is the great Norman screen, running up without buttresses or projections to the parapet and hiding the bases of the square, richly decorated towers of the west front. The plain centre of the screen is the work of Remigius, the first bishop. The rest of it is relieved with rich arcading of Late Norman and Early English periods. The wooden spires which crowned the towers were removed in 1807. In 1192 Hugh of Avalon determined to rebuild the Norman building of Remigius, which an earthquake had shaken. To him we owe the choir and eastern transept. His successors completed the western transept and began the west end of the nave. So much money had to be spent in rebuilding the central tower, which fell in 1239, that the canons could not rebuild the nave entirely, but had to incorporate the Norman end by Remigius. Unfortunately the axis of the west front does not correspond to that of the nave, which is too wide for its height. The low vaulting is a serious defect in the choir built by St. Hugh, but of the superb beauty of the Angel Choir, which encloses his shrine, there can be no doubt. In its richness of sculpture it is one of the masterpieces of Gothic architecture in England. The interior of the cathedral is remarkable for the harmony of its style, which is Lancet-Gothic, and the dim lighting of the nave only adds to its impressiveness.

The question and answer pair are described below.","response":"Question: Can a woman trying to see through a window always see clearly, especially if the room is dark? Answer: No, a woman trying to see through a window isn't always able to see clearly, especially if the room she is in is dark. The level of visibility depends on several factors such as the lighting conditions both inside and outside the room, as well as the presence of any obstructions or distortions on the window's surface. In a dark room, the woman's eyes would need time to adjust to the low light levels, a process known as dark adaptation, before she can begin to discern shapes and objects outside the window to some extent. Dark adaptation generally takes around 20-30 minutes for the human eye to adjust optimally to darkness, but some level of vision is possible before the completion of this process. Additionally, the darker the room, the more reliant she will be on whatever available external source of light there is to illuminate the outdoor scene. External factors such as the brightness and angle of light outside, the weather, and the transparency of the window glass also play a significant role in determining how clearly she can see through the window. If it is broad daylight outside and the window glass is clean and clear, her ability to see outside will be much better than if she were trying to look outside during a storm, foggy conditions, or if the window glass was dirty or frosted. Furthermore, if there are obstructions such as curtains, blinds, or external shading devices on the window, they may also considerably impede her visibility. In conclusion, a woman trying to see through a window in a dark room can face difficulties in seeing clearly due to factors such as darkness, lighting conditions outside, the clarity of the window glass itself, and the presence of any obstructions. These factors combined would impact her ability to view the scene or objects outside."},{"question":"Choose the correct sentiment from candidates: Options: - negative. - positive. TEXT:That word 'True' in this film's title got my alarm bells ringing. They rang louder when a title card referred to America's Civil War as the 'War Between the States' (the circumlocution preferred by die-hard southerners). Jesse James -- thief, slave-holder and murderer -- is described as a quiet, gentle farm boy. How dishonest is this movie? There is NO mention of slavery, far less of the documented fact that Jesse James's poor widdered mother owned slaves before the war, and that Jesse and his brother Frank actively fought to preserve slavery. According to this movie, all those Civil War soldiers were really fighting to decide whether Missouri is a northern state or a southern state ... that's ALL. (Missouri: It's a candy mint! It's a breath mint!) Black people are entirely absent from this movie, except for two glimpses of a pair of beggars, one of whom wears a \\"HELP THE POOR\\" sign that's very implausibly typeset instead of handwritten. (Some shots of 19th-century newspapers are inaccurate too, with 20th-century type fonts.) This film has a weird flashback structure. There's some very impressive stunt riding (and some fine work by stunt horses), and one excellent montage. I savoured one line of dialogue: 'Some of those boys will never taste beans again.' The movie gets a few facts straight: Agnes Moorehead, as Jesse's mother, conceals her right arm in the scenes following the raid by the agents of Pinkerton (here called 'Remington') in which Jesse James's real-life mother suffered injuries requiring the amputation of her lower arm. Some errors here are pardonable: during his bushwhacking days, the real Jesse James accidentally shot off part of his left middle finger, but Robert Wagner (in the title role here) does not have a stumpfinger. I've seen a photo of Jesse James's real wife; if she had looked half as glamorous as Hope Lange looks in this movie, Jesse James might have stayed home more. There's plenty of revisionism here, and most of the male actors wear 1950s hairstyles. But many of this movie's errors were avoidable. Jesse James's mentor William Quantrill is mentioned several times, but all the actors mispronounce his name. We see Jesse and his wife moving into an elaborate two-storey house (where he will soon die) after paying a rent of 18. Actually, Jesse James's last residence (at 1318 Lafayette Street, St Joseph, Missouri) was a simple one-storey cottage, renting for 14. There was no upper storey ... so, when Jesse James is killed, his wife could not come running from upstairs as Hope Lange does here. (She was actually in the kitchen.) One continuity error: Robert Wagner (with no stunt double) does an impressive job of taking a slug to the jaw and falling over while his hands are tied behind his back ... but when he gets up, the rope binding his wrists has vanished. The screenplay does some weird and unnecessary juggling of dates. Following the Northfield robbery attempt, Jesse says he expects to get home by his birthday. The actual Northfield bank raid by the James Gang (7 September, 1876) was two days AFTER Jesse James's birthday. (Maybe he meant next year's birthday.) Later, we see Jesse and his wife moving into their St Joseph home on a fine summer day, while Jesse tells her what he plans to do when Christmas Eve arrives ... but in real life, Mr and Mrs Jesse James moved into that house on 24 December, 1881 ... so this scene should *BE* on Christmas Eve! These errors were entirely avoidable. Some of the fictionalisations here don't make sense. According to this movie, the Northfield bank raid failed because one (fictional) henchman was late in cutting the telegraph wires. If this had actually happened, it would indeed have hampered the James Gang's getaway ... but it wouldn't have affected the robbery itself, which failed for other reasons. There are good performances here by Jeffrey Hunter (as Frank James), Moorehead, Alan Hale Jnr (as Cole Younger) and by stage actress Marian Seldes in a rare screen role. I was disappointed by Robert Wagner, normally an under-rated actor. Elsewhere, Wagner has proved his impressive range by convincingly portraying heroes, villains and morally ambiguous characters. Here, he can't seem to decide whether to depict Jesse James as a goodie or a baddie ... so he doesn't much bother. John Carradine phones in his performance in a brief role as a fictional jackleg preacher who baptises Jesse and his wife at their wedding. In fact, Jesse James was baptised in childhood by his uncle, a Methodist minister ... but perhaps this second baptism is a topping-up. Jesse James was no Robin Hood. (I doubt that Robin Hood was Robin Hood either, but that's another story.) There is not one single documented instance of Jesse James ever sharing his loot with anyone beyond his own family. After some of his hold-ups, he didn't even split the swag with the rest of his gang. In this movie, Jesse gets gunned down right after he vows to give up his bandit ways forever. In reality, the night before his death, Jesse James and the Ford brothers stole horses that Jesse planned to use the next day in a robbery of the Platte City bank. As preparation for most of his robberies, Jesse James stole horses from local farmers ... the same poor folk who (in the inaccurate legends) were supposedly the beneficiaries of his largesse. I cringed at one scene here, in which the fictional Jesse James is so gol-durn refined that he disapproves of an oil painting which tastefully depicts nudes. 'The True (not much!) Story of Jesse James' is wilfully dishonest about a thieving murderer, and likewise dishonest about the Civil War. For the very impressive stunt work, one good montage and a few fine acting turns, I'll rate this obscenely dishonest movie 2 points out of 10.","response":"The correct sentiment for this text is: - negative."},{"question":"Given the question: Skylar just started playing soccer for the first time.

Inflammation is caused by chemicals that are released when skin or other tissues are damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand.

Flight is the primary means of locomotion for most bird species and is used for breeding, feeding, and predator avoidance and escape. Birds have various adaptations for flight, including a lightweight skeleton, two large flight muscles, the pectoralis (which accounts for 15% of the total mass of the bird) and the supracoracoideus, as well as a modified forelimb (wing) that serves as an aerofoil. Wing shape and size generally determine a bird species' type of flight; many birds combine powered, flapping flight with less energy-intensive soaring flight. About 60 extant bird species are flightless, as were many extinct birds. Flightlessness often arises in birds on isolated islands, probably due to limited resources and the absence of land predators.

In honor of this special day, which makes otherwise rational people do ridiculous things to get their name in the (kinda) history books, we’ve rounded up some of the weirdest records out there. Find out what they are after the jump. The first honor goes to former Texas Medical student Wesley Pemberton who had the world’s longest leg hair, which had grown to 5 inches long. After Pemberton realized it wasn’t a girl’s hair that had landed on his leg, he started conditioning the stuff to make sure it stayed nice. Dealbreaker? [KLTV] An English man named Ken Edwards ate 36 cockroaches in one minute on the appropriately named British morning show “The Big Breakfast.” He said that swallowing the critters is “like having an anesthetic at the back of the throat,” because of the scent they emit to ward off predators. Apparently, Ken got attention several years ago after putting 47 rats down his pants. [Guinness World Records] The record for the longest fingernails belonged to a woman named Lee Redmond, who managed to avoid cutting her nails since 1979 and they’d grown to a combined 28 ft., 4.5 inches. But when they broke off in a car crash, the 68-year-old realized it was way easier to do things without them and decided it was a sign to “move on.” The record was passed on to Melvin Booth whose nails were 29 ft., 8.3 inches. [The Wondrous, Telegraph] Last year, a man named Chayne Hultgren, but who calls himself The Space Cowboy, pulled 907 pounds using his eye sockets in Milan. How someone figures out they’re really good at pulling heavy things with their eye sockets we may never know. Apparently, when you put Mentos into a bottle of Coca Cola, it erupts. This is important to know if you intend to break the world record for most simultaneous Mentos-fueled Diet Coke explosions ever! This August, Mexico City broke China’s world record with 2,433 participants. (China’s record in June had 2,175 enthusiasts.) [World Record News] In 2008, 1,253 people dressed like Smurfs and gathered at the Muckno Mania Festival in Ireland. Naturally, they won the record for largest gathering of people dressed as Smurfs. It’s kind of shocking what some people will do to get in the book, but it’s also kind of impressive how people can come together for a common purpose. It’s too bad most of the common purposes don’t actually help anyone, but I guess fun is important and someone has to take care of the blue paint industry. [The Wondrous] I suppose the Guinness people thought it would be super cute for the world’s leggiest woman to pose with the world’s smallest man, but The Daily Mail said the little guy “caught a sneaky peek.” Svetlana Pankratova isn’t the world’s tallest woman (she’s 6’ 7” while the tallest woman is 7’ 9”), but her legs are 4’ 4” tall! The leggy Russian says dating has been challenging and said, “some [men] don’t like standing next to a woman that tall.” [Daily Mail] Charlie Bell decided he wanted to break a world record and got his chance on national TV after agreeing to move a crap-ton of maggots from one container to another ... using his mouth. If you’ve got a weak stomach, you may have to stop reading, but just know Charlie won after moving 17 kilos (37.4 lbs) of the squirmy guys. And no one ever made out with him ever again. Probably. Bernie Barker retired from his energy job and took up a career stripping ... when he was 60 years old. Barker wanted to get back in shape after recovering from prostate cancer and the career move also earned him the title of oldest male stripper. [Guinness World Records] There was an epic battle over who got the most piercings in one sitting, between a guy named Robison in Marseilles and a British dude named Kam Ma. Apparently, Robison was out to beat Kam Ma’s 2002 record of 600 piercings, by getting 1,000 piercings. But Kam Ma caught wind of Robison’s plan and broke his own record with 1,015 piercings, then Robison increased his plan for 1,200 but ended up getting 1,016 piercings cause he hadn’t thought about how crappy getting stuck with needles will feel after a few hours. After setting the record, he took out all of them except for the record-breaking one. [Oddee] ||||| Most visitors to Antarctica go to see the penguins and the glaciers. Ashrita Furman went to hop on a pogo stick. Mr. Furman, seeking to break the Guinness World Record for the fastest mile on a pogo stick, jumped up and down a landing strip on the Antarctic tundra in 2003. Ashrita Furman \\"The conditions were pretty hard,\\" says the 56-year-old New Yorker, noting that extreme temperatures caused his pogo stick to freeze up midway through the event. He nevertheless completed the feat in 17 minutes, 45 seconds, setting the world record. It was just another day in the life of Mr. Furman, who holds the ultimate Guinness world record: The record for Guinness world records. Since 1979—when he set his first record by completing 27,000 jumping jacks—Mr. Furman has set 312 Guinness records, more than anyone else. He currently holds 120 titles. Watch clips from some of Guinness World Record-Record Holder Ashrita Furman's Events. Thursday, Guinness is holding its annual Guinness World Records Day and has flown Mr. Furman to London to participate. The company expects more than 300,000 people world-wide to compete in activities ranging from the largest gathering of people dressed as characters from \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" to the heaviest road vehicle pulled by human teeth. Mr. Furman's mission: break the record for walking with the heaviest shoes. He's hoping to add enough weight to a pair of custom-made metal boots so that each foot will weigh about 160 pounds. \\"He's living and breathing what Guinness is all about,\\" says Alistair Richards, Managing Director of Guinness World Records. \\"He lives by a philosophy that nothing is impossible.\\" Mr. Furman has been defying the impossible for more than 30 years. In 1981, he clapped his hands for 50 hours straight—loud enough so that the sound could be heard 120 yards away—at a pond near his home in Queens, New York. \\"The hardest part was staying up,\\" he says. In 1986, he somersaulted continuously more than 12 miles through Massachusetts, along the route followed by Paul Revere on his famous midnight ride. After eating four slices of pizza the night before, Mr. Furman became ill during the somersaults. \\"I was exhausted, nauseous, and my abdomen cramped with each roll,\\" he says. But he made it. In 2005, he broke the record for spinning the largest hula hoop—14 feet 6 inches—at least three revolutions. The following year, he, along with some friends, built the largest popcorn structure—20 feet 10 inches—in the shape of a multitiered cake. One of his oddest endeavors involved cutting the most apples in midair with a samurai sword—27 apples in one minute. \\"It took a year of practice and I stabbed myself often,\\" he says. Guinness says it receives about 1,000 applications a week for new record categories. About 80% are rejected. It currently has about 40,000 categories. \\"We are very, very broad,\\" says Guinness's Mr. Richards. \\"As long as it's measurable, as long as you can quantify that measurement, as long as it can be broken, as long as we think it's interesting, it stands a chance.\\" Enlarge Image Close Jowan Gauthier Mr. Furman's feats include covering the most distance on a pogo stick while juggling three balls in Easter Island. Unlike many reigning champs, who secure endorsements, Mr. Furman doesn't profit from his victories, and he's happy to share the secrets of his success. He has turned down endorsements and instead manages a health food store in Queens, not far from where he grew up. He gets a little financial help from his father—a retired lawyer and executive. Mr. Furman says he fell in love with the Guinness World Records Book when he was 10. \\"I remember carrying it around and reading it under the covers at night,\\" he says. Since he wasn't athletic as a child, he figured he could never break a Guinness record. His father, Bernie Furman, says there was little sign that the younger Mr. Furman would become a world class competitor. He cut gym so often that his mother had to plead with an assistant principal to let him graduate on time from Jamaica High School and attend Columbia University. After two years, he dropped out of college to study meditation with an Indian-born spiritual teacher, Sri Chinmoy. Around this time, Mr. Furman, whose birth name was Keith, changed his name to Ashrita, which means \\"protected by God\\" in Sanskrit. He says the meditation he learned from Mr. Chinmoy allows him to perform beyond his expectations. In 1978, Mr. Chinmoy convinced Mr. Furman to train for a long distance road bike marathon. After surprising himself by coming in third, Mr. Furman set his sights on Guinness records. Mr. Furman, who is single, gets most of his ideas from studying existing records and deciding if he can break them. He tries to pick records that work different areas of the body, he says, so he can have a \\"well rounded\\" training schedule. Enlarge Image Close Prabhakar Street Mr. Furman's feats also include sack racing a yak in Mongolia. \\"I would find myself in places, and I would see an opportunity,\\" he says. While on a trip to Mongolia in 2007, he decided to do a competition there. After seeing yaks, he attempted a one-mile sack race against a yak—clocking in at 16 minutes, 41 seconds, breaking the existing sack race record. He notes that many of his records don't require much athletic ability. They include egg cracking with one hand, lemon peeling and duct taping oneself to a wall. But winning can take years. It also requires discipline, creativity and friends willing to toss, measure and build. It's not unusual for Mr. Furman to brainstorm with friends when he's trying to win a record. Homagni Baptista, a friend from his meditation group, experimented for weeks with different recipes when Mr. Furman was trying to build the world's largest lollipop. No ordinary sucker, the raspberry lollipop was made after the men spent a few days building a mold in the back of a flat bed truck and another four days boiling sugar. In the end, it weighed about 6,500 pounds. Almost weekly, someone in the world is breaking one of his records. His response: Work to retake it and come up with more competitions. \\"I want to inspire people,\\" says Mr. Furman, who is almost always training for three or four events. \\"If you have a dream, you can achieve your dream. I'm living my dream.\\" Write to Jilian Mincer at jilian.mincer@dowjones.com ||||| What is a summary?","response":"A summary is a short explanation of the main ideas or points in a text, story, or article.

Their doctrine of political neutrality and their refusal to serve in the military has led to imprisonment of members who refused conscription during World War II and at other times where national service has been compulsory. In 1933, there were approximately 20,000 Jehovah's Witnesses in Germany, of whom about 10,000 were later imprisoned. Of those, 2000 were sent to Nazi concentration camps, where they were identified by purple triangles; as many as 1200 died, including 250 who were executed. In Canada, Jehovah's Witnesses were interned in camps along with political dissidents and people of Chinese and Japanese descent. In the former Soviet Union, about 9,300 Jehovah's Witnesses were deported to Siberia as part of Operation North in April 1951. Their religious activities are currently banned or restricted in some countries, including China, Vietnam and some Islamic states. What is the answer to this question: Why have Jehovah's Witnesses sometimes been imprisoned?","response":"Jehovah's Witnesses have sometimes been imprisoned because they believe in remaining politically neutral and refuse to serve in the military. This means that during times like World War II and when countries have required people to join their armies, the Jehovah's Witnesses would not do so.

Article: When you tidy your messy bedroom, it gets a lot easier to find things. Dreams may work the same way for a messy brain, helping you learn by organizing memories and ideas. To test how much dreams can help learning, Robert Stickgold had some students play a shape-fitting game called Tetris for a few hours and then go to sleep. Soon they were dreaming of falling Tetris shapes. Interestingly, the worst Tetris players had the most Tetris dreams and improved their game the most. Similar tests have shown the same results for all kinds of skills. As we dream, many important tasks are getting done. The brain decides what to keep and what to forget. It is connecting new experiences to older learning. In fact, the brain is learning all night long. Another important task of dreams may be to help us deal with emotions . At night, emotions are in the driver's seat. People who have had an upsetting experience often dream about it afterward. Often the dream event changes somehow--another way the brain tries to make the memory less upset. So if your best friend moves away, you might dream that you're the one who's moving. In fact, dreams have a proven power to improve mood, and people who dream about what's bothering them usually feel better sooner than those who don't.

Trump’s lawyers have previously said the president reimbursed Cohen for 130,000 Cohen paid to adult film star Stormy Daniels in the final weeks of the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign to keep her quiet about a sexual tryst she said she had with Trump 10 years earlier. Trump has denied the affair but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen through a monthly retainer to stop “false and extortionist accusations” made by Daniels about an affair. Cohen has also acknowledged making the payment. The disclosure said that while the payment to Cohen was not a “reportable” liability, Trump chose to list it “in the interest of transparency.” It did not say why Trump had left it out of his 2017 financial disclosure documents, though one of the president’s lawyers, Rudy Giuliani, has said that Trump didn’t know about the payment when he reported his finances last year. The Office of Government Ethics, in a letter to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, said it had determined that the payment to Cohen constituted a loan that should have been reported. However, it said the information Trump provided in his latest financial form met “the disclosure requirements for a reportable liability” under the Ethics in Government Act. Under the Ethics in Government Act, top government officials are required to report all debts in excess of 10,000 during the previous reporting period. “Knowingly or willfully” falsifying or failing to file reports carries civil and criminal penalties.

Nevertheless, he continued to visit Britain regularly; in May of that year he made his only television appearance, in a BBC \\"Concert Hour\\" programme when he played \\"Handel in the Strand\\" on the piano. Back home, after further surgery he recovered sufficiently to undertake a modest winter concerts season. On his 1958 visit to England he met Benjamin Britten, the two having previously maintained a mutually complimentary correspondence. He agreed to visit Britten's Aldeburgh Festival in 1959, but was prevented by illness. Sensing that death was drawing near, he made a new will, bequeathing his skeleton \\"for preservation and possible display in the Grainger Museum\\". This wish was not carried out.Through the winter of 1959–60 Grainger continued to perform his own music, often covering long distances by bus or train; he would not travel by air. On 29 April 1960 he gave his last public concert, at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, although by now his illness was affecting his concentration. On this occasion his morning recital went well, but his conducting in the afternoon was, in his own words, \\"a fiasco\\". Subsequently confined to his home, he continued to revise his music and arrange that of others; in August he informed Elsie that he was working on an adaptation of one of Cyril Scott's early songs.

The building is important in the history of English architecture as the first structure to be completed in the neo-classical style , which was to transform English architecture . Begun in 1619 and designed by Inigo Jones in a style influenced by Andrea Palladio , the Banqueting House was completed in 1622 at a cost of £ 15,618 , 27 years before King Charles I of England was executed on a scaffold in front of it in January 1649 . The building was controversially re-faced in Portland stone in the 19th century , though the details of the original façade were faithfully preserved . Today , the Banqueting House is a national monument , open to the public and preserved as a Grade I listed building . It is cared for by an independent charity -- Historic Royal Palaces -- which receives no funding from the British government or the Crown . - Wrest Park is a country estate located in Silsoe, Bedfordshire, England. It comprises Wrest Park, a Grade I listed country house, and Wrest Park Gardens, also Grade I listed, formal gardens surrounding the mansion. - Inigo Jones (15 July 1573 21 June 1652) was the first significant English architect (of Welsh ancestry) in the early modern period, and the first to employ Vitruvian rules of proportion and symmetry in his buildings. As the most notable architect in England, Jones was the first person who introduced the classical architecture of Rome and the Italian Renaissance to Britain. He left his mark on London by single buildings, such as the Queen's House which is the first building in England designed in a pure classical style, and the Banqueting House, Whitehall, as well as the layout for Covent Garden square which became a model for future developments in the West End. He made major contributions to stage design by his work as theatrical designer for several dozen masques, most by royal command and many in collaboration with Ben Jonson. - Whitehall is a road in the City of Westminster, Central London, which forms the first part of the A3212 road from Trafalgar Square to Chelsea. It is the main thoroughfare running south from Trafalgar Square towards Parliament Square. The street is recognised as the centre of Her Majesty's Government and is lined with numerous departments and ministries including the Ministry of Defence, Horse Guards and the Cabinet Office. Consequently, the name \\"Whitehall\\" is used as a metonym for British central governmental administration, and the geographic name for the surrounding area. - The Tudor period is the period between 1485 and 1603 in England and Wales and includes the Elizabethan period which ends with the completion of the reign of Elizabeth I in 1603. The Tudor period coincides with the rule of the Tudor dynasty in England whose first monarch was Henry VII (14571509). In terms of the entire century, Guy (1988) argues that \\"England was economically healthier, more expansive, and more optimistic under the Tudors\\" than at any time in a thousand years. - Paxton's Tower is a Neo-Gothic folly erected in honour of Lord Nelson. It is situated on a hilltop near Llanarthney in the Towy Valley, Carmarthenshire, Wales. It is a visitor attraction that can be combined with a visit to the nearby National Botanic Garden of Wales. Its hilltop location provides views over the Botanic Gardens and the Towy valley. The tower is under care of the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty and is a grade II* listed building. History. The tower was built by Sir William Paxton (1745-1824), a Scottish-born but London-raised merchant and banker, whose forefathers were from Auchencrow by Paxton, Berwickshire. Paxton made his first fortune while with the HEIC in Calcutta with Charles Cockerell, brother of the architect. He purchased the Middleton Hall estate about 1790 and built the tower circa 1806-1809. Designed by the architect Samuel Pepys Cockerell (1754-1827), Middleton Hall was destroyed by fire in 1931. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - In English architecture, mainly from the Tudor period onwards, a banqueting house is a separate pavilion-like building reached through the gardens from the main residence, whose use is purely for entertaining, especially eating. Or it may be on the roof, as in many 16th-century prodigy houses. It may be raised for additional air or a vista, with a simple kitchen below, as at Hampton Court Palace and Wrest Park, and it may be richly decorated, but it normally contains no bedrooms, and typically a single room apart from any service spaces. The design is often ornamental, if not downright fanciful, and some are also follies, as in Paxton's Tower. There are usually plenty of windows, as appreciating the view was a large part of their purpose. Often they are built on a slope, so that from the front, only the door to the main room can be seen; the door to the servants' spaces underneath was hidden at the back (Wrest Park). The Banqueting House, Gibside is an example. - Hampton Court Palace is a royal palace in the town of East Molesey, Richmond upon Thames, Greater London, England, south west and upstream of central London on the River Thames. Redevelopment began to be carried out in 1515 for Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, a favourite of King Henry VIII. In 1529, as Wolsey fell from favour, the King seized the palace for himself and later enlarged it. Along with St James's Palace, it is one of only two surviving palaces out of the many owned by King Henry VIII. - In architecture a pavilion (from French \\"pavillon\\", from Latin \\"papilio\\") has several meanings. In architectural terminology it refers to a subsidiary building that is either positioned separately or as an attachment to a main building. Often its function makes it an object of pleasure. - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - The Palace of Whitehall (or Palace of White Hall) was the main residence of the English monarchs in London from 1530 until 1698 when most of its structures, except for Inigo Jones's 1622 Banqueting House, were destroyed by fire. Before then, it had grown to be the largest palace in Europe with more than 1,500 rooms, overtaking the Vatican and Versailles. The palace gives its name, Whitehall, to the road on which many of the current administrative buildings of the UK government are situated, and hence metonymically to the central government itself. What entity does 'banqueting house' has the relation 'located in the administrative territorial entity' with? A:","response":"The Banqueting House has the relation 'located in the administrative territorial entity' with London."},{"question":"If \\"Two women playing field hockey.\\", can we conclude \\"Two women swimming in the ocean.\\"?","response":"No, we cannot conclude that \\"Two women swimming in the ocean.\\" based on the given statement, \\"Two women playing field hockey.\\" The reason is that these are two entirely different activities and contexts. Let's analyze both situations in detail to understand why we cannot reach this conclusion. 1. Two women playing field hockey Field hockey is an outdoor team sport played on a grass or turf field, with the objective of scoring goals by hitting or pushing a small ball using a hook-shaped stick. The involvement of two women in this activity implies that they are both participating in a field hockey match or practice. It could be a professional game, a recreational event, or a friendly match among friends. In this scenario, we can infer several aspects: - The two women are most likely wearing appropriate clothing, such as shorts, a sports shirt, and protective gear like shin guards and mouthguards. - They are using field hockey sticks, specifically designed for this sport, and playing with a ball. - They are likely following the rules of field hockey, which dictate how the game is played, including team size, field markings, and goal-scoring requirements. - The level of physical activity for both women might be moderate to high, as field hockey involves constant running, maneuvering, and competing against opposing team members. 2. Two women swimming in the ocean Swimming in the ocean suggests a recreational or leisure activity wherein the two women might be having a relaxing time in the sea, swimming, and enjoying the water. It could also be that they are practicing their swimming skills or engaging in water sports like surfing, snorkeling, or scuba diving. In any case, the context is very distinct from playing field hockey. Some aspects we can infer from this scenario: - The women are likely wearing appropriate swimwear (e.g., swimsuits or wetsuits), depending on the specific activity and water temperature. - Their purpose for swimming can range from exercise to relaxation or even learning a new water-based skill. - The activity level might differ significantly from playing field hockey, as swimming involves various techniques and levels of physical exertion. Given these distinct differences between the two scenarios, it is not possible to conclude that \\"Two women swimming in the ocean.\\" based solely on the information that \\"Two women playing field hockey.\\" The activities, equipment, attire, and environments are entirely different, making it an invalid conclusion in this case."},{"question":"OPT: --venison was fresh.. --ground beef was fresh..

In this case, the focus is on Lucas' preference for venison over ground beef for dinner. Step 2: Relate the given information to the focus of the sentence. We were given information that both venison and ground beef were fresh. This eliminates the possibility of freshness being the reason for Lucas' preference. There must be another reason for his preference. Step 3: Brainstorm possible reasons for his preference based on the given information. Since freshness is not a factor in his decision, possible reasons for Lucas' preference could be taste, texture, or nutritional content. Step 4: Choose a reason that seems most likely and complete the sentence. Considering the available options, the most fitting reason appears to be taste, as it is a common factor when deciding one's preference for food.

The night of his arrival coincides with a charity bazaar at the hotel where he will be boarding: Blackbeard's Inn, named after the notorious English pirate Captain Edward Teach, and now run by the elderly descendants of the pirate's crew. The owners are attempting to pay off their mortgage in order to keep the inn from being bought by the local crime boss, Silky Seymour (Joby Baker), who wants to build a casino on the land. In quick succession, Steve discovers his track team's shortcomings and runs afoul of the stiff dean of Godolphin College, its football coach, and Seymour; but he also makes the acquaintance of an attractive Godolphin professor, Jo Anne Baker (Suzanne Pleshette), who is anxious to help the elderly ladies save the Inn.A bidding war with the football coach at the charity auction nets Steve an antique bed warmer, once owned by Blackbeard's wife, Aldetha Teach, who - in addition to being a witch - is also the spitting image of Jo Anne. Inside this bed warmer is hidden a book of magic spells, that had once been the property of Aldetha. Steve recites one on a lark, unintentionally conjuring up the ghost of Captain Blackbeard (Peter Ustinov), who appears as a socially-inappropriate drunkard whose wife cursed him to an existence in limbo since his death in 1718 for all eternity unless he can perform one good deed.Steve and Captain Blackbeard soon learn that the two of them are bound to one another by the power of the spell and only the very reluctant and somewhat eccentric Steve can see or hear the ghost (whom is also coporial and can physically moves things with nobody seeing his physical image).

Context: \\"Hey, guy.\\" \\"No, this is Ray.\\" He smiled, leaned back in his chair. It was, of course, Pete. Pete was the night shift guy at Crossroads Detox across town. Ray called it the Jesus Shop because it was wholly supported by a contingent of local churches who saw addicts as a potential ministry. Apparently Jesus saved--not only from sin and hell, but also from Dark Eyed Jim Beam. Pete was a relatively innocuous born again fundie who volunteered his time two or three nights a week. When he was not saving the world, his Clark Kent was actually a steady CPA job with the local H&R Block. He'd been pulling shifts for about six months, knew nothing about drugs beyond that bad people used them to escape their problems and that they were tools of Satan, and he always needed Ray's advice about one thing or another. This arrangement was not problematic as Pete had long ago given up trying to convert him. Pete was also the only guy in the city who was, as Ray figured it, making less money than he was at such an hour. In return for Ray's magnanimity, Pete had done Ray's taxes for free last year. They had never actually met, though Ray had faxed him the tax forms and Pete had faxed back a photo of his two pre-teen daughters and his geriatric Lab. \\"What's the problem?\\" Ray asked. \\"I have a recalcitrant.\\" That's what he called them, the drunk and definitely disorderly. Pete's vocabulary did not include the word shithead either in its singular or plural. \\"Pete, they're all like that. Alcohol is bad medicine. That's why places like ours are in business.

The dog, named Bretagne, was retired and had slowed down considerably because of her age. Her handler, Denise Corliss of Cypress, told NBC's \\"Today\\" show on Monday that Bretagne hadn't eaten for three days and had became \\"really anxious\\" the previous night. She slept alongside her dog Sunday night to settle her down. Bretagne's death late Monday afternoon led to an outpouring of tributes, including from Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who tweeted, \\"Texas & America are forever grateful for Bretagne's service.\\" The shaggy golden retriever was a beloved fixture at firehouses and classrooms in the Cypress area, as well as an important symbol to the wider search-and-rescue community. \\"Some may say that the most a dog could be is a pet. However, to the over 400 members of the Cy-Fair Volunteer Fire Department, Bretagne was a civil servant, a hero and is family,\\" the department said in a statement. \\"We will remember her fondly, and continue serving the community with her as inspiration.\\" The canine and her handler, Corliss, were deployed at Ground Zero by Texas Task Force 1. Bretagne was part of the Texas search-and-rescue contingent and one of about 300 dogs to comb the wreckage in the harrowing aftermath of the attacks that killed 2,750 people in New York City alone. Corliss recalled to NBC's Tom Brokaw a few years ago how searchers and rescuers \\"would come by to pet her and thank her,\\" adding, \\"And so it became the unexpected role of therapy dog.\\" Bretagne (pronounced Brittany) also responded to disasters such as Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. After her retirement at age 10, Bretagne aided other search dogs in training and volunteered at a reading program at a local elementary school. BRETAGNE, REMEMBERED: 9/11 rescue dog returns to New York City on 16th birthday She had lived with Corliss and her husband Randy, a Cy-Fair volunteer firefighter, for all of her 16 years. Denise Corliss was described Monday as \\"inconsolable.\\" Amy Ramon, fire chief of the Cy-Fair Volunteer Fire Department, said Bretagne \\"touched every station\\" in the agency. \\"She's a part of the Cy-Fair family,\\" a tearful Ramon said Monday before Bretagne took her final walk. Late Monday afternoon, Ramon was among about two-dozen firefighters and members of the search-and-rescue community who lined the sidewalk to the Fairfield Animal Hospital in Cypress. At 4:35 p.m., the Corlisses drove up in their tan pickup with Bretagne in the back seat. Denise Corliss opened the door for Bretagne, then Randy picked her up gingerly and placed her on the ground. Bretagne didn't look around much as the solemn firefighters stood with arms raised in salute. She walked trustingly on a leash with her handler past the line of firefighters, her tail swinging limply. Then she stopped, turned toward a low bush beside the sidewalk and took a sniff. She crossed the threshold of the vet's office. Through the window, she looked back outside toward the gathering of firefighters and friends, with a friendly look that seemed like a smile. About 30 minutes later, the line of firefighters once again snapped to attention, resuming their salute. This time, they had thin black bands stretched across their gleaming silver badges. Bretagne was brought out in a casket covered with a Texas flag, carried by pallbearers from the search-and-rescue unit. Denise and Randy Corliss followed close behind - their final walk with their \\"once-in-a-lifetime\\" dog. Reporter Andrew Kragie talks with a few people touched by the heroic golden retriever on houstonchronicle.com. ||||| (CNN) When it was time to say goodbye, she was given a hero's farewell. Firefighters and rescue workers lined the sidewalk as her body, draped in an American flag, was carried out. Tears streaked down some faces. Bretagne, believed to be the last surviving 9/11 Ground Zero search dog, was euthanized Monday. The golden retriever was 16. Old age had slowed her down, and it was time to put her to sleep. So, the firefighters at the Cy-Fair Fire Department in Harris County, Texas, lined the path up to the Fairfield Animal Hospital, as her owner, Denise Corliss, walked her in to be put to sleep. Deployed to disaster Back in 2001, Bretagne (pronounced, \\"Brittany\\") and Corliss were fresh graduates of Disaster City when they were deployed to New York shortly after the World Trade Center attacks. Corliss joined hundreds of other search and rescue teams sent from around the world to find survivors at Ground Zero, working 12 hours a day for two weeks straight. We know now there were very few survivors found in the rubble of the twin towers, and Bretagne, like so many other searchers, worked hard -- only to find none. Making a discovery But Corliss discovered something unexpected: rescuers and firefighters would approach Bretagne and pet her. Soon they'd be sharing their personal stories with Corliss, describing the missing friends, loved ones and colleagues they were searching for. Bretagne had become a kind of therapy dog. \\"Dogs can be so comforting, so it makes sense to me now,\\" she says. \\"I just didn't anticipate that, then.\\" Other calls to action 9/11 was only the first of many national disasters that called Bretagne and Corliss into action. Deployments followed for Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and other storms. Once Corliss watched Bretagne risk her own safety when the dog found herself standing on the end of a dangling staircase. \\"She walked to the edge of it and she stopped -- turned -- and she came back down,\\" Corliss recalled to CNN in 2014. \\"She did exactly what she was supposed to do, but it scared me a bit.\\" Despite all that training, Corliss admits \\"there were still times when I held my breath and said, 'I hope she does this right. I hope she's OK.' \\" Pushy puppy It's no coincidence that search and rescue dogs such as Bretagne succeed while working under such dangerous conditions. From the time they're puppies, dogs must survive a rigid screening process before they can do this kind of work. When Corliss spotted Bretagne, she had a feeling this dog might be right. The puppy was pushy. Sharing a plastic kennel with eight other puppies, Bretagne buffaloed her way through the pack from back to front, to greet Corliss. \\"That kind of pushy behavior helped her be the persistent don't-give-up-style of working dog that I needed later,\\" says Corliss. Later years Bretagne left Texas Task Force 1 in 2009 to focus on her work as a local fire department search and rescue dog. Then after a couple more years, it was time for her to retire altogether. But that didn't mean the end of Bretagne's public service. In her later years, Bretagne spent time once a week teaching kids how to read. Really. She visited elementary school classrooms, where children, who \\"may be intimidated or uncomfortable reading out loud to their classmates, have an opportunity to develop reading skills by reading to her,\\" Corliss said. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","response":"Bretagne, a 16-year-old golden retriever and the last known surviving search dog who helped locate victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks in New York, was euthanized at an animal hospital due to her declining health and old age.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Down-on-his-luck Los Angeles architect and builder Edward Shaw is approached by Doris Hillman with a business proposal: buying land together, on which he would build houses that she would then sell, using her experience as a former real estate broker. Her husband, Gus Hillman, a wealthy businessman, would be willing to contribute half a million dollars as capital for the venture. Doris quickly seems interested in more than a purely professional relationship. Shaw starts an affair with her and accepts the business offer. However, an accidental discovery leaves him convinced that the Hillmans' interest lies less in the long-term profits of the venture than in the 175,000 key man insurance policy he took on himself as a precondition for the deal, and that an attempt on his life is imminent. Madge, the younger sister of Doris, develops a romantic interest in Shaw as well. Without knowing what Doris has planned, she reveals to Shaw that her sister was married previously to a man who died in Wyoming when his car crashed over a bridge. Shaw ends up drugged by Gus Hillman and barely keeps his car from going off a cliff. The police are skeptical about his story and the insurance company refuses to cancel the policy, Hillman having portrayed Shaw as a man who is trying to steal his wife. Madge teams with Shaw to try to foil her sister's scheme, but Doris lures him to a mountain cabin and shoots him with a gun. A wounded Shaw sees both Hillmans struggle then fall to their deaths through a clifftop doorway, just minutes before Madge and the cops arrive.

The answer is:","response":"The soundtrack Marie Antoinette is attached to the film \\"Marie Antoinette,\\" which is based on the life of a historical ruler who reigned during the time leading up to the French Revolution. Marie Antoinette, born as Maria Antonia Josepha Johanna in 1755, belonged to the Habsburg family and was the last queen of France before the French Revolution. She was married to King Louis XVI of France and was the mother of four children. She is often remembered for her extravagant lifestyle, which made her an unpopular figure in French society. The film \\"Marie Antoinette,\\" released in 2006, was directed by Sofia Coppola and starred Kirsten Dunst in the titular role. It is a historical drama and biographical film which focuses on the life of Marie Antoinette from her childhood in Austria, her marriage to Louis XVI, her life as the queen of France, and finally leading up to the turbulent times and events of the French Revolution. The soundtrack of the film is a mix of contemporary and classical music that helps set the tone for the visual narrative. It features songs from various artists such as The Strokes, New Order, and Aphex Twin, as well as compositions by Jean-Philippe Rameau and Antonio Vivaldi. The combination of modern and traditional music in the film's soundtrack provides a unique and creative approach to representing the world of Marie Antoinette, highlighting the contrast between the decadent French court and the impending revolution. The French Revolution is a pivotal event in world history, which took place from 1789 to 1799. The revolution erupted due to growing public discontent with the monarchy, social inequality, and economic hardships caused by years of war and food scarcity. It led to the rise of radical political groups, the Reign of Terror, and the eventual fall of the French monarchy, culminating in the execution of King Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette. Taking all this into consideration, the answer to the question is as follows: The soundtrack \\"Marie Antoinette\\" is attached to a film based on the life of the last queen of France, who reigned during the time leading up to the French Revolution. The film explores her personal life, extravagant lifestyle, and the turbulent times she lived in, with a unique and contrasting blend of contemporary and classical music to accentuate the narrative."},{"question":"Here are two sentences: Westfield , which owns Galleria in Morley , also will continue discussions about the other co-owned centres such as Knox City in Melbourne , half-owned by Deutsche Bank .

Q: Sentence: In the spring of 1834, Chopin attended the Lower Rhenish Music Festival in Aix-la-Chapelle with Hiller, and it was there that Chopin met Felix Mendelssohn. After the festival, the three visited Düsseldorf, where Mendelssohn had been appointed musical director. They spent what Mendelssohn described as \\"a very agreeable day\\", playing and discussing music at his piano, and met Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow, director of the Academy of Art, and some of his eminent pupils such as Lessing, Bendemann, Hildebrandt and Sohn. In 1835 Chopin went to Carlsbad, where he spent time with his parents; it was the last time he would see them. On his way back to Paris, he met old friends from Warsaw, the Wodzińskis. He had made the acquaintance of their daughter Maria in Poland five years earlier, when she was eleven. This meeting prompted him to stay for two weeks in Dresden, when he had previously intended to return to Paris via Leipzig. The sixteen-year-old girl's portrait of the composer is considered, along with Delacroix's, as among Chopin's best likenesses. In October he finally reached Leipzig, where he met Schumann, Clara Wieck and Felix Mendelssohn, who organised for him a performance of his own oratorio St. Paul, and who considered him \\"a perfect musician\\". In July 1836 Chopin travelled to Marienbad and Dresden to be with the Wodziński family, and in September he proposed to Maria, whose mother Countess Wodzińska approved in principle. Chopin went on to Leipzig, where he presented Schumann with his G minor Ballade. At the end of 1836 he sent Maria an album in which his sister Ludwika had inscribed seven of his songs, and his 1835 Nocturne in C-sharp minor, Op. 27, No. 1. The anodyne thanks he received from Maria proved to be the last letter he was to have from her. Question: Where were Frédéric's parents located at when he saw them for the final time in 1835? A:","response":"Frédéric's parents were located in Carlsbad when he saw them for the final time in 1835."},{"question":"Answer the following question, with explanation first. Of the following two sentences, which one is against common sense? Options: - Sentence A: \\"The man brushed his teeth with a shower sponge.\\" - Sentence B: \\"The man brushed his teeth with a toothbrush.\\"","response":"Sentence A: \\"The man brushed his teeth with a shower sponge,\\" is against common sense. Explanation: Common sense suggests that people should brush their teeth using a toothbrush, as it is specifically designed for cleaning teeth and maintaining oral hygiene. A shower sponge, on the other hand, is meant for cleaning one's body during a bath or shower. Using a shower sponge to brush your teeth goes against the conventional understanding and purpose of both items, and it may not be effective in maintaining proper oral hygiene. In contrast, Sentence B follows common sense, as it describes a regular and widely-accepted practice of using a toothbrush to brush one's teeth."},{"question":"Teen self-harmed after Vic prison transfer A juvenile offender harmed himself after he was sent to a Victorian adult maximum security prison before it was ready to house children. Lawyers for 12 youth offenders are challenging the state government's decision to transfer them to Barwon maximum security prison after riots at two youth detention facilities. The teens are among a group of offenders as young as 16 transferred to the Grevillea unit within Barwon prison in November after riots damaged the Malmsbury and Parkville youth detention facilities. One of the 40 teens transferred to the Grevillea unit used a piece of equipment to self-harm before authorities had finished removing items of risk, the Victorian Supreme Court heard on Tuesday. These items are still being removed, a Department of Health and Human Services manager says. Grevillea is being operated as a youth remand centre and youth justice custodial centre by the DHHS. The department's director of secure services, Ian Lanyon, admitted issues with Grevillea's facilities have resulted in behavioural problems. \\"There were some infrastructure issues at Grevillea that had meant that some clients' behaviour had escalated,\\" he told the trial. Mr Lanyon confirmed access to sunlight and recreational areas were temporarily restricted while renovations to the unit's facilities were completed. Some juveniles were in lockdown for 23 hours a day, or spent more time inside their cells than outside them. Several of the 40 youths who were transferred to Grevillea are accused of being ringleaders in the Malmsbury and Parkville riots. None have been found guilty of rioting charges, and all the youths are on remand for other alleged offences. Mr Lanyon said he did not speak to the juveniles about their transfer, or to their lawyers. Matthew Belleville, who signed off on the group's transfer, told the court he had never been to Grevillea. \\"The basis on which I thought they should be transferred was that they had engaged in rioting behaviour,\\" the acting general manager of the Parkville youth justice facility said. Mr Belleville also said he was unaware the teens had been warned they would be met with capsicum spray, tear gas, firearms and dogs if they acted up. Counsel for the youths, Brian Walters QC, said the teens had received a note warning them that \\"any violent, dangerous or destructive behaviour, including property damage\\" could result in intervention from Barwon prison's riot squad. The Human Rights Law Centre and the Fitzroy Legal Service say Barwon prison is no place for children because they cannot access the educational or rehabilitation programs usually provided in youth detention. The trial before Justice Greg Garde will resume on Wednesday. What is a short summary of the above article?","response":"A juvenile offender self-harmed after being transferred to an adult maximum security prison in Victoria, Australia, which was not yet prepared to house children. Lawyers for the 12 youths involved are disputing the decision to move the teenagers to Barwon maximum security prison following riots at two youth detention facilities.

Francis Piol Bol Bok (born February 1979), a Dinka tribesman and native of South Sudan, was a slave for ten years but is now an abolitionist and author living in the United States. On May 15, 1986, he was captured and enslaved at the age of seven during an Arab militia raid on the village of Nyamlel in South Sudan during the Second Sudanese Civil War. Bok lived in bondage for ten years before escaping imprisonment in Kurdufan, Sudan, followed by a journey to the United States by way of Cairo, Egypt. Bok was aided by people of diverse cultures and faiths in his journey to freedom. Francis Bok waited three years, until 1996, before he tried to escape again. During the intervening three years he tended to the herds and regained Giemma's trust. Giemma regularly praised Bok's work with the animals yet still forced him to live a life of slavery. Bok finally escaped from Giemma when he was 17 years old by walking through the forest to the nearby market town of Mutari. Bok went to the local police department to seek help, and asked the police to help him find his people. Instead of helping him, the police made him their slave for two months. Bok escaped from the police by simply taking their donkeys to the well, tying them, and leaving them behind as he walked into the crowded marketplace. Bok asked a man with a truck to give him a ride out of Mutari. The man, a Muslim named Abdah, agreed to help him. Abdah thought that slavery was wrong and agreed to transport Bok to the town of Ed-Da'Ein in the back of his truck amongst his cargo of grain and onions. Bok stayed with Abdah, his wife and two sons for two months while Abdah tried to find a way to take Bok to Khartoum, the capital city of Sudan. When he could not find a friend to provide passage to Khartoum, Abdah bought a bus ticket to Khartoum for Bok. Francis Bok arrived in Khartoum with no money, no place to go, and did not know where to turn. Fortunately for Francis, another stranger helped him find his way to his fellow Dinka tribespeople in Khartoum in the Jabarona settlement.

People thought that poetry was the new rock 'n' roll. However, despite the brief popularity of a few pop poets, poetry and pop music didn't seem to mix. But are they really so different? If you look back at the origins of poetry, there is a strong connection between poems and popular music. In Greek mythology, for example, the muse Erato is pictured with a lyre in her hand, and looks just like the ancestor of the modern rock star with his electric guitar. In addition, the poets Shelley and Byron were as famous in the nineteenth century as the pop stars of today. But despite their common origins, there are many differences between poetry and pop music. Pop songs are always written for a public performance, whereas poetry often isn't. And the lyrics in pop songs sometimes have less rhythm than those in poetry. This is because the music provides the rhythm rather than the words. Pop lyrics are also simpler and often keep on saying the same thing. This repetition works well in a performance and means that pop songs are easier for people to sing and learn by heart. Both songs and poems tell a story or talk about feelings. Songs in particular deal with the different stages in a relationship, such as falling in love or breaking up. The words and ideas in songs are usually easier to understand than those in \\"serious\\" poetry. However, talented performers like Paul McCartney, or newer stars like Robbe Williams, often give simple songs more expression when they perform them. And some of the best lines from pop lyrics are as beautiful as poetry. So although pop music and poetry have many differences, they do have one important thing in common: the power to make us think about how we feel. Question: According to the article, the difference between poetry and pop songs is that _ .

Reasoning: In outer space, there is a lack of atmosphere and oxygen, which makes it impossible for humans to breathe without the aid of protective gear or equipment. The atmospheric pressure in space is near vacuum, meaning there is no air to breathe. Without oxygen, the human body cannot function, as respiration is essential for converting the nutrients we consume into energy.

Within four years, the people living on this farm step outside on their front porch to view an extensive shopping center containing Wal-Mart, McDonald's, Wendy's, TCBY, and a Cinemark movie theatre. The once quiet road is now a city street with traffic lights, busy with automobiles day and night. The air smells of car exhaust and fast food. Some destruction of farmland is unavoidable when a city expands. Instead of expanding outward, planning commissions should consider interior _ of a city.

It's very hard for me to figure out why Bujor couldn't stand to have even one of the girls ugly. The plot about three people working together to save their world didn't improve much. Think to your cliches... A snobby rich girl, a sweet peasant, and a quiet bookworm- welcome to reality. Each step was predicted, and Joa didn't contribute at all. I didn't know why she was there in the first place since she apparently has no relevance to the main plot. Yes, we all had those fairy tale dreams. And yes, they're perfect little children movies and shows. But NO, they are NOT that appealing to my taste. I doesn't actually matter that the poor girl is a teen, but the writing itself. If the book wasn't as boringly predictable, THEN I would be impressed. Even if I am younger than her, I learn from others mistakes. So, an easy bet to whoever can beat Bujor's writing.

Richard inherited the crown and immediately began raising funds for the crusade. In the meantime, some of his subjects departed in multiple waves by sea. Some of them together with contingents from the Holy Roman Empire and France conquered the Moorish city of Silves in Iberia during the summer of 1189, before continuing to the Holy Land. In April 1190, King Richard's fleet departed from Dartmouth under the command of Richard de Camville and Robert de Sablé on their way to meet their king in Marseille.

This task involves working with wooden pieces, understanding their shape, size, and properties, and using spatial reasoning, as well as problem-solving skills to create a completed model from these components. A detailed explanation of the sequential steps of this task is as follows: 1. Collect Tools and Materials: Acquire a 3D wooden puzzle kit, which includes wooden pieces with pre-cut shapes designed to fit together to create a specific model. Typically, the kit comes with instructions to assist in assembling the puzzle. You may also need additional tools, such as a hobby knife, glue, sandpaper, and a clean workspace to accomplish the task. 2. Study the Instructions: Before starting the assembly process, thoroughly read the instructions and look at the diagrams provided. Familiarize yourself with the different shapes of the pieces, their identifiers, and the way they should be arranged and connected to create the final structure. Also, pay attention to any warnings or suggestions mentioned in the instructional manual. 3. Identify and Organize Puzzle Pieces: Spread out the wooden pieces and sort them according to their size, shape, and the step in which they appear in the instructions. This step helps to maximize efficiency and minimizes confusion throughout the assembly process. 4. Careful Removal of Pieces: Start removing the puzzle pieces from their wooden sheets, following the alphabetical or numerical order provided in the instructions. Use the hobby knife to carefully slice through any remaining wood connections to free the pieces, without causing any damage to their structure or appearance. 5. Sanding and Smoothing: Use sandpaper to gently smoothen the rough edges of the wooden pieces. This step will help achieve a seamless connection between the components and create a professional-looking finish in the final model. 6. Assembling the Puzzle: Start assembling the puzzle by connecting one piece at a time as indicated in the instructions. Carefully identify the interlocking points and gently insert one piece into the other. Apply a small amount of glue at the appropriate joints, if required, to ensure that the pieces firmly stay in place. 7. Working with Subassemblies: In the case of complex or large 3D puzzles, you may have to first assemble smaller sections or subassemblies before constructing the final model. Follow the step-by-step instructions to build these subassemblies and ensure their correct alignment. 8. Connecting Subassemblies: This step involves connecting the different subassemblies accurately to create the final 3D wooden model. Ensure that the joints are well-aligned, and use glue to secure the connection, if necessary. 9. Adding Finishing Touches: Once the entire 3D wooden puzzle is assembled, make sure there are no remaining rough edges or imperfections. If desired, you can either paint or stain the wooden model to customize its appearance to your preferences. 10. Displaying the Model: Finally, choose an appropriate location to display the finished 3D wooden puzzle. Ensure that the model is safely secured on a stable surface or within a protective case to prevent accidental damage or disassembly. Overall, building a 3D wooden puzzle involves numerous sequential steps and essential knowledge of physical objects, including their properties and how they interact with spatial constraints. Successfully completing such a task requires concentration, problem-solving skills, patience, and a keen eye for detail, along with a basic understanding of woodworking and crafting techniques."},{"question":"Question: The thinner the wire, the more resistance it offers. Barry is connecting new wires to his speakers. His new wires are thinner than the old ones, therefore, he should expect that the electrical current will display more or less resistance than his older, thicker ones? Answer:","response":"Barry should expect that the electrical current will display more resistance with his new, thinner wires compared to his older, thicker ones. The reason is that the resistance of a wire is inversely proportional to its cross-sectional area. Thinner wires have a smaller cross-sectional area, leading to higher resistance, while thicker wires have a larger cross-sectional area, resulting in lower resistance. Consequently, the thinner the wire, the higher the resistance it will offer."},{"question":"Given the question: FINAL EXAM Question 1. Are Robert J.

Was the original Metroid groundbreaking for its polygons?","response":"Rationale: When discussing the groundbreaking aspects of a video game, it's important to consider the context of its time and the unique features it introduced or popularized. In the case of the original Metroid, released in 1986 for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), we need to analyze its graphics, gameplay mechanics, and impact on the gaming industry. Specifically, as the question mentioned polygons, it's essential to look at how the game utilized them and whether it was groundbreaking in that regard. Answer: The original Metroid was not groundbreaking for its polygons, as the game didn't utilize polygonal graphics. The game featured 2D sprite-based graphics, which were common for its time. However, it was groundbreaking in many other ways, such as its non-linear exploration, atmosphere, and the fusion of platforming with action-adventure elements. Additionally, the revelation of the protagonist, Samus Aran, as a female character at the end of the game was a significant milestone in video game history."},{"question":"Q:Carson hurt another lover because this is what she did.

In just over a decade he created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most of them in the last two years of his life. They include landscapes, still lifes, portraits and self-portraits, and are characterised by bold colours and dramatic, impulsive and expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art. His suicide at 37 followed years of mental illness and poverty. - Irises is one of many paintings and prints of irises by the Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh . Irises was painted while Vincent van Gogh was living at the asylum at Saint Paul - de - Mausole in Saint - Rémy - de - Provence , France , in the last year before his death in 1890 . It was painted before his first attack at the asylum . There is a lack of the high tension which is seen in his later works . He called the painting \`\` the lightning conductor for my illness '' because he felt that he could keep himself from going insane by continuing to paint . The painting was influenced by Japanese ukiyo - e woodblock prints like many of his works and those by other artists of the time . The similarities occur with strong outlines , unusual angles , including close - up views , and also flattish local colour ( not modelled according to the fall of light ) . He considered this painting a study which is probably why there are no known drawings for it , although Theo , Van Gogh 's brother , thought better of it and quickly submitted it to the annual exhibition of the Société des Artistes Indépendants in September 1889 , together with Starry Night Over the Rhone . He wrote to Vincent of the exhibition : \`\` ( It ) strikes the eye from afar . The Irises are a beautiful study full of air and life . '' - Oil painting is the process of painting with pigments with a medium of drying oil as the binder. Commonly used drying oils include linseed oil, poppy seed oil, walnut oil, and safflower oil. The choice of oil imparts a range of properties to the oil paint, such as the amount of yellowing or drying time. Certain differences, depending on the oil, are also visible in the sheen of the paints. An artist might use several different oils in the same painting depending on specific pigments and effects desired. The paints themselves also develop a particular consistency depending on the medium. The oil may be boiled with a resin, such as pine resin or frankincense, to create a varnish prized for its body and gloss. What entity does 'irises ' has the relation 'material used' with? Answer:","response":"Irises have the relation 'material used' with oil paint, as Vincent van Gogh created this artwork using oil paints as the medium on canvas."},{"question":"Based on the premise \\"Since its first safety razor almost a century ago, Gillette has always conceived the actual razor mainly as an inducement for selling replacement blades.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"Gillette's first safety razor was made 50 years ago.\\" is true?","response":"Okay little buddy, let's think about this together.

Paragraph : If there are more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, more ultraviolet radiation will be trapped and the Earth will heat up. Question: Tony drives an SUV that contributes many greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Evan rides a scooter that contributes few greenhouses gases to the atmosphere. Who likely contributes less to the Earth heating up Tony or Evan? The answer to this question is:","response":"Evan likely contributes less to the Earth heating up than Tony based on the information provided in the paragraph. This conclusion can be drawn from understanding the impact of greenhouse gases on the atmospheric temperature and comparing the emissions produced by an SUV and a scooter. The paragraph informs us that if there are more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, more ultraviolet radiation will be trapped, and the Earth will heat up as a result. Greenhouse gases are responsible for the greenhouse effect, which is a natural process that occurs when certain gases in the Earth's atmosphere trap heat, maintaining the Earth's average temperature. However, when the amounts of these gases increase, due to human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes, the Earth's atmosphere captures more heat, resulting in global warming and climate change. Now, let's compare the vehicles driven by Tony and Evan. Tony drives an SUV, which is a large, fuel-consuming vehicle that emits more greenhouse gases when compared to smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles. SUVs usually have larger engines and weigh more than smaller cars, leading them to consume more fuel and release increased greenhouse gas emissions. In contrast, Evan rides a scooter, which generally produces far fewer greenhouse gas emissions due to its small size, lighter weight, and more efficient use of fuel. In conclusion, Evan, who rides a scooter, likely contributes less to the Earth heating up compared to Tony, who drives an SUV. This is because Evan's vehicle emits fewer greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, which corresponds to the reduced trapping of ultraviolet radiation and lesser heating of the Earth. By choosing a more environmentally friendly mode of transportation, Evan helps in reducing the overall impact of greenhouse gases and mitigates the effects of global warming and climate change."},{"question":"Answer the following question: - People burn coal for heat or electricity - Pollution from the coal goes into the sky - Coal pollution enters clouds - Clouds rain over an area - The polluted rain becomes acid rain.

Which group had fewer organisms having mutations that can be passed to the next generation? Dan studied multicellular organisms that presented mutations. Group A presented gemline mutations, while group B presented somatic mutations. He was fascinated by these organisms. Hint: Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer. A:","response":"Group B, which presented somatic mutations, had fewer organisms having mutations that can be passed to the next generation. This is because somatic mutations occur in the body cells of an organism and are not inherited by offspring. These mutations may lead to various medical conditions, such as cancer, but they do not directly impact the genetic information passed down to the next generation. On the other hand, Group A presented germline mutations, which occur in the sex cells, or gametes, and can be inherited by the offspring as these mutations are present in the resulting organism's DNA. Since germline mutations can be passed down to offspring, they have a higher likelihood of affecting the next generation compared to somatic mutations, which remain limited to the individual organism."},{"question":"Teacher:In this task, you are given a review of a product in the Polish language.

Family put into van shortly after midnight and taken to airport. They are deported days before anniversary of Bin Laden's death on May 2. Article:","response":"Title: Bin Laden’s Family Members Face Deportation Prior to Death Anniversary Introduction: As we approach the anniversary of Osama Bin Laden's death on May 2nd, a somber development has occurred involving his family. Three widows, eight children, and a grandchild of the notorious al-Qaeda leader have been deported from their current residence and placed on a plane at dawn. Body: The family members, picked up from their residence shortly after midnight, were escorted into a van and taken to an undisclosed airport. The deportation comes just days before the world commemorates the anniversary of Bin Laden's death, reigniting the memories and conversation surrounding the mastermind behind the devastating 9/11 attacks. Bin Laden, who was killed in a covert raid by U.S. Navy SEAL Team 6 at his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan on May 2, 2011, left behind not only an enduring scar on global history, but also a family who has struggled to live in the aftermath of his heinous actions. While the family has reportedly attempted to lead a quiet life and distance themselves from Bin Laden's infamy, the recent deportation is a stark reminder of the burden they continue to bear due to their connection to the infamous terrorist leader. The identities of the family members have not been released to the media; ostensibly to protect their privacy, but the impact of their abrupt deportation has undoubtedly upended their lives. The destination of their deportation also remains undisclosed, sparking speculations concerning the reasons behind the government's decision to take such drastic action. The deportation's timing, just days before the anniversary of Bin Laden's death, prompts questions about whether any perceived security risks may have contributed to the decision. It is possible that the event could have driven potential extremist elements to seek out and possibly harm the family in a misguided attempt at vengeance or martyrdom. However, the government has not officially confirmed or denied these speculations. Moreover, the plight of Bin Laden's family raises a broader discussion on the consequences faced by the families of individuals who are responsible for terror-related activities. Often, they are treated with suspicion or hostility by their communities or are subjected to unwarranted surveillance by law enforcement agencies. This deportation acts as a sobering reminder of the lasting impact terrorism can have, not only on the victims and their families but also on the lives of those unwittingly caught in its shadow. Conclusion: It has been nearly a decade since the world witnessed the death of Osama Bin Laden, but his legacy and the repercussions of his actions continue to reverberate today. The recent deportation of his family members serves as a stark reminder of the lasting pain inflicted by terrorist acts, demonstrating the tangled web of grief and suffering left in their wake. While we pause to remember and reflect on his death and the devastation he wrought, let us also consider the complex legacy of terrorism, and the often-forgotten victims who must rebuild their lives in its aftermath."},{"question":"Trivia question: French writer Sully Prudhomme was the first winner of what prize in 1901?

But some teachers think the changes are not all for the better. Eleanor Johnson, an English professor, thinks that text messaging has made students believe that it is far more acceptable than it actually is to just make terrible spelling and grammatical errors. And she says her students over the past several years have increasingly used less formal English in their writing. Words and phrases like \\"guy\\" and \\"you know\\" now appear in research papers. Professor Johnson supposes there is a strong relationship between the rise of informal online communication and an increase in writing mistakes. But she says there may not be much scientific information, at least not yet. David Crystal, a British linguist , says the actively changing nature of the Internet makes it difficult to keep up-to-date in studying its effects. But he believes its influence on language is small. The main effect of the Internet on language is the way it has added to the expressive richness of language, providing language with a new set of communicative tools that haven't existed in the past. Erin Jansen is founder of NetLingo.com, an online dictionary of the Internet and text messaging terms.

The second generation 300 was marketed as the Chrysler 300C in the United Kingdom and Ireland and as the Lancia Thema in the remainder of Europe. What's the best answer to this question: is a chrysler 300 considered a sports car?","response":"To determine if the Chrysler 300 is considered a sports car, we will analyze its features and compare them to the general characteristics of sports cars. 1. Performance: Sports cars typically boast powerful engines, agile handling, and outstanding performance. The Chrysler 300 offers strong engine options, including a V6 and a V8, with its top-tier model producing 363 horsepower. However, while the 300 has a solid performance, it doesn't necessarily match the high-performance capabilities of many sports cars. 2. Design: Sports cars are known for their eye-catching, aerodynamic, and aggressive designs. The Chrysler 300 has a bold and distinctive style, with a large grille and boxy body not typically associated with sports cars. The luxurious design of the 300 is more reminiscent of a full-sized sedan than a sports car. 3. Seating & Comfort: Sports cars usually have a two-door layout and a two-seater or 2+2-seater configuration, prioritizing driving dynamics over comfort and passenger capacity. The Chrysler 300 is a four-door sedan with ample seating for five passengers, emphasizing comfort and spaciousness. Based on the analysis, we can conclude that although the Chrysler 300 offers some powerful engine options and has spirited performance, it doesn't possess all the typical characteristics of a sports car. It is more accurately described as a full-sized luxury sedan. So the best answer to the question \\"Is the Chrysler 300 considered a sports car?\\" would be \\"No, it is a full-sized luxury sedan.\\""},{"question":"Instructions: You are given a background paragraph that describes one or more causal or qualitative relationships such as a relationship in economics or a scientific law and a story that makes use of the concepts or the relationship described in the provided paragraph.

Would the following review decrease or increase the chances of you buying the product? Review title: Handle broke here too Product review: After a week, the spigot button on the handle fell apart and would no longer work. This teakettle is a piece of junk. Don't be fooled by a good price. Answer:","response":"The review described would more than likely significantly decrease the chances of buying the product for multiple reasons. Firstly, the title itself hints at an issue with the product's handle, suggesting it's not an isolated case but a recurring problem as it says 'Handle broke here too'. This might make a potential customer think about product's quality control issues and the possibility that it is a design or manufacturing flaw that impacts many or all units of the product. Secondly, the main content of the review notes the issue of a main component of the product (the spigot button on the handle) falling apart after just a week of usage. This signifies poor durability and potentially poor materials used in production. The user calls the teakettle 'a piece of junk'. This characterization is strong negative language and it emphasizes their dissatisfaction with the product - length of usage versus the quick rate of depreciation. It also implies that the product failed to meet their expectations or the standards claimed by the manufacturer. Lastly, the review ends with a warning to other prospective buyers to not be 'fooled by a good price'. This suggests that while the product might be priced attractively or competitively, the reviewer believes that the value for money is not there due to the issues with quality and durability.

What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","response":"The first step of the process leading to the formation of a hurricane is the development of an area of low pressure. This occurs when warm ocean water heats the air above it, causing the warm air to rise. As the warm air rises, it leaves behind an area of lower pressure near the surface. This low-pressure area then causes the surrounding air to flow inward, starting a rotation that can eventually lead to the formation of a hurricane when combined with other favorable weather conditions and processes."},{"question":"Is the premise \\"The white dog is being squirted in the face with a jet of water.\\" true if \\"The pet remains dry after being hit from behind with a pail of water.\\"?","response":"In order to examine whether the premise \\"The white dog is being squirted in the face with a jet of water\\" is true, when given the information that \\"The pet remains dry after being hit from behind with a pail of water,\\" we must analyze the information given and compare the two statements. 1. The white dog is being squirted: This statement informs us that the subject is a white dog, and the action taking place is a squirting action, specifically in the dog's face. 2. The pet remains dry after being hit from behind with a pail of water: This statement informs us that the subject (in this case, referred to as the pet, which we can assume is the white dog) is not taking on any water, despite being hit from behind. While the method of water application is different, the focus is on the result of remaining dry after being contacted with water. There are a few factors that need to be considered to determine whether the first premise is true, given the information provided. 1. Timing: It is crucial to determine the chronological order of the events described. If the statement about the pet remaining dry after being hit from behind with a pail of water came before the event of the white dog being squirted in the face, then it does not necessarily negate the premise that the white dog gets squirted in the face later on. However, if the squirting event happened earlier and the pet remains dry subsequently after being hit by another water source, it could lead to questioning the legitimacy of the first premise. 2. The actual relationship between the two events: If these two events are causally related or part of a single experiment, we can infer that the premise might be inaccurate since the pet remains dry despite being hit with water from two different sources. However, if these events are unrelated or separate experiments, it is possible that the white dog was squirted in the face with water in one situation and remained dry in another when hit by a pail of water. 3. The type of water application: The premise states that the white dog is being squirted in the face with a jet of water. In contrast, the provided information states that the pet is being hit from behind with a pail of water. The difference in water application could impact the outcome for the dog's level of wetness. The jet of water could be more forceful or concentrated enough to get the dog wet, whereas the pail of water might not have the same impact on the dog's level of wetness. In conclusion, the premise, \\"The white dog is being squirted in the face with a jet of water,\\" could be true or false, depending on the specific context and the chronological order of events. The information provided, \\"The pet remains dry after being hit from behind with a pail of water,\\" does not necessarily negate the first premise; however, it does raise questions about the actual sequence of events and their relationship. It is crucial to consider these factors to determine whether the initial premise holds true."},{"question":"Complete the following text: his voice held the familiar purity that seemed to be a part of the carpathian species . \`\` he has the children . go after him . if you 're like falcon , you have to go after him and get the children back . he 's taking them to the vampire . '' falcon , i 'm all right . you must find the children and keep them from the","response":"vampire's clutches. Their lives are at stake, and the future of our kind depends on their safety.\\" Falcon listened intently to the words spoken to him, his heart pounding as he realized the gravity of the situation they were in. As a Carpathian, he was born with the responsibility of protecting not only his people but also the innocent from the vicious threats that had plagued their world for centuries. Vampires had been their natural enemies for ages, reveling in their cruelty and the suffering they caused. The Carpathians, on the other hand, were gifted with supernatural abilities which they honorably utilized to ensure the well-being of the human race, with whom they coexisted. Falcon's determination only grew stronger with every word, aware that he could never back down or abandon his duty, no matter the risks involved or the sacrifices he would have to make. In order to track down the vampire and rescue the kidnapped children, Falcon knew he would have to rely on his keen senses, unparalleled instincts, and expert fighting skills. As a Carpathian, he had the ability to tap into an array of powers, including telepathy, shape-shifting, and even control over the elements. He could also call upon his brethren for assistance and support when needed. Before setting off, Falcon gathered the necessary resources, weapons, and equipment he would need for his mission. He also reached out to his fellow Carpathians, alerting them of the dangerous situation and imploring them to help him in any way they could. The collected information about the vampire and his lair, potential escape routes the children could have been taken, and recent sightings in the local area. Together with the intelligence and the support from his allies, Falcon prepared himself for an arduous and perilous journey ahead. Following his instincts and the clues he had gained, Falcon embarked on his mission, his eyes constantly scanning the landscape for any sign of the vampire or the missing children. His senses remained alert as he traversed through dense forests, treacherous mountains, and desolate wastelands. Along the way, he encountered an assortment of hostile creatures, both mortal and supernatural, but he was steadfast in his resolve to protect those in his charge at any cost. Countless days and nights passed, Falcon's desperate search for the children seemingly leading him in circles, yet he never for a moment allowed himself to falter or give up hope. The unwavering belief that he would eventually find them and bring them back safely to their families kept him going through even the most disheartening moments. Finally, after what felt like an eternity of tracking and hunting, Falcon managed to uncover the hidden lair of the vampire deep within a cavern system tucked away in the heart of a treacherous mountain range. With his heart pounding in anticipation, he stealthily infiltrated the lair, taking down any guards or minions that foolishly stood between him and the captured children. At long last, Falcon faced the vampire responsible for the kidnappings, a fierce battle unfolding within the dimly lit caverns. Utilizing his Carpathian prowess and an unwavering determination, Falcon vanquished the vampire and its followers, freeing the children at last from their terrifying captor. Exhausted but triumphant, Falcon gathered the exhausted and traumatized children in his arms, providing them with the comfort and reassurance they desperately needed. It was not an easy journey, as he had endured seemingly insurmountable obstacles and faced great personal hardship. Still, with the children safely in his care, Falcon knew that every sacrifice had been worth it. As the Carpathian made the long and arduous trek back towards their homes, the children clinging tightly to him, Falcon knew that he had not only fulfilled his duty as a protector but also set an example of what it truly meant to be a selfless warrior dedicated to the preservation of life and all that is good. The world may be riddled with darkness and malevolence, but he had shown that, as long as there were beings like the Carpathians, purity and hope could still triumph over evil and despair in the end."},{"question":"most of his working life has been spent at large corporations including volvo where, when he left the company in early 1994, he was director of finance.

He was born in the town of Qasr Abu Hadi, near the city of Sirte in what was then the Kingdom of Libya. Muammar Gaddafi belonged to the Al-Gaddafa tribal group of the Berber Arabized people. His father, Mohammad Abdul Salam bin Hamed bin Mohammad, also known as Abu Meniar, passed away in 1985. His mother, Aisha, died in 1978.

However, we can analyze the phrase itself and discuss its potential implications from both positive and negative perspectives. Negative Interpretation: The phrase \\"inside an enigma\\" might suggest that the movie is confusing, perplexing, or puzzling, which some viewers could perceive as negative aspects. They may find the film unnecessarily complex or difficult to understand. Some people prefer linear storytelling and clear-cut explanations, and for such viewers, a movie that feels like an enigma may lead to frustration and dissatisfaction. In this context, the phrase could be seen as expressing a negative sentiment towards the movie. Positive Interpretation: On the other hand, \\"inside an enigma\\" could be viewed positively if it is intended to convey a sense of mystery, intrigue, and complexity in the movie. In this case, a film described as an enigma would be perceived as intellectually stimulating, engaging, and thought-provoking, challenging viewers to think critically and draw their own conclusions. For individuals who enjoy complex narratives and unconventional storytelling, having to decipher an enigma can be a rewarding and enjoyable experience. In such instances, the phrase can be considered as expressing a positive sentiment about the movie. Overall, the sentence \\"inside an enigma\\" is ambiguous in terms of expressing positive or negative sentiment.

During ancient times, Gibraltar was regarded by the peoples of the Mediterranean as a place of religious and symbolic importance. The Phoenicians were present for several centuries, apparently using Gorham's Cave as a shrine to the genius loci of the place, as did the Carthaginians and Romans after them. Excavations in the cave have shown that pottery, jewellery and Egyptian scarabs were left as offerings to the gods, probably in the hope of securing safe passage through the dangerous waters of the Strait of Gibraltar.The Rock was revered by the Greeks and Romans as one of the two Pillars of Hercules, created by the demigod during his tenth labour when he smashed through a mountain separating the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. According to a Phocaean Greek traveller who visited in the sixth century BC, there were temples and altars to Hercules on the Rock where passing travellers made sacrifices. The Spanish later symbolised the importance of the Pillars of Hercules with a heraldic device consisting of a pair of columns with a scroll wrapped around them – a symbol that became the sign and the related Portuguese cifrão ().To the Ancient Romans, Gibraltar was known as Mons Calpe, a name perhaps derived from the Phoenician word kalph, \\"hollowed out\\", presumably in reference to the many limestone caves in the Rock. It was well-known to ancient geographers, but there is no known archaeological evidence of permanent settlements from the ancient period. According to the Roman writer Avienus, the ancient Greek traveller Euctemon recorded that thirty stadia separate [the Pillars of Hercules]; [Euctemon] says that they bristle with woods all over and are always unwelcoming to seamen. Indeed he says that on those are both temples and altars to Hercules. He says that strangers sail there by boat to make offerings to the gods and depart hot foot thinking it wrong to linger ...

The Kinks were an English rock band formed in Muswell Hill, North London, in 1964 by brothers Ray and Dave Davies. They are regarded as one of the most important and influential rock bands of the 1960s. The band emerged during the height of British rhythm and blues and Merseybeat, and were briefly part of the British Invasion of the United States until their touring ban in 1965. Their third single, the Ray Davies-penned \\"You Really Got Me\\", became an international hit, topping the charts in the United Kingdom and reaching the Top 10 in the United States. The Kinks started out playing the then popular R&B and blues styles; then, under the influence of The Kingsmen's \\"Louie Louie\\" recording, developed louder rock and hard rock sounds -- due to their pioneering contribution to the field, they have often been labelled as \\"the original punks\\". Dave Davies was \\"really bored with this guitar sound - or lack of an interesting sound\\" so he purchased \\"a little green amplifier ... an Elpico\\" from a radio spares shop in Muswell Hill, and \\"twiddled around with it\\", including \\"taking the wires going to the speaker and putting a jack plug on there and plugging it straight into my AC30\\" (a larger amplifier), but didn't get the sound he wanted until he got frustrated and \\"got a single-sided Gillette razorblade and cut round the cone [from the centre to the edge] ... so it was all shredded but still on there, still intact. I played and I thought it was amazing.\\" The jagged sound of the amplifier was replicated in the studio; the Elpico was plugged into the Vox AC30, and the resulting effect became a mainstay in The Kinks' early recordings--most notably on \\"You Really Got Me\\" and \\"All Day and All of the Night\\". From 1966 onwards, The Kinks came to be known for their adherence to traditions of English music and culture, during a period when many other British bands dismissed their heritage in favour of American blues, R&B and pop styles. Ray Davies recalled that at a distinct moment in 1965 he decided to break away from the American scene, and write more introspective and intelligent songs. \\"I decided I was going to use words more, and say things. I wrote 'Well Respected Man'. That was the first real word-oriented song I wrote. ... [I also] abandoned any attempt to Americanise my accent.\\" The Kinks' allegiance to English styles was strengthened by the ban placed on them by the American Federation of Musicians. The ban cut them off from the American record buying public, the world's largest musical market, forcing them to focus on Britain and mainland Europe. The Kinks expanded on their English sound throughout the remainder of the 1960s, incorporating elements of music hall, folk, and baroque music through use of harpsichord, acoustic guitar, mellotron, and horns, and creating some of the most influential and important music of the period. Beginning with Everybody's In Show-biz (1972), Ray Davies began exploring theatrical concepts on the group's albums; these themes became manifest on the 1973 album Preservation Act 1 and continued through Schoolboys In Disgrace (1976). The Kinks found little success with these conceptual works, and reverted to a traditional rock format throughout the remainder of the 1970s. Sleepwalker (1977), which heralded their return to commercial success, featured a mainstream, relatively slick production style that would become their norm. The band returned to hard rock for Low Budget (1979), and continued to record within the genre throughout the remainder of their career.

Rushing briskly forward, living on the country where needful, on that Iglau Magazine, on one's own Sechelles resources; rushing on, with the Saxons, with the French, emulous on the right hand and the left, a Captain like Friedrich might have gone far; Vienna itself--who knows!--not yet quite beyond the reach of him. Here was a way to check Khevenhuller in his Bavarian Operations, and whirl him back, double-quick, for another object nearer home!--But, alas, neither the Saxons nor the French would rush on, in the least emulous. The Saxons dragged heavily arear; the French Detachment (a poor 5,000 under Polastron, all that a captious Broglio could be persuaded to grant) would not rush at all, but paused on the very frontier of Moravia, Broglio so ordering, and there hung supine, or indeed went home. Friedrich remonstrated, argued, turned back to encourage; but it was in vain. The Saxon Bastard Princes \\"lived for days in any Schloss they found comfortable;\\" complaining always that there was no victual for their Troops; that the Prussians, always ahead, had eaten the country. No end to haggling; and, except on Friedrich's part, no hearty beginning to real business. \\"If you wish at all to be 'King of Moravia,' what is this!\\" thinks Friedrich justly. Broglio, too, was unmanageable,--piqued that Valori, not Broglio, had started the thing;--showed himself captious, dark, hysterically effervescent, now over-cautious, and again capable of rushing blindly headlong. 1. what kind of experiences is Friedrich having? 2. what did the princes complain about? 3. were they ahead or behindd the prussians? 4. what did the prussians do? 5. who else was hard to manage? 6. what was he mad about? 7. where did the French Detachment stop? 8. who was not interested in rushing? 9. what was one of the first Friedrich took under the Joint-stock Principle? 10. how did he feel about this?","response":"1. Friedrich is having rather painful and deeply disappointing experiences during his Moravian Expedition. 2. The princes complained that there was no food for their troops, as the country had been eaten up by the Prussians who were always ahead. 3. They were behind the Prussians. 4. The Prussians were rushing briskly forward, living on the country where needed, and were ahead of the Saxons and the French. 5. Broglio was also hard to manage. 6. Broglio was mad that Valori, not himself, had started the thing (the Moravian Expedition). 7. The French Detachment stopped on the very frontier of Moravia. 8. The Saxons and the French were not interested in rushing forward. 9. The winter Expedition to Mahren was one of the first that Friedrich took under the Joint-stock Principle. 10. Friedrich felt quite disgusted with the Joint-stock Principle in affairs of war due to the disappointing outcome of this expedition."},{"question":"SENTENCE: \`\` you should not ...

'' oaka asked . \`\` i do n't think it matters very much . '' monika said , turning to gnat . \`\` besides , i do n't wear one when i 'm","response":"working on the farm, so I don't see why I should start now.\\" Gnat nodded in agreement and added, \\"As long as you're comfortable, that's what matters.\\" Monika's decision to wear clothes similar to what she had worn on her journey demonstrated her preference for practicality and her disregard for society's expectations of traditional gender roles. She recognized that her clothing choice would not hinder her ability to participate in the task they were about to undertake, thus rendering the choice inconsequential. Oaka's comment about Monika wearing a dress seemed to stem from a deep-rooted social norm that expected women to appear in a certain way, especially in more formal or ceremonial settings. Monika's response revealed that she valued functionality over optics and saw no need to conform to societal norms if they did not serve a practical purpose. By mentioning her clothing choice while working on the farm, she emphasized the fact that she was used to dressing comfortably for the task at hand and saw no reason to change that practice in their current situation. This remark suggested that Monika's decisions were guided by practicality and personal comfort, rather than by the expectations of others. Gnat's support for Monika's clothing decision demonstrated a similar mindset, as they prioritized Monika's comfort over her adherence to social norms. Their response suggested that they believed individuals should be able to choose their own outfits without being restrained by external expectations. Moreover, Gnat's lack of criticism or judgment towards Monika's decision underscored their belief in personal freedom and the importance of valuing individual choices. This exchange between the characters highlights the theme of challenging traditional gender roles and societal expectations. It brings attention to the need for practical clothing options for women, especially in work settings, and emphasizes the importance of personal comfort over adherence to cultural norms. Additionally, the dialogue offers a critique of societal expectations that may not align with an individual's personal values or practical needs, thus advocating for the importance of prioritizing one's own preferences and well-being. In conclusion, Monika's decision to wear a shirt, breeches, and boots instead of a dress showcases her practicality and portrays a challenge to typical gender roles. The dialogue between Monika, Oaka, and Gnat highlights the importance of personal comfort and functionality while emphasizing the need for individuals to feel free to make personal decisions that may not align with societal expectations. By doing so, the narrative encourages embracing individuality and questioning traditional norms that may not serve the best interests of those involved."},{"question":"Sentence 1: Tudjman is reportedly suffering from stomach cancer that has metastasized. Sentence 2: It's said that Tudjman has stomach cancer that's traveled to other parts of his body. Choose from: (A). yes (B). it is not possible to tell (C). no Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","response":"(A). yes Step-by-step reasoning: 1. In sentence 1, it is mentioned that Tudjman has stomach cancer and that it has metastasized. 2. In medical terms, metastasized means that the cancer has spread from its original site to other parts of the body. 3. Sentence 2 states that Tudjman has stomach cancer, which has traveled to other parts of his body. 4. The information in sentence 2 follows the same logic as the information in sentence 1, which is that Tudjman has stomach cancer and it has spread. Hence, the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence."},{"question":"Given the question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What did the captain from West Point do as soon as he gets to Furnace Creek? Troops are massacred at a Furnace Creek fort in 1880 after an army captain, Walsh, cites orders forcing him to abandon a wagon train. Apache Indians hid inside the wagons to gain access to the fort. General Blackwell is blamed for the incident and court-martialed. Denying that he sent any such order, the general has a stroke and dies on the witness stand. No written evidence of the order is presented. One of his sons, Rufe, a captain from West Point, travels west to find out what happened. His brother, Cash, reads of their father's death in a Kansas City newspaper and also heads toward Furnace Creek in search of answers. Using an alias, Cash learns that Capt. Walsh has become a drunkard. A mining boss, Leverett, is impressed by the stranger in town and hires him, not knowing Cash's real name or intent. Rufe arrives in town and also assumes a false identity. Cafe waitress Molly Baxter, whose father was killed at the fort, still considers General Blackwell the man to blame. But the real villain is Leverett, who bribed Walsh and organized the Apache raid. A guilty conscience causes Walsh to write a confession. Leverett sends one of his henchmen to do away with Walsh, but the confession is found by Cash. Rufe is framed, arrested and tried, but escapes. Cash gives him the confession and tells him to take it to the Army as proof. Wounded in a gunfight with Leverett but victorious, Cash recovers and reads in the paper about the proof of General Blackwell's innocence. The answer is:","response":"As soon as the captain from West Point, Rufe, gets to Furnace Creek, he assumes a false identity."},{"question":"How does the sentence end? (CNN) -- Organizers of a tennis tournament in Dubai, criticized for banning an Israeli player, said Tuesday they were trying to protect the woman from anti-Israel protests. Shahar Peer told CNN she learned of her visa ban Saturday, just before her scheduled flight to Dubai. \\"The Tournament respects Ms. Shahar Peer as a professional tennis player on the Tour and understands her disappointment,\\" the organizers wrote in a statement. \\"Ms. Peer personally witnessed protests against her at another tournament in New Zealand only a few weeks ago. \\"We do not wish to politicize sports, but we have to be sensitive to recent events in the region and not alienate or put at risk the players and the many tennis fans of different nationalities that we have here.\\" \\"I am confident that the OPTIONS: - CNN will take appropriate actions to ensure that this injustice is not allowed to occur in the future, and that the Tour will make sure I will not be further harmed in the short and long term,\\" Peer said in a statement on Tuesday. - Dubai will take appropriate actions to ensure that this injustice is not allowed to occur in the future, and that the Tour will make sure I will not be further harmed in the short and long term,\\" Peer said in a statement on Tuesday. - Israeli will take appropriate actions to ensure that this injustice is not allowed to occur in the future, and that the Tour will make sure I will not be further harmed in the short and long term,\\" Peer said in a statement on Tuesday. - New Zealand will take appropriate actions to ensure that this injustice is not allowed to occur in the future, and that the Tour will make sure I will not be further harmed in the short and long term,\\" Peer said in a statement on Tuesday. - Peer will take appropriate actions to ensure that this injustice is not allowed to occur in the future, and that the Tour will make sure I will not be further harmed in the short and long term,\\" Peer said in a statement on Tuesday. - Player will take appropriate actions to ensure that this injustice is not allowed to occur in the future, and that the Tour will make sure I will not be further harmed in the short and long term,\\" Peer said in a statement on Tuesday. - Shahar Peer will take appropriate actions to ensure that this injustice is not allowed to occur in the future, and that the Tour will make sure I will not be further harmed in the short and long term,\\" Peer said in a statement on Tuesday. - Tour will take appropriate actions to ensure that this injustice is not allowed to occur in the future, and that the Tour will make sure I will not be further harmed in the short and long term,\\" Peer said in a statement on Tuesday. - UAE will take appropriate actions to ensure that this injustice is not allowed to occur in the future, and that the Tour will make sure I will not be further harmed in the short and long term,\\" Peer said in a statement on Tuesday. - anti-Israel will take appropriate actions to ensure that this injustice is not allowed to occur in the future, and that the Tour will make sure I will not be further harmed in the short and long term,\\" Peer said in a statement on Tuesday.","response":"\\"Tour will take appropriate actions to ensure that this injustice is not allowed to occur in the future, and that the Tour will make sure I will not be further harmed in the short and long term,\\" Peer said in a statement on Tuesday. This is the right answer because in this context, it makes the most sense for Shahar Peer, the Israeli tennis player, to express her confidence that the \\"Tour\\", or the tennis tour organizers, will make sure she isn't treated unfairly in future events. Other answers are wrong because it wouldn't make sense for Shahar Peer to say them. For example, \\"CNN\\" is a news channel and it doesn't control the events of the tournament or how the players are treated. Similarly, \\"Dubai\\", \\"Israeli\\", \\"New Zealand\\", \\"UAE\\", and \\"anti-Israel\\" are not responsible for making sure Shahar Peer is not subjected to unfair treatment in the future. It's not right for her to say \\"Peer will take appropriate actions\\" because she is Peer and she can't fix things alone. \\"Player\\" isn't the correct choice either because it refers to all players, not just one. \\"Shahar Peer\\" is not correct because it repeats the name unnecessarily in the sentence. Imagine if you said \\"I, [Your Name], will...\\".

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","response":"The perturbation of using dirty coal to power factories does not have a direct effect on the process of radioactive decay itself, as radioactive decay is a property of the unstable atomic nuclei and is not affected by external conditions like the source of power for factories. However, the indirect effect of using dirty coal can be related to the environmental impact, pollution, and contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. These environmental impacts might lead to changes in climate, air quality, and other factors, which could potentially affect the conditions in which radioactive materials are stored or the rate at which they are discovered and used. However, the actual process of radioactive decay itself remains unchanged by the use of dirty coal.

My partner and I decided to celebrate our anniversary at the restaurant, expecting a fabulous meal and exemplary service. Regrettably, neither aspect even came close to exceeding our expectations. Reservation and Seating: Making a reservation was surprisingly easy, but it was all downhill from there. We arrived promptly at our 7:30 PM reservation time, only to be kept waiting for an additional 30 minutes. The hostess appeared flustered and disorganized, offering vague excuses for the delay. Eventually, we were shown to our table, which was uncomfortably squeezed between two larger parties – far from our requested window seat. Ambience: The ambience had us unimpressed, as it was noisy and chaotic, making conversations next to impossible. The lighting was also overly dim, which, combined with the cramped seating, resulted in a rather uninviting atmosphere. While we recognize that the restaurant strives for a trendy, modern vibe, these factors made it difficult to relax and enjoy our evening. Food: The presentation of our food was certainly aesthetically pleasing, but unfortunately, the taste did not measure up. We started with the lobster bisque and pear and goat cheese salad. The bisque was overwhelmingly salty and lacked the expected lobster richness, while the salad had barely any goat cheese, and the pears were unripe. Next, we ordered the steak and shrimp duo and wild mushroom risotto for our entrees. The steak was severely overcooked, arriving with a dry, charred exterior and a nearly well-done interior when we specifically requested medium-rare. The shrimp, on the other hand, were rubbery and underseasoned. The risotto was overly heavy and lacked the earthy, savory flavors one would expect from a wild mushroom dish; it tasted more like a mouthful of buttery, mushy rice. Lastly, we decided to give their famous chocolate lava cake a try. Although the center was gooey as advertised, the cake itself was dry and crumbly, with a slightly burnt aftertaste. The accompanying ice cream was nothing special and tasted store-bought. Service: Sadly, the abysmal service further dampened our dining experience. Our server seemed perpetually rushed, forgetting our drink orders multiple times and not checking in on us throughout the meal. When we pointed out the issues with our dishes, he offered only a cursory apology and not even a hint of compensation. The meal's pacing was also awkward, with long gaps between courses, making us wonder about the efficiency and coordination within the kitchen. Value for Money: Considering the prices on the menu, we were shocked by the low quality of our meal and the service. It is apparent that the restaurant focuses on boasting high-end clientele rather than delivering a genuinely satisfying dining experience. We left feeling cheated out of our hard-earned money, and that our special occasion was wasted at such a subpar establishment. In conclusion, it is with regret that we cannot recommend The Dining Experience to anyone searching for a memorable meal or exceptional service. Instead, we suggest looking elsewhere for an establishment that truly values its customers and takes pride in its culinary offerings."},{"question":"Possible tweet sentiments: Pick your answer from: A. negative B. positive Write a tweet that is A..","response":"A. negative A possible negative tweet could be: \\"I just had the worst day ever.

Options: - bottom out - cross ocean - collide - cross river - carry people The answer is:","response":"carry people Ship transportation has been prevalent throughout human history, playing a significant role in connecting various parts of the world. While cargo ships are predominantly used for carrying goods from one port to another, there are various other types of ships in the ocean with distinct purposes and functionalities. One such purpose is to transport people, which is why the option \\"carry people\\" aligns with common sense in answering the question. There are several types of ships designed specifically to carry people, including: 1. Passenger ships: These ships are specifically designed to transport people, typically offering a range of services and amenities for the comfort and convenience of passengers. Examples include cruise ships, ferries, and ocean liners. 2. Cruise ships: These large vessels are designed for leisure travel, providing hospitality and entertainment facilities on board to create a vacation-like atmosphere. Cruise ships usually have multiple destinations as part of a planned itinerary and can accommodate thousands of passengers. 3. Ferries: These ships are used to transport passengers, vehicles, and cargo across relatively short distances, such as across rivers or between coastal ports. They are an essential means of developing connectivity between islands and mainland coastal cities. 4. Ocean liners: These are large ships designed to carry passengers on long-distance voyages across oceans, operating on a schedule much like cargo ships.

Longacre is best known for designing the Indian Head cent, which entered commerce in 1859, and for the designs of the Shield nickel, Flying Eagle cent and other coins of the mid-19th century. Longacre was born in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, in 1794. He ran away to Philadelphia at age 12, where he became an apprentice in a bookstore. His artistic talent developed and he was released to apprentice in an engraving firm. He struck out on his own in 1819, making a name providing illustrations for popular biographical books. He portrayed the leading men of his day; support from some of them, such as South Carolina Senator John C. Calhoun, led to his appointment as chief engraver after the death of Christian Gobrecht in 1844. In Longacre's first years as a chief engraver, the Philadelphia Mint was dominated by Mint Director Robert M. Patterson and Chief Coiner Franklin Peale. Conflict between Longacre and the two men developed after Congress ordered a new gold dollar and double eagle, with both to be designed by Longacre. Peale and Patterson nearly had Longacre fired, but the chief engraver was able to convince Treasury Secretary William M. Meredith that he should be retained. Both Patterson and Peale left the Mint in the early 1850s, ending the conflict. In 1856, Longacre designed the Flying Eagle cent. When that design proved difficult to strike, Longacre was responsible for the replacement, the Indian Head cent, issued beginning in 1859. Other coins designed by Longacre include the silver and nickel three-cent pieces, the Shield nickel, the pattern Washington nickel, and the two-cent piece. In 1866–1867, he redesigned the coins of Chile. Longacre died suddenly on New Year's Day 1869; he was succeeded by William Barber.

Asteroid A and asteroid B are of the same mass, but asteroid A is farther from the earth than asteroid B. Asteroid C and asteroid D are at the same distance form the earth, but asteroid C has more mass than asteroid D. He also figured out that all of these asteroids have less mass than earth. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: In clssical theory, if Rob needs to find out the object with stronger gravitational pull, which one would he choose, earth or asteroid A? A:","response":"In classical theory, the gravitational pull between two objects depends on their masses and the distance between them. This relation is given by Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, which states: F = G * (m1 * m2) / r^2 Where F is the force of gravity, G is the gravitational constant, m1 and m2 are the masses of the objects, and r is the distance between the centers of the two objects. Given the information in the paragraph, we can compare the gravitational pull of Earth and Asteroid A on an object. Since Rob detected that all of the asteroids (including Asteroid A) have less mass than Earth, we know that the mass of Earth (m1) is greater than the mass of Asteroid A (m2). Additionally, Asteroid A is farther from Earth than Asteroid B, meaning the distance between Earth and Asteroid A (rA) is greater than the distance between Earth and Asteroid B (rB). Even though we do not have the exact values for the masses and distances, we can conclude that Earth has a stronger gravitational pull on an object than Asteroid A based on the given information. First, let's compare the mass factor in the gravitational force formula. Since Earth's mass is greater than Asteroid A's mass (m1 > m2), this factor for Earth's gravitational pull will be stronger than that of Asteroid A. Next, consider the distance factor. Because Asteroid A is farther from Earth, the force of gravity between an object and Asteroid A would decrease due to the increased distance (rA > rB). This factor further implies that Earth's gravitational pull would be stronger. Combining the mass and distance factors in Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, it becomes evident that Earth's gravitational pull is stronger than that of Asteroid A. Thus, if Rob needs to find the object with a stronger gravitational pull in classical theory, he should choose Earth over Asteroid A."},{"question":"What's the best dogs restaurant in the world?

In this case, the premise says that Lexus ads in Car and Driver or Fortune reach people who have lots of money and enjoy fancy cars. A hypothesis is like a guess we make based on the information we have. The hypothesis here is that some Lexus ads are made for rich people who like nice cars. So, if the premise is true, it means that those Lexus ads are indeed reaching rich people who love nice cars. And that's exactly what our hypothesis says!

Now, let's evaluate each option: [i] very aimless - This description could apply to someone who lacks direction in life or has trouble making decisions. Although Taylor made the decision to read blogs instead of going to work, it is not clear whether this choice demonstrates a general lack of direction in their life. [ii] determined - This description implies that someone works hard and is committed to achieving their goals. Taylor's decision to skip work to read online blogs does not align with being determined. [iii] lazy - This description applies to someone who avoids work or responsibilities. As Taylor chose to read online blogs all day rather than going to work, this option seems like the best fit. Given the information provided, I would describe Taylor as: The answer is: [iii] lazy"},{"question":"Read this: The majority of eukaryotic genes are stored on a set of large, linear chromosomes. The chromosomes are packed within the nucleus in complex with storage proteins called histones to form a unit called a nucleosome. DNA packaged and condensed in this way is called chromatin.:4.2 The manner in which DNA is stored on the histones, as well as chemical modifications of the histone itself, regulate whether a particular region of DNA is accessible for gene expression. In addition to genes, eukaryotic chromosomes contain sequences involved in ensuring that the DNA is copied without degradation of end regions and sorted into daughter cells during cell division: replication origins, telomeres and the centromere.:4.2 Replication origins are the sequence regions where DNA replication is initiated to make two copies of the chromosome. Telomeres are long stretches of repetitive sequence that cap the ends of the linear chromosomes and prevent degradation of coding and regulatory regions during DNA replication. The length of the telomeres decreases each time the genome is replicated and has been implicated in the aging process. The centromere is required for binding spindle fibres to separate sister chromatids into daughter cells during cell division.:18.2 Chromosomes that are packed within the nucleus in complex with histones are called what? What is the answer? (If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\")","response":"Okay kiddo, let me explain this to you. Inside the tiny center of a cell, called the nucleus, there are these long, stringy things called chromosomes. They have important stuff called genes. To keep them nice and neat, they get wrapped around special little helper proteins called histones, kind of like when you wrap your headphones around something to stop them getting tangled. When this happens, the chromosomes with histones are called a nucleosome. And all of the DNA that's wrapped up this way has a special name, too: it's called chromatin.

This phrase could refer to a conversation about the island country of Madagascar. Located in the Indian Ocean, east of the African continent, Madagascar is the fourth largest island in the world and is home to a rich and diverse ecosystem with abundant flora and fauna. Originally settled by Austronesian people between 350 BC and 550 AD, Madagascar has a fascinating history and a unique blend of cultures influenced by Southeast Asian, African, Arab, and European settlers. The Malagasy, the island's indigenous people, have a diverse culture that embraces various ethnic groups, each with their own linguistic, ethnic, and social characteristics. The wildlife of Madagascar is a significant topic of interest for many people, as the island has a high level of biodiversity and is home to numerous endemic species (meaning they are found nowhere else on Earth). Some of the iconic species found in Madagascar include the various types of lemurs, endemic reptiles, and a vast array of bird species. Over the years, several conservation efforts have been put in place to protect the ecosystem and wildlife of Madagascar. However, the island faces several environmental challenges, primarily deforestation, habitat loss, and human encroachment. These issues have led to a significant loss of habitat for many endemic species and have resulted in alarming rates of species endangerment. Another aspect of Madagascar that is often discussed is its art, language, and traditions. Malagasy, the official language of Madagascar, has Austronesian, Bantu, Arabic, French, and English influences. Music and dance play a vital role in the Malagasy culture, and various regional styles can be found throughout the island. Madagascar's visual arts, such as wood carving, silk weaving, and painting, also exhibit the island's diverse cultural influences. The economy of Madagascar is another area that may be covered in a discussion. Madagascar's economy relies heavily on agriculture, mining, and tourism. The island is a significant global producer of vanilla, coffee, and precious stones such as sapphires. Unfortunately, the country still faces numerous challenges, including poverty, political instability, and infrastructure deficiencies. In conclusion, a discussion about Madagascar could cover a wide array of topics, including its history, culture, wildlife, ecology, economy, and current challenges. The island's unique and diverse aspects make it an interesting subject for conversation and further exploration."},{"question":"Concepts: building, detail, facade Write a sentence that includes all these words.","response":"The intricately designed building, boasting a remarkable level of detail, undoubtedly captured the attention of passersby due to its stunning facade that harmoniously blended traditional and contemporary architectural elements."},{"question":"I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: One reaction to all the concern about tropical deforestation is a blank stare that asks the question, \\"Since I don't live there, what does it have to do with me?\\" The answer is that your way of life, wherever you live in the world, is tied to the tropics in many ways. If you live in a house, wash your hair, eat fruits and vegetables, drink soda, or drive a car, you can be certain that you are affected by the loss of tropical forests. Biologically, we are losing the richest regions on earth when, each minute, a piece of tropical forest, the size of ten city blocks, disappears. As many as five million species of plants, animals, and insects (40 to 50 percent of all living things) live there, and are being lost faster than they can be found and described. Their loss is immeasurable. Take rubber for example. For many uses, only natural rubber from trees will do. _ are not good enough. Today over half the world's commercial rubber is produced in Malaysia and Indonesia, while the Amazon's rubber industry produces much of the world's four million tons. And rubber is an important material in making gloves, balloons, footwear and many sporting goods. Thousands of other tropical plants are valuable for their industrial use. Many scientists strongly believe that deforestation contributes to the greenhouse effect -- or heating of the earth from increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. As we destroy forests, we lose their ability to change carbon dioxide into oxygen. Carbon dioxide levels could double within the next half-century, warming the earth by as much as 4.5 degrees. The result? A partial melt-down of polar ice caps, raising sea levels as much as 24 feet; even 15 feet could threaten anyone living within 35 miles of the coast. Unbelievable? Maybe. But scientists warn that by the time we realise the severe effects of tropical deforestation, it will be 20 years too late. Can tropical deforestation affect our everyday lives? Now, you should have got the answer. Question: The author's attitude towards the tropical deforestation is _ .

Miller was raised in the outskirt mountains of Tijuana , Mexico for some time , before settling down in Santa Barbara , California .","response":"No, the two sentences do not have the same meaning. In fact, they describe two completely different scenarios. The first sentence describes a situation in which Miller originally spent a part of his upbringing in the mountains of Santa Barbara, California. Afterwards, he eventually settled down in Tijuana, Mexico. This implies that Miller perhaps was initially living in the USA but later moved and decided to stay in Mexico. The second sentence, conversely, tells us that Miller was raised for some time in the mountain outskirts of Tijuana, Mexico. He then ended up settling down in Santa Barbara, California. This implies a trajectory of life where Miller started in Mexico but later moved to and settled in the USA. Therefore, although both statements involve the same locations (Tijuana, Mexico and Santa Barbara, California) and the same individual (Miller), the order of events and hence the overall meanings are entirely different. In the first sentence, Miller moves from the USA to Mexico, and in the second sentence, he moves from Mexico to the USA.

If your headaches do not go away with lifestyle and other changes, see a doctor for evaluation. While usually not serious, chronic headaches can be caused by other medical problems. To help your doctor provide the best diagnosis, make a list of your symptoms. Keep a headache diary, chronicling when your headaches occur and any potential triggers. Include the intensity of each headache. You should also note how long your headaches have been occurring and any existing medical conditions you have. Depending on your symptoms, your doctor may want to run some tests to check for underlying conditions that may be causing your headaches. They may order a CT scan, an MRI, or blood work to check for neurological or other problems. If your doctor orders any tests, make sure you ask them about preparing ahead of time. Some tests may require you not to eat or drink the day before, for example. Depending on what your doctor thinks is causing the headaches, they may suggest dietary supplements. Magnesium, butterbur, feverfew, coenzyme Q10, and riboflavin are supplements that have reduced headache symptoms for some. Discuss dietary supplements with your doctor to see if they would be safe given your current health and any existing medications. Never introduce a dietary supplement before talking to your doctor first. Massage therapy involves seeing a professional masseuse to have your head, temples, and other body parts massaged to reduce the frequency of headaches.

I might forgo a diet and start exercising . (C). I might get on a fast and stop exercising . (D). I might get on a diet and start exercising .","response":"Based on the context of the user wanting to lose weight and get back into a healthy range, the best choice would be: (D). I might get on a diet and start exercising. Justification for this step: Option (A) proposes binge eating, which directly opposes the user's purpose of losing weight. Binge eating typically leads to weight gain, not loss. Option (B) suggests forgoing a diet but starting to exercise. While exercise can help with weight loss, diet is a significant part of the process. One could exercise and still not lose weight if they're consuming more calories than they're burning. Option (C) recommends getting on a fast and stop exercising. While fasting can lead to weight loss, it's not generally a sustainable long-term approach. Additionally, cutting out exercise when wishing to lose weight is counterproductive. Option (D) proposes getting on a diet and starting to exercise. This choice aligns with a balanced, healthful approach to weight loss. Both diet adjustments and increased physical activity can support a steady, healthy weight loss towards the user's goal of reaching 150 lbs.

Mycenaean Greece, a period between approximately 1600-1100 BC, represents one of the early stages of Greek civilization. This period laid the foundation for many aspects of Greek culture, including religion and mythology. The Mycenaean people were heavily influenced by the earlier Minoan civilization, but their religion was also shaped by Indo-European belief systems and those of the surrounding regions. The Mycenaean religion, like those of later Greek antiquity, was polytheistic, which means they worshipped multiple gods and goddesses. One notable surviving aspect of Mycenaean heritage is the names of these gods and goddesses, which were passed down and incorporated into later religious systems, particularly the Olympian Pantheon. The Olympian Pantheon refers to the classical collection of the twelve principal gods and goddesses of Greek mythology. These deities held central roles in Greek religious beliefs and were considered to reside on Mount Olympus, the highest peak in Greece. The Olympian Pantheon was an important part of Greek religion, culture and literature, and its influence can still be observed in art and architecture around the world. In the sentence provided, three major figures of the Olympian Pantheon are mentioned: Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades. Zeus was the king of the gods and the ruler of the sky. His brothers, Poseidon and Hades, governed the oceans and the underworld, respectively. These gods, among others, held significant roles in Greek religious practices and were believed to have the ability to influence the lives of ancient Greeks, thus demonstrating an ancestral tie. Other prominent figures from Mycenaean Greece who became part of the Olympian Pantheon include Hera, Athena, Aphrodite, Apollo, Artemis, Ares, Hephaestus, Demeter, Hermes, and Hestia. These gods and goddesses had various roles and responsibilities, and each one was associated with a unique set of customs, symbols, and rituals. In conclusion, the sentence provided gives a valid answer to the question about figures for the established religion that is based on ancestral ties. Mycenaean Greece's religious heritage has had a significant influence on later Greek mythology and the Olympian Pantheon, which played a crucial role in shaping Greek culture, traditions, and belief systems. Among the mentioned figures are Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades, as well as many other gods and goddesses of divine lineage, emphasizing the ancestral connections and traditions that comprise the roots of Greek mythology."},{"question":"Question: John was 15 and this was the first year he would get to do what?

Answer:","response":"In China, the traditional colour of a wedding dress is red. This vibrant and auspicious colour holds deep cultural and historical significance within Chinese society and is believed to bring luck, joy, and prosperity to the couple's life. In Chinese culture, red not only represents love and fertility, but also wards off evil spirits, making it the ideal choice for celebrating such an important and meaningful occasion as a wedding. The history of red wedding dresses in China dates back to the earliest dynasties when the colour was associated with virtues of loyalty, honour, and righteousness. Over the years, as different empires ruled over China and transformed the country, the symbolism and importance of the colour red persisted, further embedding itself into the customs and practices of the Chinese people. During traditional Chinese weddings, brides usually wear a long-sleeved gown known as a qipao or cheongsam. This dress is made from silk and is intricately embroidered with various symbols and patterns, such as dragons, phoenixes, flowers, and other auspicious elements, typically in gold and silver thread. These designs represent the balance and harmony of the bride and groom's union, as well as their wishes for a happy and prosperous life together. The qipao is also typically adorned with beads, sequins, or pearls to amplify its elegance and formality. Traditionally, the bride's hair is also ornamented with a red headpiece or veil known as a xiape, which conceals her face until the groom lifts it during the wedding ceremony. This act symbolizes the beginning of their life together and the unveiling of their love, respect, and commitment to each other. It is also common for Chinese brides to wear multiple outfits during the day of the wedding. After wearing the red dress for the traditional wedding ceremony, some brides may change into a white Western wedding dress for the reception or more formal dinner. This change reflects the cultural shift due to globalization and often symbolizes a blending of the traditional Chinese and contemporary Western customs and values. Lastly, out of respect for their families, many Chinese couples pay homage to their ancestors by participating in a tea ceremony, during which they usually don traditional Chinese red wedding attire. The tea ceremony involves the couple serving tea to their parents, grandparents, and sometimes other relatives as a sign of gratitude for their guidance and support. In conclusion, the traditional colour of a wedding dress in China is red, symbolizing good fortune, love, and protection against evil. Today, the use of red wedding dresses remains a popular and meaningful custom for many Chinese brides, helping to maintain and preserve the rich cultural heritage and values of the Chinese community."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What city contained the Antonia Fortress?, using the article: The Acra was not the first Hellenistic stronghold in Jerusalem. Sources indicate that an earlier citadel, the Ptolemaic Baris, had also occupied a location overlooking the Temple's precincts. Although the exact location of the Baris is still debated, it is generally accepted to have stood north of the Temple Mount on the site later occupied by the Antonia Fortress. The Baris fell to Antiochus III at the turn of the 2nd century BCE and is absent from all accounts of the Maccabean Revolt. Despite the narratives which have the Acra constructed within a very short time-span, it was nevertheless formidable enough to weather long periods of siege. These factors, coupled with references in which the Baris was itself called an acra, have led some to suggest that the Baris and the Acra were in fact the same structure. Although both 1 Maccabees and Josephus seem to describe the Acra as a new construction, this may not have been the case. Antiquities of the Jews 12:253 may be translated to give the sense that the \\"impious or wicked\\" had \\"remained\\" rather than \\"dwelt\\" in the citadel, which could be taken to mean that the Acra had been standing before the revolt and that only the Macedonian garrison was new.Koen Decoster proposes that Josephus wrote of \\"a citadel in the lower part of the city\\" to an audience that would have been familiar with the Jerusalem of the 1st century CE—a city that did feature two citadels: the Antonia Fortress and the Herodian palace. As Josephus' Roman Jerusalem had already expanded to the higher western hill, \\"a citadel in the lower city\\" could have referred to anything located east of the Tyropoeon Valley, including the Antonia which stood north of the Temple and did indeed rise above and dominate it. In his view, this is the place Josephus must have had in mind when he wrote of the Acra.Opponents of a northern location counter that this site is not supported by the historical sources, and that this would place the Acra away from Jerusalem's population center.

Fact 2: Botulism affects the nervous system. Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"what does botulism affect?\\" with the following options: - humans - the skin - plants - our planet - neurons - people - insects - animals Answer:","response":"Botulism affects neurons in the nervous system. Before providing a comprehensive answer, let us first delve deeper into both facts. Fact 1: Neurons are the structural and functional units of the nervous system. Neurons are specialized cells that transmit information through electrical and chemical signals. They form the fundamental building blocks of the nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves. Neurons communicate with each other through synapses, gaps between adjacent neurons where electrical or chemical signals are exchanged. These signals, otherwise known as nerve impulses, facilitate the regulation of various body functions such as muscle movement, digestion, and the processing of thoughts and memories. Fact 2: Botulism affects the nervous system. Botulism is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition caused by toxins produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. These toxins are among the most powerful known to science and interfere with the normal functioning of the nervous system. Specifically, they block the release of a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine, which is crucial for nerve impulse transmission at the neuromuscular junction. When the release of acetylcholine is hindered, it leads to muscle paralysis and, in severe cases, respiratory failure and death. Now, let us examine each of the given options to understand how botulism interacts with them: - Humans: Botulism affects humans by targeting their neurons, leading to potentially severe nervous system impairments. - The skin: Botulism does not directly affect the skin; its primary target is the nervous system, resulting in muscle paralysis and other complications. - Plants: Botulism does not affect plants as its toxins specifically target the nervous system, which plants lack. - Our planet: Botulism has no direct impact on the planet as a whole. However, it can pose a significant health threat to humans, resulting in localized or individual consequences. - Neurons: Botulism directly affects neurons by inhibiting the release of acetylcholine, a critical neurotransmitter necessary for nerve impulse transmission. - People: Similar to humans, botulism affects people by interfering with the functioning of their nervous systems. - Insects: Although botulism primarily affects humans and animals, insects can act as vectors in transmitting Clostridium botulinum spores and toxins to human food sources. - Animals: Some animals, such as birds and mammals, can also be affected by botulism. It primarily impacts their nervous systems, just as it does in humans. Given these details, we can conclude that botulism affects neurons, which are the structural and functional units of the nervous system. By targeting neurons and blocking neurotransmitter release, botulism causes potentially life-threatening impairments in the affected individual's nervous system."},{"question":"If Sheba has the weight advantage because she's heavier, can we conclude that \\"She is a tiny one.\\"? Choose your answer from: [i] yes [ii] it is not possible to tell [iii] no","response":"[iii] no"},{"question":"Answer the question...where did the uranium on earth come from??","response":"To answer the question of where the uranium on Earth came from, I would follow these steps: Step 1: Research the origin of uranium My first step would be to research the origins of uranium to better understand the processes involved in its creation. Uranium is a heavy element with atomic number 92, making it one of the elements produced by nucleosynthesis. Step 2: Understand nucleosynthesis I would proceed by learning about nucleosynthesis, which is the process by which atomic nuclei are created. There are different types of nucleosynthesis, including Big Bang nucleosynthesis, stellar nucleosynthesis, and supernova nucleosynthesis. Step 3: Identify the main source of uranium After researching nucleosynthesis, I would focus on the primary source of uranium. As heavier elements like uranium cannot be synthesized during the Big Bang, they are mostly produced during supernova explosions and the merging of neutron stars. These extreme astronomical events provide the necessary high-energy environment for the formation or fusion of heavy elements like uranium. Step 4: Relate the source of uranium to the formation of the solar system Next, I would investigate how uranium made its way to Earth. The materials that formed our solar system, including the Earth, were created from a cloud of gas and dust containing heavy elements such as uranium. These elements originated from past supernova explosions and neutron star mergers, which resulted in their distribution throughout the galaxy. Step 5: Explain the distribution of uranium on Earth Finally, I would describe how uranium became distributed within Earth's crust and mantle. As Earth formed and underwent differentiation, elements like uranium were distributed unevenly based on factors such as their density, affinity with other elements, and crystallization temperatures. Concentrations of uranium vary across geological formations, with higher concentrations often found in certain types of rocks, such as granites and sedimentary rocks. In summary, the uranium on Earth originated from past supernova explosions and neutron star mergers. The heavy elements produced during these events were dispersed throughout the galaxy and eventually incorporated into the gas and dust cloud that formed our solar system. As the Earth formed and evolved, uranium became distributed within the planet's crust and mantle."},{"question":"See question below: Of the following two sentences, which one is against common sense?

Sentence A: \\"Lee parked his truck in the driveway.\\" - In this sentence, Lee is parking a truck in a driveway. Trucks are common personal vehicles and, in most cases, can fit within the average size of a residential driveway. Therefore, parking a truck in a driveway is generally in line with common sense. Sentence B: \\"Lee parked his bus in the driveway.\\" - In this sentence, Lee is parking a bus in the driveway. Buses are typically larger and longer than personal vehicles and can often exceed the size of a residential driveway. Due to their size, buses are less likely to fit within the average driveway. In most cases, it is against common sense to park a bus in a residential driveway.

As a devoted fan of his favorite science fiction series, Alex had always been on the lookout for authentic memorabilia to add to his growing collection. Over the years, he amassed an assortment of action figures, comic books, and original artwork, but the one thing he prized above all were the items signed by the cast of the show. It was a constant reminder of his deep connection to the story and the other fans of the series. One day, Alex received a tip from a fellow collector about an upcoming auction where a rare signed poster and a signed card would be up for sale. Excited and prepared to go to any lengths to acquire these sought-after collectibles, he spent the days before the auction researching the history of the items, analyzing the signatures, and working out his bidding strategy. When the day of the auction finally arrived, Alex felt a mix of anticipation and anxiety. The signed card was the first item on the block, and as he studied the image of his favorite character and the signature underneath, Alex was confident in the authenticity of the item. The pen strokes, the pressure, and even the slight smudging all pointed to the genuine article. He had pored over countless examples of the actor's signature, so he knew what to look for. He prepared his bid, and as the auctioneer began the call for bids, Alex found himself in a heated bidding war with another collector. It was a nerve-wracking experience, but in the end, his determination prevailed, and the signed card was his. However, as the auction continued and the signed poster came to the block, Alex's enthusiasm waned. Unlike the card, the signature on the poster seemed inconsistent. The pen strokes did not match the flow he had come to know so well, and something about the pressure applied appeared unnatural. It almost seemed as though the signature had been written by someone attempting to mimic the real thing but lacking the years of practice the actor would have developed in perfecting it. Despite the poster's ideal place in his collection, Alex could not shake the nagging feeling that it was a counterfeit. He was disappointed, but he reminded himself that he had won the genuine article in the signed card, and that was no small achievement. As the auction wound down, Alex took a moment to reflect on the day and the additions to his collection. He decided to take this experience as a lesson and resolve to continue improving his skills as a collector. The pursuit of authenticity was a never-ending journey, and he was grateful to be a part of that adventure. In the months that followed, Alex delved deeper into the world of collecting, familiarizing himself with authentication methods and forging relationships with reputable appraisers and fellow collectors.

The biological function of a flower is to effect reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower). Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy). Flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop. Many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause them to be vectors for the transfer of pollen. After fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops into fruit containing seeds. - Thyme is an evergreen herb with culinary, medicinal, and ornamental uses.

The rebels, he said, had reserves of 150 combat vehicles, including tanks. An earlier mistranslation of his words suggested Mr Zakharchenko had said the vehicles were on their way from Russia. Russia has denied claims by Ukraine and Western reporters that military aid to the rebels has been crossing the border. More than 2,000 civilians and combatants have been killed since mid-April, when Ukraine's new government sent troops to put down an uprising by pro-Russian separatists in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. A huge humanitarian aid convoy from Russia is stalled on the Russian side of the border about two hours drive from Luhansk, apparently awaiting inspection by Ukrainian border guards. Red Cross official Pascal Cuttat said on Saturday there were still no security guarantees in place for his staff to escort the lorries, although \\"technical conditions\\" had been agreed with Ukraine and Russia for crossing the border. On Friday Russian Defence Minister Sergey Shoygu assured his US counterpart Chuck Hagel that there were no Russian military personnel involved with the convoy, nor would it be used as a pretext for a Russian military intervention. Journalists who were invited to inspect some of the 280 or so vehicles on Friday found humanitarian aid inside but also noticed that some of the lorries were not full to capacity. Mr Zakharchenko, who became the prime minister of the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) last week, made the announcement to the rebels' parliament on Friday, with a video of his speech (in Russian) posted on YouTube. Littering the speech with military jargon, he said: \\"There are, at present, in the axis of the corridor [linking rebels in Donetsk with those in Luhansk and the Russian border] - there have been assembled -reserves of the following order: 150 units of military hardware of which about 30 are actual tanks and the rest are infantry fighting vehicles and armoured personnel carriers, and 1,200 personnel who underwent four months of military training on the territory of the Russian Federation.\\" The rebel leader went on a Russian pro-Kremlin TV channel on Saturday to reject reports that the hardware had come from Russia. \\"The Ukrainian military have left us so much hardware that we can't find enough people to crew it - I mean tanks, troop carriers, Grad [multiple rocket] launchers and so on,\\" he told Life News (video in Russian). He added that \\"ethnic Ukrainian\\" volunteers from Russia, not servicemen, were fighting for the rebels, along with \\"Turks; a great many Serbs; Italians and Germans; and even two Romanians\\". Ukraine said on Friday it had partially destroyed an armoured column that had crossed from Russia on Thursday evening. Two UK newspaper reporters witnessed the alleged incursion. Russia's defence ministry responded by saying the incursion reports were \\"some kind of fantasy\\" and Moscow has consistently denied directly arming or training the rebels. But the incident prompted a flurry of Western condemnation. \\"Any unilateral military actions on the part of the Russian Federation in Ukraine under any pretext, including humanitarian, will be considered by the European Union as a blatant violation of international law,\\" a statement by EU foreign ministers issued on Friday says. German Chancellor Angela Merkel told Russian President Vladimir Putin in a phone call on Friday to \\"put an end to the flow of military goods, military advisers and armed personnel over the border\\".

A medal may be awarded to a person or organization as a form of recognition for sporting, military, scientific, academic, or various other achievements. Military awards and decorations are more precise terms for certain types of state decoration. Medals may also be created for sale to commemorate particular individuals or events, or as works of artistic expression in their own right. In the past, medals commissioned for an individual, typically with their portrait, were often used as a form of diplomatic or personal gift, with no sense of being an award for the conduct of the recipient. - A gold medal is a medal awarded for highest achievement in a non-military field. Its name derives from the use of at least a fraction of gold in form of plating or alloying in its manufacture. - Hancock is a city in Houghton County, Michigan, United States and is located on Copper Island, which is part of the Keweenaw Peninsula, on the Keewenaw Waterway directly opposite Houghton, Michigan.

Squaw Valley was chosen to host the Games at the 1956 meeting of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). It was an undeveloped resort in 1955, so from 1956 to 1960 the infrastructure and all of the venues were built at a cost of US80,000,000. It was designed to be intimate, allowing spectators and competitors to walk to nearly all the venues. Squaw Valley hosted athletes from thirty nations who competed in four sports and twenty-seven events. Women's speed skating and biathlon made their Olympic debuts. The organizers decided the bobsled events did not warrant the cost to build a venue, so for the first and only time bobsled was not on the Winter Olympic program. The Soviet Union dominated the medal count winning twenty-one medals, seven of which were gold. Soviet speed skaters Yevgeny Grishin and Lidiya Skoblikova won two gold medals each.

Article: (ALAUDDIN VALLEY) -- Russia's relationship with Tajikistan has _ following an incident involving a Russian pilot who was arrested -- after making an emergency landing in the Central Asian nation. Russia responded by beginning to drive out Tajik guest workers, a move that threatens Tajikistan's entire economy. In total, some 700,000 Tajik citizens work in Russia. In the past quarter, they sent home some 742 million in remittances . Overall, the money guest workers send back makes up half of the republic's government budget. The Alauddin Valley is in the Fann Mountains in eastern Tajikistan. The place long held an attraction for Russian writers and adventurers. Later, during the Soviet era, it was a popular tourist destination. Yet establishing a strong relationship with the people of the mountainous region is not easy. Men are seldom seen in the area. Nearly every family has at least one breadwinner working in Russia, if not more. The farm work falls to the women, who divide it up among themselves. Each summer, the village chooses the most experienced and skilled women to take all of the cows (up to 300 of them) to the summer pastures high up on in the mountains. The women spend four months there with their children since there is no one to leave the children with. They milk the cows and prepare products for the winter: cheese, butter and so on. These fermented goods get them through the winter when snow and avalanches cut off all contact with civilization. Residents here generally have two questions for visiting Russians. The first one is obvious: Is President Dmitri Medvedev going to limit the entry of Tajik guest workers? The second question is less obvious: Are there cows in Moscow? The Alauddin Valley's women truly can't imagine life without either.

The MAUD Committee reports urged the co-operation with the United States should be continued in the research of nuclear fission. Charles C. Lauritsen, a Caltech physicist working at the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC), was in London during this time and was invited to sit in on a MAUD meeting. The committee pushed for rapid development of nuclear weapons using gaseous-diffusion as their isotope separation device. Once he returned to the United States, he was able to brief Vannevar Bush, the director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), concerning the details discussed during the meeting.In August 1941, Mark Oliphant, the director of the physics department at the University of Birmingham and an original member of the MAUD Committee, was sent to the US to assist the NDRC on radar. During his visit he met with William D. Coolidge. Coolidge was shocked when Oliphant informed him that the British had predicted that only ten kilograms of uranium-235 would be sufficient to supply a chain reaction effected by fast moving neutrons. While in America, Oliphant discovered that the chairman of the OSRD S-1 Section, Lyman Briggs, had locked away the MAUD reports transferred from Britain entailing the initial discoveries and had not informed the S-1 Committee members of all its findings.Oliphant took the initiative himself to enlighten the scientific community in the U.S. of the recent ground breaking discoveries the MAUD Committee had just exposed. Oliphant also travelled to Berkley to meet with Ernest Lawrence, inventor of the cyclotron. After Oliphant informed Lawrence of his report on uranium, Lawrence met with NDRC chairman James Bryant Conant, George B.

This event took place from June 14th to July 15th, 2018, and featured 32 teams from various countries competing to be the world champion. England performed well in their group stage, where they were placed in Group G alongside Belgium, Tunisia, and Panama. After winning against Tunisia with a score of 2-1 and crushing Panama with a resounding 6-1 victory, England suffered a narrow 1-0 loss to Belgium. However, their performance had earned them a spot in the knockout phase with a second-place finish in the group. In the Round of 16, England faced Colombia, securing a thrilling 4-3 win in a penalty shootout after the match ended in a 1-1 draw in extra time. This victory advanced them into the quarterfinals, where they met Sweden. The match saw England emerge victorious with a 2-0 scoreline, propelling the team into the semifinals. Heading into the semifinal match against Croatia on July 11th, 2018, England held high hopes for their squad led by coach Gareth Southgate. The match started in favor of England, with Kieran Trippier's spectacular free-kick goal just five minutes into the match. However, Croatia equalized in the 68th minute with a goal from Ivan Perišić and after no additional goals from either team, the match went into extra time. In the 109th minute, Mario Mandzukic from Croatia scored the decisive goal, leading to a 2-1 victory for Croatia and knocking England out of the tournament. England then played the third-place playoff match against Belgium on July 14th, 2018, in which Belgium secured a 2-0 win. Although England's dream of winning the 2018 FIFA World Cup was not fulfilled, their journey to the semifinals was an impressive achievement considering their previous World Cup performance in 2014, where they were eliminated in the group stage. The 2018 tournament marked England's best performance in a World Cup since 1990 when they also reached the semifinals.

In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer.

My partner and I decided to go there for our anniversary dinner after hearing great things about the place from our friends. Unfortunately, the evening turned out to be a complete disaster. Upon our arrival, we had to wait for 20 minutes, despite having a reservation. The hostess seemed overwhelmed and was not very apologetic about the inconvenience. Once we were finally seated, it took another 15 minutes for our server to come and take our drink order. We observed that several tables surrounding us were also neglected, so this may have been a staffing issue. When it came to the food, both of our appetizers, the calamari and bruschetta, were underwhelming. The calamari was chewy and lacked seasoning, while the bruschetta had stale bread and was drenched in oil. For our main courses, I ordered the lobster ravioli and my partner ordered the steak. The ravioli tasted bland and the sauce lacked the necessary richness to complement the dish. My partner’s steak, although cooked to the correct temperature, was a poor quality cut of meat, which was quite disappointing considering the price. To make matters worse, the service continued to decline throughout the evening. Our server was inattentive, forgot to refill our water glasses, and didn't check in on our satisfaction with the meal. Finally, after finishing our main courses, we decided to skip dessert and just asked for the bill to leave. Overall, we were incredibly disheartened by our experience at XYZ Restaurant.

The figure was 9.1 in October 2010 and 9.0 in October 2012.","response":"To create a set of triples for the given sentence, we need to identify the subject, predicate, and object for each piece of information. In this case, the sentence provides two pieces of information, so we need to create two triples. Triple 1: 1. Subject: The figure in October 2010 2. Predicate: Was 3. Object: 9.1 Triple 2: 1. Subject: The figure in October 2012 2. Predicate: Was 3. Object: 9.0 The reasoning for the triple creation is as follows: - In both triples, the \\"predicate\\" (verb) is \\"was\\" as it relates the subject and object. - For Triple 1, the \\"subject\\" is \\"The figure in October 2010\\" since the sentence specifically mentions the figure for that time period. The \\"object\\" is the value provided for the figure, which in this case is \\"9.1.\\" - Similarly, for Triple 2, the \\"subject\\" is \\"The figure in October 2012,\\" as the sentence once again refers to a specific figure for a particular time period. The \\"object\\" in this triple is the mentioned value \\"9.0.\\" So, the set of triples is: 1. (The figure in October 2010, Was, 9.1) 2.

After the 1768 purchase, the land became part of Northumberland County, but was soon divided among other counties. Most of the park is in Luzerne County, which was formed in 1786 from part of Northumberland County. Within Luzerne County, the majority of the park, including all of the waterfalls and most of Lake Jean, is in Fairmount Township, which was settled in 1792 and incorporated in 1834; the easternmost part of the park is in Ross Township, which was settled in 1795 and incorporated in 1842. The northwest part of the park is in Sullivan County, which was formed in 1847 from Lycoming County; Davidson Township was settled by 1808 and incorporated in 1833, while Colley Township, which has the park office and part of Lake Jean, was settled in the early 19th century and incorporated in 1849. A small part of the southwest part of the park is in Sugarloaf Township in Columbia County; the township was settled in 1792 and incorporated in 1812, the next year Columbia County was formed from Northumberland County.A hunter named Robinson was the first inhabitant in the area whose name is known; around 1800 he had a cabin on the shores of Long Pond (now called Lake Ganoga), which is less than 0.4 miles (0.6 km) northwest of the park. The first development within the park was the construction of the Susquehanna and Tioga Turnpike, which was built from 1822 to 1827 between the Pennsylvania communities of Berwick in the south and Towanda in the north. The turnpike, which Pennsylvania Route 487 mostly follows through the park, had daily stagecoach service from 1827 to 1851; the northbound stagecoach left Berwick in the morning and stopped for lunch at the Long Pond Tavern on the lake about noon.The earliest settlers in what became the park were two squatters who built sawmills to make bed frames from cherry trees they cut for lumber.

Leopold believed that it was his duty to proclaim this miracle to the world, otherwise he would be \\"the most ungrateful creature\\". He was said to have described Wolfgang as \\"The miracle which God let be born in Salzburg.\\" Mozart biographer Wolfgang Hildesheimer has suggested that, at least in the case of Wolfgang, this venture was premature: \\"Too soon, [the] father dragged [the] son all over Western Europe for years. This continual change of scene would have worn out even a robust child...\\" However, there is little evidence to suggest that Wolfgang was physically harmed or musically hindered by these childhood exertions; it seems that he felt equal to the challenge from the start.Leopold wanted to begin the tour as soon as possible—the younger the children were, the more spectacular would be the demonstration of their gifts. The route he intended to take included southern Germany, the Austrian Netherlands, Paris, Switzerland and possibly northern Italy. The London leg was only added after urgings during the Paris visit, and the eventual Dutch trip was an unplanned detour. The plan was to take in as many princely European courts as possible, as well as the great cultural capitals—Leopold was relying on his professional musical network and on his more recent social contacts to obtain invitations from the royal courts. Practical assistance came from Hagenauer, whose trading connections in the major cities would supply the Mozarts with what were effectively banking facilities. These would enable them to obtain money en route, while waiting for the proceeds from their performances to accumulate.Wolfgang prepared for the tour by perfecting himself on the violin, which he had learned to play apparently... answer the following question: What is the last name of the person who wanted to start the tour right away?

At the same time, he refused to evacuate Saxony until its elector had renounced any claim to reparation. The Austrians wanted at least to retain Glatz, which they had in fact reconquered, but Frederick would not allow it.

Look up the sun requirements for your specific plant, and move them to a location that matches those requirements. Keep in mind that windows facing the south side of your house will receive the most light, while windows facing the north side will receive the least amount of light. Step 1: Research the specific sunlight requirements for the plant species you have. Different plants may have different light exposure needs, so it's important to adapt the plant's location to ensure its health. Step 2: Identify the windows in your house with the most suitable light exposure. Windows that face south tend to receive the most light throughout the day, whereas north-facing windows will receive less sunlight. Step 3: Move the plant to a location with the appropriate level of sunlight based on your research. This will help provide the optimal conditions for your plant to thrive. Step 4: Continuously monitor the health and growth of your plant. If you notice any problems or changes, reassess the sunlight conditions and adjust accordingly. Don't hesitate to experiment as needed since various factors may change the light exposure in your home. These steps ensure that the plant receives the amount of sunlight necessary for its health, and by adjusting the location based on the plant's specific requirements, it's more likely to thrive."},{"question":"The exercise is to decide whether the question accepts the proposed suggestion as a correct answer.

Further recognition came with the hanging of one of Fuller's paintings, Summer Breezes, at the Royal Academy in 1904. Other Australian artists whose works were hung at the same time included Rupert Bunny, E. Phillips Fox, Albert Fullwood, George Lambert, and Arthur Streeton. Fuller was the only woman painter to be represented. A critic writing in The West Australian observed:The work ... is essentially Australian in almost every detail. Standing in a sunlit Australian paddock, a lithesome Australian blonde holds her summer hat on against the rude caresses of an Australian breeze—a subject simple but grand in its simplicity ... Next to its suggestion of breezy sunshine and the incidental portrayal of willowy grace the picture is to be admired for its colour scheme ... The details of the picture disclose untiring care. By the time Summer Breezes was on display, Fuller had returned to Australia, not to her previous home in Melbourne but to Perth in Western Australia, where she joined her sister, Amy Fuller, who was a singer. Although only in her mid-thirties, Fuller's background made her \\"one of the most experienced artists in Western Australia at this time\\". For the next four years, she painted portraits, including one of Western Australian politician James George Lee Steere, undertaken posthumously from photographs and recollections of those who had known him. It was acquired by the gallery whose board he chaired. She also took on students, including French-Australian artist Kathleen O'Connor. Fuller's paintings from this period included A Golden Hour, described by the National Gallery of Australia as \\"a masterpiece ... giving us a gentle insight into the people, places and times that make up our history\\". The painting, an oil on canvas 109 cm (43 in) high and 135 cm (53 in) wide, portrays a woman and a man standing together in a rural setting in late afternoon, surrounded by grass, scattered gum trees, and Xanthorrhoea.

These adults owe an average of 5,178 (median 1,349). Debt in collections involves a nonmortgage bill—such as a credit card balance, medical or utility bill—that is more than 180 days past due and has been placed in collections. 5.3 percent of people with a credit file have a report of past due debt, indicating they are between 30 and 180 days late on a nonmortgage payment. Both debt in collections and debt past due are concentrated in the South.

FILE - In this May 9, 2012 file photo, a Visa credit card is tendered at the opening of the Superdry store in New York's Times Square. More than 35 percent of Americans have debts and unpaid bills that... (Associated Press) These consumers fall behind on credit cards or hospital bills. Their mortgages, auto loans or student debt pile up, unpaid. Even past-due gym membership fees or cellphone contracts can end up with a collection agency, potentially hurting credit scores and job prospects, said Caroline Ratcliffe, a senior fellow at the Washington-based think tank. \\"Roughly, every third person you pass on the street is going to have debt in collections,\\" Ratcliffe said. \\"It can tip employers' hiring decisions, or whether or not you get that apartment.\\" The study found that 35.1 percent of people with credit records had been reported to collections for debt that averaged 5,178, based on September 2013 records. The study points to a disturbing trend: The share of Americans in collections has remained relatively constant, even as the country as a whole has whittled down the size of its credit card debt since the official end of the Great Recession in the middle of 2009. As a share of people's income, credit card debt has reached its lowest level in more than a decade, according to the American Bankers Association. People increasingly pay off balances each month. Just 2.44 percent of card accounts are overdue by 30 days or more, versus the 15-year average of 3.82 percent. Yet roughly the same percentage of people are still getting reported for unpaid bills, according to the Urban Institute study performed in conjunction with researchers from the Consumer Credit Research Institute. Their figures nearly match the 36.5 percent of people in collections reported by a 2004 Federal Reserve analysis. All of this has reshaped the economy. The collections industry employs 140,000 workers who recover 50 billion each year, according to a separate study published this year by the Federal Reserve's Philadelphia bank branch. The delinquent debt is overwhelmingly concentrated in Southern and Western states. Texas cities have a large share of their populations being reported to collection agencies: Dallas (44.3 percent); El Paso (44.4 percent), Houston (43.7 percent), McAllen (51.7 percent) and San Antonio (44.5 percent). Almost half of Las Vegas residents— many of whom bore the brunt of the housing bust that sparked the recession— have debt in collections. Other Southern cities have a disproportionate number of their people facing debt collectors, including Orlando and Jacksonville, Florida; Memphis, Tennessee; Columbia, South Carolina; and Jackson, Mississippi. Other cities have populations that have largely managed to repay their bills on time. Just 20.1 percent of Minneapolis residents have debts in collection. Boston, Honolulu and San Jose, California, are similarly low. Only about 20 percent of Americans with credit records have any debt at all. Yet high debt levels don't always lead to more delinquencies, since the debt largely comes from mortgages. An average San Jose resident has 97,150 in total debt, with 84 percent of it tied to a mortgage. But because incomes and real estate values are higher in the technology hub, those residents are less likely to be delinquent. By contrast, the average person in the Texas city of McAllen has only 23,546 in debt, yet more than half of the population has debt in collections, more than anywhere else in the United States. The Urban Institute's Ratcliffe said that stagnant incomes are key to why some parts of the country are struggling to repay their debt. Wages have barely kept up with inflation during the five-year recovery, according to Labor Department figures. And a separate measure by Wells Fargo found that after-tax income fell for the bottom 20 percent of earners during the same period. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","response":"Over 35% of American adults have debts and unpaid bills that have been reported to collection agencies, with an average debt of 5,178, according to a study by the Urban Institute.

Movie plot title: Go Tell the Spartans Movie plot: It's July 1964 in the period when American troops were euphemistically termed \\"military advisors\\" in Vietnam. Major Asa Barker (Burt Lancaster) has been given this command: a poorly-manned outpost named Muc Wa in rural South Vietnam somewhere near the rural Da Nang to Phnom Penh (Cambodia) highway that a decade earlier had been the scene of a massacre of French soldiers during the First Indochina War. Barker is a weary infantry veteran in his third war (he served in the Pacific during World War II as well as in the Korean War), who provides veteran supervision to a cadre of advisors attached to a group of South Vietnamese who garrison the deserted village of Muc Wa.Barker, as a seasoned officer, knows that he cannot defend his position due to lack of numbers and the quality of his local troops. He is still obliged to carry out the orders of his superior, General Harnitz (Dolph Sweet), who sends Barker U.S. re-enforcements to appease him. His command consists of a handful of U.S. soldiers (encompassing the inexperienced, unhappy, idealistic and glory-seeking) and some reluctant former Vietnamese paddy farmers turned militiamen. Barker is a capable commander who has ended his career by having an affair with a senior officer's wife. He argues that the hamlet is deserted and has no importance, but sends a detachment from his command. The detachment is commanded by the brash but nervous Lt. Hamilton, and includes veteran Sergeant Oleonowski, who is suffering from battle fatigue, a drug-addicted medic, Cpl. Lincoln, and a young draftee, Cpl.

Upon seeing the price tag, they realize that it is within their budget, but they still feel reluctant about gifting something as mundane as a neck pillow. Jeffrey's girlfriend then suggests that they visit a local art shop, as Brian enjoys decorating his home with unique pieces from his travels. As they enter the shop, they are instantly captivated by the diverse collection of exquisite art pieces. They find a stunning painting of a world map made with layered canvases and vibrant colors, which they believe would perfectly encapsulate Brian's love for travel and adventure.

To determine the most accurate answer from the given options, let's consider each one and its plausibility. 1. Room temperature: Although bodies of water can influence the temperature of their surroundings, water itself does not inherently change room temperature. So, this option is not directly related to the effects of large amounts of water over time. 2. Thin blood: This option is not relevant to the impact of large amounts of water on the environment or other physical systems, as it pertains to biological processes within the human body. Thus, this is not the answer we are looking for. 3. Make parks: While water can be a feature of parks, it is not the primary factor for park creation. Parks are typically man-made leisure spaces that might incorporate water elements (e.g., lakes, ponds, fountains), but water is not the sole determinant for park formation. 4. Take several forms: Water can naturally exist in three states: solid (ice), liquid, and vapor (steam). Over long periods, water can evaporate, freeze, or melt, depending on environmental factors like temperature and pressure. Hence, this option is valid as it does demonstrate some of the possible impacts of water over time. 5. Move mountains: Over long periods, water erosion can alter and reshape landscapes, including mountains. Erosion can occur from natural processes like rainfall, rivers, and glacier movement. This process can slowly break down rocks and soil, gradually changing the shape and position of mountains over millions of years. Therefore, this option is also a valid consideration. Based on the options provided and reasoning process, the most accurate options are: - Take several forms - Move mountains While both options can occur due to large amounts of water over long periods, \\"move mountains\\" highlights the transformative power of water on Earth's surface and illustrates water's ability to shape our planet's landscapes."},{"question":"(CNN) -- \\"You are obviously, to me, always going to be The Dude,\\" Piers Morgan said to Jeff Bridges, referring to the actor's title role in the 1998 Coen brothers movie, \\"The Big Lebowski.\\" The Oscar-winning actor is a guest on Thursday's \\"Piers Morgan Tonight.\\" Bridges, who took a year off from movies to focus on his music career, will release his self-titled album August 16. \\"You're The Dude,\\" continued Morgan. \\"To millions of people around the world, Jeff Bridges, you will always be The Dude.

The ideology is not as perverse as in those films Collins made later. However, my main misgivings about the film are that it is implausible and quite frankly boring for a long time. The whole concept of an ex-SAS man joining terrorists for no particular reason isn't very convincing and you can't help wondering why a group of highly organized terrorists (who later become pretty clueless) fall for it. The film starts with a pretty powerful scene but then meanders for quite a long time building up towards the great finale. Overall, I think Who dares wins could have been an interesting 45 minutes episode of The Professionals but the story doesn't carry a feature film. Although reasonably successful at the time this film initiated the demise of Collins' career who in the eighties mainly made cheap and dubious soldier-of-fortune or army films.

I wanted to give society a chance to determine if it should change itself.” Beginning in June, Snowden leaked documents to the Post and The Guardian newspaper in Britain outlining the government's collection of of bulk Internet and phone records, an activity that has grown dramatically in 12 years since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. President Barack Obama hinted Friday that he would consider some changes to NSA's bulk collection of Americans' phone records to address the public's concern about privacy. His comments came in a week in which a federal judge declared the NSA's collection program probably was unconstitutional. A presidential advisory panel has suggested 46 changes to NSA operations. The effects of Snowden's revelations have been evident in the courts, Congress, Silicon Valley and capitals around the world, where even U.S. allies have reacted angrily to reports of U.S. monitoring of their leaders' cellphone calls. Brazil and members of the European Union are considering ways to better protect their data and U.S. technology companies such as Google, Microsoft and Yahoo are looking at ways to block the collection of data by the government. Snowden's disclosures have led him to be accused of treason by many members of government, including House Intelligence Committee chairman Mike Rogers, R-Mich. When asked why he felt entitled to take on the responsibility of leaking the information, Snowden replied \\"They elected me. The overseers. \\"[Senate Intelligence Committee Chair] Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) elected me when she asked softball questions .. Mike Rogers elected me when he kept these programs hidden. . . . The FISA court elected me when they decided to legislate from the bench on things that were far beyond the mandate of what that court was ever intended to do. The system failed comprehensively, and each level of oversight, each level of responsibility that should have addressed this, abdicated their responsibility.\\" Snowden also shrugged off accusations of disloyalty. \\"The oath of allegiance is not an oath of secrecy,\\" he told the Post. \\"That is an oath to the Constitution. That is the oath that I kept that [NSA Director] Keith Alexander and [Director of National Intelligence] James Clapper did not. \\"I am not trying to bring down the NSA, I am working to improve the NSA,\\" Snowden continued. \\"I am still working for the NSA right now. They are the only ones who don’t realize it.\\" Asked about the Snowden interview, White House spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden told the Associated Press: \\"Mr. Snowden faces felony charges here in the United States and should be returned to the U.S. as soon as possible, where he will be afforded due process and all the protections of our criminal justice system.\\" The Associated Press contributed to this report.

She notices that all signs indicate that Milshen is experiencing adiabatic cooling. She doesn't see any indications of adiabatic cooling in Limlen, though. This is important information to relay in her broadcast later tonight to the citizens of both countries and she is glad she noticed it. But I can use this background: Adiabatic cooling occurs when one or more of three possible lifting agents – cyclonic/frontal, convective, or orographic – causes a parcel of air containing invisible water vapor to rise and cool to its dew point, the temperature at which the air becomes saturated. The main mechanism behind this process is adiabatic cooling. As the air is cooled to its dew point and becomes saturated, water vapor normally condenses to form cloud drops. This condensation normally occurs on cloud condensation nuclei such as salt or dust particles that are small enough to be held aloft by normal circulation of the air.Frontal and cyclonic lift occur when stable air is forced aloft at weather fronts and around centers of low pressure by a process called convergence. Warm fronts associated with extratropical cyclones tend to generate mostly cirriform and stratiform clouds over a wide area unless the approaching warm airmass is unstable, in which case cumulus congestus or cumulonimbus clouds will usually be embedded in the main precipitating cloud layer. Cold fronts are usually faster moving and generate a narrower line of clouds which are mostly stratocumuliform, cumuliform, or cumulonimbiform depending on the stability of the warm air mass just ahead of the front. What is an answer for this question: Is the air more or less saturated in Limlen?","response":"Based on the given information, the air in Limlen does not show any indications of adiabatic cooling. This suggests that the air in Limlen is likely less saturated compared to Milshen, where adiabatic cooling is taking place. In the case of Milshen, adiabatic cooling is occurring due to one or more of the three possible lifting agents – cyclonic/frontal, convective, or orographic. This is leading to a parcel of air containing water vapor to rise and cool to its dew point, the temperature at which air becomes saturated. As the air reaches its dew point and becomes saturated, water vapor condenses to form cloud drops, typically happening on cloud condensation nuclei such as salt or dust particles. However, in Limlen, there are no observed occurrences of adiabatic cooling, which implies that the abovementioned process is not taking place. Consequently, the air is not cooling down to its dew point, and no significant condensation is happening to increase the saturation level in the air. Thus, it can be inferred that the air in Limlen is less saturated compared to the air in Milshen, where adiabatic cooling is happening. It is essential for the meteorologist to communicate this difference in weather patterns and saturation levels between the two countries in her broadcast. This information can help the citizens of both countries to understand the expected weather conditions in their respective regions and make any necessary adjustments in their plans or activities accordingly."},{"question":"This question has options.

In writing Young Modern, Johns tried to make the music sound very simple, despite a complex musical structure. The lyrics were written after the music was created, sometimes as late as the day of recording. As Johns dreads writing lyrics, he suggested that the band could produce an instrumental album at some stage in the future. Johns is the band's primary songwriter, and notes that while Joannou and Gillies do not have significant influence on what he writes, they are key to the band's overall sound. For that album, Hamilton co-wrote four songs with Johns including the APRA Award-winning \\"Straight Lines\\". Joannou believed that Young Modern was simpler than Diorama but \\"still as complex underneath with simple pop song elements\\". He said that much of the band's success resulted from trying to push themselves harder in recording and writing. Self-producing has allowed the band to do so without the pressures of a record label.Gillies notes that Silverchair will often \\"run the risk of losing fans\\" with their work, and this was evident in the changes in musical direction in Diorama and Young Modern. However, he described this as a good thing, describing the fact \\"that we haven't been pigeonholed, and people really don't know what to expect\\" as one of the attractive elements of the band. Despite the ups and downs of success at a young age, Gillies says the band \\"appreciate what we've achieved and what we've got\\" in their careers. The band have received six APRA Awards with Johns winning three songwriting awards at the 2008 ceremony. Answer:","response":"The name of the band that has received six APRA Awards is Silverchair."},{"question":"Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the person Adell helped off the horse? In 1878 a hardened American gunfighter arrives in a small town in the foothills of the Canadian Rockies, a place that doesn't understand or appreciate the brutal code of the American Wild West. Gunslinger Sean Lafferty, known as the Montana Kid, has a bounty on his head for killing eleven people across the western United States. He arrives in town on his horse, riding backwards, bound, with a noose around his neck, and dragging the broken tree branch over which a group had tried to hang him on the American side of the border. After being helped off his horse by a young Chinese girl named Adell, he begins to explore the town, starting with the town general store. After leaving the store, he finds his horse gone and accuses Jack, the blacksmith, of stealing it, even though Jack was simply replacing the horse's damaged shoes. After unsuccessfully trying to intimidate the blacksmith, the Montana Kid decides to call him out. Since the blacksmith has no gun, though, Sean can't shoot him because the Kid lives by a code of ethics that prevents him from killing unarmed men. When she witnesses this, Jane Taylor, one of the townsfolk, says the Kid can have her broken gun (to fix and give to Jack) if he builds her a windmill. Sean proceeds to go with her and stays in a sod house at her farm, alternately working on the windmill and repairing the gun. After a few days, however, the Kid begins to develop feelings toward Jane while also becoming friends with the townsfolk. In the meantime, a roaming band of American bounty hunters crosses into Canada and heads for the town to claim the price on Sean's head. They terrorize a camp of Chinese railroad workers to find out his whereabouts. Answer:","response":"The full name of the person Adell helped off the horse is Sean Lafferty, also known as the Montana Kid."},{"question":"Summarize this article: Tap the Google Drive app icon, which resembles a blue, green, and yellow triangle.

Please remove spaces between words.","response":"TheoutrageagainstthebullyingtacticsoftheEmergencyFleetCorporationspreadtootherunions. The outrage against the bullying tactics of the Emergency Fleet Corporation spread to other unions as they felt the effects of the heavy-handed approaches taken by the corporation to control and suppress labor activity. This not only caused tremendous tension among the unions but also led to a surge of solidarity across a wide range of industries and labor organizations. At the time, unions were a powerful force for representing the interests and rights of workers. They had achieved significant milestones in the fight for better working conditions, fair wages, and reasonable hours by collectively bargaining and pushing for reforms. The aggressive tactics employed by the Emergency Fleet Corporation, a government-owned entity established to build and manage the nation's shipping fleet during World War I, were seen as a direct threat to these hard-won gains. In response to the perceived targeting and victimization of unions by the Emergency Fleet Corporation, many other unions opted to take a principled stance against this abuse of power. They believed that by supporting one another and demonstrating a united front, they would be better equipped to face the challenges presented by this powerful entity. Consequently, a broader resistance against the Emergency Fleet Corporation's tactics was mounted, with numerous labor organizations rallying to defend their collective interests. As the outrage against the Emergency Fleet Corporation's bullying tactics spread to other unions, industrial action became a common occurrence. There were various protests, strikes, and acts of civil disobedience staged in defiance of the corporation's blatant disregard for workers' rights. These collective actions not only generated national and international attention on the plight of the affected workers but also put pressure on the Emergency Fleet Corporation to reconsider its methods and rectify the situation. Ultimately, the widespread outrage and mobilization of various unions against the coercion and abuse perpetuated by the Emergency Fleet Corporation served to protect labor interests and preserve the rights of workers. It also demonstrated the importance of solidarity among labor organizations, as this unity was instrumental in challenging the destructive policies that sought to undermine them. In conclusion, the outrage against the bullying tactics of the Emergency Fleet Corporation that spread to other unions was a crucial turning point in the labor movement's struggle for fair treatment and respect. By standing together and opposing these oppressive measures, unions were able to amplify their voices and successfully resist the heavy-handed tactics of powerful entities."},{"question":"Build a movie plot around this: What is being signified when the entire universe is shown glowing very brightly then disappearing? The end of the world A:","response":"Title: The Last Radiance Genre: Sci-fi/Adventure/Drama Plot: In the near future, Earth receives an unprecedented cosmic signal termed \\"The Luminous Entity\\" that forecasts doom through an intense burst of light, resulting in the cosmic event of the universe glowing brightly before disappearing. This event would signify the end of not just Earth, but the entire universe. As panic and chaos engulf the world, space agencies, governments, and scientists from all countries are forced to collaborate in an effort to prevent this catastrophic event. Our protagonist, Dr. Ada Lovelace, a renowned astrophysicist, recognizes the signal as a potential message, not merely a threat. She embarks on a quest to decipher the meaning of this cryptic message, believing it to hold the key to the survival of the universe. As governments and private space programs from around the world race against time to evacuate segments of humanity to a new potential safe haven, a planet known as Kepler-452b, a distant world that remains unaffected by the Luminous Entity, Ada forms an eclectic team of experts comprising of an ex-military strategist, a genius hacker, and an archaeologist who specializes in ancient civilizations. Together, Ada's team uncovers surprising evidence that the Luminous Entity is a cosmic phenomenon that was previously encountered by an ancient civilization that seemingly vanished from Earth several millennia ago. The ancient civilization had left behind a complex network of hidden artifacts and structures around the world, encoded with secrets to help humanity communicate with the Luminous Entity in order to save the universe from a repetitive cycle of destruction and creation. As humanity scrambles to chart its way to the stars and find a new home in Kepler-452b, Ada's team must decipher the ancient codes, unravel the mysteries surrounding the Luminous Entity, and ultimately confront the colossal cosmic being to plead for the existence of the universe. The climax of the movie sees the deciphering of the final message, unlocking an interstellar portal that allows the team to travel to the center of the Luminous Entity. As the cosmic being absorbs the knowledge and emotions of the human representatives, it acknowledges their determination to protect the universe. Empathizing with the resilience of humanity and its sincere desire to grow and evolve, the Luminous Entity halts the process of destruction. In the final act, as society is left to face the impact caused by panic and chaos on Earth, humanity turns a new leaf, having learned the importance of unity, cooperation, and the pursuit of knowledge. With the cosmic balance restored and the universe saved from destruction, the memory of the Luminous Entity lives on as a reminder of the power of compassion, unity, and the human spirit. The Last Radiance is a compelling story that blends cosmic forces and human emotions to explore the limits of human potential, the importance of solidarity, and the undying essence of hope in the face of seemingly insurmountable challenges"},{"question":"Q: In this task, you are given a sentence and a question, you would be asked to create the answer which is contained in the sentence provided.

Are Fritz Lang and Christophe Gans from the same country? Answer:","response":"Fritz Lang and Christophe Gans are not from the same country. They are both filmmakers known for their work in the cinema industry, but they come from different European countries. Fritz Lang, born Friedrich Christian Anton Lang, was an Austrian-German filmmaker who was born on December 5, 1890, in Vienna, Austria. Lang is considered one of the pioneers of German Expressionist cinema and directed several influential films during the early 20th century, including the groundbreaking science fiction epic, \\"Metropolis\\" (1927) and the crime thriller, \\"M\\" (1931). Lang's career spanned both the silent and sound eras in film. He later moved to the United States to escape the Nazi regime and continued working in Hollywood, where he directed film noirs and crime dramas such as \\"Scarlet Street\\" (1945) and \\"The Big Heat\\" (1953). On the other hand, Christophe Gans is a French film director, producer, and screenwriter. Born on March 11, 1960, in Antibes, France, Gans is particularly known for his work in the horror and fantasy genres. He made his feature directorial debut with the film \\"Crying Freeman\\" (1995), based on a Japanese manga. Gans gained international recognition with his work on the movie \\"Brotherhood of the Wolf\\" (2001), a French historical action film with elements of horror and fantasy. He is also known for directing the film adaptation of the popular survival horror video game, \\"Silent Hill\\" (2006). While both filmmakers have had an impact on the cinema industry and the genres in which they've worked, they are from different countries and cultural backgrounds, with Lang hailing from Austria and Gans from France.

I was given a mere partial refund but I will think it twice before ordering again through Amazon. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? Answer:","response":"This review undoubtedly depicts the product in an unflattering light. A thorough analysis of the review reveals several negative aspects mentioned by the reviewer that contribute to this unfavorable representation of the product. Here are some key points that elucidate the unflattering portrayal: 1. Defective item: The reviewer initially received a defective product, which already establishes a negative perception of the item. Consumers anticipate receiving a fully functional and high-quality product when making a purchase. However, in this case, the delivered item did not meet the buyer's expectations, leading to dissatisfaction and disappointment. 2. Replacement issues: While the reviewer attempted to resolve the problem by requesting a replacement, they unfortunately faced another problem as the replacement item arrived with missing parts. This further aggravates the dissatisfaction and implies that this might not be a one-off issue, but rather a consistent flaw in the manufacturing or quality control process of the product. 3. Partial refund: The reviewer's dissatisfaction is exacerbated by the fact that they were only granted a partial refund upon returning the defective item. Ideally, a full refund should be provided in such cases to compensate for the inconvenience caused to the customer. A partial refund may lead the reviewer to feel that they were not adequately compensated for their troubles and that their customer rights were not fully respected by the seller. 4. Caution with future purchases: The effect of these negative experiences has proven significant enough for the reviewer to reconsider purchasing through Amazon in the future. This statement denotes a loss of trust in the platform and serves as a warning to other potential buyers who come across this review. As a result, the review clearly paints the product in an unflattering light, highlighting the negative experiences of the reviewer. These experiences, which entail receiving a defective product, encountering difficulties with the replacement item, and being inadequately compensated, generate a sense of dissatisfaction and disappointment. Consequently, any potential buyers reading this review may be deterred from purchasing the product, given the unfavorable impression it receives through this evaluation."},{"question":"Read the following article and select the best answer.

In an outcome few could have imagined several weeks ago, Jones defeated controversial Republican candidate Roy Moore, who had the backing of President Donald Trump. In the wake of Jones' victory, Democrats are more confident about success in next year's congressional midterm elections, and Republicans are looking for a way to rebound. Late Tuesday, Jones paid tribute to the voters and staffers who supported him in his longshot victory over Moore. \\"This campaign has been about common courtesy and decency and making sure everyone in this state, regardless of which ZIP code you live in, is going to get a fair shake in life!\\" he told supporters. Moore was unable to overcome allegations of sexual misconduct stemming back decades involving several women who were teenagers at the time while Moore was in his 30s. Moore stopped short of conceding the race, however, saying, \\"We have been painted in an unfavorable and unfaithful light. We have been put in a hole, if you will, and it reminds me of a [Bible] passage in Psalms 40, 'I waited patiently for the Lord.' That is what we have got to do.\\" Moore had the full backing of the president in the final days of the campaign after Trump initially held back his endorsement in the wake of the allegations against Moore. The president responded Wednesday to questions at the White House about the Alabama race and said that he had hoped for a different result. \\"I wish we would have gotten the seat. A lot of Republicans feel differently. They are very happy with the way it turned out,\\" he said. \\"But as the leader of the party, I would have liked to have the seat. I want to endorse the people who are running.\\" Jones won in large part because of a strong Democratic turnout, especially by African-Americans. Moore was hurt by a depressed Republican turnout and a write-in campaign that drained away votes. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Containing very graphic depictions death-scenes; A parachute that doesn't open *smack* guys body on the floor. A guy being eaten by a Lion *chomp* teeth in the throat. And a guy being run over by a speedboat *zoom* bloody corpse going down. But besides gore, this flick also contains some brilliant (and stunningly beautiful) scenes, filmed in the gray fisher's town that is Vlissingen; Thousands of rosebuds flying over the screen, in a somewhat irrelevant part of the movie, a beautiful (holy) woman putting flowers in a milk-can, surrounded by slabs of blood-dripping meat and a steamy love scene between two male characters, in a graveyard. The story is concluded in a frantic, but fulfilling 10 minutes, that don't disappoint, and will leave you sighing a breath of relief. Of course with the pros come the cons, Some special-effects are too over-the-top, and are obviously done to see how far Verhoeven could push the gore-factor (e.g. the several eyeballs hanging out of their sockets). Also, while the two lead actors, (Jeroen Krabbé and Renée Soutendijk), do an excellent job of breathing life into their characters, the character of Herman (portrayed by the rather un-charming Thom Hoffman) just feels enormously underdeveloped, making him hard to care for, even after his tragic death. I've done my best to give you a slight idea of what to expect of this amazing movie, and as you can see, it's not easily summed up in words. So do yourself a favor, if you happen to find this movie somewhere, watch it ! And enjoy the unique style and substance of this masterpiece. How would you describe the sentiment of this review?","response":"The sentiment of this review is predominantly positive with some noticeable critiques. The reviewer appears to greatly appreciate and admire the movie as they provide detailed praise for its graphic depictions, innovative scenes, beautiful cinematography, and a fulfilling ending. They laud the performances of the lead actors, Jeroen Krabbé and Renée Soutendijk, and express their fascination for the creative, bold, and over-the-top ideas of the director, Verhoeven. This admiration culminates in their recommendation for others to watch and appreciate this distinctive movie, underlining their overall positive sentiment. However, amidst this praise, the reviewer also sheds light on some criticisms that add a touch of ambivalence to their sentiment. They critique some overly excessive special effects and point out an underdeveloped character. Specifically, they feel the character Herman, played by Thom Hoffman, lacks depth and hence is difficult to empathize with, particularly during a grave moment in the film – his death. These aspects suggest dissatisfaction and slightly temper the overwhelmingly positive tone of the review. Despite these points of criticism, the final sentiment leans more towards the positive in appreciating the movie's impactful and iconoclastic style and substance. The reviewer is clearly impressed by the director’s audacious approach in delivering graphic and beautifully filmed scenes, and they encourage others to indulge in this cinematic experience, implying favorability. In essence, the sentiment of this review is largely positive but with mild criticisms, demarcating a balanced and thoughtful critique. A potent mix of admiration for innovation and insistence on character and plot development mark this review – notable are the signs of a reviewer who feels delight and disappointment in roughly equal measure – but ultimately, their appreciation and endorsement of the movie wins out."},{"question":"Q:Generate a question that has the following answer: a porn shop for the following movie plot: Childhood friends Olly Pickering and Murray go their separate ways when Olly goes to university.

The coming days are expected to bring significant precipitation, raising concerns for localized flooding and posing a risk to residents living in flood-prone areas. In this article, we'll outline important safety tips and precautions that should be taken during the inclement weather. Step 1: Understanding the Warning The warning was issued by the Meteorological Office, who expect increased rainfall throughout the Welsh region. Persistent downpours can lead to adverse impacts on infrastructure, transportation, and daily living. Citizens should remain updated on weather forecasts and be prepared to adapt their plans accordingly to mitigate potential safety risks. Step 2: Paying Attention to Flood-Prone Areas Areas more prone to flooding during heavy rains should be closely monitored. Residents living near rivers, low-lying regions, and drainage systems ought to exercise caution and be on the lookout for rising water levels or signs of flooding. In case of emergency, familiarize yourself with evacuation routes and locations of emergency shelters. Step 3: Preparing Your Home To minimize potential damage to your property, take the necessary precautions early. Clear gutters and drainage systems, as well as trimming any loose branches from nearby trees to reduce the possibility of water or wind damage. Ensure all doors and windows are sealed correctly to prevent water ingress. Step 4: Preparing an Emergency Kit In case of a power outage or the need to evacuate, having an emergency kit on hand can be invaluable. It should include essential items such as bottled water, non-perishable food, a flashlight, batteries, a first-aid kit, important documents, and medications, among other necessities. Don't forget to include supplies for your pets. Step 5: Being Cautious on the Roads If traveling is necessary during heavy rainfall, exercise extra caution on the roads. Reduced visibility and puddled water can make driving conditions hazardous, increasing the risk of accidents. Slow down while driving, maintain a safe distance from other vehicles, avoid flooded roads, and be watchful for debris or fallen branches. Step 6: Staying Updated with Weather Alerts In times of heavy rain and potential flooding, it's essential to remain informed with up-to-date weather information. Follow your local news stations or official weather websites for developments and advisories. When updating your community through social media or other platforms, ensure the information is accurate and comes from reliable sources to dispel any misconceptions or false alarms.

Sadness... How would the sentiment of this tweet be described?","response":"The sentiment of this tweet can be described as a mixture of regret, sadness, and disappointment. It portrays an emotional experience of an individual who has unintentionally lost something valuable to them - in this case, a voicemail that they wanted to keep. This tweet serves multiple purposes: it communicates the user's feelings and shares their experience so that others can empathize with their situation. 1. Regret: The tweet starts with \\"I just realized I deleted a voicemail,\\" which highlights the realization of an unintentional action. The individual indicates that the voicemail was something they truly wanted to hold onto, suggesting that they deeply regret their mistake and wish they could reverse the action. 2. Sadness: The tweet includes a direct expression of sadness—\\"Sadness...\\"—that functions as a reflection of their emotional state. This explicit statement of sadness illustrates a sense of vulnerability as they share their emotions with their followers on social media. 3. Disappointment: In conjunction with the other emotions, the sentiment of disappointment can be inferred as well. The user feels let down by the loss of the voicemail, as it was something they \\"really really wanted to keep.\\" This disappointment may not only be directed at themselves for accidentally deleting the voicemail but also at the situation that led to the loss in the first place.

Options: a ) 17 sec , b ) 12 sec , c ) 16 sec , d ) 15 sec , e ) 20 sec","response":"To solve this problem, let's first find the speeds of both trains. For the first train, speed (S1) = distance (D1) ÷ time (T1) S1 = 200m ÷ 10s = 20m/s For the second train, speed (S2) = distance (D2) ÷ time (T2) S2 = 200m ÷ 15s = 13.33m/s (approx.) Since they are moving in opposite directions, we can add their speeds to find the relative speed (RS). RS = S1 + S2 = 20m/s + 13.33m/s = 33.33m/s The total distance (TD) covered by both trains when crossing each other will be the sum of their lengths. TD = 200m + 200m = 400m Now, we will use the formula time (T) = distance (D) ÷ speed (S) to find the time needed for the trains to cross each other. T = TD ÷ RS = 400m ÷ 33.33m/s = 12s (approx.)

Some historically significant Baptist doctrinal documents include the 1689 London Baptist Confession of Faith, 1742 Philadelphia Baptist Confession, the 1833 New Hampshire Baptist Confession of Faith, the Southern Baptist Convention's Baptist Faith and Message, and written church covenants which some individual Baptist churches adopt as a statement of their faith and beliefs. Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What belief was not shared by doctrines?","response":"It is not possible to identify a specific belief that was not shared by doctrines, as doctrines can vary significantly across different denominations and religious traditions. However, we can point out some beliefs that are not commonly shared across the mentioned Baptist doctrinal documents: 1. Infant baptism: Many Baptist doctrines emphasize believer's baptism, which is the practice of baptizing individuals who have consciously professed faith in Jesus Christ. This contrasts with the practice of infant baptism, which is followed by several other Christian denominations. 2. Predestination: While some Baptist doctrines, such as the 1689 London Baptist Confession of Faith, include the belief in predestination, not all Baptist traditions adhere to this belief. The notion of predestination asserts that God predetermines the eternal destiny of some individuals to salvation, while others are predestined for damnation. 3. Hierarchical church structure: Baptist doctrines often emphasize the autonomy of the local church and the priesthood of all believers, which contrasts with the hierarchical structures found in other Christian denominations, such as the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church. 4. Apostolic succession: Baptist doctrines generally do not recognize or emphasize the importance of maintaining an unbroken line of succession from the original twelve apostles through the bishops, as some other Christian denominations do. These are just a few examples of beliefs that may not be shared by all Baptist doctrines, demonstrating the diversity of belief even within a single Christian denomination."},{"question":"Title: poor Milton Product review: Interest in Milton has waned in American universities, and I can't help but think that THE RIVERSIDE MILTON tossed him into an eternity more boring than anything his prose could have ever created.I understand that this text is \\"academic\\" so its asinine price and density are justified.

James Bamford, writing in the New York Times, said Snowden told him the intercepts included communications of Arab- and Palestinian-Americans whose relatives in Israel and the Palestinian territories could become targets based on the information. 'It's one of the biggest abuses we’ve seen,' Bamford quoted Snowden as saying. Former U.S. intelligence analyst Edward Snowden has accused the U.S. National Security Agency of routinely passing private, unedited communications of Americans to Israel. Snowden said the material was routinely transferred to Unit 8200, a secretive Israeli intelligence organization.

Leaked by Snowden and first reported by the British newspaper the Guardian, it said the material included 'unevaluated and unminimized transcripts, gists, facsimiles, telex, voice and Digital Network Intelligence metadata and content.' The memorandum indicates the data is routinely sent in raw form, without editing out names or other personally identifiable information, Bamford said. He noted allegations in Israel by veterans of Unit 8200, who in a letter to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week accused the agency of using information it collects to politically persecute innocent Palestinians.

Whether he was escaping from a locked box or making things disappear and reappear, he surely was entertaining. People thought that he must truly have some supernatural powers, but in fact, what Harry really had was drive. Harry was born in Budapest, Hungary, in 1874. His real name was Ehrich Weiss, the third of five children. His family moved to Wisconsin not long after his birth and when he was nine, he was tying ropes all over his backyard and learning amazing tricks to show his friends and neighbors. He visited the local locksmith, and when he had reached his teens he could pick almost any lock that was made. He also learned how to do card tricks. He and his brother, Theo, would often entertain at local parties and clubs for extra money. When Ehrich was 16, he came across a book that would actually change his life: the biography of France's greatest magician, Jean Eugene Robert-Houdin. It showed Ehrich that his hobby of magic and tricks could also be a career. Immediately, he changed his name to Harry Houdini. He and Theo headed out to make a living as magicians. In 1893, they performed at the Chicago World's Fair, and after that they traveled around giving magic shows for anyone willing to listen and pay. Theo grew restless, however, as the jobs became scarce, so he left. His timing was perfect since Harry had just fallen in love with a lovely woman named Bess who was just the right size for slipping in and out of the trunk they used in their magic tricks. They married immediately and then off they went, traveling with circuses and other road shows. Harry learned more and more tricks and spent much of his time reading and studying all kinds of locks, especially handcuffs.

We have the equation: 14727 * r + 150 = 14802 * r Now, our goal is to find the value of 'r'. To do that, let's first move all the 'r' terms to one side of the equation and the other numbers to the opposite side. So, let's subtract 14727 * r from both sides: 14727 * r + 150 - 14727 * r = 14802 * r - 14727 * r This simplifies to: 150 = (14802 - 14727) * r Now, calculate the difference between 14802 and 14727: 150 = 75 * r To find 'r', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 75: 150 / 75 = 75 * r / 75 This simplifies to: 2 = r So, the value of 'r' is 2!"},{"question":"Write an article that answers the following question: How many years did the period of low-intensity warfare last?","response":"Title: Understanding the Length and Impact of the Period of Low-Intensity Warfare Low-intensity warfare, also recognized as low intensity conflict, small wars, or unconventional warfare, involves the military strategies which may be applied when conflicts turn non-conventional. The warfare may encompass insurgency, counter-insurgency, terror campaigns, guerrilla warfare, information warfare, and other sub-versions. In examining the extent of this term, it is crucial to keep in mind that low-intensity warfare is not a description of a time span or an era, but instead an approach or type of conflict. Therefore, periods of low-intensity warfare have occurred and continue to occur intermittently throughout history—rather than over a quantifiable span of years—depending on the specific historical circumstances being discussed. From a historical perspective, low-intensity warfare can trace its roots back to the earliest formations of humans and tribes, as smaller factions have always had to rely on irregular tactics to challenge larger, more powerful entities. Periods of low-intensity warfare translated into guerrilla tactics used by the Roman Empire's foes, extended to the irregular tactics used during the American Revolutionary War, and carried on into the nature of global modern conflicts in regions such as the Middle East and Africa. Therefore, putting a time-stamp on the period of low-intensity warfare can be challenging. However, from the perspective of modern warfare, low-intensity conflicts became more recognizable with the onset of the Cold War. The term was employed as a catch-all phrase for various conflicts that did not escalate to full-scale conventional warfare. The Cold War, which spanned roughly from 1947 to 1991, was peppered with several such examples, from the Vietnam War and the Korean War, to various proxy wars in Africa, Central America, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. Consequently, it can be inferred from these instances that the time frame for low-intensity warfare has been prolonged over the centuries and varies depending on region and conflict at hand. Particularly in contemporary contexts, the length of this type of warfare is typically endured over an extended duration, as reducing an insurgency or settling a guerilla conflict can take many years, if not decades. For instance, the conflict in Afghanistan is a prime modern example of low-intensity warfare, which has been ongoing for over 40 years. Moreover, the rise of transnational terrorism and global extremism in the late 20th and 21st centuries has led to a new era of low-intensity warfare, marked by conflicts like the War on Terror post-9/11 or the ongoing battles against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. In conclusion, the question of the duration of the period of low-intensity warfare does not have a definitive numerical answer because the term relates more to the nature of a conflict, rather than a specific time period. However, it can be surmised that episodes of low-intensity warfare have been recurring throughout human history and continue to occupy a significant role in our understanding of modern conflict, warfare, and international relations. The impacts, repercussions, and potential future developments of low-intensity warfare will require a deeper understanding and multi-dimensional approaches to peace, conflict resolution, and diplomacy."},{"question":"HomeProductsYodotRecoveryforAndroid™LGOptimusGProRecovery Generate a sentence using the above characters:","response":"Once upon a time, Yodot, a robot, helped his friend L.G.

The friend had a habit of looking at everything positively that happened in his life and saying \\"This is good\\". One day the king and his friend were out hunting. The friend would prepare the guns for the king. The friend did something wrong in preparing one of the guns, and after the gun from his friend, the king fired it and his thumb was blown off.

But it can certainly be a heck of a lot of fun. During my days as an inmate in Bridges House at the University of New Brunswick, I shared this space with about 99 other testosterone-addled 'young adults' whose charming tendency to get completely out of hand was barely held in check by the rod of authority of the Don and Resident Fellow. This is not to say that these two worthies weren't good at their jobs; more accurately, their task was more akin to herding cats -- fairly obtuse, barely socialized cats. Given the state of controlled chaos that existed, it wasn't unusual for little conflicts to arise from time to time. Being rather physically small and odd, I came in for a certain amount of abuse from someone called Scut, a large and obnoxious Newfie (hmmm, that's like saying that water is wet). I can't remember what it was he did to me, but it was serious enough that I decided to get my own back. It's been said that revenge is a dish best enjoyed cold. I think revenge is a dish best enjoyed in secret with no chance of counter-revenge to spoil the occasion. And so it was that I laid my plans against Scut. The occasion and place were set.

'We must hold our military to a higher standard.' The military conducted a thorough investigation into the matter, leading to the identification of the four Marines involved in the video. They were court-martialed and subsequently found guilty of desecration of remains and other charges related to the misconduct. The Marines were dishonorably discharged and sentenced to serve time in military prison. In the weeks following the incident, public opinion and debate about the actions of the Marines remained divisive. Some, like Dana Loesch and Bill Maher, continued to support their behavior, arguing that it was an understandable, albeit tasteless, expression of anger and frustration after years of combat. Others were appalled by the dishonorable acts, believing it counterproductive to the mission's goals and damaging to America's global reputation. Veterans organizations and military officials released statements, condemning the actions. They emphasized the importance of maintaining respect for the fallen, regardless of their affiliation. This event led to increased awareness of PTSD and the mental health needs of soldiers returning from combat. The U.S. military also implemented additional training on appropriate conduct and respecting cultural sensitivities while deployed in foreign countries. The story sparked discussions on how war affects the human spirit, the standards to which soldiers should be held, and how such incidents impact global relations. As time passed, public attention eventually shifted to other pressing issues. Nevertheless, the incident remained a cautionary tale for future military personnel and a reminder of the complex challenges faced by those who serve in warzones."},{"question":"Answer the following question: The fruit harvest was awesome this year, so Mary decided to experiment by candying some raspberries, apricots and apples.

Lactic acid is a waste product of this process. Our muscles perform lactic acid fermentation during strenuous exercise, since oxygen cannot be delivered to the muscles quickly enough. The buildup of lactic acid is believed to make your muscles sore after exercise. Bacteria that produce lactic acid are used to make cheese and yogurt. The lactic acid causes the proteins in milk to thicken. Lactic acid also causes tooth decay, because bacteria use the sugars in your mouth for energy. I am facing a new situation today: Tony and Greg are brothers. They are currently in the kitchen eating a snack together. Greg is eating a stalk of celery while Tony is eating out of a bowl of candy. Tony remarks that he doesn't know how Greg enjoys such a bland snack. Greg just gives Tony an angry glare before getting up to go into the living room. On the living room table, Greg finds a glass of milk and a bowl of milk. The glass of milk has started to get thick, but the bowl of milk appears to be still fresh.

As mentioned in the background article, lactic acid is known to cause tooth decay. On the other hand, Greg is eating celery, which is a much less sugary and acidic snack compared to candy. As a result, there will be less sugar available for the oral bacteria to produce lactic acid, contributing to a lower risk of tooth decay for Greg."},{"question":"Given the question: Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it?

The answer is:","response":"Karan Kapoor and Geoffrey Kendal both have a strong connection to India in terms of their theatrical performances. Geoffrey Kendal was a renowned British actor and theater director who is best known for his work in India. He set up theatre company Shakespeareana in 1947, which was dedicated to bringing Shakespeare's plays to Indian audiences. Geoffrey traveled extensively across India with his troupe, performing numerous plays and becoming a celebrated figure in the Indian theatre community. Karan Kapoor, on the other hand, is an Indian film actor and former model, born to the famous actors Shashi Kapoor and Jennifer Kendal. Jennifer Kendal is the daughter of Geoffrey Kendal, making Karan Kapoor Geoffrey's grandson. Though Karan has not worked with his grandfather, he has acted in several Hindi and British films and has pursued a career in photography.

Product review: If so, then this video is for you, however, I suggest that you make this the second of your video collection. I would first buy the Midnight Special. It has a lot of the same skits as this one, but with Tony Clifton to boot. The answer to this question is:","response":"The given review would neither significantly increase nor decrease the chances of buying the product without more context and information about personal preferences. However, there are certain aspects of the review that could potentially influence the decision-making process. The first aspect to consider is the relevance of the product to the individual's interests. The review is specifically addressing those who are fans of Kaufman (presumably referring to Andy Kaufman, the American entertainer). If the individual is a Kaufman fan or has an interest in his work, this review might increase the chances of buying the product. The reviewer suggests that the video is suitable for Kaufman enthusiasts, which may resonate with certain individuals. On the other hand, the review also recommends purchasing the Midnight Special first, as it contains similar content but also includes Tony Clifton (a character portrayed by Kaufman). This suggestion could potentially lead to a slight decrease in the chances of buying the reviewed product, as it might be perceived that the Midnight Special offers more value for Kaufman fans. Ultimately, the impact of the review on the decision to purchase the product will largely depend on the individual's interests and personal preferences. Those who are particularly interested in Kaufman's work and have not yet purchased the Midnight Special may be inclined to follow the reviewer's advice, making the likelihood of buying the reviewed product secondary to acquiring the suggested one. However, for those who have already purchased the Midnight Special or are not as invested in Kaufman's work, the review might not have a significant impact on their purchasing decision. In summary, the given review contains both positives and negatives that could potentially influence the decision to buy the product. The extent to which these factors affect the overall decision will depend on the individual's personal interests and preferences. It would be beneficial to gather more information about the product and reviews from various perspectives to make a well-informed decision about the purchase."},{"question":"Translate to German: The XO is designed for the use of children ages 6 to 12 — covering the years of elementary school — but nothing precludes its use earlier or later in life.","response":"Step 1: Identify key phrases and words - The XO is designed - For the use of children ages 6 to 12 - Covering the years of elementary school - Nothing precludes its use earlier or later in life Step 2: Translate key phrases and words into German - The XO is designed - Der XO ist entworfen - For the use of children ages 6 to 12 - für den Gebrauch von Kindern im Alter von 6 bis 12 Jahren - Covering the years of elementary school - abdeckend die Jahre der Grundschule - Nothing precludes its use earlier or later in life - nichts schließt seine Verwendung früher oder später im Leben aus Step 3: Combine translated phrases and words for the German translation Der XO ist entworfen für den Gebrauch von Kindern im Alter von 6 bis 12 Jahren, abdeckend die Jahre der Grundschule, aber nichts schließt seine Verwendung früher oder später im Leben aus."},{"question":"Q:What is the final step of the following process: - Gases cause pressure beneath the earth - The gases come to a head and push molten magma to the surface - The magma cools - With enough time the pressure builds up greatly A:","response":"The final step of the process outlined above involves a volcanic eruption, during which the built-up pressure is released, and the molten magma, along with volcanic gases, and other pyroclastic materials are expelled from the Earth's crust. This step-by-step process in more detail is as follows: 1. Gases cause pressure beneath the Earth: The Earth's mantle is composed of solid and molten rock material called magma, which contains different types of dissolved volatile gases, such as water vapor, carbon dioxide, and sulfur dioxide. These gases primarily originate from the mantle or are released by the subduction of tectonic plates. The heating and movement of the molten rock increase the pressure caused by these gases. 2. The gases come to a head and push molten magma to the surface: When the pressure exerted by the gases within the magma increases beyond a certain threshold, it forces the magma to rise towards the surface. The less dense molten magma ascends through fractures and cracks in the Earth's crust. This movement is facilitated by the fact that gases decrease the viscosity of magma, allowing it to flow more easily. 3. The magma cools: Upon reaching the surface or near the surface, the magma is exposed to lower temperatures and pressure, leading to the commencement of the cooling process. Over time, this results in the formation of various igneous rocks, such as basalt, andesite, or rhyolite, depending on the magma's composition, crystallization process, and cooling rate. Some intrusions of magma cool slowly within the Earth's crust, forming plutonic rocks like granite. 4. With enough time, the pressure builds up greatly: If the magma fails to reach the Earth's surface, or volcanic activity becomes dormant for an extended period, the pressure from the trapped gases and subsurface activity gradually builds up again. This increase in pressure continues as more magma and dissolved gases accumulate beneath the Earth's crust. 5. Volcanic eruption: The final step is triggered when the pressure build-up becomes too great to be contained by the surrounding rock, leading to a volcanic eruption. The eruption can vary in intensity and type, including explosive or effusive eruptions. During an eruption, a combination of molten magma (which turns into lava once it reaches the surface), volcanic gases, ash, and other pyroclastic materials are expelled rapidly from the Earth's crust. The eruption occurs through surface openings called vents, and the expelled materials can form different types of volcanic landforms, such as lava flows, volcanic cones, or domes. In summary, the final step in this geological process involves a volcanic eruption, wherein the increased pressure from gases and molten magma forces its way through the Earth's crust, releasing a combination of lava, volcanic gases, ash, and other pyroclastic materials. The results of volcanic eruptions can lead to significant changes in the Earth's surface topography, ecosystems, and the global climate."},{"question":"Write a sentence that is about a restaurant with all the following properties: name = The Cricketers, eatType = coffee shop, food = French, customer rating = low, familyFriendly = yes, near = The Portland Arms Sentence:","response":"The Cricketers, a family-friendly coffee shop near The Portland Arms, serves French cuisine but unfortunately has a low customer rating."},{"question":"Leo: Premise: \\"A brown dog and a black dog run into each other in the grass.\\" Hypothesis: \\"Fat animals running.\\" Do we know that the hypothesis entailed by the premise?

Passage: Taiwan was first populated by Austronesian people and was colonized by the Dutch, who had arrived in 1623. The Kingdom of Tungning, lasting from 1661 to 1683, was the first Han Chinese government to rule Taiwan. From 1683, the Qing Dynasty ruled Taiwan as a prefecture and in 1875 divided the island into two prefectures. In 1885 the island was made into a separate Chinese province to speed up development in this region. In the aftermath of the First Sino-Japanese War, Taiwan and Penghu were ceded by the Qing Dynasty to Japan in 1895. Japanese troops in Taiwan surrendered to the Republic of China at end of World War II, putting Taiwan under a Chinese government again after 50 years of Japanese rule. The ROC would then claim sovereignty on the basis of the Qing dynasty's administration, Cairo Declaration, Potsdam Declaration, and Japanese Instrument of Surrender, but this became contested by pro-independence groups in subsequent years due to different perceptions of the said documents' legality. Upon losing the Chinese civil war in 1949, the ROC government retreated to Taipei, and kept control over a few islands along the coast of mainland China and in the South China Sea. The People's Republic of China was established in mainland China on 1 October 1949, claiming to be the successor to the ROC. Quemoy, Matsu and Wuchiu on the coast of Fukien, Taiping and Pratas in the South China Sea, are part of the ROC's present territory, but were not ceded to Japan.

Movie title: Story of Women Context: Under the German military administration in occupied France during World War II. Paul Latour is a prisoner of war in Germany and his wife Marie lives hand-to-mouth with their two children in a squalid flat. A neighbour, whose husband is also in Germany, has fallen pregnant and is trying to lose the baby. Marie helps her, successfully. Other women come to her and she starts charging. While talking with Paul one night, she reveals that a fortune teller saw \\"nothing but good things\\" in her future, along with a lot of women, which she wouldn't clarify, but alluded to her abortion activities. Marie also confessed to wanting to be a famous singer. Despite her husbands return, she will not resume relations. She sees him as immasculated, and less than a man. Although he cannot find work, he rents a bigger flat so that the two can have some privacy. Marie not only has more space for her illicit business but lets a prostitute use a room during the day. She also starts a daytime affair with a collaborator. When one of the abortions goes wrong, the woman dies and her despairing husband commits suicide. Marie shrugs off the tragedy and hires a maid to help, suggesting that part of her duties can be to sleep with Paul. After returning home early and witnessing Marie and her lover asleep together, he sends an anonymous denunciation to the police, alerting them of her illegal activities. A recent law of the Vichy rÃ©gime, determined to enforce morality and stop population decline, has made abortion a treasonable crime. Marie is condemned to death and guillotined. Before being arrested, she visits a music teacher, who tells her that she was a great voice, fulfilling both prophecies of the fortune teller. Answer:","response":"\\"Story of Women\\" is based upon the true story of Marie-Louise Giraud, a Frenchwoman who performed illegal abortions during the German military administration in occupied France during World War II. Marie-Louise Giraud was ultimately condemned to death under Vichy France's laws that deemed abortion a treasonable crime, aimed at enforcing morality and stopping population decline. She was executed by guillotine, making her one of the last women to be executed in France. The movie delves into the life of Marie-Louise Giraud, who was trying to support her family while her husband, Paul Latour, was a prisoner of war in Germany. Marie starts by helping a neighbor lose her baby through an unauthorised procedure and gradually turns it into a business, charging other women who seek her help to terminate pregnancies. She also dreams of becoming a famous singer and experiences a growing separation from her husband upon his return from captivity. The film showcases Marie's downward spiral, as she becomes involved in various illicit activities, including providing space for a prostitute to work and engaging in an affair with a collaborator. Tragedy strikes when one of the abortions she performs results in the woman's death, followed by her husband's suicide. Marie remains unapologetic and hires a maid to help with her endeavors, suggesting the maid also sleep with her own husband, Paul. Paul, feeling betrayed and displaced, ultimately sends an anonymous denunciation to the police about Marie's illegal activities. Consequently, she is arrested and tried under the laws of the Vichy regime, which had declared abortion a treasonable crime. Marie-Louise Giraud is sentenced to death and executed by guillotine. Hence, \\"Story of Women\\" narrates the tragic and true story of Marie-Louise Giraud, a woman whose actions stemmed from a desperate need to support her family, but who was led down a path of immoral decisions, culminating in her execution under the Vichy regime's strict laws."},{"question":"Given the question: I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

There, she will await her reign once her grandmother, Queen Clarisse (Julie Andrews), steps down as Queen. During Mia's 21st birthday party, she dances with all the eligible bachelors in hope of finding a husband. She becomes attracted to a handsome gentleman named Nicholas (Chris Pine). During the course of the night, Mia's tiara falls off and is caught by Parliament member Viscount Mabrey (John Rhys-Davies) who secretly plans to steal Mia's crown. While the Parliament is in-session the next morning, Mia stumbles upon a hidden room that allows her to secretly listen in. Viscount Mabrey reveals his nephew, Lord Devereaux, is another heir to the Genovian throne.

During periods when continents move apart, more oceanic crust is formed by volcanic activity. Because young volcanic crust is relatively hotter and less dense than old oceanic crust, the ocean floors rise during such periods. This causes the sea level to rise. Therefore, in the first half of the Paleozoic, large areas of the continents were below sea level.Early Paleozoic climates were warmer than today, but the end of the Ordovician saw a short ice age during which glaciers covered the south pole, where the huge continent Gondwana was situated. Traces of glaciation from this period are only found on former Gondwana. During the Late Ordovician ice age, a few mass extinctions took place, in which many brachiopods, trilobites, Bryozoa and corals disappeared. These marine species could probably not contend with the decreasing temperature of the sea water.The continents Laurentia and Baltica collided between 450 and 400 Ma, during the Caledonian Orogeny, to form Laurussia (also known as Euramerica). Traces of the mountain belt this collision caused can be found in Scandinavia, Scotland, and the northern Appalachians. In the Devonian period (416–359 Ma) Gondwana and Siberia began to move towards Laurussia. The collision of Siberia with Laurussia caused the Uralian Orogeny, the collision of Gondwana with Laurussia is called the Variscan or Hercynian Orogeny in Europe or the Alleghenian Orogeny in North America. The latter phase took place during the Carboniferous period (359–299 Ma) and resulted in the formation of the last supercontinent, Pangaea.By 180 Ma, Pangaea broke up into Laurasia and Gondwana. Now, I have a new situation: Two space explorers are flying around through an unknown galaxy when they discover two new planets. Given that these planets have no names, the explorers decide to name them after themselves. The planet of Sarahn is currently going through a large geographic shift. Many of the continents on the planet are currently breaking apart and moving. Timon, however, has been a stable planet with no continental moving for quite awhile now. Answer this question please: Which planet is currently making less oceanic crust? Answer:","response":"Timon is currently making less oceanic crust, as it is a stable planet with no continental movement for quite some time. On the other hand, Planet Sarahn is going through a large geographic shift with continents breaking apart and moving, which would cause more oceanic crust to be formed due to volcanic activity."},{"question":"The latest Belgium lottery results are listed below Add punctuation","response":"The latest Belgium lottery results are listed below: (Note: The actual lottery numbers would be added after the colon in a clear, easy-to-read format, such as with bullet points or separated by commas.)"},{"question":"Question: I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

Movie title: Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star Movie plot: Dickie Roberts is a former child star who shot to fame on a TV sitcom called The Glimmer Gang with his catchphrase \\"This is Nuckin' Futs!\\". His career subsequently halted after his 6th birthday. Since his heyday, he has been reduced to parking cars at Morton's and appearing on Celebrity Boxing, where he is matched with Emmanuel Lewis. In the public eye and to his girlfriend Cyndi who apparently leaves him during a roadside incident, Dickie is washed up. After talking to an old friend, Leif Garrett, Dickie is absolutely convinced that a new Rob Reiner movie in the works, Mr. Blake's Backyard, will be his comeback vehicle. Even after Sidney, his agent, does not land him an audition, Dickie persists. While on duty at Morton's, he joy rides in a customer's vehicle, drops into an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, and he pesters Tom Arnold to hook him up with Reiner. After he is kicked out because he's not an alcoholic, Dickie fakes being wasted and crashes what turns out to be a Lamaze class. However, Brendan Fraser (in an uncredited cameo appearance) is in the class and, finding his entrance to the class hilarious and ridiculous, he agrees to help him out and calls Reiner for Dickie. Reiner bluntly tells Dickie that the part is not within his abilities because it requires knowing how a regular person lives. Unfortunately, Dickie never had a real childhood; he grew up in the limelight, and then his mother abandoned him when his show was cancelled. Desperate to prove to Reiner that he's right for the part, Dickie sells his raunchy autobiography to raise 30,000. With the money, he pays a family to \\"adopt\\" him for a month, as he believes he will \\"watch and learn\\". Once Dickie hires his \\"family\\", things get off to a rocky start, as George, the bread winning father, insists that they need the money, despite the rightful reservations of the other family members.

As anyone who has experienced occasional — or even chronic — constipation can tell you, it can really put a damper on quality of life and well-being. Constipation can also cause more substantial problems, such as: * Severe abdominal pain, which can lead to emergency room visits * Hemorrhoids, which can bleed or be painful * Increased irritability, agitation, or even aggression, in people with Alzheimer’s disease or other forms of dementia * Stress and/or pain that can contribute to delirium (a state of new or worse confusion that often happens when older adults are hospitalized) * Fecal incontinence, which can be caused or worsened by having a hard lump of stool lodged in the lower bowel * Avoidance of needed pain medication, due to fear of constipation Fortunately, it’s usually possible to help older adults effectively manage and prevent constipation. This helps maintain well-being and quality of life, and can also improve difficult behaviors related to dementia. The trouble is that constipation is often either overlooked or sub-optimally managed by busy healthcare providers who aren’t trained in geriatrics. They are often focused on more “serious” health issues. Also, since many laxatives are available over-the-counter, some providers may assume that people will treat themselves if necessary. Personally, I don’t like this hands-off approach to constipation. Although several useful laxatives are indeed available over-the-counter (OTC), I’ve found that the average person doesn’t know enough to correctly choose among them. Also, although in geriatrics we often do end up recommending or prescribing laxatives, it’s vital to start by figuring out what is likely to be causing — or worsening — an older person’s constipation. For instance, many medications can make constipation worse, so we usually make an attempt to identify and perhaps deprescribe those.

In 1953, he earned a bachelor's degree in journalism from Sam Houston State University where he was editor of the school newspaper, The Houstonian. On September 8, 2004, Rather reported on 60 Minutes Wednesday that a series of memos critical of President George W. Bush's Texas Air National Guard service record had been discovered in the personal files of Lt. Bush's former commanding officer, Lt. Col. Jerry B. Killian. Once copies of the documents were made available on the Internet, their authenticity was quickly called into question. Much of this was based on the fact that the documents were proportionally printed and displayed using other modern typographic conventions usually unavailable on military typewriters of the 1970s. The font used on the documents has characteristics that exactly match standard font features of Microsoft Word. This led to claims that the memos were forgeries. The accusations then spread over the following days into mainstream media outlets including The Washington Post, The New York Times, and the Chicago Sun-Times. Rather and CBS initially defended the story, insisting that the documents had been authenticated by experts. CBS was contradicted by some of the experts it originally cited, and later reported that its source for the documents - former Texas Army National Guard officer Lt. Col. Bill Burkett - had misled the network about how he had obtained them. On September 20, CBS retracted the story. Rather stated, \\"If I knew then what I know now, I would not have gone ahead with the story as it was aired, and I certainly would not have used the documents in question.\\" The controversy has been referred to by some as \\"Memogate\\" and \\"Rathergate.\\" Following an investigation commissioned by CBS, CBS fired story producer Mary Mapes and asked three other producers connected with the story to resign.

The plant's ventilation system pulled debris \\"from the infested crawl space into production areas of the plant resulting in the adulteration of exposed food products,\\" a health department news release said. Officials at the plant, which opened in March 2005 and produced oil-roasted peanuts, dry-roasted peanuts, peanut meal and granulated peanut, voluntarily stopped operations Monday night. \\"Our understanding is that the bulk of their products go to other food manufacturers,\\" McBride said. \\"We're not aware of any direct sales to consumers.\\" The state has the authority to stop a company's operations and order a recall if it finds \\"a condition that poses an immediate and serious threat to human life or health,\\" as was the case here, he said. Though tests are being carried out to determine if the products contain salmonella or other disease-causing organisms, the orders are not contingent on what is found, he said. The plant is barred from resuming operations without health services approval. The company's peanut butter and peanut paste products produced at its plant in Blakely, Georgia, have been linked to a nationwide outbreak of salmonella poisoning that has affected 600 people, killing nine. A call to the company's telephone number, which was working earlier this week, elicited a recording that said it was no longer in service. What are highlight points for this article?","response":"1.

The Apple logo is pictured at its flagship retail store in San Francisco, California January 27, 2014. REUTERS/Robert Galbraith According to figures from the FBI and the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, Comey’s annual salary as of January 2015 was 183,300. Without a raise or bonus, Comey will make 1.34 million over the remainder of his job. That suggests the FBI paid the largest ever publicized fee for a hacking job, easily surpassing the 1 million paid by U.S. information security company Zerodium to break into phones. Speaking at the Aspen Security Forum in London, Comey was asked by a moderator how much the FBI paid for the software that eventually broke into the iPhone. “A lot. More than I will make in the remainder of this job, which is seven years and four months for sure,” Comey said. “But it was, in my view, worth it.” The Justice Department said in March it had unlocked the San Bernardino shooter’s iPhone with the help of an unidentified third party and dropped its case against Apple Inc (AAPL.O), ending a high-stakes legal clash but leaving the broader fight over encryption unresolved. Comey said the FBI will be able to use software used on the San Bernardino phone on other 5C iPhones running IOS 9 software. There are about 10 million 5C iPhones in use in the United States, according to estimates from research firm IHS Technology. Eighty-four percent of iOS devices overall are running iOS 9 software, according to Apple. The FBI gained access to the iPhone used by Rizwan Farook, one of the shooters who killed 14 people in San Bernardino, California on Dec. 2. The case raised the debate over whether technology companies’ encryption technologies protect privacy or endanger the public by blocking law enforcement access to information. (This version was officially corrected to change active U.S. 5C iPhone estimates to 10 million from 16 million in paragraph 8 after analyst IHS corrects figure.) ||||| FBI Director James Comey suggested Thursday that the bureau paid more than 1 million to access an iPhone belonging to one of the San Bernardino attackers, the first time the agency has offered a possible price tag in the high-profile case. While speaking at a security forum in London hosted by the Aspen Institute, Comey would not offer a precise dollar figure, saying only that it cost “a lot” to get into the phone. He said the cost of the tool was “more than I will make in the remainder of this job, which is seven years and four months, for sure.” As he made his remark, Comey, a former federal prosecutor who speaks precisely in public settings, paused as if to consider the math he was performing in his head. The FBI director serves a 10-year term, though Comey’s predecessor, Robert S. Mueller III, served for 12 years after Congress approved a request from President Obama to extend his tenure. Comey was confirmed July 2013 and took office in September of that year, so he has more than seven years left in his term. According to the federal statute detailing his salary, Comey is paid the rate set for Level II of the executive salary schedule. That means he makes 185,100 a year, under the pay schedules that went into effect this year. As a result, Comey’s remarks strongly implied that the bureau paid at least 1.3 million to get onto the phone, which had belonged to Syed Rizwan Farook, who, with his wife, killed 14 people during the Dec. 2 terror attack in San Bernardino, Calif. “But it was, in my view, worth it,” the FBI director said of what it cost to access the phone’s data. [The San Bernardino case is already changing Apple’s arguments over another locked iPhone] An FBI spokesman said the bureau would not comment on Comey’s remarks. Federal authorities have not publicly revealed who helped the FBI unlock the San Bernardino iPhone, which was at the center of an extended fight between the government and Apple. The Justice Department had maintained that only Apple could help it access the phone without erasing all of its data before abruptly saying it had gotten help from an outside party and no longer needed Apple’s assistance. According to people familiar with the issue, the FBI cracked the phone with the help of professional hackers who were paid a one-time flat fee. Law enforcement officials have said recently that the FBI has found no links to foreign terrorists on the phone, though they are still hoping that geolocation data on the device could help reveal what the attackers did during an 18-minute period after the shooting. Earlier this month, Comey had said that the government was considering telling Apple how it accessed the phone, though he acknowledged that if that happened, the technology giant would fix the flaw and close off that avenue. But he said the tool would only work on a “narrow slice” of devices, saying he was “pretty confident” it would not work on newer models. Comey conceded Thursday that the tool would work only on an iPhone 5c running iOS 9. In part because of the price tag, Comey said he hoped the government could figure out a solution to access other, more current phones without having to make mass appeals to the tech industry for some kind of hack. He noted that there were 18,000 law enforcement agencies across the U.S. that might want to access phones and could not afford what the FBI paid to access the San Bernardino phone. The FBI’s total budget for fiscal year 2016 was more than 8.7 billion, and the bureau requested more than 9.5 billion for fiscal year 2017. “I’m hoping that we can somehow get to a place where we have a sensible solution, or set of solutions, that doesn’t involve hacking, it doesn’t involve spending tons of money in a way that’s un-scaleable,” Comey said. Further reading: Justice Dept. still wants to force Apple to help it unlock an iPhone in a New York drug case The FBI has weighed whether the San Bernardino tool can help state and local law enforcement The Justice Department said tech companies have accessed phones for it before. So the ACLU tried to find all the cases. ||||| A summary of this is?","response":"This news article is about the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) Director James Comey disclosing that the FBI paid more than his seven-year plus remaining tenure’s salary to access an iPhone belonging to one of the San Bernardino shooters, implying a cost of over 1.34 million. The phone was unlocked with the help of an unidentified third party, after a legal clash with Apple Inc, who had refused to assist. The software that unlocked the phone will reportedly be usable on other 5C iPhones running IOS 9 software. This case has intensified the debate over the balance between technology companies' encryption technologies safeguarding privacy rights and the national security implications of denying law enforcement access to information. The action was defended by Comey, stating that despite the enormous fee, it was worth it. However, he also expressed hope for a future that doesn't involve high-cost hacking for accessing information, acknowledging that the strategy is not scalable. Overall, this story speaks to issues of encryption, privacy, public safety and the significant costs involved in navigating these complex realms in the digital age."},{"question":"Write a question about the following article.

When it comes to choosing flowers as a gift or for a special occasion, the choice often goes beyond a simple preference for bloom type or color. The man likely considered the meanings and cultural associations tied to each flower before ultimately deciding on the roses, weighing the advantages and personal significance of each choice. Roses, as a classic symbol of love, hold a veritable plethora of meanings depending on their color, ranging from red roses which symbolize deep love and respect, to white roses that represent purity and innocence, and yellow roses which communicate friendship and joy. The man may have considered that roses, regardless of their color, possess an inherent, classic charm that makes them an undoubtedly romantic choice —perfect for expressing his feelings of love, affection, or admiration. On the other hand, carnations are also lovely flowers, and they too carry a plethora of meanings depending on their hue. Red carnations are often associated with love and admiration, while white ones usually signify pure love and good luck, and pink carnations are thought to represent a mother's eternal love. However, the man may have been aware that carnations can sometimes carry less favorable meanings, such as disdain, rejection, or even disappointment – and perhaps wished to avoid inadvertently conveying any negativity or mixed messages. Moreover, in pondering his decision, the man may have also considered the respective visual appeal of his floral choices. While carnations are undoubtedly beautiful and can be arranged in stunning bouquets, roses often carry a higher level of sophistication, with their enchanting, layered petals and distinct, noble scent. The man may have believed that the gracefulness and allure of the roses, which have long been regarded as the quintessential romantic flower, would make a stronger impression and speak more loudly to the recipient's heart. Finally, the cultural history of both flowers may have been another factor in the man's choice. Roses have been admired and celebrated for centuries across various civilizations, including in ancient Greece, Rome, and Egypt, where they were often used in rituals and ceremonies due to their captivating beauty and deeply evocative aroma. In contrast, while carnations also have their place in history, their associations are often more varied and complex, which may have led the man to perceive roses as a more reliable and universally appreciated symbol of love and devotion. In conclusion, the man chose to buy the roses instead of the carnations because the roses symbolized a deeper emotional connection and carried a certain level of elegance and sophistication that he believed would better convey his sentiments. By choosing roses, he communicated a timeless message of love, admiration, and devotion, lending weight and meaning to his gesture, while avoiding the potentially mixed messages that a bouquet of carnations could potentially convey."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Question: \\"Which version of Windows was leaked in 2011?\\" Context: \\"Three milestone releases of Windows 8 leaked to the general public.

He convinces Princeton University's college football star, Carter \\"the Bullet\\" Rutherford, to join the Bulldogs, hoping to capitalize on Carter's fame as a decorated hero of the First World War (like Alvin York, he single-handedly captured a large group of German soldiers). In addition to his legendary tales of combat heroism, Carter has dashing good looks and unparalleled speed and skill on the field. As a result of his presence, both the Bulldogs and pro football in general begin to prosper. Chicago Tribune newspaper reporter Lexie Littleton becomes the object of the affections of both Dodge and Carter. Lexie has been assigned to find proof that Carter's war heroics are bogus. Carter confesses that the surrender of the Germans was a lucky accident and that his role in it was more foolish than heroic. Carter soon discovers Lexie's agenda and is doubly hurt when he learns that Dodge and Lexie are starting to show affections for each other and even shared a kiss. The ensuing fight over Lexie's affections puts her off. Spurred on by the threats of Carter's manager, she decides to publish the story. The story sparks a firestorm of accusations and reprimands. Carter's manager resorts to shady dealing to cover it up, even bribing the original witness to change his story. Dodge's attempts to legitimize pro football take a life of its own.

His writings draw on his experiences as an Indigenous American with ancestry from several tribes. He grew up on the Spokane Indian Reservation and now lives in Seattle, Washington. His best-known book is The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven (1993), a collection of short stories. In order to better his education, Alexie decided to leave the reservation and attend high school in Reardan, Washington. The school was twenty-two miles off the reservation and Alexie was the only Native American student. He excelled at his studies and became a star player on the basketball team, the Reardan High School Indians. He was elected as class president and participated as a member of the debate team. His successes in high school won him a scholarship in 1985 to Gonzaga University, a Roman Catholic university in Spokane. Originally, Alexie enrolled in the pre-med program with hopes of becoming a doctor, but found he was squeamish during dissection in his anatomy classes. Alexie switched to law, but found that was not suitable, either. He felt enormous pressure to succeed in college, and consequently, he began drinking heavily to cope with his anxiety. Unhappy with law, Alexie found comfort in literature classes. In 1987, he dropped out of Gonzaga and enrolled at Washington State University (WSU), where he took a creative writing course taught by Alex Kuo, a respected poet of Chinese-American background. Alexie was at a low point in his life, and Kuo served as a mentor to him. Kuo gave Alexie an anthology entitled Songs of This Earth on Turtle's Back, by Joseph Bruchac. Alexie said this book changed his life as it taught him \\"how to connect to non-Native literature in a new way\\". He was inspired by reading works of poetry written by Native Americans. With his new appreciation of poetry, Alexie started working on what was published as his first collection, The Business of Fancydancing: Stories and Poems, published in 1992 through Hanging Loose Press. With that success, Alexie stopped drinking and quit school just three credits short of a degree. However, in 1995, he was awarded a bachelor's degree from Washington State University. Ask a question about this article.","response":"What impact did Alex Kuo and the anthology \\"Songs of This Earth on Turtle's Back\\" have on Sherman Alexie's life and career?"},{"question":"Answer the following question, with explanation first.

In contrast, Sentence B describes a common and practical method of cutting grass with a riding lawn mower, which is specifically designed for efficiently cutting large areas of grass."},{"question":"Build a movie plot around this: Who knows where the bomb is located? Archer Answer:","response":"Title: The Archer's Gambit Genre: Action/Thriller Plot Summary: The world is on the brink of devastation as a ruthless terrorist organization, led by the enigmatic mastermind Zenith, threatens to detonate a powerful nuclear bomb hidden somewhere in the city of London. With millions of lives at stake, the fate of humanity rests on the shoulders of an unassuming and disillusioned former MI6 agent, Thomas Archer, who has only one clue to find the bomb – his extraordinary archery skills. Act I: The movie begins with a fast-paced chase scene, with a team of MI6 agents pursuing Zenith through the streets of London. Just as they're about to capture him, Zenith escapes, leaving behind a cryptic message that warns of the impending nuclear attack. Brought out of retirement, Thomas Archer is tasked with finding and disabling the bomb in 72 hours. He reluctantly accepts the mission, burdened with the guilt of past failures that led to the loss of his family and his departure from MI6. Determined to right his wrongs, Archer follows a trail of secretive messages and mysterious clues hidden in London's historic landmarks, leading him to a group of elite underground archers who have taken a collective vow to protect the city. Act II: With the help of the underground archers and using his unparalleled archery skills, Archer uncovers a series of hidden symbols and maps that guide him to the bomb's location. The clues reveal that Zenith, a former star archer himself, had become disillusioned with the world and sought to reshape it through chaos. As the clock ticks down, Archer realizes that the path to finding the bomb is eerily similar to a notoriously difficult archery gauntlet that he and Zenith once faced together during their time in the elite archery team. He becomes increasingly convinced that Zenith was his long-lost friend and former mentor, Alexander Kane. Act III: Archer confronts Zenith in a nail-biting showdown in the London Underground, both men armed with bows and arrows. Zenith's true identity as Alexander Kane is confirmed during the fight, as he shares his philosophy of how only destruction can pave the way for a better world. As they battle through the subway tunnels, Archer tries to reason with Alexander, reminding him of their shared history and the values they once held. In a climactic battle, Archer emerges victorious, incapacitating Alexander and retrieving the bomb's deactivation code. With only seconds remaining, Archer disarms the bomb, saving countless lives and averting catastrophe. In the aftermath of the ordeal, Archer processes his former mentor's betrayal and the harsh reality that one of his most trusted friends had become such a formidable adversary. He decides to stay on with MI6, finding renewed purpose and resolve in fighting against the dark forces that threaten global peace. The movie ends with Archer training a new generation of MI6 archery agents and spreading the message of hope, unity, and justice. Through his actions, he seeks to honor the memory of his family, as well as remind the world that a single individual has the power to create a change for the better. In \\"The Archer's Gambit,\\" audiences are guaranteed to find an engaging, action-packed, and emotionally charged journey that explores the themes of hope, redemption, and the battle between good and evil, all driven by one man's unwavering determination and extraordinary talent."},{"question":"Question: Information: - Pair skating is a figure skating discipline.

Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction. - Del Rey Books is a branch of Ballantine Books, which is owned by Random House and, in turn, by Penguin Random House.

First laid out by Sigmund Freud in the late 19th century, psychoanalytic theory has undergone many refinements since his work. Psychoanalytic theory came to full prominence in the last third of the twentieth century as part of the flow of critical discourse regarding psychological treatments after the 1960s, long after Freud's death in 1939, and its validity is now widely disputed or rejected. Freud had ceased his analysis of the brain and his physiological studies and shifted his focus to the study of the mind and the related psychological attributes making up the mind, and on treatment using free association and the phenomena of transference. His study emphasized the recognition of childhood events that could influence the mental functioning of adults. His examination of the genetic and then the developmental aspects gave the psychoanalytic theory its characteristics. Starting with his publication of \\"The Interpretation of Dreams\\" in 1899, his theories began to gain prominence. - Psychopathology is the scientific study of mental disorders, including efforts to understand their genetic, biological, psychological, and social causes; effective classification schemes (nosology); course across all stages of development; manifestations; and treatment.

Vienna is Austria's primary city, with a population of about 1.8 million (2.6 million within the metropolitan area, nearly one third of Austria's population), and its cultural, economic, and political centre. It is the 7th-largest city by population within city limits in the European Union. Until the beginning of the 20th century, it was the largest German-speaking city in the world, and before the splitting of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in World War I, the city had 2 million inhabitants. Today, it has the second largest number of German speakers after Berlin. Vienna is host to many major international organizations, including the United Nations and OPEC. The city is located in the eastern part of Austria and is close to the borders of the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary. These regions work together in a European Centrope border region. Along with nearby Bratislava, Vienna forms a metropolitan region with 3 million inhabitants. In 2001, the city centre was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. - Beyond the Pleasure Principle ( German : Jenseits des Lustprinzips ) is a 1920 essay by Sigmund Freud that marks a major turning point in his theoretical approach . Previously , Freud attributed most human behavior to the sexual instinct ( Eros or libido ) . With this essay , Freud went \`\` beyond '' the simple pleasure principle , developing his theory of drives with the addition of the death drive ( s ) ( Todestrieb ( e ) ) ( often referred to as \`\` Thanatos '' ) . - Hypersexuality is a clinical diagnosis used by mental healthcare researchers and providers to describe extremely frequent or suddenly increased sexual urges or sexual activity. The terms nymphomania and satyriasis were once used to describe the condition, in women and men respectively, but are no longer in general medical use, although the former is still used colloquially. - Moravia is a historical country in the Czech Republic (forming its eastern part) and one of the historical Czech lands, together with Bohemia and Czech Silesia. The medieval and early modern Margraviate of Moravia was a crown land of the Lands of the Bohemian Crown (from 1348 to 1918), an imperial state of the Holy Roman Empire (1004 to 1806), later a crown land of the Austrian Empire (1804 to 1867) and briefly also one of 17 former crown lands of the Cisleithanian part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire from 1867 to 1918. During the early 20th century, Moravia was one of the five lands of Czechoslovakia from 1918 to 1928; it was then merged with Czech Silesia, and eventually dissolved by abolition of the land system in 1949. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - In Greek mythology, Eros (or , \\"Desire\\") was the Greek god of love. His Roman counterpart was Cupid (\\"desire\\"). Some myths make him a primordial god, while in other myths, he is the son of Aphrodite. He was one of the winged love gods, Erotes. - Puberty is the process of physical changes through which a child's body matures into an adult body capable of sexual reproduction. It is initiated by hormonal signals from the brain to the gonads: the ovaries in a girl, the testes in a boy. In response to the signals, the gonads produce hormones that stimulate libido and the growth, function, and transformation of the brain, bones, muscle, blood, skin, hair, breasts, and sex organs. Physical growthheight and weightaccelerates in the first half of puberty and is completed when an adult body has been developed. Until the maturation of their reproductive capabilities, the pre-pubertal physical differences between boys and girls are the external sex organs. - In classical Freudian psychoanalytic theory, the death drive is the drive towards death and self-destruction. It was originally proposed by Sabina Spielrein in her paper \\"Destruction as the Cause of Coming Into Being\\" (\\"\\"Die Destruktion als Ursache des Werdens\\"\\") which was then taken up by Sigmund Freud in 1920 in \\"Beyond the Pleasure Principle.\\" This concept has been translated as, \\"opposition between the ego or death instincts and the sexual or life instincts\\". In \\"Pleasure Principle\\", Freud used the plural \\"death drives\\" (\\"Todestriebe\\") much more frequently than in the singular. - Neuropathology is the study of disease of nervous system tissue, usually in the form of either small surgical biopsies or whole-body autopsies. Neuropathology is a subspecialty of anatomic pathology, neurology, and neurosurgery. It should not be confused with neuropathy, which refers to disorders of the nerves themselves (usually in the peripheral nervous system). - Libido, colloquially known as sex drive, is a person's overall sexual drive or desire for sexual activity. Sex drive is influenced by biological, psychological and social factors. Biologically, the sex hormones and associated neurotransmitters that act upon the nucleus accumbens (primarily testosterone and dopamine, respectively) regulate libido in humans. Social factors, such as work and family, and internal psychological factors, like personality and stress, can affect libido. Sex drive can also be affected by medical conditions, medications, lifestyle and relationship issues, and age (e.g., puberty). A person who has extremely frequent or a suddenly increased sex drive may be experiencing hypersexuality, while the opposite condition is hyposexuality. - Instinct or innate behavior is the inherent inclination of a living organism towards a particular complex behavior. The simplest example of an instinctive behavior is a fixed action pattern (FAP), in which a very short to medium length sequence of actions, without variation, are carried out in response to a clearly defined stimulus. 'beyond the pleasure principle' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'genre'?

Of the three, it is by far the weakest in several respects: Hitler is one dimensional and over the top in presentation; his dialogue is generally made up of cobbled together verses and phrases from his speeches. Many of the Bunker principle players are missing.The film is dated and the inter-cut original footage does not work well. It looks out of place and only serves as a distraction.

A spork I'd seen before, but the addition of a simple serration on the side of the fork end makes this a genuine \\"three-in-one\\" implement for eating one's full three-course takeaway meal on the plane. The sporf is no innovation; back in 1940 the \\"sporf\\" was born. It took me until 2015 to notice this one thanks to its rather pleasant design. The sporf is a little like most strategy documents that I come across. It is one implement designed to serve a multitude of goals, but with one fatal flaw: you can only ever use one part of the sporf / strategy at any one time. With the sporf, things would get messy trying to use the spoon and knife and the same time. The knife and fork work quite well in sequence but physics prevents me using both at the same time as I can with the older technologies of knife and fork. In strategy formation, we can develop a multitude of potential purposes within one document, killer vision statement or mission. But it's important to recognise that the teams around us will only ever be able to do one thing really well at any one time. This is a lesson oft ignored by schools, in particular, as they attempt to ask educators to create an ever-more creative curriculum without having first tackled attitudes towards summative assessments throughout the year. It is also a challenge in some of the world's most successful, but now stagnating, big businesses: they've spent decades or centuries building a reputation across a large array of devices, technologies, components or clothing, but the real strategy is working out which of the current array needs killed off to enable teams in their quest to develop something totally new, properly innovative.

Bold farm used lots of fertilizers over the years, while Shallow farm used organic methods combined with methods from permaculture. Which farm put less nitrogen into bodies of water? A:","response":"Shallow farm, which used organic methods combined with permaculture techniques, likely put less nitrogen into bodies of water compared to Bold farm that heavily relied on artificial fertilizers. To provide a more detailed understanding of the reasons, let's discuss the agricultural methods employed by both farms and how they can impact nitrogen levels in nearby water bodies. 1. Bold Farm - Heavy use of artificial fertilizers: Artificial fertilizers, also known as synthetic or inorganic fertilizers, contain nutrients in high concentrations that help stimulate crop growth and increase productivity. A common component of synthetic fertilizers is nitrogen, which is essential for plant growth. However, excessive use of artificial fertilizers can lead to several problems, including water pollution caused by nitrogen leaching. When these fertilizers are applied to the soil, only a portion of the nitrogen is absorbed by the plants, while the rest remains in the soil. Over time, this excess nitrogen can leach into groundwater or rivers and streams, causing a spike in nitrogen levels in nearby water bodies. This process, known as eutrophication, can lead to reduced oxygen levels, the decline of aquatic life, and the development of harmful algal blooms. 2. Shallow Farm - Organic methods and permaculture techniques: Organic farming methods and permaculture techniques focus on creating a more sustainable, balanced, and diverse agricultural system that relies on natural processes and ecological interactions. In organic farming, the use of synthetic fertilizers is replaced by organic sources of nutrients, such as compost, manure, and green manure. These materials are often slower to release nutrients (including nitrogen) into soil, reducing the risk of nutrient leaching and water pollution. Permaculture techniques enhance the sustainability of organic farming practices by emphasizing soil health, water conservation, and biodiversity. Examples of permaculture strategies include: a. Crop rotation: Planting different crops in the same field in a planned sequence to help maintain soil fertility and minimize the buildup of pests and diseases. b. Intercropping: Growing two or more crops together in the same field, which can increase nutrient uptake and reduce nitrogen leaching. c. Cover crops: Planting crops that help protect and nourish the soil, either between growing seasons or around the main crops. d. Mulching: Applying organic materials, such as straw or wood chips, around the base of plants to help retain moisture and suppress weeds, reducing the need for additional water and nutrient inputs. Overall, Shallow farm's use of organic methods and permaculture techniques likely contributed to a more sustainable and eco-friendly farming system. These practices allowed for the gradual release of nutrients, better retention of water and nutrients in the soil, and reduced nitrogen leaching into nearby water bodies. As a result, Shallow farm would have put less nitrogen into local bodies of water compared to Bold farm, which heavily relied on artificial fertilizers."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: The Linguistic Habits of a New Generation In the year of 1914 a young girl named Monica Baldwin entered a convent ,remaining there until 1941 when she returned to the outer world. During these twenty-eight years wars and revolutions had come and gone in Europe. Her uncle, Stanley Baldwin, had led his country for some time. Technical developments had changed the conditions of everyday life almost beyond recognitions, but all these events had left as a matter of fact untouched the small religious community to which she had belonged. In 1949 Miss Baldwin published her impressions of those bewildering years of her return to a world in which the motorcar had replaced the horse and carriage and where respectable women showed their legs and painted their faces. Yet it was not only these odd sights that surprised her, for she was more puzzled by what she heard. During a railway journey the term \\"luggage in advance\\" meant nothing to her, so in desperation she asked the porter to do as he thought best. Reading the newspapers made her feel very stupid, because the writers of reviews and leading articles used words and phrases such as Jazz,prefix = st1 /Hollywood, Cocktail and Isolationism. These and many others were quite incomprehensible to Miss Baldwin, who was really bewildered when friends said: \\"It's your funeral or Believe it or not.\\" This is a rare and valuable reminder to the rest of us that the English language does not stand still.

In either case, it has no relation to a baby kangaroo. - Sentence B: \\"A joey is a baby kangaroo\\" makes sense. A \\"joey\\" is the correct term for a young kangaroo, usually for one that is still being carried in its mother's pouch.

In English-language sources it is usually referred to as the Imperial German Air Service, although that is not a literal translation of either name. German naval aviators serving with the \\"Marine-Fliegerabteilung\\" remained an integral part of the Imperial German Navy \\"(Kaiserliche Marine)\\". Both military branches, the army and navy, operated conventional aircraft, observation balloons and Zeppelins. - The Luftwaffe was the aerial warfare branch of the combined German Wehrmacht military forces during World War II. Germany's military air arms during the First World War, the \\"Luftstreitkräfte\\" of the Army and the \\"Marine-Fliegerabteilung\\" of the Navy, had been disbanded in May 1920 as a result of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles which stated that Germany was forbidden to have any air force. - A flying ace or fighter ace is a military aviator credited with shooting down several enemy aircraft during aerial combat. The actual number of aerial victories required to officially qualify as an \\"ace\\" has varied, but is usually considered to be five or more. The few aces among combat aviators have historically accounted for the majority of air-to-air victories in military history. - The Wehrmacht (lit. \\"defence force\\") was the unified armed forces of Nazi Germany from 1935 to 1946. It consisted of the \\"Heer\\" (army), the \\"Kriegsmarine\\" (navy) and the \\"Luftwaffe\\" (air force). The designation \\"Wehrmacht\\" for Nazi Germany's military replaced the previously used term, \\"Reichswehr\\" (191935), and was the manifestation of Nazi Germany's efforts to rearm the nation to a greater extent than the Treaty of Versailles permitted. - The Messerschmitt Bf 109, was a German World War II fighter aircraft that was the backbone of the Luftwaffe's fighter force. The Bf 109 first saw operational service during the Spanish Civil War (1939) and was still in service at the dawn of the jet age at the end of World War II (1945). It was one of the most advanced fighters of the era, including such features as all-metal monocoque construction, a closed canopy, and retractable landing gear. It was powered by a liquid-cooled, inverted-V12 aero engine. From the end of 1941, the Bf 109 was steadily being supplemented by the superior Focke-Wulf Fw 190. - An aircraft is a machine that is able to fly by gaining support from the air. It counters the force of gravity by using either static lift or by using the dynamic lift of an airfoil, or in a few cases the downward thrust from jet engines. - Squadron leader (Sqn Ldr in the RAF and PAF; SQNLDR in the RAAF and RNZAF; formerly sometimes S/L in all services) is a commissioned rank in the Royal Air Force and the air forces of many countries which have historical British influence.

Movie title: The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Context: The film begins with a Broadway-style number \\"So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish\\", sung by the dolphins of the world, who are aware of the Earth's impending doom. At the end, they all jump out of the oceans and into space, leaving Earth for good. One Thursday morning, Arthur Dent discovers that his house is to be immediately demolished to make way for a bypass. He tries delaying the bulldozers by lying down in front of them. Ford Prefect, a friend of Arthur's, convinces him to go to a pub with him. Over a pint of beer (as \\"muscle relaxant\\"), Ford explains that he is an alien from a planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse, and a journalist working on the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, a universal guide book, and that the Earth is to be demolished later that day by a race called Vogons, to make way for a hyperspace bypass. Suddenly, a Vogon Constructor Fleet appears in the sky and destroys the planet. Ford saves himself and Arthur by stowing away on a Vogon ship. When discovered, they are thrown out of an airlock, but are picked up by the starship Heart of Gold. They find Ford's \\"semi-cousin\\" Zaphod Beeblebrox, the President of the Galaxy.

I offer these very, very preliminary thoughts just to start you thinking - do you want your UK colleagues on the program; do we want some ancillary events? After getting your views on questions such as these, I can make more definite suggestions. I certainly think that we should convene a few hours before the opening dinner so that the advisors can have a tour of the building and the facilities. Also, I am hoping that Steve will leave some time on this trip for a tour of the new BA headquarters - very innovative. We should consider doing something on the global warming question from the viewpoint of the Europeans. Start with three recommendations on the political side that Paul received from David Victor of the Council on Foreign Relations (characterized as \\"a VERY smart guy on climate\\"): Tony Brenton (Deputy chief of mission, UK embassy in DC. Has been on UK climate delegations for a decade; smart and lively; pragmatic; insightful). Bo Kjellen (Swedish head of delegation; knows European politics inside out; big figure in Europe). Tubiana, Laurence (Conseil d'Analyse Economique, France; knows the issue and can speak to French position, but may not have the gravitas of Kjellen or Brenton). Among other ideas (I have winnowed out several) is a guy named Liam Salter at Climate Network Europe. Brussels based, but relatively junior. Paul also recommends a woman by the name of Laurence Tubiana, an economist in the French government's equivalent of the CEA; she has a reputation as a good presenter and a good economist. WOULD YOU PLEASE CHECK THESE FOLKS OUT WITH YOUR LONDON PEOPLE, AND GET ADDITIONAL NAMES FROM THEM. THE GOAL IS TO GIVE ALL OF US A PERSPECTIVE ON THE EUROPEAN VIEW ON ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES - UNLESS YOU THINK THAT NOT A USEFUL TOPIC. I turn now to Pankaj's suggestion, which I transmit verbatim: \\"I remember promising to scout around and see if there were a European whom it would be interesting to invite to talk to the Enron International Advisory Council about the (non) convergence of governance structures in Europe, particularly on the Continent, to the U.S. model. I got the following names from Jay Lorsch (apparently all members of the committee steering a multifaculty Harvard business School project on governance in comparative perspective) as possibilities. Jay suggested that Sihler would be best (former CEO of Henkel, very senior), Peter's second best (apparently, chairman of Amsterdam Stock Exchange now) and Smith - formerly Managing partner at Price Waterhouse Coopers - would be the most junior of the three. I don't personally know any of the three.\\" Now some ideas of my own, again acting on the assumption that we want a two-way educational dialogue - to give your folks in London and Europe a run-down on the situation in the US, and the US contingent a better understanding of how European policymakers view the issues we all face. 1.Bill Kristol on the US political scene, in which there is great interest here, and great misunderstanding of the Bush administration. We might also consider inviting Larry Lindsey or some other Bush person if allowed to do so. 2. Someone on the European view on global warming (see suggestions above). 3. Energy regulation in the UK. Callum McCarthy. 4. Economic outlook. Gavyn Davies (usual talk). 5. What went wrong in California (great interest in that over here) and how to fix it. Steve could do this, or you could invite Bill Hogan (just joking) or the chairman of FERC if we are allowed to pay his way. 6. Motivating people in a multinational, multicultural organization. If this is of interest, I can get recommendations for speakers. 7. I would be inclined to add a high-level speaker on the state of US-UK-European relations, perhaps as a dinner speaker. Between Gavyn and me, we might be able to get Chancellor Gordon Brown, a very interesting guy, and the inventor of the \\"climate change levy\\" that is driving industry in this country nuts. Please look this over. Steve and I have to get together, preferably with Ken, which leads me to suggest Aspen during the Institute's energy forum, which I understand Ken will be attending. But if that is not feasible, Steve and I can work out a date for a preliminary meeting, followed up by one with Ken at his convenience.

(III) they are more reliable and willing to repay the loan. (IV) they are more likely to spend what they earn on their children. Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Millions of families around the world have been given a helping hand out of poverty by micro-credits. These very small loans , usually less than US200, have enabled the very poorest people to set up or expand businesses and become self-sufficient. The micro-credit movement started with Professor Muhammad Yunus, who founded the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh. Professor Yunus, who won the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize, used his own money to set up a bank to benefit the poorest people in Bangladesh--families living on less than US1 a day. There are now hundreds of organizations around the world following his blueprint to help people escape from poverty. So how does the system work? Local microfinance institutions (MFIs) make contact with families and offer loans, usually to women, to enable them to start or expand a business. These are very poor people who would not normally be able to get credit, but as no collateral is required they can get micro-credits. They pay back the loan on a weekly basis, over six months to a year. A very important aspect to the success of the micro-credit system is that receivers get local support. The MFIs educate local communities about ways to improve their lives, and offer practical support as well as collecting weekly loans payments. They encourage people to help each other, so that the whole community can pull itself out of poverty. MFIs may also help with literacy and health problems. Micro-credits are mainly given to women. Experience has shown that women are more motivated to improve their children's lives and will spend the money they make on better nutrition and schooling for their children. This may be the first chance they've had to contribute financially to the family, and their status in the home and the local community is raised. The micro-credit system is not charity. The payments are fixed-term loans and interest is charged. The costs of making such small loans, collecting them and giving personal support are high.

During the business meeting Benjamin was rude to Donald so after the meeting the boss told 1). Benjamin to accept an apology. 2). Donald to accept an apology. Answer:","response":"Answer: 1). Benjamin to accept an apology. During the business meeting, Benjamin was rude to Donald, which created an uncomfortable and unprofessional atmosphere. As a result, after the meeting concluded, the boss felt it was necessary to address the situation to maintain a healthy working environment and to uphold the standards of professionalism expected within the company. Therefore, the boss instructed Benjamin to accept an apology, understanding that his behavior was not in line with the company's values and policies. This decision to have Benjamin accept an apology served multiple purposes. Firstly, it allowed Benjamin the opportunity to reflect on his actions and acknowledge that they were inappropriate and unbecoming of the professional environment. Secondly, it demonstrated to Donald that the company values and supports its employees while also establishing boundaries and promoting respect among colleagues. Lastly, this gesture helped maintain the overall morale and unity of the team by reinforcing the importance of teamwork, cooperation, and respectful communication. In asking Benjamin to accept an apology, the boss also sent a clear message to the other employees present at the meeting that disrespectful behavior would not be tolerated. Moving forward, this serves as a reminder to all staff members that they should treat each other with courtesy and professionalism at all times. It emphasizes that the company takes the well-being of its employees seriously and is committed to fostering a supportive and inclusive workplace culture. For Benjamin, this event may serve as a turning point in his professional development. By being held accountable for his actions, he now has the chance to learn from his mistakes and grow as an individual and employee. By accepting the apology, he is demonstrating remorse and a willingness to improve his behavior and communication skills. For Donald, this experience may also impact his professional journey. The fact that his employer stood up for him and addressed the situation showcases the company's commitment to maintaining a positive work environment and supporting its employees. This may further boost his confidence in his workplace and strengthen his trust in the company's management. In conclusion, while Benjamin's rude behavior towards Donald during the business meeting was a negative experience, the boss's decision to have Benjamin accept an apology took a step towards resolving the issue and reaffirming the importance of professionalism in the company's environment. For both Benjamin and Donald, as well as all other employees, this serves as a reminder to uphold professional standards and to treat each other with respect as they work together to achieve the company's goals."},{"question":"Coming off a road loss to the Steelers, the Saints went home for an interconference fight with the Cincinnati Bengals.

Answer: A neuron ( or ; also known as a neurone or nerve cell) is an electrically excitable cell that processes and transmits information through electrical and chemical signals. Question: what kind of potential is created after a neuron is excited","response":"The answer to your question is: yes, a potential is created after a neuron is excited. This potential is called action potential. When a neuron is excited, an electrical signal known as action potential is produced. Action potentials are generated due to the movement of ions across the neuron's cell membrane, leading to a temporary change in the membrane's voltage. This process occurs in several stages: 1. Resting state: In the resting state, a neuron has a negative membrane potential (typically around -70 millivolts). This is due to a higher concentration of potassium ions (K+) inside the cell and a higher concentration of sodium ions (Na+) outside the cell. 2. Depolarization: When a stimulus is received, the neuron's membrane becomes permeable to sodium ions, which rush into the cell. This influx of positive ions causes the membrane potential to become more positive, a process called depolarization. If the potential reaches a particular threshold (usually around -55 millivolts), an action potential is triggered. 3. Action potential: The action potential is the rapid depolarization and subsequent repolarization of the neuron's membrane potential. As it reaches its peak (around +40 millivolts), voltage-gated sodium channels close, and voltage-gated potassium channels open, allowing potassium ions to flow out of the cell. This efflux of positive ions causes the membrane potential to drop back towards its resting state. 4. Hyperpolarization and refractory period: As the membrane potential approaches its resting state, there is a brief period of time in which the membrane becomes hyperpolarized (more negative than the resting state). During this period, the neuron is less likely to generate another action potential, known as the refractory period. 5. Return to resting state: The neuron's membrane potential eventually returns to its resting state, and the neuron is ready to receive another stimulus and generate another action potential. In summary, when a neuron is excited, it creates an action potential – a rapidly changing electrical signal that travels along the neuron and helps process and transmit information throughout the nervous system."},{"question":"Zase lžete.

A:","response":"Title: Decent App for Managing Superuser Permissions, Needs Improvement Review: I've been using the com.koushikdutta.superuser app for a while now, and my experience has been a bit of a mixed bag. I would give it a 3-star rating out of 5 for its overall performance and functionality. On a positive note, the app does fulfill its main purpose of providing users control over their device's superuser permissions. As a tech-savvy person, I appreciate having the ability to manage these permissions to ensure that only authorized apps get access to such crucial system controls. The interface is also user-friendly, and the app is relatively easy to set up and use. However, there are a few areas that could use improvement. Firstly, the app tends to be a bit unstable at times, crashing or freezing more often than I would like. While this issue is not persistent, it can be quite frustrating when it occurs. The updates for the app are few and far between, and I feel this could be a significant factor behind its stability issues. More frequent updates would address these concerns by incorporating bug fixes and the latest security patches. Finally, I believe the app could benefit from expanded compatibility with more devices and custom ROMs. While it works well on some of my gadgets, it has not been fully compatible with others, requiring me to search for alternative solutions in those cases. In conclusion, the com.koushikdutta.superuser app offers a satisfactory solution for users looking to manage superuser permissions on their devices. There's significant potential for improvement, and I am hopeful that future updates will address the issues of instability, device/Rom compatibility, and more frequent software updates."},{"question":"Question: Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: A lethal disappointment Review: This compilation of songs from the lethal weapon movies would be better if they were the ones from the original recording artist as heard in the movies.

At the heart of this lies the technology industry, growing by 20% annually. The government is vigorously promoting its vision of creating a Silicon Savannah that can take on the developed world. To do this, as well as the more traditional forms of investment, human capital is needed. The population is one of the most educated in the region, unemployment is running at around 40% - yet technology companies are struggling to hire enough qualified talent. Something that could, if left unchecked, derail Kenya's technology explosion. In one of Nairobi's many gated suburbs, tucked away behind a luxuriant hedge, is Computer Revolution Africa. The IT company occupies a sprawling colonial bungalow in the middle of a shady garden. For director Simon Kinuthia recruiting new graduates to join the team has been tough. \\"I would say it has been a nightmare,\\" he says. \\"We do not get the right people from the universities and tertiary institutions where we expect technology-trained students to come from. \\"Modern technology is simply not available in colleges, so we have to bring them in and train them and bring them up to speed before we send them to the clients.\\" His company is taking part in a internship project run by an NGO called NetHope and technology giant Microsoft. After a rigorous selection process, 400 computer science graduates are whittled down to 40. The successful group are then trained at the NetHope Academy - partly funded by a Microsoft grant. Then the interns are placed with companies, about half through Microsoft partners, to gain that all-important practical experience. \\"[The course] was actually very vigorous but it was also very interesting and I got to learn a lot,\\" says current intern Lease Mutisya. \\"It opened my eyes to the IT world ... to the very many possibilities out there, so I was actually better placed to choose. Things are explained more in detail and things that never used to make sense began making sense.\\" The interns are paid a stipend, and the placements last 6 months. Another intern, Dennis Gichuhi explains what the chance means to him \\"Actually getting this place is more of a golden opportunity, and it means a lot to me, because it's like achieving one of my dreams.\\" The project is more than just a philanthropic gesture according to Microsoft's Mark Matunga. \\"Obviously the impact is clear that there will be stagnated growth in the technology sector, technology being an agent of growth in the 21st century,\\" he says. \\"When you don't have a qualified workforce in a country then you're facing stagnated economic growth, stagnated social issues.\\" It's not only in the technology sector where companies and jobseekers alike have problems finding a good fit. Nancy Wang is one of a generation of young entrepreneurs that has migrated to east Africa to make their fortune, arriving here in 2006. After running her own business in South Sudan for five years, she returned to Nairobi looking for opportunities. When a Kenyan friend of hers came to her house to polish up her CV and apply for some jobs she realised she had found a gap in the market. In Kenya, job-hunting can mean a lengthy journey across town by bus to an internet café, the constant expense of paying for newspapers, and most likely relying word of mouth. \\"Information is so hard to come by, whereas you know the affluent, they get a lot of job information because family members or communities are able to link them to the right opportunities,\\" she says. \\"Whereas if you are a fresh graduate living in Kisumu, or even more rural outside of the major cities, it's very difficult for you to hear about the job information or opportunities.\\" This was the inspiration for recruitment platform M-Kazi. Kazi is Swahili for job. This is more than just a job listings website. Designed for a country where many people have limited access to the internet - but where just over 70% of the population has access to a mobile - it works on the most basic mobile phone handsets. Job seekers register their details from their phones using technology called Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) - a sort of souped-up text message system that works more like a secure form of chat. Vacancies tailored to their experience and qualifications are then texted to them each day, as well as job-hunting tips. One trip to the internet café is still necessary, to upload their CV. But after that users can send a coded text, and it will be sent with a generic covering letter to prospective employers. Sylvia Wamuyu lives in Nairobi. The 24-year-old has been looking for work since the beginning of the year. \\"It has been tough getting a job since most of the applications you send no one ever replies, even with a regret if you never made it to be shortlisted,\\" she says. \\"Other agencies take your money with the hopes of getting you a job but only to find that they were fraudsters.\\" She started using M-Kazi several weeks ago and since then has landed a job as a receptionist with printing and marketing company Identity Partners. Her new employer is Monicah Ngongoo. As a small business employing four people, finding reliable staff has been difficult, especially as she relied on referrals from family and friends. \\"This has been the biggest issue for me when I started my business, as I ended up with inexperienced personnel,\\" she says. \\"The best thing about M-Kazi is that I didn't have to go through irrelevant CVs, as the ones I received were filtered to the category I wanted, it was so easy as I had to call only four people for an interview. \\"It has made things so easy, especially for small business like mine, as I cannot afford to use HR companies as they are expensive for the percentage they are charging, or newspaper advertising.\\" The service is fairly new, so for now it is free for employers to post jobs, while the young company builds up a comprehensive database. Employees are charged a nominal amount for text messages containing vacancies. Current estimates put the population of Nairobi at around 3m - and it's growing fast. Getting the right people into the right jobs - and finding ways to harness technology to make that happen may ultimately ensure that this expansion in population is mirrored by one in the economy, rather than in unemployment levels. A summary of the above article is?","response":"Kenya's technology industry is growing very fast, about 20% each year.

Solve -26*n + 119*n + 1395 = 0 for n.","response":"To solve the equation -26n + 119n + 1395 = 0 for n, follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms. The equation has two terms with the variable n, namely -26n and 119n. We can combine them as follows: (-26n + 119n) + 1395 = 0 93n + 1395 = 0 Step 2: Isolate the variable. To isolate n, we want to get rid of the 1395 term on the left side and have n alone. We can do that by subtracting 1395 from both sides of the equation: 93n + 1395 - 1395 = 0 - 1395 93n = -1395 Step 3: Solve for n. Now, we can find the value of n by dividing both sides of the equation by 93: 93n / 93 = -1395 / 93 n = -15 So, the solution to the equation -26n + 119n + 1395 = 0 is n = -15."},{"question":"Write the next sentence in the following story.

It entered service late in the war (1944) and saw service on the Eastern and Western Fronts. The \\"Jagdpanther\\" combined the very powerful 8.8 cm KwK 43 cannon of the Tiger II and the characteristically excellent armor and suspension of the Panther chassis, although it suffered from the general poor state of German ordnance production, maintenance and training in the later part of the war, which resulted in small production numbers, shortage in spare parts and poor crew readiness. - The Pak 43 ( Panzerabwehrkanone 43 ) was a German 88 mm anti-tank gun developed by Krupp in competition with the Rheinmetall 8.8 cm Flak 41 anti-aircraft gun and used during the Second World War . The Pak 43 was the most powerful anti-tank gun of the Wehrmacht to see service in significant numbers , also serving in modified form as the 8.8 cm KwK 43 main gun on the Tiger II tank , to the open - top Nashorn , and fully enclosed , casemate - hulled Elefant and Jagdpanther tank destroyers . The improved 8.8 cm gun had a very flat trajectory out to 914 m ( 1,000 yd ) , making it easier for the gunner to hit targets at longer ranges as fewer corrections in elevation were needed . In addition to this , the gun 's exceptional penetration performance made it able to frontally penetrate any Allied tank to see service during the war at long ranges , even the Soviet IS - 2 tanks and IS chassis - based tank destroyers . The gun 's maximum firing range exceeded 13 kilometers ( 8 miles ) . - The 8.8 cm KwK 43 L/71 (Kampfwagenkanone \\"fighting vehicle cannon\\") was an 88 mm 71 calibre tank gun designed by Krupp and used by the German Wehrmacht during the Second World War. It was mounted as the primary armament on the Panzerkampfwagen VI Ausf. B \\"Tiger II\\" and the 8.8 cm PaK 43, an anti-tank gun, was very similar in design and use albeit not mounted on tanks but rather on tank destroyers or deployed on the field. - Düsseldorf (Low Franconian, Ripuarian: \\"Düsseldörp\\" ) is the capital city of the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia and the seventh most populous city in Germany. Düsseldorf is an international business and financial centre, renowned for its fashion and trade fairs. The city is headquarters to one Fortune Global 500 and two DAX companies. Messe Düsseldorf organises nearly one fifth of premier trade shows. - Nashorn (German \\"rhinoceros\\", pronounced [nashn]), initially known as Hornisse (German \\"hornet\\"), was a German tank destroyer of World War II. It was developed as an interim solution in 1942 by equipping a light turretless chassis with the Pak 43 heavy anti-tank gun. Though only lightly armoured and displaying a high profile, it could frontally penetrate any Allied tank at long range, and its relatively low cost and superior mobility to heavier vehicles ensured it remained in production until the war's end. - Hornets (insects in the genera Vespa and Provespa) are the largest of the eusocial wasps, and are similar in appearance to their close relatives yellow jackets. Some species can reach up to in length. They are distinguished from other vespine wasps by the relatively large top margin of the head and by the rounded segment of the abdomen just behind the waist. Worldwide, there are 22 recognized species of \\"Vespa\\", and three species of \\"Provespa\\", which are unique amongst hornets in being nocturnal. Most species only occur in the tropics of Asia, though the European hornet (\\"Vespa crabro\\"), is widely distributed throughout Europe, Russia, North America and Northeast Asia. Wasps native to North America in the genus \\"Dolichovespula\\" are commonly referred to as hornets (e.g. baldfaced hornets), but are actually yellowjackets. - Essen (Latin: \\"Assindia\\") is a city in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.

Under Hitler's rule, Germany was transformed into a fascist state in which the Nazi Party took totalitarian control over nearly all aspects of life. The official name of the state was \\"Deutsches Reich\\" from 1933 to 1943 and \\"Großdeutsches Reich\\" (\\"Greater German Reich\\") from 1943 to 1945. The period is also known under the names the Third Reich and the National Socialist Period (abbreviated as \\"NS-Zeit\\"). The Nazi regime came to an end after the Allied Powers defeated Germany in May 1945, ending World War II in Europe. - The Kriegsmarine (\\"War Navy\\") was the navy of Nazi Germany from 1935 to 1945.

It consisted of the \\"Heer\\" (army), the \\"Kriegsmarine\\" (navy) and the \\"Luftwaffe\\" (air force). The designation \\"Wehrmacht\\" for Nazi Germany's military replaced the previously used term, \\"Reichswehr\\" (191935), and was the manifestation of Nazi Germany's efforts to rearm the nation to a greater extent than the Treaty of Versailles permitted. - The Treaty of Versailles was the most important of the peace treaties that brought World War I to an end. The Treaty ended the state of war between Germany and the Allied Powers. It was signed on 28 June 1919, exactly five years after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. The other Central Powers on the German side of World War I signed separate treaties. Although the armistice, signed on 11 November 1918, ended the actual fighting, it took six months of Allied negotiations at the Paris Peace Conference to conclude the peace treaty. The treaty was registered by the Secretariat of the League of Nations on 21 October 1919. - Rheinmetall AG is an automotive parts supplier and military technology group headquartered in Düsseldorf. In fiscal 2015 (2014), the company's 20,676 (20,166) employees generated sales of €5.18 billion (€4.68 billion). Rheinmetall was the tenth-largest European defence contractor in 2011. - U-boat is the anglicised version of the German word U-Boot , a shortening of Unterseeboot, literally \\"undersea boat\\". While the German term refers to any submarine, the English one (in common with several other languages) refers specifically to military submarines operated by Germany, particularly in the First and Second World Wars. Although at times they were efficient fleet weapons against enemy naval warships, they were most effectively used in an economic warfare role (commerce raiding), enforcing a naval blockade against enemy shipping. The primary targets of the U-boat campaigns in both wars were the merchant convoys bringing supplies from Canada, the British Empire, and the United States to the United Kingdom and (during the Second World War) to the Soviet Union and the Allied territories in the Mediterranean. - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate.

Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf. - The Elefant (German for \\"elephant\\") was a heavy tank destroyer used by German Wehrmacht Panzerjäger during World War II. It was built in small numbers in 1943 under the name Ferdinand after its designer Ferdinand Porsche, using tank hulls that had been produced for the Tiger I tank requirement which was rejected in favour of a Henschel design. - Ferdinand Porsche (3 September 1875 30 January 1951) was an automotive engineer and founder of the Porsche car company. He is best known for creating the first gasoline-electric hybrid vehicle (Lohner-Porsche), the Volkswagen Beetle, the Mercedes-Benz SS/SSK, several other important developments and Porsche automobiles. In addition, Porsche designed the 1923 Benz Tropfenwagen, which was the first racing car with a mid-engine, rear-wheel drive layout. - The Krupp family (see pronunciation), a prominent 400-year-old German dynasty from Essen, have become famous for their production of steel, artillery, ammunition, and other armaments. The family business, known as Friedrich Krupp AG, was the largest company in Europe at the beginning of the 20th century. It was important to weapons development and production in both world wars. One of the most powerful dynasties in European history, for 400 years Krupp flourished as the premier weapons manufacturer for Germany. From the Thirty Years' War until the end of the Second World War, they produced everything from battleships, U-boats, tanks, howitzers, guns, utilities, and hundreds of other commodities. - The Luftwaffe was the aerial warfare branch of the combined German Wehrmacht military forces during World War II. Germany's military air arms during the First World War, the \\"Luftstreitkräfte\\" of the Army and the \\"Marine-Fliegerabteilung\\" of the Navy, had been disbanded in May 1920 as a result of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles which stated that Germany was forbidden to have any air force.

Article: We know, painkillers in a tablet can make your headache go away, and antibiotic from a tube can prevent your cuts from becoming infected. Can medicine come in chicken eggs? A team of scientists from Scotland says \\"yes.\\" They've kept some special chickens that lay eggs with disease-treating drugs inside. These drugs are made of molecules called proteins. Animals make thousands of proteins--they're the main ingredients in skin, hair, milk, and meat. Since animals can make proteins easily, they're good animals for making protein drugs. Researchers have already made cows, sheep, and goats that pump out protein drugs in their milk. But chickens are cheaper to take care of, need less room, and grow faster than these other animals. \\"Those qualities could make chickens a better choice to become living drug factories.\\" says Simon Lillico of the Roslin Institute near Edinburgh, Scotland. Lillico and a team of researchers changed chickens' DNA--the code that tells cells how to make proteins--so that the birds' cells made two protein drugs. One drug can treat skin cancer, and the other treats a nerve disease called multiple sclerosis. The scientists changed the chickens' DNA so that the birds made these drugs only in their egg whites. This protects the chickens' bodies from the drugs' possible harmful effects and makes it easy for scientists to collect the drugs. These special chickens can pass on their drug-laying abilities to their chicks. So far, the Scottish researchers have kept five generations of drug-producing chickens. But the scientists need to improve these chickens. The chickens don't make enough drugs to treat people yet. Once the researchers perfect their technique, you might eventually take your medicine from chicken eggs. Question: Which of the following is Not True according to the passage? Answer: A:","response":"The chickens make enough drugs to treat people currently."},{"question":"Given the question: Facts: - birth date: 3 may 1960 - name: maría patricia franco cruz - nationality: mexican - birth place: state of mexico , mexico - occupation: politician Based on these bullet points, write a short biography describing the life of maría patricia franco cruz .

Vaikka tehtävää on vielä runsaasti, on tärkeää tunnustaa ne merkittävät edistysaskeleet, joita olemme ottaneet kansainvälisen yhteistyön avulla. Näiden askelten tarkoituksena on ollut ratkaista joitakin maailman vaikeimmista ongelmista sekä kehittää strategioita ja resursseja niiden voittamiseksi. Kansainvälisten sitoumusten ja diplomatian avulla olemme pystyneet rakentamaan yhteistyön siltoja valtioiden ja järjestöjen välille, mikä on ollut kriittinen tekijä monissa nykyisissä ja aikaisemmissa edistysaskelissa. Etenkin YK:n kestävän kehityksen tavoitteet (SDG:t) ovat onnistuneet saamaan valtiot, yritykset ja sidosryhmät sitoutumaan niihin ja etsimään yhdessä hankkeita, jotka vievät maailmaa kohti kestävämpää ja tasa-arvoisempaa tulevaisuutta. Toinen esimerkki kansainvälisistä sitoumuksista, jotka ovat mahdollistaneet edistymisen, on Pariisin ilmastosopimus. Sopimuksen myötä lähes kaikki maailman maat ovat sitoutuneet vähentämään kasvihuonekaasupäästöjään siirtyäkseen kohti hiilineutraalia tulevaisuutta. Vaikka Pariisin sopimuksen tavoitteet ovatkin kunnianhimoisia, olemme havainneet, että maiden ja yritysten konkreettiset toimenpiteet ovat jo alkaneet vaikuttaa asioihin, kuten uusiutuvan energian käyttöönottoon ja metsien säilymiseen. Edistymisestä huolimatta meidän ei pidä unohtaa, että vastuullisuus jaetaan niiden maiden kesken, jotka ovat sitoutuneet toimimaan. Meidän on jatkettava intensiivistä työtä paikallisten, kansallisten ja globaalien tavoitteiden saavuttamiseksi.

Helpfulness of employees: The review states that the employees at Kohl's and Target are really helpful. I will give this factor a score of 5. 2. Cleanliness: The reviewer mentions the store stays nice and clean. I will give this factor a score of 5 too. 3. Convenience: The Kohl's store is conveniently located right next to a Target, which the reviewer seems to appreciate. I will give this factor another score of 5. 4.

Nigel Reuben Rook Williams (15 July 1944 – 21 April 1992) was an English conservator and expert on the restoration of ceramics and glass. From 1961 until his death he worked at the British Museum, where he became the Chief Conservator of Ceramics and Glass in 1983. There his work included the successful restorations of the Sutton Hoo helmet and the Portland Vase. Joining as an assistant at age 16, Williams spent his entire career, and most of his life, at the British Museum. He was one of the first people to study conservation, not yet recognised as a profession, and from an early age was given responsibility over high-profile objects. In the 1960s he assisted with the re-excavation of the Sutton Hoo ship-burial, and in his early- to mid-twenties he conserved many of the objects found therein: most notably the Sutton Hoo helmet, which occupied a year of his time. He likewise reconstructed other objects from the find, including the shield, drinking horns, and maplewood bottles. The \\"abiding passion of his life\\" was ceramics, and the 1970s and 1980s gave Williams ample opportunities in that field. After nearly 31,000 fragments of shattered Greek vases were found in 1974 amidst the wreck of HMS Colossus, Williams set to work piecing them together. The process was televised, and turned him into a television personality. A decade later, in 1988 and 1989, Williams's crowning achievement came when he took to pieces the Portland Vase, one of the most famous glass objects in the world, and put it back together. The reconstruction was again televised for a BBC programme, and as with the Sutton Hoo helmet, took nearly a year to complete. Williams died at age 47 of a heart attack while in Aqaba, Jordan, where he was working on a British Museum excavation. The Ceramics & Glass group of the Institute of Conservation awards a biennial prize in his honour, recognising his significant contributions in the field of conservation.

Article: After studying the daily habits of 177 self-made millionaires over the course of five years, Thomas C. Corley found that they avoid one costly habit: procrastination . \\"It prevents even the most talented individuals from realizing success in life,\\" he writes in his upcoming book, \\"Change Your Habits, Change Your Life.\\" This goes hand-in-hand with author Napoleon Hill's claim that the wealthiest people are also the most decisive people. Out of the 500 millionaires Hill studied in the early 20thcentury, \\"Every one of them had the habit of reaching decisions quickly,\\" Hill wrote in his 1937 classic, \\"Think and Grow Rich.\\" One of the major causes of procrastination is lack of passion, Corley emphasizes: \\"We simply like to do the things we like to do and we put off the things we do not like to do.\\" \\"According to Gallup, only 13% of employees are 'engaged' in their jobs, or emotionally invested in their work,\\" Corley writes. \\"Whether you realize it or not, procrastination is a big reason why you are struggling financially in life. It damages your credibility with employers and fellow colleagues at work. It also affects the quality of your work and this affects the business you or your employer receive from customers, clients, and business relationships.\\" The good news is that anyone can overcome procrastination -- and it's simpler than you may think. He also notes that \\"the voice of procrastination screams just as loud and clear in the minds of those who _ in life as it does in the minds of those who do not.\\" How do they silence it? They rely on \\"to-do\\" lists to get things done. They create firm deadlines, and they meet with \\"accountability partners\\" to ensure they're sticking to their goals and deadlines, Corley says. Nearly everyone is susceptible to procrastination -- but fighting against it can make all the difference.

Are the following two questions the same? How do I download movies without torrents with subtitles? How do I install subtitles to a downloaded movie? Available options: (i). no; (ii). yes; The answer is:","response":"(i). no; The two questions you've provided are not the same, but they are related. Let me explain each question in detail, so you can understand the differences and connections between them. 1. How do I download movies without torrents with subtitles? This question is asking about downloading movies that are not using torrent technology and already include subtitles. There are a few methods for downloading movies without torrents: A. Streaming services: Subscribing to a streaming service like Netflix, Hulu, or Amazon Prime offers an extensive library of movies with subtitles. All you need is a subscription and a compatible device to watch them. B. Direct download sites: Some websites provide direct download links for movies with subtitles. Websites like Openload, Rapidgator, and Nitroflare are a few examples where you may find movies to download, but beware of potential legal issues or malware risks. C. Usenet: Usenet is an internet discussion system that allows users to download binary files, including movies and subtitles, through NZB files and a newsreader client. However, using Usenet typically requires a subscription to a Usenet provider, and the learning curve may be higher than for other methods. When downloading movies through any of these options, subtitles can often be found either as separate files or already embedded in the video files. 2. How do I install subtitles to a downloaded movie? This question is about adding subtitles to a movie that you've already downloaded, which may not have come with subtitles initially. Here are some steps to follow: A. Find and download subtitle files: First, visit a subtitle website such as OpenSubtitles, Subscene, or YIFY Subtitles, and search for the movie title. Subtitle files usually come in SRT, ASS, or SUB formats. Make sure to download the correct language and format of your choice. B. Rename the subtitle file: Make sure the subtitle file has the same name as the movie file (aside from the file extension). For instance, if your movie file is \\"example_movie.mp4,\\" your subtitle file should be \\"example_movie.srt\\" (or whichever format it's in). C. Load subtitles in a media player: Use a media player such as VLC or MPC-HC, which supports external subtitle files. Most media players have a \\"load subtitles\\" or \\"add subtitles\\" option in the menu or right-click context menu. Alternatively, you can drag and drop the subtitle file onto the media player while it's playing the movie. In conclusion, while the two questions you've provided are connected, they are not the same. The first question is about downloading movies that already have subtitles included with them, whereas the second question is about adding subtitles to a movie that has already been downloaded without subtitles."},{"question":"What is the title of this article: In the following decades there was a constant battle between the company lobby and the Parliament.

His father, William Terence McQueen, was a stunt pilot for a barnstorming flying circus who left McQueen's mother, Julia Ann (a.k.a. Julian; nee Crawford), six months after meeting her. Several biographers have stated that Julia Ann was an alcoholic. In 1952, with financial assistance provided by the G.I. Bill, McQueen began studying acting in New York at Sanford Meisner's Neighborhood Playhouse. Reportedly, he delivered his first dialogue on a theatre stage in a 1952 play produced by Yiddish theatre star Molly Picon. McQueen's character spoke one brief line: \\"Alts iz farloyrn.\\" (\\"All is lost.\\"). During this time, he also studied acting with Stella Adler in whose class he met Gia Scala. McQueen began to earn money by competing in weekend motorcycle races at Long Island City Raceway and purchased the first of many motorcycles, a Harley-Davidson and Triumph. He soon became an excellent racer, and went home each weekend with about 100 in winnings (equivalent to 900 in 2017). He appeared as a musical judge in an episode of ABC's Jukebox Jury, that aired in the 1953-1954 season. McQueen had minor roles in productions including Peg o' My Heart, The Member of the Wedding, and Two Fingers of Pride. He made his Broadway debut in 1955 in the play A Hatful of Rain, starring Ben Gazzara. In late 1955, at the age of 25, McQueen left New York and headed for California, where he moved into a house on Vestal Avenue in the Echo Park area, seeking acting jobs in Hollywood. When McQueen appeared in a two-part television Westinghouse Studio One presentation entitled The Defenders, Hollywood manager Hilly Elkins (who managed McQueen's first wife, Neile) took note of him and decided that B-movies would be a good place for the young actor to make his mark. He landed his first film role in a bit part in Somebody Up There Likes Me, directed by Robert Wise and starring Paul Newman. McQueen was subsequently hired for the films Never Love a Stranger, The Blob (his first leading role) which depicts a flesh eating amoeba-like space creature, and The Great St. Louis Bank Robbery. McQueen's first breakout role came on television. He appeared on Dale Robertson's NBC western series, Tales of Wells Fargo. Elkins, then McQueen's manager, successfully lobbied Vincent M. Fennelly, producer of the western series Trackdown, to have McQueen read for the part of bounty hunter Josh Randall in a Trackdown episode. McQueen appeared as Randall in the episode, cast opposite series lead and old New York motorcycle racing buddy Robert Culp. McQueen then filmed the pilot episode, which became the series titled Wanted: Dead or Alive, which aired on CBS in September 1958. In 1971 McQueen starred in the poorly received auto-racing drama Le Mans. Then came Junior Bonner in 1972, a story of an aging rodeo rider. He worked for director Sam Peckinpah again with the leading role in The Getaway, where he met future wife Ali MacGraw. He followed this with a physically demanding role as a Devil's Island prisoner in 1973's Papillon, featuring Dustin Hoffman as his character's tragic sidekick. In 1973 The Rolling Stones referred to McQueen in the song \\"Star Star\\" from the album Goats Head Soup for which an amused McQueen reportedly gave personal permission. The lines were \\"Star , star , star , star star/ Yes you are, yes you are, yes you are/Yeah, Ali MacGraw got mad with you/For givin' head to Steve McQueen\\". By the time of The Getaway, McQueen was the world's highest-paid actor, but after 1974's The Towering Inferno, co-starring with his long-time professional rival Paul Newman and reuniting him with Dunaway, became a tremendous box-office success, McQueen all but disappeared from the public eye, to focus on motorcycle racing and traveling around the country in a motor home and on his vintage Indian motorcycles. He did not return to acting until 1978 with An Enemy of the People, playing against type as a bearded, bespectacled 19th-century doctor in this adaptation of a Henrik Ibsen play. The film was never properly released theatrically. His last two films were loosely based on true stories: Tom Horn, a Western adventure about a former Army scout-turned professional gunman who worked for the big cattle ranchers hunting down rustlers, and later hanged for murder in the shooting death of a sheepherder, and The Hunter, an urban action movie about a modern-day bounty hunter, both released in 1980. In 1998 director Paul Street created a commercial for the Ford Puma. Footage was shot in modern-day San Francisco, set to the theme music from Bullitt. Archive footage of McQueen was used to digitally superimpose him driving and exiting the car in settings reminiscent of the film. The Puma shares the same number plate of the classic fastback Mustang used in Bullitt, and as he parks in the garage (next to the Mustang), he pauses and looks meaningfully at a motorcycle tucked in the corner, similar to that used in The Great Escape. In 2005, Ford used his likeness again, in a commercial for the 2005 Mustang. In the commercial, a farmer builds a winding racetrack, which he circles in the 2005 Mustang. Out of the cornfield comes Steve McQueen. The farmer tosses his keys to McQueen, who drives off in the new Mustang. McQueen's likeness was created using a body double (Dan Holsten) and digital editing. Ford secured the rights to McQueen's likeness from the actor's estate licensing agent, GreenLight, for an undisclosed sum. At the Detroit Auto Show in January 2018, Ford unveiled the new 2019 Mustang Bullitt. The company called on McQueen's granddaughter, actress Molly McQueen, to make the announcement. After a brief rundown of the tribute car's particulars, a short film was shown in which Molly was introduced to the actual Bullitt Mustang, a 1968 Mustang Fastback with a 390 cubic-inch engine and a four-speed manual gearbox. That car has been in possession of the same family since 1974 and hidden away from the public until now, when it was driven out from under the press stand and up the center aisle of Ford's booth to much fanfare. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What was the result of this?","response":"As a result of Ford unveiling the new 2019 Mustang Bullitt at the Detroit Auto Show in January 2018, they called upon McQueen's granddaughter, actress Molly McQueen, to make the announcement.

Answer: There is generally nothing competitive at stake and some rules may be changed or experimented with (such as unlimited substitutions, which allow teams to play younger, less experienced, players, and no cards). Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","response":"Answer: In friendly games, participants often prioritize enjoyment, skill development, and socializing over strict adherence to the rules. As a result, many friendlies see alterations to standard regulations in order to foster a more relaxed and inclusive atmosphere. One of the most common rule changes implemented in these settings is the allowance of unlimited substitutions. Unlimited substitutions provide several benefits, one of which is the opportunity to involve a greater number of players. Rather than adhering to the strict substitution limits often present in more competitive formats, unlimited substitutions ensure that all team members can participate actively in the game without fear of permanent exclusion following their exit. This serves to create a more inclusive environment in which players of varying skill levels are welcomed to contribute. Another advantage of allowing unlimited substitutions is the chance for younger and less experienced players to gain valuable game time without a significant impact on the overall outcome. In more competitive games, coaches and team decision-makers may be hesitant to field less experienced players due to the potential risk to the game's outcome. However, in a friendly setting where the primary focus is on development and enjoyment, allowing these individuals to gain experience can be highly beneficial for both the player and the team as a whole. The absence of cards in some friendlies is another example of a rule change that adds a more casual and relaxed atmosphere. This alteration helps to minimize confrontations between players and officials, ensuring that the primary focus remains on the game itself and the development of skills rather than punitive actions for minor rule violations. Additionally, this rule change can create a more positive environment for newer players who may be intimidated by the idea of receiving a card for what they perceive to be a trivial offense. In conclusion, friendly games often involve changes to the standard rules in order to create a more relaxed and inclusive atmosphere with an emphasis on enjoyment and skill development. Unlimited substitutions are one such example, facilitating greater involvement and promoting the growth of less experienced players. Other rule changes, such as the elimination of cards, further contribute to fostering a positive environment for players of all skill levels. These changes help to make friendly games an ideal setting for those seeking to learn, develop, and enjoy a sport without the pressures of a competitive atmosphere."},{"question":"Brent & Peggy, Memo complete with exception of last paragraph write-up of your promotions.

Brazenly taunting him with her sexuality, she bluntly dissects their prior relationshipâa nightmarish web of masochism, money, manipulation and dependency, pimping her out to dangerous clients in order to gain both a business advantage and perverse personal thrills. She outlines her newest ambition, since their estrangement, of raising the necessary capital to run a nightclub in Beijing. Miles makes no pretense of the fact that he is less interested in the proposal than the woman, and encourages her to visit him at his apartment. Without making any promises, Sandra leaves for her job at an import business, run by a young married couple: Lester and Sue Wong. Sandra's own import sideline, drug running, is facilitated by her close bond of loyalty with low-ranking employee Lisa. Acting as her driver and lookout, Lisa escorts Sandra to the site of a drug deal that quickly goes sour when her buyer is revealed to be a Narcotics officer. Suspicious after Sandra's cool response to his earlier queries about a missing container in a recent shipment, Lester follows Sandra to the deal and accosts Lisa as she waits in the car.

How many customers did all three of these women serve that day in total? Think carefully first, then make a decision:","response":"To calculate the total number of customers served by Ann, Becky, and Julia on that specific day, we will first need to calculate the number of customers served by each individual, then add those figures together. 1. Ann and Becky both work the full 8 hours. Since they each serve 7 customers per hour, we can calculate the number of customers they each served using the following formula: Customers served = (hours worked) × (customers per hour) For Ann and Becky: Customers served = 8 hours × 7 customers/hour Customers served = 56 customers (for each of them) 2. Julia worked only 6 hours on that day instead of the full 8 hours. Using the same formula, we can calculate the number of customers she served: For Julia: Customers served = 6 hours × 7 customers/hour Customers served = 42 customers 3. Lastly, to find the total number of customers served by all three of them, we add up the individual totals: Total customers served = (Ann's customers) + (Becky's customers) + (Julia's customers) Total customers served = 56 customers + 56 customers + 42 customers Total customers served = 154 customers So, Ann, Becky, and Julia served 154 customers in total on that specific day."},{"question":"Write a dialog with this premise \\"Beatriz is in Cambridge and it's raining heavily there.

In 1692, the Neapolitan painter Luca Giordano became one of the few allowed to view paintings held in Philip IV's private apartments, and was greatly impressed by Las Meninas. Giordano described the work as the \\"theology of painting\\", and was inspired to paint A Homage to Velázquez (National Gallery, London). By the early 18th century his oeuvre was gaining international recognition, and later in the century British collectors ventured to Spain in search of acquisitions. Since the popularity of Italian art was then at its height among British connoisseurs, they concentrated on paintings that showed obvious Italian influence, largely ignoring others such as Las Meninas.An almost immediate influence can be seen in the two portraits by Mazo of subjects depicted in Las Meninas, which in some ways reverse the motif of that painting. Ten years later, in 1666, Mazo painted Infanta Margaret Theresa, who was then 15 and just about to leave Madrid to marry the Holy Roman Emperor. In the background are figures in two further receding doorways, one of which was the new King Charles (Margaret Theresa's brother), and another the dwarf Maribarbola. A Mazo portrait of the widowed Queen Mariana again shows, through a doorway in the Alcázar, the young king with dwarfs, possibly including Maribarbola, and attendants who offer him a drink. Mazo's painting of The Family of the Artist also shows a composition similar to that of Las Meninas. Francisco Goya etched a print of Las Meninas in 1778, and later used Velázquez's painting as the model for his Charles IV of Spain and His Family. As in Las Meninas, the royal family in Goya's work is apparently visiting the artist's studio. In both paintings the artist is shown working on a canvas, of which only the rear is visible. Goya, however, replaces the atmospheric and warm perspective of Las Meninas with what Pierre Gassier calls a sense of \\"imminent suffocation\\". Goya's royal family is presented on a \\"stage facing the public, while in the shadow of the wings the painter, with a grim...

His parents divorced when he was four, and he was sent to Monroeville, Alabama, where, for the following four to five years, he was raised by his mother's relatives. He formed a fast bond with his mother's distant relative, Nanny Rumbley Faulk, whom Truman called \\"Sook\\". \\"Her face is remarkable - not unlike Lincoln's, craggy like that, and tinted by sun and wind\\", is how Capote described Sook in \\"A Christmas Memory\\" (1956). The critical success of one of his short stories, \\"Miriam\\" (1945), attracted the attention of the publisher Bennett Cerf, resulting in a contract with Random House to write a novel. With an advance of 1,500, Capote returned to Monroeville and began Other Voices, Other Rooms, continuing to work on the manuscript in New Orleans, Saratoga Springs, New York, and North Carolina, eventually completing it in Nantucket, Massachusetts. It was published in 1948. Capote described this symbolic tale as \\"a poetic explosion in highly suppressed emotion\\". The novel is a semi-autobiographical refraction of Capote's Alabama childhood. Decades later, writing in The Dogs Bark (1973), he commented: Other Voices, Other Rooms was an attempt to exorcise demons, an unconscious, altogether intuitive attempt, for I was not aware, except for a few incidents and descriptions, of its being in any serious degree autobiographical. Rereading it now, I find such self-deception unpardonable. The story focuses on 13-year-old Joel Knox following the loss of his mother. Joel is sent from New Orleans to live with his father, who abandoned him at the time of his birth. Arriving at Skully's Landing, a vast, decaying mansion in rural Alabama, Joel meets his sullen stepmother Amy, debauched transvestite Randolph, and defiant Idabel, a girl who becomes his friend. He also sees a spectral \\"queer lady\\" with \\"fat dribbling curls\\" watching him from a top window. Despite Joel's queries, the whereabouts of his father remain a mystery. When he finally is allowed to see his father, Joel is stunned to find he is a quadriplegic, having tumbled down a flight of stairs after being inadvertently shot by Randolph. Joel runs away with Idabel but catches pneumonia and eventually returns to the Landing, where he is nursed back to health by Randolph. The implication in the final paragraph is that the \\"queer lady\\" beckoning from the window is Randolph in his old Mardi Gras costume. Gerald Clarke, in Capote: A Biography (1988) described the conclusion: Finally, when he goes to join the queer lady in the window, Joel accepts his destiny, which is to be homosexual, to always hear other voices and live in other rooms. Yet acceptance is not a surrender; it is a liberation. \\"I am me\\", he whoops. \\"I am Joel, we are the same people.\\" So, in a sense, had Truman rejoiced when he made peace with his own identity.

If we're successful this year then we'll end 2018 on a much better trajectory.\\" Facebook was under much scrutiny in 2017 for a litany of issues, including admitting Russians bought ads with the intent to sway the 2016 U.S. elections. Its ad-targeting capabilities were also allowing companies to find potential customers using racially discriminatory and derogatory terms. Facebook is facing four major challenges as it matures as a company, said Aaron Shapiro, CEO of advertising agency Huge. The company needs to find its role in society, address mental health issues, assuage users' privacy concerns and remain relevant while growing revenue. But while Facebook has done a good job at acquiring companies like Instagram, it's never really addressed the other issues until now, Shapiro said. The most pressing issue Facebook has to address is fixing its \\"fake news\\" problem, said Ronn Torossian, founder and CEO of public relations firm 5WPR. His firm does crisis management for major technology companies. \\"We're living in an era where the president of the United States — arguably the most powerful person in the world — speaks about fake news as an issue every day,\\" Torossian said. \\"If you have a report coming out that says Facebook was a big purveyor of this fake news, you need to fix this thing.\\" Zuckerberg — who has taken on a personal challenge every year since 2009 — said in his post that one of the most interesting issues facing the technology industry is the concept of \\"centralization vs. decentralization.\\" Technology was expected to give people more control over their lives, he wrote. But as a handful of technology companies become the dominant players and governments used technology to monitor citizens, people increasingly believe technology is becoming a controlling, centralized power. \\"There are important counter-trends to this — like encryption and cryptocurrency — that take power from centralized systems and put it back into people's hands,\\" Zuckerberg wrote. \\"But they come with the risk of being harder to control. I'm interested to go deeper and study the positive and negative aspects of these technologies, and how best to use them in our services.\\" The fact that Facebook is used by more than a billion people on a daily basis makes it both an ideal communication tool and an easy way to spread misinformation, said eMarketer principal analyst Debra Aho Williamson. People see major tech companies as having vast control over their lives, and Facebook will have to learn how to balance its influence with public perception. \\"Recognizing its power, and understanding how that power can be used for both good and potentially bad purposes and doing something about that is probably Facebook's biggest challenge,\\" Williamson said. The fact that Zuckerberg is acknowledging the problems is admirable and positive, 5WPR's Torossian said. And saying he'll do so on his Facebook page is an intelligent move. \\"It's PR 101. ... He doesn't have to do an interview. He doesn't have to shout it from the rooftops. All he has to do is put it out on Facebook, and he controls the message,\\" Torossian said. See the full text of Zuckerberg's post below: ||||| Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg sets a personal challenge each year, a kind of public New Year’s resolution that he posts about all year long. A few years ago he set out to learn Mandarin. He also built a robot butler for his home. Last year, he toured America to spend more time with regular citizens (who were also likely Facebook users). Zuckerberg’s goal this year: Fix Facebook. Or at least improve some of the most important elements of Facebook that have gotten the company into hot water over the past 12 months, like its unintended role as a propaganda weapon for Russia during last year’s U.S. presidential election. Here’s how he described it in a post on Thursday. The world feels anxious and divided, and Facebook has a lot of work to do -- whether it’s protecting our community from abuse and hate, defending against interference by nation states, or making sure that time spent on Facebook is time well spent. My personal challenge for 2018 is to focus on fixing these important issues. We won’t prevent all mistakes or abuse, but we currently make too many errors enforcing our policies and preventing misuse of our tools. If we’re successful this year then we’ll end 2018 on a much better trajectory. You might be thinking: Well isn’t fixing a company’s issues already the job of the CEO? Yes, it is. And Zuckerberg seems to realize that too, adding that one of the reasons he’s choosing this challenge is so he won’t distract himself from Facebook’s important problems by going around and killing all his own food (that was his 2011 challenge). “This may not seem like a personal challenge on its face,” Zuckerberg continued. “But I think I’ll learn more by focusing intensely on these issues than I would by doing something completely separate.” Zuckerberg has been very philosophical over the past 12 months, regularly posting about his greater ambitions for tech and Facebook in particular. This time, Zuckerberg talked about the importance of “centralization vs decentralization” in tech — in other words, who is benefitting from tech’s tremendous power. “A lot of us got into technology because we believe it can be a decentralizing force that puts more power in people’s hands,” he wrote. “But today, many people have lost faith in that promise. With the rise of a small number of big tech companies — and governments using technology to watch their citizens — many people now believe technology only centralizes power rather than decentralizes it.” Facebook, of course, is one of those “big tech companies” with an immense amount of power. Not only does the company help shape the news for more than two billion people worldwide, but it controls a massive share of the global digital advertising market, which is making it difficult for smaller companies, including media companies, to survive. But Zuckerberg says he’s thinking about all of that and taking his role as the leader of one of the world’s premier tech giants very seriously. “This will be a serious year of self-improvement and I’m looking forward to learning from working to fix our issues together,” he wrote. Every year I take on a personal challenge to learn something new. I've visited every US state, run 365 miles, built an...

Carruth was convicted of conspiracy to murder his then-pregnant girlfriend in 2001. USA TODAY Sports Former Carolina Panthers NFL football player Rae Carruth, center rear, exits the Sampson Correctional Institution in Clinton, N.C., on Oct. 22,. Carruth has been released from prison after serving nearly 19 years for conspiring to murder the mother of his unborn child. (Photo: Jeff Siner, AP) CLINTON, N.C. — Former Carolina Panthers wide receiver Rae Carruth took his first steps as a free man in nearly 19 years, leaving the Sampson Correctional Institution after serving his prison sentence for plotting the death of his pregnant girlfriend. Carruth, 44, wore a black skull cap and black jacket as he emerged from the minimum-security facility. He got into a Chevy Tahoe without talking to the more than 20 news media members assembled nearby. The tires of the white SUV screeched as he left. Prison officials did not disclose who met Carruth and ferried him away from the facility. Carruth was convicted in 2001 for conspiracy to commit murder, using an instrument with intent to destroy an unborn child and discharging a firearm into occupied property in the shooting near Carruth’s Charlotte home on Nov. 16, 1999, that led to the death of Cherica Adams. Chancellor Lee Adams, Carruth's son whom the hitman testified Carruth wanted dead so he wouldn’t have to pay child support, was born premature and suffers from cerebral palsy. Carruth was acquitted of the most serious charge, first-degree murder, at trial. While he’s no longer incarcerated, Carruth will serve a nine-month supervised probation term related to his convictions. \\"I think Rae will acclimate pretty easily,\\" Gordon Widenhouse, an attorney who handled Carruth's appeal, told USA TODAY Sports. \\"He's a very engaging individual. He's intelligent. I think he will find a way to integrate himself back into society. \\"I think it's difficult any time for anyone who has been in prison any significant amount of time, and then they're released and try to find employment, find housing, make friends and try to be accepted within a community. I think Rae has a good attitude. He's taken care of himself while he was in prison. I think and hope he will find a way to make it in the real world. \\" Carruth has remained largely mum as he’s sat in various North Carolina prison facilities over the last nearly two decades, outside an interview with WBTV in February. \\"I'm apologizing for the loss of her daughter,” Carruth told the Charlotte-based TV station. “I'm apologizing for the impairment of my son. I feel responsible for everything that happened. And I just want her to know that truly I am sorry for everything.\\" In the interview, Carruth said he’d seek to gain “responsibility back” for raising Chancellor Lee Adams after his release, although he wrote to The Charlotte Observer he would “no longer be pursuing a relationship with Chancellor” or Saundra Adams, Cherica’s mother who has raised Chancellor. \\"I promise to leave them be, which I now see is in everyone’s best interest,” Carruth wrote. Carruth fled after the shooting before his capture in December 1999, in Tennessee as authorities found him hiding in the trunk of a car outside of a hotel. Carruth, a native of Sacramento, California, was drafted in the first round by the Panthers in 1997 after he played collegiately at the University of Colorado. He was a first-team All-American in 1996. Follow USA TODAY Sports' A.J. Perez on Twitter @byajperez. ||||| Former Carolina Panther Rae Carruth walked out of prison and back into the free world Monday. At 8:02 a.m. on a cold and clear October morning, Carruth was released from the minimum-custody facility at Sampson Correctional Institution, about 190 miles east of Charlotte. He will no longer be primarily identified as offender number 0712822 in the North Carolina prison system. He is now Rae Wiggins, also known as Rae Carruth, also known as a free man. About 10 TV trucks and a couple of dozen members of the media awaited Carruth’s release in a parking lot that bordered the prison. Carruth didn’t speak to reporters before entering a white Chevy Tahoe and being driven away. Tiffany Trice, a longtime friend of the Carruth family, said shortly after the release that Carruth “just wants to move on.” Be the first to know. No one covers what is happening in our community better than we do. And with a digital subscription, you'll never miss a local story. SIGN ME UP! “Rae was picked up by family this morning, and that’s about all we’re going to say right now,” Trice said by phone. She said she was with Carruth and that the former Panther didn’t want to do an interview and also didn’t want to disclose where he planned to live. Carruth must meet occasionally with authorities wherever he lives for a nine-month period as part of his post-release requirements. The Carolina Panthers’ first-round draft choice in 1997, Carruth served nearly 19 years in prison. In January 2001, a Charlotte jury convicted Carruth of conspiring to murder Cherica Adams, who was nearly eight months pregnant with Carruth’s child when she was shot four times inside her car on Nov. 16, 1999. At the time, Adams was Carruth’s on-and-off girlfriend. Carruth was 25 on the night Adams was ambushed in Charlotte. He was in the third year of a promising NFL career and boasted a net worth of approximately 368,000. Carruth is now 44 years old. His money is long gone, eaten up mostly by his legal defense. His 4.3 speed in the 40-yard dash is a thing of the past as well. His disabled son Chancellor Lee Adams turns 19 next month. SHARE COPY LINK Former Carolina Panther wide Rae Carruth was released from prison Oct. 22, 2018, after serving almost 19 years for conspiring to kill Cherica Adams. Adams was pregnant with Carruth's son Chancellor Lee at the time of the murder. Chancellor Lee has been raised since birth in Charlotte by his grandmother, Saundra Adams. Cherica Adams was her only biological child. Chancellor Lee was born by emergency C-section less than 90 minutes after his mother was shot. He has brain damage and cerebral palsy owing to the blood and oxygen that he was deprived of during the chaotic minutes after the gunshots. Cherica Adams didn’t die immediately of her wounds and saved Chancellor Lee’s life with her haunting 911 call. But she did pass away four weeks later in a Charlotte hospital. In 2016, Adams told me that she and Chancellor Lee planned to meet Carruth at the prison gates so that he could see his son and she could talk to him honestly about the crime he committed and its aftermath. In recent months, though, Saundra and Chancellor Adams both changed their minds about being in Clinton on the day of Carruth’s release. “We’re not going,” Saundra Adams told me Sunday. SHARE COPY LINK Saundra Adams expresses some concern as the man that planned her daughter's murder, Rae Carruth will be released from prison. Carruth, a former NFL rising star will be released from prison on October 22, 2018. Saundra Adams hasn’t ruled out Carruth and Chancellor Lee seeing each other at some point in the future, however. While Adams said she doesn’t believe she, Chancellor Lee and Carruth will ever have a sustained relationship, she also said she long ago forgave Carruth and doesn’t wish ill on him as he re-enters society. “I want to forgive him so that I can move on and enjoy the fruits of my labor and enjoy my life,” Adams said in a recent interview. “Because if I’m sitting around in unforgiveness, it’s like me drinking poison and hoping he’s going to die.” Reached on Monday after Carruth’s release, she said she didn’t want to make any further comments. Carruth hasn’t answered detailed questions about the night Cherica Adams was shot in 17 years. In a letter he wrote to me in care of the Charlotte Observer in March, he wrote that there was little point in doing so because he would always be considered the villain in this story. Wrote Carruth at the time: “In every great piece of literature, there’s always a protagonist and an antagonist. ... The latter applies to me — and that’s something that will never change. ... “There’s absolutely nothing that I could ever say or do to right my wrongs … to no longer be ‘the bad guy.’ ” Doesn’t argue with verdict Carruth’s murder conspiracy conviction stemmed from the fact that the jury believed that Carruth had hired a hitman, Van Brett Watkins, to shoot and kill Cherica Adams and destroy their unborn child so Carruth wouldn’t have to pay child support. Two co-conspirators — Watkins and Michael Kennedy, who drove the car used in the drive-by shooting and also acquired the gun Watkins used to shoot Adams — testified in court in 2000 that Carruth masterminded the murder plot. Carruth already had another son at the time of Cherica Adams’ shooting, and he was paying 3,000 a month in child support. That son is now 24. He and Carruth have talked on the phone regularly in the past few years. That son, like Chancellor Lee, never visited Carruth in prison, however, according to his mother, Michelle Wright. Carruth told WSOC-TV in a phone interview days before his release that he wished that Saundra Adams had brought Chancellor Lee to see him before his prison sentence ended. “I was really looking forward to the opportunity to see my son — to touch him, to hug him, to kiss him,” Carruth said of Chancellor Lee Adams. “All these things I’ve never had the opportunity to do. And I wanted to apologize to him in person for all that he’s been through.” SHARE COPY LINK The jury must now decide unanimously on the four charges facing Carruth. The charges are: first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder, using an instrument with intent to destroy an unborn child and discharging a firearm into occupied property. Carruth has never admitted to conspiring to murder Adams, a fact that still rankles Saundra Adams. In a compromise decision, a Charlotte jury convicted him on three counts, including conspiracy to commit murder, in 2001. But it acquitted Carruth of first-degree murder. Carruth’s lead defense lawyer, David Rudolf, spoke with the former NFL player in August at the prison and then was authorized to speak to the Observer by Carruth. Rudolf said in an interview that Carruth still maintains Watkins shot Adams on his own as an act of violent retribution after Carruth backed out of an agreement to finance a drug deal. However, Rudolf said, Carruth doesn’t argue with the jury’s compromise verdict even though Carruth tried to appeal it several times. “He (Carruth) sort of thinks it sort of came out probably where it should have,” Rudolf said of the jury’s verdict, “in that he was responsible for putting Cherica in that place.” The cage In February, Carruth wrote a letter to WBTV saying he would one day like to have primary guardianship of Chancellor Lee Adams. This infuriated Saundra Adams, who said at the time Carruth would never get primary custody of the son he once wanted dead. “He will never be raised by a stranger — someone he doesn’t know and who tried to kill him,” Adams said of Chancellor Lee. Carruth reversed course in a later letter to the Charlotte Observer, saying he understood his initial suggestion was a mistake and telling everyone to “please calm down” because he would not pursue custody of Chancellor Lee. Carruth has been in custody since he was found in a friend’s car trunk in Tennessee in December 1999, trying to hide from authorities in a space that was far smaller than a prison cell. When he was captured, Carruth’s pants were down around his knees and he had 3,900 and two bottles full of urine in the trunk with him, according to Mark Post, the FBI agent who caught Carruth. In 2000, while in jail, the former English major at Colorado wrote a poem called “How It Feels To Be Caged.” Carruth’s poem began: Think about how many times you’ve been to the zoo Ever wonder how it would feel if one of the animals were you? It ended: I bet you’ve never sensed the animals’ pain, humility or rage Because it’s impossible to conceive unless you’ve lived on both sides of the cage. Where Carruth goes next – or what he will do for a living, although he was a licensed barber in prison – is unclear. His future relationship with the son he was convicted of trying to kill is also muddy. But one thing is for sure: For the first time in nearly 19 years on Monday, Carruth switched sides of the cage. ||||| A summary of this is?","response":"Former NFL player Rae Carruth has been released from prison after serving nearly 19 years for conspiring to murder his then-pregnant girlfriend, Cherica Adams, in 1999.

The problem came when it turned out that a huge number of these concerned tabloid-reading parents were also absolute fucking morons. For every story of an actual sex offender being driven from their house by a baying mob there was one like that of Dr Yvette Cloete, a doctor at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport, South Wales, who returned home from work to find that a group of 'concerned parents' had daubed the word 'paedo' on her front door in bright red paint. Dr Cloete was a consultant paediatrician. Easy mistake. If you're an absolute fucking moron. And so it was that one hung-over morning, after reading yet another story about vigilantes who had threatened to stone Maxine Carr, the girlfriend of Soham killer Ian Huntley, to death during her high-profile trial for perverting the course of justice, I decided to set up a website parodying this collective national madness. The result of two or three hours of hung-over labour was thinkofthechildren.co.uk, a spoof campaign site which claimed to offer a handy online guide for crazy vigilantes of all stripes to co-ordinate their crazy vigilante efforts. Although there are a few parts of the site I'm still a bit proud of, the majority of it was, I freely admit, satire of the lowest order. Question: What color paint did the vandals use?

In this detailed analysis, we'll dissect the sentence to understand the negative sentiment. First, let's break down the sentence structure: 1. \\"that not only fails on its own\\" - This part of the sentence clearly shows a sense of failure. The use of \\"not only\\" amplifies the negative sentiment and tells us that there is something more to come. The fact that the subject in question \\"fails on its own\\" implies that it is incapable of succeeding or providing any satisfaction on an individual level. 2. \\"but makes you second-guess your affection for the original\\" - The conjunction \\"but\\" used here indicates a contrast, while \\"makes you second-guess\\" conveys a tone of doubt and disappointment. Furthermore, the term \\"your affection for the original\\" implies that the reader initially had a strong, positive emotional connection to the original item, but now, due to the subject under discussion, their confidence or faith in the original is being shaken. Taking the two parts of the sentence together, we can see that the negative sentiment comes from the incapability of the subject to succeed on its own, as well as the damage it does to one's appreciation of the original. The sentence implies that not only does the subject not meet expectations, it also has an adverse effect on something that was initially liked or appreciated, which effectively amplifies the negative sentiment. Overall, the combination of the two parts creates a sense of disapproval and disappointment, making the sentiment negative."},{"question":"QUEBEC CITY, CANADA — On the eve of the G-7 summit in Canada, the U.S. president lashed out at host Justin Trudeau and the White House announced Donald Trump would skip some of the sessions. In two tweets Thursday evening, Trump accused the Canadian prime minister, as well as French President Emmanuel Macron, of “charging the U.S. massive tariffs” and creating “non-monetary barriers.” Trump also said Trudeau was being “indignant” about the cross-border trade relationship. Later Thursday night, Trump took to Twitter again to urge the European Union and Canada to “Take down your tariffs & barriers or we will more than match you!” Trump’s tweets came after Macron threatened to exclude the United States from the G-7 final statement to be issued in the mountainous tourism destination of Charlevoix. In his own tweets in French and English, Macron stated that while Trump “may not mind being isolated” the other six leaders meeting in Canada would also not mind signing an agreement among themselves. “American jobs are on the line because of his actions and because of his administration,” Trudeau said at a joint news conference with Macron earlier in the day in Ottawa. “When we can underscore this, and we see that there’s a lot of pressure within the U.S., perhaps he will revise his position.” “A trade war doesn’t spare anyone,” Macron said. “It will start to hurt American workers. The cost of raw materials will rise and industry will become less competitive.” After the contentious salvos on social media and the Trudeau-Macron news conference, the White House announced Trump would depart the summit at 10:30 a.m. Saturday, following the session on women’s empowerment. \\"The president will travel directly to Singapore from Canada in anticipation of his upcoming meeting with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un Tuesday.

Maggie Gault (Kim Novak), one of his neighbors whose son is friends with his son, helps him get a commission to build a house for an eccentric writer named Roger Alter (Ernie Kovacs, for comic relief). Both Larry and Maggie are dissatisfied in their marriages. Larry's wife is too hard-headed and practical and Maggie's husband isn't interested in having sex with her (or maybe he can't). So they have an affair that involves lots of walking on the beach and having drinks in oceanside hideaways. They both know what they're doing is wrong, and they each love their spouses in their own way and they're devoted to their children.Felix Anders (Walter Matthau) is a dirty old man neighbor who snoops around and finds out about their affair. His leering and insinuations to Larry makes Larry realize the risks he's taking and he tells Maggie that they shouldn't see each other for a while. Felix, in the meantime, makes a play for Larry's wife Eve in an unbelievably creepy scene. In a way, Felix is a personification of the tawdriness of Larry and Maggie's affair.

[A]. negative [B]. positive","response":"The sentiment of the tweet \\"I just spilt some water on my jeans. http://twitgoo.com/78sn\\" can be considered as: [A]. negative To understand the reason behind this classification, let's analyze the tweet in more detail. Sentiment analysis is the process of identifying the emotion expressed in a piece of text, such as a tweet. It usually ranges from positive to negative, with neutral as a midpoint. In this particular tweet, the user states that they have spilled water on their jeans. This event is likely to evoke feelings of inconvenience, annoyance or frustration. Spilling water, or any liquid, on one's clothes is something that most people would consider to be unfortunate or undesirable, as it can cause discomfort, require immediate attention, and potentially ruin or damage the clothing. Therefore, it wouldn't be associated with a positive emotion or experience. Additionally, the accompanying link to a picture (http://twitgoo.com/78sn) could potentially serve as a visual reference to the incident, illustrating the unfavorable situation and strengthening the negative sentiment. However, the link is now inaccessible, so we cannot determine the exact impact it had on the tweet's sentiment. In conclusion, based on the context and the natural assumption that spilling water on one's jeans is not a desirable event, the sentiment for this tweet can be categorized as negative. Consequently, the appropriate choice from the given options would be [A]. negative."},{"question":"What's the most logical way to complete this passage?

South African midfielder Pattison finished high into the net after eight minutes after Rob Ramshaw had got the better of Craig Robinson near the touchline and pulled the ball back. But they needed a stoppage time second from Wright to overcome Warrington's spirited resistance. It was a moment to forget for goalkeeper Karl Wills, who tried to launch a late Warrington assault but saw his clearance fall straight to Wright, who finished into an empty net.

Bison, also known as Dictator, is a video game character created by Capcom. First introduced in Street Fighter II: The World Warrior, he is a recurring character and villain in the Street Fighter series of fighting games, acting as one of the series' primary antagonists. A would-be world dictator and megalomaniac, M. Bison's ultimate ambition is to control the world's governments through his covert crime syndicate, Shadaloo (shiyadoru, Shadoru, sometimes spelled as \\"Shadoloo\\", \\"Shadowloo\\" or \\"Shadowlaw\\"). He serves as the host of Street Fighter II's fighting tournament and is the last opponent fought in the game. Context: In Japan, the character is named Vega (bega, Bega), derived from the star of the same name. However, during localization of Street Fighter II for the English language market, Capcom's North American branch felt that the name did not sound threatening enough to North American audiences for the game's final boss, and thus was more suitable for the Spanish cage fighter Vega (Street Fighter). At this same time, another concern arose that the name of another character, Mike Bison, conceived as a parody of real-life boxer Mike Tyson, would be a legal liability for Capcom. As a result, the characters swapped names, and the game's final boss was dubbed M. Bison for international appearances of the character. Though the \\"M\\" originally stood for \\"Mike\\" in Japan, Capcom has never explained what it stands for in Western releases, calling it \\"part of the character's mystery\\". Regardless, Bison has been addressed as Master Bison in Street Fighter Alpha 3 repeatedly, as well as in the animated movie. In his introduction before a fight in (Super) Street Fighter IV, he refers to himself as \\"The Mighty Bison\\". In endings in Alpha 2, he is referred to by a henchman as Commander Bison. In Street Fighter V, he is referred to by F.A.N.G as Lord Bison. When developing Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie, it was decided to give him a more muscular appearance, rather than have him resemble \\"a middle aged man\\", while his face was modified to appear somewhat demonic. This appearance was later carried onto the Street Fighter Alpha series, featured as his original appearance before the Street Fighter II series. The first source of inspiration for M. Bison's design came from the character General Washizaki, one of the main villains of the popular martial arts manga Riki-Oh. However the final realized concept (especially the characters mysticism) is widely believed to be a homage to Yasunori Kato, the supernatural villain of the influential Teito Monogatari franchise. Question: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?. Whats the answer?","response":"The question asks for interesting aspects from the provided text. Drawing from the text, here are some noteworthy points: 1. The character M. Bison underwent a name swap in the English version of the game. Due to concerns over the original name 'Mike Bison' being a parody of the name of famous boxer Mike Tyson, the names of characters were changed. This was done to avoid legal liabilities. 2. The 'M' in 'M. Bison' stands for 'Mike' in Japan, but its meaning has been kept a mystery in Western releases. Sometimes it stands for 'Master', 'Mighty', 'Commander', and 'Lord Bison' depending on the game and context, which adds an interesting element to the character's identity. 3. The character's design was influenced by characters from martial arts manga and supernatural villains from other franchises.

We then join a squad of SH-60B Seahawk helicopters on approach to the USS Harry S. Truman off the coast of Africa, and a news reporter on the flight deck reporting on the coup taking place. His report is interrupted by the news of the whole presidential family being assassinated by rebel forces.Lieutenant Waters and his team of Navy SEALs disembark from a helicopter, returning from a mission to extract American citizens from the embassy. They are greeted by Captain Bill Rhodes on the deck who immediately informs them that they'll need to be reinserted to extract a critical personality immediately. After refitting for the next mission, eating and having their wounds tended by the medic they meet in the ships briefing room to get the details of their mission. They're instructed that they will Halo Jump over Cameroon and into the jungle outside of a small Catholic mission where they will find Dr. Lena Fiore Kendricks (an American citizen by marriage). Their secondary mission is to extract the priest and two nuns who run the mission if they are willing to go with them. Once they have their \\"package\\" they are to make a twelve kilometer hike to the designated extraction point where they'll be flown out by helicopter.The mission begins precisely as planned with the SEAL team dropping from the aircraft and free falling over the target area. After forcibly having a young Nigerian woman lead the SEALs to Kendricks, Waters informs Kendricks of the rebel company approaching the mission and that their orders are to extract U.S. personnel. Kendricks refuses to leave the mission without the people under her care. Waters contacts Rhodes to explore their options and after a short and ambiguous conversation concedes to the...

Here's what we will do step by step: 1. We start with the equation: 0 = -2 * z + 8 2. Our goal is to have just \\"z\\" on one side. First, let's get rid of the 8 on the right side. To do that, we will add -8 to both sides of the equation (because 8 + -8 = 0). It will look like this: (0 - 8) = -2 * z + (8 - 8) 3. Now, we calculate what's inside the parenthesis: -8 on the left side and 0 on the right side: -8 = -2 * z 4. Almost there! We only have -2 multiplied by z on the right. To find z, we need to cancel out the -2. We do this by dividing both sides by -2 (because -2 divided by -2 equals 1, and 1 multiplied by z is just z). It will look like this: (-8 / -2) = (-2 * z) / -2 5. Finally, we calculate the left side: -8 divided by -2 equals 4. The equation will look like this: 4 = z There you have it! The number z is 4.

May they Rest In Peacepic.twitter.com/vB3k6vNz2y ||||| Two Iraqi citizens living in Bowling Green, Ky., who admitted using improvised explosive devices (IEDs) against U.S. soldiers in Iraq and who attempted to send weapons and money to Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) for the purpose of killing U.S. soldiers, were sentenced today to serve federal prison terms by Senior Judge Thomas B. Russell in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky. The sentences was announced Lisa Monaco, Assistant Attorney General for National Security; David J. Hale, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Kentucky; and Perrye K. Turner, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Louisville Division. Mohanad Shareef Hammadi, 25, a former resident of Iraq, was sentenced to life in federal prison, and Waad Ramadan Alwan, 31, a former resident of Iraq, was sentenced to 40 years in federal prison, followed by a life term of supervised release. Both defendants had pleaded guilty to federal terrorism charges. “These two former Iraqi insurgents participated in terrorist activities overseas and attempted to continue providing material support to terrorists while they lived here in the United States. With today’s sentences, both men are being held accountable,” said Assistant Attorney General Monaco. “I thank the dedicated professionals in the law enforcement and intelligence communities who were responsible for this successful outcome.” “These are experienced terrorists who willingly and enthusiastically participated in what they believed were insurgent support operations designed to harm American soldiers in Iraq,” stated U.S. Attorney Hale. “The serious crimes of both men merit lengthy punishment, and only the value of Alwan’s immediate and extensive cooperation with law enforcement justifies our recommendation of a reduced sentence for him. Bringing these men to justice is the result of a comprehensive law enforcement effort. The FBI agents of the Louisville Division, along with the federal and local law enforcement members of the Joint Terrorism Task Forces here in Kentucky, including the Bowling Green Police Department, and our many other partners, are to be commended.” “Protecting the United States from terrorist attacks remains the FBI's top priority,” said FBI Special Agent in Charge Turner. “Using our growing suite of investigative and intelligence capabilities, FBI agents and analysts assigned to our Bowling Green office were able to neutralize a potential threat. Our local Joint Terrorism Task Force, comprised of FBI Agents and other local, state and federal agencies from across the Commonwealth, remains committed to dismantling extremist networks and cutting off financing and other forms of support provided by terrorist sympathizers, whether they are operating in Kentucky or worldwide.” “Today, the sentencing of Alwan and Hammadi represents the culmination of the extensive, effective and focused efforts of the U.S. Attorney's Office and the Kentucky Division of the FBI for their roles in the investigation and prosecution of these would-be terrorists. I want to thank U.S. Attorney David Hale, the Kentucky Division of the FBI and the members of the FBI Bowling Green local office for their individual and collective efforts in bringing Alwan and Hammadi to justice for their crimes against the people of Kentucky and the United States,” stated Chief Doug Hawkins, Bowling Green Police Department. Alwan, whose fingerprints were found on an unexploded IED found in Iraq, pleaded guilty earlier in the case on Dec. 16, 2011, to all counts of a 23-count federal indictment. He pleaded guilty to conspiring to kill U.S. nationals abroad; conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction (explosives) against U.S. nationals abroad; distributing information on the manufacture and use of IEDs; attempting to provide material support to terrorists and to AQI and conspiring to transfer, possess and export Stinger missiles. Hammadi pleaded guilty on Aug. 21, 2012, to a 12-count superseding indictment. Charges against him included attempting to provide material support to terrorists and to AQI; conspiring to transfer, possess and export Stinger missiles; and making a false statement in an immigration application. At today’s sentencing, at the request of the United States, Alwan received a reduced sentence due to his cooperation with federal law enforcement. The United States asked for no reduction of Hammadi’s sentence. According to information presented by the United States in connection with today’s sentencings, Hammadi and Alwan both admitted, in FBI interviews that followed waiver of their Miranda rights, to participation in the purported material support operations in Kentucky, and both provided the FBI details of their prior involvement in insurgent activities while living in Iraq. Both men believed their activities in Kentucky were supporting AQI. Alwan admitted participating in IED attacks against U.S. soldiers in Iraq, and Hammadi admitted to participating in 10 to 11 IED attacks as well as shooting at a U.S. soldier in an observation tower. Court documents filed in this case reveal that the Bowling Green office of the FBI’s Louisville Division initiated an investigation of Alwan in which they used a confidential human source (CHS). The CHS met with Alwan and recorded their meetings and conversations beginning in August 2010. The CHS represented to Alwan that he was working with a group to ship money and weapons to Mujahadeen in Iraq. From September 2010 through May 2011, Alwan participated in ten separate operations to send weapons and money that he believed were destined for terrorists in Iraq. Between October 2010 and January 2011, Alwan drew diagrams of multiple types of IEDs and instructed the CHS how to make them. In January 2011, Alwan recruited Hammadi, a fellow Iraqi national living in Bowling Green, to assist in these material support operations. Beginning in January 2011 and continuing until his arrest in late May 2011, Hammadi participated with Alwan in helping load money and weapons that he believed were destined for terrorists in Iraq. Documents filed by the United States describe in detail the material support activities of the men in Bowling Green. Without Hammadi present, Alwan loaded money and weapons he believed were being sent to Iraq on five occasions from September 2010 through February 2011, handling five rocket-propelled grenade launchers, five machine guns, two sniper rifles, two cases of C4 explosive and what he believed to be 375,000. After Hammadi joined Alwan in January 2011, the two men loaded money and weapons together on five occasions from January to May 2011. Together, on these five occasions, they loaded five rocket-propelled grenade launchers, five machine guns, five cases of C4 explosive, two sniper rifles, one box of 12 hand grenades, two Stinger surface-to-air missile launchers and what they believed to be a total of 565,000. Alwan and Hammadi were recorded by video during these operations. In speaking with the CHS, Alwan spoke of his efforts to kill U.S. soldiers in Iraq, stating “lunch and dinner would be an American.” Hammadi told the CHS that he had experience in Iraq with “Strelas” (a Russian made, portable, shoulder-fired surface-to-air missile launcher) and discussed shipping “Strelas” in future operations. According to the charging documents, Hammadi entered the United States in July 2009, and, after first residing in Las Vegas, moved to Bowling Green. Hammadi and Alwan were arrested on May 25, 2011, in Bowling Green on criminal complaints. Both defendants were closely monitored by federal law enforcement authorities in the months leading up to their arrests. Neither was charged with plotting attacks within the United States. All of the weapons, including Stinger missiles, had been rendered inert before being handled by Hammadi and Alwan. The weapons and money handled by the men in the United States were never provided to AQI, but instead were carefully controlled by law enforcement as part of the undercover operation. This case was investigated by the Louisville Division of the FBI. Assisting in the investigation were members of the Louisville and Lexington Joint Terrorism Task Forces, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, U.S. Marshals Service, U.S. Department of Defense, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and the Bowling Green Police Department. The prosecution was handled by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Michael Bennett and Bryan Calhoun from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Kentucky and Trial Attorney Larry Schneider from the Counterterrorism Section of the Justice Department’s National Security Division. ||||| Kellyanne Conway, a senior adviser to Donald Trump, has come in for criticism and ridicule after blaming two Iraqi refugees for a massacre that never happened. Conway, the US president’s former campaign manager who has frequently faced the press to defend his controversial moves, cited the fictitious “Bowling Green massacre” in an interview in which she backed the travel ban imposed on visitors from seven Muslim-majority countries. Interviewed by Chris Matthews on MSNBC’s Hardball programme on Thursday evening, Conway compared the executive order issued by Trump in his first week in the White House to what she described as a six-month ban imposed by his predecessor Barack Obama. This claim has been debunked by commentators who have pointed out that the 2011 action was a pause on the processing of refugees from Iraq after two Iraqi nationals were arrested over a failed attempt to send money and weapons to al-Qaida in Iraq. Conway told Matthews: “I bet it’s brand new information to people that President Obama had a six-month ban on the Iraqi refugee program after two Iraqis came here to this country, were radicalised and they were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre. “Most people don’t know that because it didn’t get covered.” Trump defends chaotic foreign policy: 'We're going to straighten it out, OK?' Read more It didn’t get covered, many are now pointing out, because there was no such massacre. The two Iraqi men arrested in 2011 did live in Bowling Green, Kentucky, and are currently serving life sentences for federal terrorism offences. But there was no massacre, nor were they accused of planning one. The US department of justice, announcing their convictions in 2012, said: “Neither was charged with plotting attacks within the United States.” Analysis by the Cato Institute of terrorist attacks on US soil between 1975 and 2015 found that foreign nationals from the seven countries targeted by Trump’s travel ban – Iran, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Libya and Somalia – have killed no Americans. Following the Conway interview, some social media users pointed out that false rumours about a Halloween massacre had circulated in several universities, including Ohio’s Bowling Green state university, in 1998. But the likelihood that Conway had Kentucky in mind was bolstered when that state’s senator Rand Paul also made a variation of her false claim. In a separate interview with MSNBC, Paul referred to “the attempted bombing in Bowling Green, where I live”. Joe Sonka (@joesonka) Rand Paul: \\"...the attempted bombing in Bowling Green, where I live.\\" (Prosecutor said there was no attempt or even plot to bomb in America) pic.twitter.com/O0BMEgk4XF Conway had already prompted astonishment by describing comments by White House spokesman Sean Spicer that Trump’s inauguration crowd “was the largest audience ever to witness an inauguration, period” as “alternative facts”. “You’re saying it’s a falsehood, and they’re giving – Sean Spicer, our press secretary, gave alternative facts to that,” Conway told NBC last week. Matthews did not press Conway on her Bowling Green massacre claim in the interview, and she has not yet responded to reports that she misrepresented the events of 2011. ||||| Several dozen suspected terrorist bombmakers, including some believed to have targeted American troops, may have mistakenly been allowed to move to the United States as war refugees, according to FBI agents investigating the remnants of roadside bombs recovered from Iraq and Afghanistan. The discovery in 2009 of two al Qaeda-Iraq terrorists living as refugees in Bowling Green, Kentucky -- who later admitted in court that they'd attacked U.S. soldiers in Iraq -- prompted the bureau to assign hundreds of specialists to an around-the-clock effort aimed at checking its archive of 100,000 improvised explosive devices collected in the war zones, known as IEDs, for other suspected terrorists' fingerprints. \\"We are currently supporting dozens of current counter-terrorism investigations like that,\\" FBI Agent Gregory Carl, director of the Terrorist Explosive Device Analytical Center (TEDAC), said in an ABC News interview to be broadcast tonight on ABC News' \\"World News with Diane Sawyer\\" and \\"Nightline\\". \\"I wouldn't be surprised if there were many more than that,\\" said House Committee on Homeland Security Chairman Michael McCaul. \\"And these are trained terrorists in the art of bombmaking that are inside the United States; and quite frankly, from a homeland security perspective, that really concerns me.\\" As a result of the Kentucky case, the State Department stopped processing Iraq refugees for six months in 2011, federal officials told ABC News – even for many who had heroically helped U.S. forces as interpreters and intelligence assets. One Iraqi who had aided American troops was assassinated before his refugee application could be processed, because of the immigration delays, two U.S. officials said. In 2011, fewer than 10,000 Iraqis were resettled as refugees in the U.S., half the number from the year before, State Department statistics show. Suspect in Kentucky Discovered to Have Insurgent Past An intelligence tip initially led the FBI to Waad Ramadan Alwan, 32, in 2009. The Iraqi had claimed to be a refugee who faced persecution back home -- a story that shattered when the FBI found his fingerprints on a cordless phone base that U.S. soldiers dug up in a gravel pile south of Bayji, Iraq on Sept. 1, 2005. The phone base had been wired to unexploded bombs buried in a nearby road. An ABC News investigation of the flawed U.S. refugee screening system, which was overhauled two years ago, showed that Alwan was mistakenly allowed into the U.S. and resettled in the leafy southern town of Bowling Green, Kentucky, a city of 60,000 which is home to Western Kentucky University and near the Army's Fort Knox and Fort Campbell. Alwan and another Iraqi refugee, Mohanad Shareef Hammadi, 26, were resettled in Bowling Green even though both had been detained during the war by Iraqi authorities, according to federal prosecutors. Most of the more than 70,000 Iraqi war refugees in the U.S. are law-abiding immigrants eager to start a new life in America, state and federal officials say. But the FBI discovered that Alwan had been arrested in Kirkuk, Iraq, in 2006 and confessed on video made of his interrogation then that he was an insurgent, according to the U.S. military and FBI, which obtained the tape a year into their Kentucky probe. In 2007, Alwan went through a border crossing to Syria and his fingerprints were entered into a biometric database maintained by U.S. military intelligence in Iraq, a Directorate of National Intelligence official said. Another U.S. official insisted that fingerprints of Iraqis were routinely collected and that Alwan's fingerprint file was not associated with the insurgency. “ ” How do they get into our community? In 2009 Alwan applied as a refugee and was allowed to move to Bowling Green, where he quit a job he briefly held and moved into public housing on Gordon Ave., across the street from a school bus stop, and collected public assistance payouts, federal officials told ABC News. \\"How do you have somebody that we now know was a known actor in terrorism overseas, how does that person get into the United States? How do they get into our community?\\" wondered Bowling Green Police Chief Doug Hawkins, whose department assisted the FBI. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Peter Boogaard said in a statement that the U.S. government \\"continually improves and expands its procedures for vetting immigrants, refugees and visa applicants, and today [the] vetting process considers a far broader range of information than it did in past years.\\" \\"Our procedures continue to check applicants' names and fingerprints against records of individuals known to be security threats, including the terrorist watchlist, or of law enforcement concern... These checks are vital to advancing the U.S. government's twin goal of protecting the world's most vulnerable persons while ensuring U.S. national security and public safety,\\" the statement said. Last year, a Department of Homeland Security senior intelligence official testified in a House hearing that Alwan and Hammadi's names and fingerprints were checked by the FBI, DHS and the Defense Department during the vetting process in 2009 and \\"came in clean.\\" After the FBI received the intelligence tip later that year, a sting operation in Kentucky was mounted to bait Alwan with a scheme hatched by an undercover operative recruited by the FBI, who offered Alwan the opportunity to ship heavy arms to al Qaeda in Iraq. The FBI wanted to know if Alwan was part of a local terror cell -- a fear that grew when he tapped a relative also living in Bowling Green, Hammadi, to help out. The FBI secretly taped Alwan bragging to the informant that he'd built a dozen or more bombs in Iraq and used a sniper rifle to kill American soldiers in the Bayji area north of Baghdad. \\"He said that he had them 'for lunch and dinner,'\\" recalled FBI Louisville Supervisory Special Agent Tim Beam, \\"meaning that he had killed them.\\" Alwan even sketched out IED designs, which the FBI provided to ABC News, that U.S. bomb experts had quickly determined clearly demonstrated his expertise. 'Needle in a Haystack' Fingerprint Match Found on Iraq Bomb Parts, White House Briefed The case drew attention at the highest levels of government, FBI officials told ABC News, when TEDAC forensic investigators tasked with finding IEDs from Bayji dating back to 2005 pulled 170 case boxes and, incredibly, found several of Alwan's fingerprints on a Senao-brand remote cordless base station. A U.S. military Significant Action report on Sept. 1, 2005 said the remote-controlled trigger had been attached to \\"three homemade-explosive artillery rounds concealed by gravel with protruding wires.\\" \\"There were two fingerprints, developed on the top of the base station,\\" Katie Suchma, an FBI supervisory physical scientist at TEDAC who helped locate the evidence, told ABC News at the center's IED examination lab. \\"The whole team was ecstatic because it was like finding a needle in a haystack.\\" \\"This was the type of bomb he's talking about when he drew those pictures,\\" added FBI electronics expert Stephen Mallow. Word was sent back to the FBI in Louisville. \\"It was a surreal moment, it was a real game changer, so to speak, for the case,\\" FBI agent Beam told ABC News. \\"Now you have solidified proof that he was involved in actual attacks against U.S. soldiers.\\" Worse, prosecutors later revealed at Hammadi's sentencing hearing that he and Alwan had been caught on an FBI surveillance tape talking about using a bomb to assassinate an Army captain they'd known in Bayji, who was now back home – and to possibly attack other homeland targets. \\"Many things should take place and it should be huge,\\" Hammadi told Alwan in an FBI-recorded conversation, which a prosecutor read at Hammadi's sentencing last year. Then-FBI Director Robert Mueller briefed President Obama in early 2011 as agents and Louisville federal prosecutors weighed whether to arrest Alwan and Hammadi or continue arranging phony arms shipments to Iraq that the pair could assist with, consisting of machine guns, explosives and even Stinger missiles the FBI had secretly rendered inoperable and which never left the U.S. But agents soon determined there were no other co-conspirators. An FBI SWAT team collared the terrorists in a truck south of Bowling Green in late May 2011, only weeks after al Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden was killed in Pakistan and Obama had visited nearby Fort Campbell to thank the SEALs and Army Nightstalker pilots for their successful mission. The Kentucky al Qaeda case drew little attention as the nation celebrated Bin Laden's death. Suspects Linked to Attack That Killed 4 US Soldiers Pennsylvania National Guard soldiers who had served in Bayji in 2005 saw news reports about the two arrests, and Army Staff Sgt. Joshua Hedetniemi called the FBI to alert them to an Aug. 9, 2005, IED attack that killed four of their troopers in a humvee patrolling south of the town. The U.S. attorney's office in Louisville eventually placed the surviving soldiers in its victim notification system for the case, even though it couldn't be conclusively proven that Alwan and Hammadi had killed the Guardsmen. The four Pennsylvania soldiers killed that day were Pfc. Nathaniel DeTample, 19, Spec. Gennaro Pellegrini, 31, Spec. Francis J. Straub Jr., 24, and Spec. John Kulick, 35. \\"It was a somber moment for the platoon, we had a great deal of love and respect for those guys and it hit us pretty hard,\\" Hedetniemi said in an interview in the Guard's armory near Philadelphia. \\"I think that these two individuals are innately evil to be able to act as a terrorist and attack and kill American soldiers, then have the balls to come over to the United States and try to do the same exact thing here in our homeland.\\" Confronted with all the evidence against them, Alwan and Hammadi agreed to plead guilty to supporting terrorism and admitted their al Qaeda-Iraq past. Alwan cooperated and received 40 years, while Hammadi received a life term which he is appealing. A hearing for Hammadi's appeal took place Tuesday in the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Ohio. \\"We need to take this as a case study and draw the right lessons from it, and not just high-five over this,\\" said retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Barbero, who headed the military's Joint IED Defeat Organization until last May. \\"How did a person who we detained in Iraq -- linked to an IED attack, we had his fingerprints in our government system -- how did he walk into America in 2009?\\" Barbero is credited with leveraging the Kentucky case to help the FBI get funding to create a new state of the art fingerprint lab focused solely on its IED repository in a huge warehouse outside Washington. The new FBI lab assists counterterrorism investigations of suspected bombmakers and IED emplacers and looks for latent prints on 100,000 IED remnants collected over the past decade by the military and stored in the vast TEDAC warehouse. The only man in the Humvee to survive the 2005 IED bombing in Bayji, Daniel South, who is now an Army Black Hawk helicopter pilot in Texas, said he was stunned to learn al Qaeda-Iraq insurgents were living in Kentucky -- but he's glad they were finally brought to justice for attacking U.S. troops in Iraq. \\"I kind of wish that we had smoked [Alwan] when it happened, but we didn't have that opportunity so I guess this is second best,\\" South told ABC News.

She told MSNBC's Chris Matthews: \\"I bet it's brand new information to people that President Obama had a six-month ban on the Iraqi refugee program after two Iraqis came here to this country, were radicalized and they were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre. It didn't get covered.\\" First of all, Obama didn't ban the Iraqi refugee program. Second, there's no such thing as the Bowling Green massacre. Conway later clarified that she was referencing the case of two Iraqis -- Waad Ramadan Alwan and Mohanad Shareef Hammadi -- who lived in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Both were granted refugee status and entered the United States in 2009. \\"On @hardball@NBCNews@MSNBC I meant to say 'Bowling Green terrorists' as reported here,\\" she said, before linking to an ABC news story on the case. Mohanad Shareef Hammadi Waad Ramadan Alwan The two men were never planning on committing an act of terrorism on US soil. Instead, they were trying to help get weapons to al Qaeda in Iraq. They were terrorists who should not have been allowed in the country, but they weren't planning an attack in the United States. And they didn't kill anyone in Bowling Green (or anywhere else in the US). CNN has reached out to the White House seeking comment of Conway's statement and have not yet received a response. Chelsea Clinton, the daughter of Trump's general election Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton, referenced Conway's comments in a tweet Friday morning , saying \\"don't make up fake attacks.\\" \\"Very grateful no one seriously hurt in the Louvre attack ...or the (completely fake) Bowling Green Massacre. Please don't make up attacks.\\" Very grateful no one seriously hurt in the Louvre attack ...or the (completely fake) Bowling Green Massacre. Please don't make up attacks. — Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) February 3, 2017 Some background on that case: After arriving in the United States, the men were monitored by federal authorities. They told an FBI confidential informant that they wanted to provide weapons and explosives to al Qaeda in Iraq, court documents said. An extensive undercover sting operation was launched, authorities said, and Alwan -- who a Justice Department official once called \\"a really bad guy\\" -- told an undercover agent he had been involved with \\"hundreds\\" of IEDs. An indictment released at the time said the United States was able to locate Alwan's fingerprints on an IED and on the base of a cordless phone used in an attack near Bayji, Iraq in the early 2000s. That the vetting process didn't work and that these men were allowed into the country highlighted serious flaws in the refugee resettlement system and led to reforms of the vetting process. As a result, Obama ordered that 57,000-58,000 Iraqi refugees recently allowed into the country be revetted, causing a massive backlog. So, while there was no specific 'ban' on Iraqi refugees coming into the country, there was a delay in allowing anymore in. ||||| CLOSE Many will have you believe that President Obama's 2011 immigration order is the same as President Trump's travel ban. Veuer's Nick Cardona has the story. Buzz60 A woman yells as she protests President Trump's executive immigration ban at O'Hare International Airport on Jan. 29, 2017 in Chicago. (Photo: Joshua Lott, AFP/Getty Images) In defending his executive order banning immigration and travel from certain countries, which has touched off widespread anger and confusion, President Trump compared the order to action taken by the Obama administration in 2011. CLOSE In response to the protests across the country against President Donald Trump's travel ban, former President Obama issued his first public statement since leaving office. Veuer's Nick Cardona has that story. Buzz60 “My policy is similar to what President Obama did in 2011 when he banned visas for refugees from Iraq for six months,” Trump claimed. Obama administration officials and fact checkers say the claim is wrong. Trump’s order banned visitors from seven Middle Eastern countries — Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Yemen, Sudan and Syria — from coming to the United States for 90 days. The executive order signed Friday also suspended for 120 days all refugees coming to the United States. In 2011, the State Department significantly slowed the number of visas it issued to Iraqis in order to review its vetting process. The concern stemmed from the arrests of two Iraqi refugees on terrorism charges in Bowling Green, Kentucky, in 2011. One of the men was linked through fingerprints to an improvised explosive attack in Bayji, Iraq. The arrests triggered concerns in the administration and on Capitol Hill and led to a massive review of Iraqi refugees already admitted to the country and more extensive vetting of those applying to immigrate to the United States. The action only applied to refugees from Iraq. MORE: Obama's office released a statement Monday that, while not directly critical of President Trump, did applaud those protesting a travel ban on visitors from seven Muslim countries. \\"President Obama is heartened by the level of engagement taking place in communities around the country. In his final official speech as President, he spoke about the important role of citizen and how all Americans have a responsibility to be the guardians of our democracy — not just during an election but every day,\\" Obama spokesman Kevin Lewis said in a statement. \\"With regard to comparisons to President Obama’s foreign policy decisions, as we’ve heard before, the President fundamentally disagrees with the notion of discriminating against individuals because of their faith or religion,\\" Lewis added. Jon Finer, an Obama administration official, said the review slowed the pace of Iraqis coming into the United States, but never completely halted it. The “flow of Iraqi refugees slowed significantly during the Obama administration’s review,” Finer wrote in an article for Foreign Policy magazine’s website, but “there was no outright ban.” But in 2012, the flow of refugees from Iraqi had returned to close to pre-2011 numbers. Glenn Kessler, the Washington Post’s fact checker, gave the Trump claim “three Pinocchios,” indicating a “significant factual error.” He cited several differences between the Obama administration action and Trump’s recent executive order: Obama’s action was in response to a specific threat, it was not a complete halt of refugees from Iraq and it did not apply to all visitors from Iraq entering the United States, he said.

Ok, well that’s a slight exaggeration but it was the first high-end make-up item that I ever bought and it made me feel like I was really getting somewhere. I’d got a good job, was in the process of buying my own house and I could afford to buy premium beauty products. I chose a transparent lemon yellow gloss with tiny flecks of iridescent glitter in, and over the following months I treated myself to several other Juicy Tube variants including a shimmery nude gloss called Pamplemousse which I wore on nights out for years (incidentally Pamplemousse is still going!). Fast forward several (ahem…) years and Juicy Tubes are still going strong, but there’s a new member of the Juicy family vying for attention – the Juicy Shaker.*. Another lip product, this one is a nourishing tinted lip oil which acts a bit like a gloss, and I was sent two of the new shades to try out – Piece of Cake and Show Me The Honey. Juicy Shakers are a bi-phase nourishing lip oil, when the product is allowed to settle the pigment falls to the bottom and the oil rises to the top, giving a split effect. Then you need to shake the bottle to mix the two layers together, giving the product it’s name. The ingredients include sweet almond oil, omega 3 and cranberry oil and really help care for your lips unlike most other glosses. Show Me The Honey is a nude coral shade, it looks rather orange and scary in the bottle but in reality it’s much more of a gentle shade. Piece of Cake is a damson pink, and again looks much darker in the bottle. I found that Piece of Cake matches almost exactly with the natural colour of my lips so it’s perfect for when I want my make-up to look really pared back with glossy supple natural looking lips. Question: When did the author feel Lancome Juicy Tubes first changed her life? Options: - after she got her first job - after she bought her new house - When she was in the process of buying her own house - not enough information === The correct answer is","response":"When she was in the process of buying her own house."},{"question":"What's an example of a movie review?","response":"Step 1: Choose a movie to review For this example, I'll review the movie \\"The Shawshank Redemption.\\" Step 2: Provide a brief introduction The Shawshank Redemption, directed by Frank Darabont and released in 1994, is a timeless tale of hope, friendship, and the human spirit.

Question: Where were Bactria, Sogdiana, and Margiana located in modern maps? Context: The Greek kingdom of Bactria began as a breakaway satrapy of the Seleucid empire, which, because of the size of the empire, had significant freedom from central control. Between 255-246 BCE, the governor of Bactria, Sogdiana and Margiana (most of present-day Afghanistan), one Diodotus, took this process to its logical extreme and declared himself king. Diodotus II, son of Diodotus, was overthrown in about 230 BC by Euthydemus, possibly the satrap of Sogdiana, who then started his own dynasty. In c. 210 BC, the Greco-Bactrian kingdom was invaded by a resurgent Seleucid empire under Antiochus III. While victorious in the field, it seems Antiochus came to realise that there were advantages in the status quo (perhaps sensing that Bactria could not be governed from Syria), and married one of his daughters to Euthydemus's son, thus legitimising the Greco-Bactria dynasty.

The eastern area of the park, where the first developments took place at the end of the 19th century, was then under the local government control of Stretford Urban District; the west was controlled by the urban district of Barton-upon-Irwell. Tensions soon began to emerge between the Estates Company and Stretford Council over the provision of local services and infrastructure. In 1902, W. T. Glover & Co, a cable manufacturing company that had moved to the park from nearby Salford, built a power station next to their works to supply electricity to the rest of the park; the Estates Company had previously approached Manchester Corporation, but Stretford would not allow another local authority to supply electricity within its area.In 1901 Manchester Corporation formally proposed a merger with Stretford UDC, on the basis that Stretford's growth was due in large part to Trafford Park, the growth of which in turn was largely due to the Manchester Ship Canal. Manchester Corporation had provided one-third of the capital needed to build the ship canal, for which it had doubled its municipal debt, despite having also increased rates by 26 per cent between 1892 and 1895.

Choices: - hydra - globular - polypoid - medusa A: The answer is:","response":"Most hydrozoa have both polyp and medusa forms in their life cycle. Hydrozoa is a class of relatively simple, mostly marine organisms belonging to the phylum Cnidaria, which also includes more familiar organisms like jellyfish, corals, and sea anemones. Hydrozoans display a characteristic life cycle known as metagenesis, which involves both asexual and sexual reproduction phases. The life cycle can be easily understood by looking at the two distinct body forms, namely polyps and medusae. Polyps are the sessile, or stationary, stage of the life cycle. They are typically cylindrical in shape, with a mouth opening at the top, surrounded by tentacles. Polyps are usually colonial, living in complex colonies called hydranths, which serve different functions such as feeding, reproduction, or defense. They reproduce asexually, primarily through budding - a process where a small outgrowth of the parent polyp detaches and develops into a new individual. Medusae, on the other hand, are the free-swimming, typically bell-shaped stage of the life cycle, generally referred to as the jellyfish stage. In contrast to polyps, medusae reproduce sexually. They possess both male and female reproductive organs (gonads) and release eggs and sperm into the water column. Fertilized eggs then develop into planktonic larvae called planulae, which eventually settle onto a solid substrate, metamorphose into a small polyp, and begin the asexual phase again. Some hydrozoans, like the freshwater Hydra, only exhibit the polyp stage, while others alternate between polyp and medusa forms throughout their life cycle. This alternation between the two forms helps ensure the long-term survival of the species, as it allows hydrozoans to adapt to and exploit a wide variety of environments and ecological niches and enhances dispersal potential. In conclusion, most members of the hydrozoa class exhibit both polyp and medusa forms throughout their life cycles. This distinction serves important functional and reproductive roles and allows these unique organisms to persist in diverse environments."},{"question":"Are these paraphrases?

In a controversial move, Pelletier was placed in the custody of the Massachusetts Department of Children and Families more than a year ago, after two reputable Boston hospitals sparred in their diagnosis of the girl. When the girl's parents disagreed with a psychiatric diagnosis given by Boston Children's Hospital, the couple said they wanted their daughter returned to her original physician at Tufts Medical Center, who had previously treated Justina for mitochondrial disease, a group of rare genetic disorders affecting cellular energy production. Lou and Linda Pelletier, of West Hartford, Conn., were then accused of \\"medical child abuse,\\" which led to Massachusetts officials taking full custody of the girl. The legal battle that ensued made the case one of the most controversial custody battles in state history. In May, Justina was moved from Massachusetts to a facility in Thompson, Conn. Her parents are now able to visit with their daughter, but still angry that she hasn't been returned home. In a 45-second, videotaped plea, first posted on a Facebook support page Sunday night, Justina is seen sitting in a chair and pleading plaintively with Massachusetts juvenile court Judge Joseph Johnston. \\"All I really want is to be with my family and friends,\\" the girl says, her voice faltering at times. \\"You can do it. You're the one that's judging this. Please let me go home.\\" In what Justina's attorneys are calling a \\"dramatic reversal,\\" the Massachusetts DCF filed a motion agreeing that the teenager should be returned to her family. Alec Loftus, a spokesman for Massachusetts Health and Human Services Secretary John Polanowicz, confirmed to FoxNews.com Wednesday that both parties are in agreement. \\"We are pleased that the family has engaged around the reunification plan and we have filed papers in court to support our shared goal of bringing Justina home,\\" he said in an email. Attorneys representing Justina filed a subsequent motion Tuesday requesting that Johnston expedite a ruling \\"because all parties are in agreement,\\" said Mat Staver, founder and chairman of Liberty Counsel, which represents the Pelletier family. According to sources close to the case, Johnston issued a June 13 deadline for all paperwork to be filed and indicated a ruling will be made on or before June 20. Staver claims that DCF's concession \\"completely undercuts their argument.\\" \\"She's now getting treatment from Tuft’s medical providers and they’ve agreed to return her to her family,\\" Staver told FoxNews.com. \\"This really cuts out the basis for why they took her in the first place.\\" \\"We're waiting on the judge. At this point, there is no reason to delay,\\" he said. \\"There’s no reason why he can't act immediately.\\" The emotional toll on Justina and her family is one that cannot be measured, Staver said. \\"Every hour she's not back with her family is an hour she can't ever get back,\\" he said. \\"Once she does get home, she’ll have a long road to recovery -- physically, mentally and spiritually.\\" Justina has missed out on two years of education, Staver said, and went from becoming a competitive figure skater to being confined in a wheelchair. Lou Pelletier, meanwhile, said he remains skeptical of the judge, after so many legal hurdles, and will \\"jump for joy once she is released home.\\" \\"Actions speak louder than words,\\" Pelletier said.

In 1992, he was selected as a leading member of the Russian-American Bankers Forum, an advisory group set up by the head of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to advise Russia on the modernization of its banking system, with the full endorsement of President Boris Yeltsin. Rockefeller had a lifelong association with the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) when he joined as a director in 1949. In 1965, Rockefeller and other businessmen formed the Council of the Americas to stimulate and support economic integration in the Americas.

Three years later, Inman finds himself in the trenches of Petersburg, Virginia, during the Battle of the Crater. Union soldiers tunneling beneath Confederate fortifications detonate over 300 kegs of gunpowder, in a futile attempt to undermine the position prior to their assault. As the ill-fated attack begins, Oakley (Lucas Black) an old acquaintance of Inman's from Cold Mountain, is impaled on a bayonet and mortally wounded. Inman rescues him from the fighting and takes him to a field hospital. Later that day Oakley dies in the hospital, with Inman and Stobrod Thewes (Brendan Gleeson) beside him. The next night, Inman, along with his Cherokee friend Swimmer (Jay Tavare), are sent to flush out surviving Union troops trapped behind their lines. During the raid, a burst of friendly fire kills Swimmer and seriously injures Inman.

A gas or electric stove can be used, with the heat being transferred from the burner to the pan containing the eggs. Therefore, the stove is one of the correct answers. Electricity is another correct answer. For electric stoves, it is the electricity that powers the heating elements, allowing the transfer of heat to the pan for cooking the eggs. Additionally, eggs can also be cooked using electric appliances such as electric griddles, skillets, or even microwave ovens, all of which rely on electricity as their energy source.

Article: For the first time, scientists have found a planet beyond the solar system that not only is the same size as Earth, but has the same proportions of iron and rock, a key step in an ongoing quest to find potentially habitable sister worlds. The planet, known as Kepler-78b, circles a star that is slightly smaller than the sun located in the constellation Cygnus , about 400 light years away. Kepler-78b was discovered last year with NASA's now-idled Kepler space telescope, which detected potential planets as they circled in front of their parent stars, blocking a bit of light. That measurement not only revealed that Kepler-78b was ly small, with a diameter just 20 percent larger than Earth's, but that it was practically orbiting on the surface of its host star. Scientists do not know how the planets ended up so close to their host stars. While the planet's presumably molten surface and hot temperatures make it ill-suited for life, two independent teams of astronomers jumped at the opportunity to follow up the discovery with ground-based measurements to try to determine the density of Kepler-78b. In two papers in this week's journal Nature, the teams report that not only were they successful, but that they came to the same conclusion: Kepler-78b has roughly the same density as Earth, suggesting that it also is made primarily of rock and iron. Kepler-78b is among a dozen or so recently discovered small planets that orbit very close to their parent stars. Kepler-78b, for example, completes an orbit in just 8.5 hours.

The answer is yes. The process of speciation within the same space is called sympatric speciation; the prefix “sym” means same, so “sympatric” means “same homeland” in contrast to “allopatric” meaning “other homeland. ” A number of mechanisms for sympatric speciation have been proposed and studied. One form of sympatric speciation can begin with a serious chromosomal error during cell division. In a normal cell division event chromosomes replicate, pair up, and then separate so that each new cell has the same number of chromosomes. However, sometimes the pairs separate and the end cell product has too many or too few individual chromosomes in a condition called aneuploidy (Figure 18.14). Q: Species divergence often, but not always, occurs because of what type of barrier between species?

Chihiro is whiny and unhappy about the move, especially when she notices that the bouquet her friend gave her as a good-bye gift is wilting. In sight of their new house, they take a wrong turn and follow a bumpy, decayed old road through the woods; Chihiro sees an odd old statue through the trees as they drive by. The road ends at a tunnel leading to an abandoned theme park. It gives Chihiro the creeps, but her parents persuade her to go in with them and look around.After wandering across a grassy landscape and a dry riverbed, they climb a stone staircase and come to a street lined with restaurants and shops. Most are deserted, but the aroma of cooking leads them to the one restaurant that's well stocked with food -- though it's mysteriously deserted. Mom and Dad are hungry and start eating, despite Chihiro's objections. The food is delicious, and Chihiro wanders away to explore while they eat. She finds a towering, ornate building that she recognizes as a bathhouse (a spa resort); there's a train track running under it.

Article:","response":"Title: George Osborne: Once the Second Most Powerful Person in the Government Once upon a time, just two months ago, there was a very important person in the government named George Osborne. He was so important that he was the second most powerful person in the government. Can you imagine that? It's like being the king's best friend. George Osborne had a special job called the \\"Chancellor of the Exchequer.\\" This might sound like a funny title, but it is an important job because he was in charge of looking after the country's money. He had to make sure everybody paid their taxes, and decide how to spend the government's money on things like building schools, fixing roads, and helping people who are sick or need money to live. But then, everything changed. The people who live in the country, including your mom and dad, got to vote on something called the \\"EU Referendum.\\" This was a big question about whether our country should stay friends with a group of other countries called the European Union or go on its own way. It was such a big decision that even people who normally don't think about such grown-up things were talking about it. George Osborne and his friends in the government wanted our country to keep being friends with the European Union. But, guess what? When all of the people voted, more of them decided that our country should go on its own way. This was a surprise to many people, and it meant that things began to change in the government. Because of this big change, a new leader of the government was chosen, named Theresa May, like when you play musical chairs and someone new gets to sit in the big chair. Since George Osborne and his friends didn't get their way, Theresa May decided that she needed some new helpers to work with her in the government. And that's why, just a short time ago, George Osborne went from being the second most powerful person in the government to not having a special job there anymore. Even though George Osborne isn't in the government now, he is still working hard and trying to help the country in other ways. And who knows, maybe one day he'll get to have another important job in the government again. So, boys and girls, it's important to remember that things can change very quickly in the world of grown-ups, just as they do in your lives."},{"question":"The film is set in Igloolik in the Eastern Arctic wilderness at the dawn of the first millennium . http://atanarjuat.com/legend/legend_film.php The wind is blowing over a bleak snowy landscape while a man tries to herd away some marauding dogs .

Article: It's important to learn about protecting our environment. Here is a 5R rule for us: 1. Reduce If you want to reduce waste, you should use things wisely. Millions of trees are being cut down to make paper. If everyone uses a little paper carelessly and throw it out, soon we would not have any trees left. Other things are also being wasted, and people don't know what to do with the waste in big cities. So it is necessary to reduce the waste 2. Reuse You should always think of reusing the usable things before throwing them out. Give your clothes you do not use or the ones which are too small to the poor. With a family, you may pass on such clothes to younger brothers or sisters. 3. Recycle Bottles, cans and paper can easily be recycled. By doing so, we save lots of time and money. For example, coke cans are sent to a factory, where they are smashed flat and melted and the melted things are made for new coke cans. 4. Recover When you buy a box of apples, there may be a few rotten apples. You have two choices: one is to throw the whole apple away, or you could cut off the rotten parts and eat the good parts. In this way, you are recovering the eatable parts of food. 5. Repair If one of the legs of your table is broken, you can repair it instead of throwing it away.

Just as surely, someone will be celebrating the holiday traditionally, with real candles burning on a real tree, in Scandinavian fashion. In some houses, Bob Dylan’s “Must Be Santa” is playing in a loop with Rosemary Clooney, Asleep at the Wheel and the choir of King’s College, Cambridge. On Christmas Eve, some will read the Grinch aloud, some will read David Sedaris and many will re-read the first verses of the second chapter of Luke, only to be moved by their beauty all over again. Christmas is by far the most eclectic holiday in the calendar. An Elvis Christmas is just as valid as a Bing Crosby Christmas, “A Charlie Brown Christmas” or a Lady Gaga Christmas. In fact, almost anything that happens two Christmases in a row becomes tradition. New traditions age swiftly, and the old ones gather wistfulness. Dangerously outdated strings of lights share the tree with LEDs. Aluminum gives way to mylar, but it’s all tinsel in the end. Just when you’re about to throw out the illuminated reindeer that go on the roof, you reconsider, as you do every year. Eventually, memories accumulate like old, familiar Christmas ornaments, only memories are not so easily broken. Who would have guessed you could come to enjoy the specialized vocabulary of the season, words like “figgy” and “nog” and “yuletide”? Or that you could pine for the sight of Santa sleighing through the old Norelco ads? It has been this way, more or less, since 1823, when Clement Moore’s “A Visit From St. Nicholas” first found its way into print. We doubt it will ever change.

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - use - rot - waste - ruin - decay A:","response":"Upon discovering the remains of the lost city, archaeologists tried to preserve its historical use. In broader terms, they sought to protect and maintain the integrity of the city's structures, artifacts, and other remains to learn more about the people who lived there, their culture, and their daily lives. The term \\"use\\" in this context refers to the functional purpose, cultural significance, and historical value that objects, buildings, and other remains hold within the lost city. As archaeologists uncover the various elements of the city, they strive to understand and preserve these aspects for future study and analysis. To effectively achieve this, archaeologists employ various methods and techniques. These may include the following: 1. Careful documentation: For each artifact and structure found, researchers meticulously document their characteristics, locations, and any other pertinent information. Photography, detailed drawings, and mapping techniques are used to record the context in which the discoveries were made. 2. Stabilization and conservation: Once items are discovered, archaeologists assess their condition and take necessary steps to protect them from further deterioration. Conservation measures may include stabilizing fragile objects, applying protective coatings, and storing items in climate-controlled environments. 3. Controlled excavation: To ensure the site's preservation and minimize damage, archaeologists perform slow, methodical excavations. They use tools like brushes, dental picks, and trowels instead of heavy machinery, allowing them to meticulously uncover artifacts and structures without causing harm. 4. Restoration and reconstruction: In some cases, archaeologists may choose to restore or reconstruct damaged structures and artifacts to their original forms using non-invasive techniques and materials. This not only helps to maintain the city's integrity but also allows for a better understanding of its historical use. 5. Public education and outreach: Archaeologists often work with local communities, museums, and educational institutions to promote awareness of the lost city's significance and the importance of preserving its history. By sharing their knowledge and research, they foster a greater appreciation of the site and secure its preservation for future generations. In conclusion, upon discovering the remains of the lost city, archaeologists focus their efforts on preserving the historical use of the site. Through a combination of documentation, stabilization, conservation, controlled excavation, restoration, and public education, they help protect and maintain the city's cultural and historical significance for current and future generations."},{"question":"Un certain nombre d'organes subsidiaires entreprennent des activités touchant au commerce dans le cadre de leur programme sectoriel.

He visits Choule in the hospital but finds her entirely in bandages and unable to talk. Whilst still at Choule's bedside, Trelkovsky meets Simone's friend, Stella (Isabelle Adjani), who has also come to visit. Stella begins talking to Simone, who becomes aware of her visitors. Initially showing some signs of agitation upon seeing them, Choule soon lets out a disturbing cry, then dies. It isn't clear which of the two has caused this reaction. Apparently unaware that Choule is now dead, Trelkovsky tries to comfort Stella but dares not say that he never knew Simone, instead pretending to be another friend. They leave together and go out for a drink and a movie (1973's Enter The Dragon), where they fondle each other. Outside the theatre they part ways. As Trelkovsky occupies the apartment he is chastised unreasonably by his neighbors and landlord, Monsieur Zy (Melvyn Douglas), for hosting a party with his friends, apparently having a woman over, making too much noise in general, and not joining in on a petition against another neighbor. Trelkovsky attempts to adapt to his situation, but is increasingly disturbed by the apartment and the other tenants.

Look no further than those annoying posts on blogs and online news stories where someone simply writes, \\"FIRST!\\" because they're celebrating being the first person to comment. Or watch any news program and see how they will report the detail of any minor celebrity in the off chance that it leads to a bigger, more exciting story. Then they can run ads that say, \\"We were the first news team to bring you the story of Jennifer Aniston's new puppy.\\" Now, imagine if you could get paid to be that cool, hip person who gets try products and services before anyone else? When everyone else is claiming to have discovered this awesome new technology gadget, you can say, \\"Oh, that? Yeah, I tried it out months ago.\\" With that pioneering (and braggart) spirit in mind, we put together a list of five jobs that let you try new things before they hit the market. You not only get paid to be the first person to try a new item, but your opinion matters. You can't beat that. CareerBuilder.com: Food workers, nurses forced to work sick. Here are five jobs that let you try an item before everyone else buys it:. 1. Video game tester. Yes, people are paid to test video games. This job isn't all fun and games, although it sort of is. But someone has to try new video games and look for flaws or glitches so programmers and designers can fix them before the release date. Consider how complicated today's video games are -- you're immersed in an interactive world that has come a long way from the 2-D world of Mario and Luigi. There are bound to be items that are overlooked, like a door that leads to nowhere or a secret code that doesn't do what it's supposed to. 2. Consumer Reports researcher. Independent testing organization Consumer Reports carries out extensive tests on products, such as cars, gadgets and home furnishings. A dedicated staff researches a product that is put through a battery of tests. They then administer a grade and detailed report for the product so that consumers know what its positive and negative attributes are. CareerBuilder.com: Have an incompetent boss? You're not alone. 3. Blogger. As blogging has shifted from a niche activity for a few writers to a respected outlet for news and topical conversations, bloggers have been granted some impressive privileges. Among them is access to conferences and company events, such as the unveiling of a new smartphone. Months before a new music player, smartphone or computer lands in your local retail store, the company announces it with great fanfare at a launch event. Bloggers who have large readership and respect in an industry are given prime seats at these events, where they can get their hands on these new gadgets minutes after they're unveiled. 4. Ice cream tester. If you thought testing video games was fun, consider the sheer joy of getting paid to try ice cream. Before you pick up a pint of a new, exotic flavor at the grocery store, someone had to make sure it was edible. For every whacky flavor like bubble gum, some food scientists tried out less successful flavors like spaghetti or pumpkin-wheatgrass. So the idea of eating ice cream for a living sounds fun until you realize it also means tasting some undesirable attempts, too. (Not to mention the damage done to your waistline.) CareerBuilder.com: Conflicting career advice: Which is right. 5. Critics. Before you see the must-see movie of the year, someone had to declare it a must-see film. Critics get to screen films weeks or months in advance so they can write a review for a magazine or newspaper before opening day. Music critics also get first stab at new albums. Record labels and movie studios give critics first access because their reviews drum up publicity for the respective projects -- and they hope the reviewers are positive, though there's no guarantee. Either way, critics get to enjoy some of pop culture's finest experiences for free. &copy CareerBuilder.com 2011. All rights reserved.

Article: Every year on my birthday, from the time I turned 12, a white gardenia was delivered to my house. No card came with it. Calls to the flower-shop were not helpful at all. After a while I stopped trying to discover the sender's name and just delighted in the beautiful white flower in soft pink paper. But I never stopped imagining who the giver might be. Some of my happiest moments were spent daydreaming about the sender. My mother encouraged these imaginings. She'd ask me if there was someone for whom I had done special kindness. Perhaps it was the old man across the street whose mail I'd delivered during the winter. As a girl, though, I had more fun imagining that it might be a boy I had run into. One month before my graduation, my father died. I felt so sad that I became completely uninterested in my upcoming graduation dance, and I didn't care if I had a new dress or not. But my mother, in her own sadness, would not let me miss any of those things. She wanted her children to feel loved and lovable. In truth, my mother wanted her children to see themselves much like the gardenia-lovely, strong and perfect with perhaps a bit of mystery .My mother died ten days after I was married. I was 22.

Nick Cohen and Craig Murray are both writers, journalists, and political commentators, but it is difficult to say the exact time and reason they may have stopped being friends, as this is personal information about them. They did have different opinions on various political topics, which may have caused disagreements, but we can't say for certain why their friendship ended. 2. No, Queen Elizabeth II does not have the final veto on the UK leaving the EU. While the Queen is the ceremonial head of the country and has some powers, important decisions like this are made by the government and Parliament. They followed a process called Brexit, which was the UK leaving the EU, and it has already happened without the Queen having to make the final decision. 3.

Ben Rhodes did not give details about the military aid other than to say it would be \\"different in scope and scale to what we have provided before\\". The Syrian government said the US statement was \\"full of lies\\". The White House \\"relied on fabricated information\\" about chemical weapons use in Syria in order to justify its decision to arm the rebels, the foreign ministry said. The BBC's Jim Muir in Beirut says the US announcement is one that the Syrian opposition has been pushing and praying for for months. By Jonathan MarcusBBC diplomatic correspondent Initially US support looks likely to involve the supply of light arms and ammunition. Mr Rhodes says that the President has not made any decision to pursue a military option, like a no-fly zone, and he has ruled out the deployment of US ground troops. Requests from the opposition for anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons are, we understand, still a matter of discussion. Thus the US response to President Assad's apparent crossing of a \\"red line\\" seems tentative at best. As ever it raises more questions than answers. Will US arms fix Syrian problem? It seems clear that President Obama has finally been persuaded, as Britain and France have argued, that the battlefield cannot be allowed to tilt strongly in the regime's favour, as is currently happening, he adds. Washington's \\"clear\\" statement was welcomed by Nato Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen, who urged Syria to let the UN \\"investigate all reports of chemical weapons use\\". British Foreign Secretary William Hague said the UK agreed with Washington's assessment and said an urgent response to the Syria crisis would be discussed at the G8 this week. Russia said it had seen Washington's evidence of chemical weapons use in Syria; \\"What was presented to us by the Americans does not look convincing,\\" said Yuri Ushakov, President Putin's senior foreign policy adviser. A spokesperson for UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon told the BBC that he remained against \\"any further militarisation\\" of the conflict in Syria, saying the people there need peace not more weapons. Mr Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser to Mr Obama, said the US intelligence community believed the \\"Assad regime has used chemical weapons, including the nerve agent sarin, on a small scale against the opposition multiple times over the last year\\". Audio statement from Ben RhodesText statement from Ben Rhodes He said intelligence officials had a \\"high confidence\\" in their assessment, and also estimated that 100 to 150 people had died from chemical weapons attacks, \\"however, casualty data is likely incomplete\\". \\"We have consistently said the use of chemical weapons violates international norms and crosses red lines that have existed in the international community for decades,\\" Mr Rhodes said. Mr Rhodes said President Obama had made the decision to increase assistance, including \\"military support\\", to the Supreme Military Council (SMC) and Syrian Opposition Coalition. He did not give details of the aid, but administration officials have been quoted by US media as saying it will most likely include sending small arms and ammunition. The New York Times quoted US officials as saying that Washington could provide anti-tank weapons. Syria's rebels have been calling for both anti-tank and anti-aircraft weaponry. Syria's chemical weapons stockpile The Wall Street Journal reported that Washington is also considering a no-fly zone inside Syria, possibly near the border with Jordan, that would protect refugees and rebels who are training there. When asked whether Mr Obama would back a no-fly zone over Syria, Mr Rhodes said one would not make a \\"huge difference\\" on the ground - and would be costly. He said further actions would be taken \\"on our own timeline.\\" The CIA is expected to co-ordinate delivery of the military equipment and train the rebel soldiers in how to use it. Until now, the US has limited its help to rebel forces by providing rations and medical supplies. Mr Rhodes said the White House hoped the increased support would bolster the effectiveness and legitimacy of both the political and military arms of Syria's rebels, and said the US was \\"comfortable\\" working with SMC chief Gen Salim Idris. \\"It's been important to work through them while aiming to isolate some of the more extremist elements of the opposition, such as al-Nusra,\\" he said. The US decision marks a significant escalation of the proxy war that has been gathering pace in Syria, our Beirut correspondent says. By Mark MardellNorth America editor The support of the West's regional allies, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, had helped the rebels in the days after the uprising became militarised. But the tide turned after the Assad government turned to Moscow and Tehran for help. Hezbollah fighters have also been involved in the government's counter-offensive. Now the West is lining up to try and help the rebels, but that is likely to take many months with more bloodshed and destruction, our correspondent adds. The White House announcement immediately shook up the ongoing debate in Washington DC over how the US might provide assistance to the rebels. Republican Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham, who have been particularly strident in their calls for military aid, said the finding must change US policy in Syria. They called for further action, saying US credibility was on the line. \\"A decision to provide lethal assistance, especially ammunition and heavy weapons, to opposition forces in Syria is long overdue, and we hope the president will take this urgently needed step,\\" they said in a joint statement. \\"But providing arms alone is not sufficient. The president must rally an international coalition to take military actions to degrade Assad's ability to use airpower and ballistic missiles and to move and resupply his forces around the battlefield by air.\\" The White House announcement came on the same day the United Nations said the number of those killed in the Syrian conflict had risen to more than 93,000 people. A UN report released on Thursday found at least 5,000 people have been dying in Syria every month since last July, with 30,000 killed since November. More than 80% of those killed were men, but the UN's Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) says it has also documented the deaths of more than 1,700 children under the age of 10.

I had to rate this so I gave it a 1 star, but it wasn't worth that. A:","response":"The given review would likely decrease the chances of me buying the product, but it should be observed with caution and analyzed in different aspects. Here are some reasons why the review might affect my decision: 1. Delivery Issues: If a customer claims that they never received the item, it might indicate that there are some issues with the delivery process. If there are more similar reviews about delivery problems, this would be a red flag, and I would be less likely to buy the product. However, if this is the only such review, it might be an isolated or rare case. 2. Perception of Overall Ratings: Due to the 1-star rating from this review, the overall rating of the product might get affected, especially if there are not many reviews. This might subconsciously make me lean towards not buying the product, as people generally rely on the average rating of a product while shopping online to make quick decisions. 3. Review Relevance: While analyzing reviews, one important aspect is to consider the relevance of the review to the actual performance or quality of the product. This particular review does not offer any useful information about the product itself - it only discusses the delivery issue which might not even be the fault of the product or the seller. As a result, it would be wise to look for other reviews that discuss the actual performance, quality, and usefulness of the product in question. 4. Seller Reputation: The review might make me question the seller's reputation and their ability to fulfill orders. If there are numerous complaints about the delivery and order fulfillment, it might indicate that the seller is not trustworthy, which would decrease my chances of purchasing the product. 5. Unfair Ratings: It is important to recognize that sometimes customers may give 1-star ratings for issues that may not be directly related to the product itself or its performance. Such reviews might not be a true representation of the product quality, so it is essential to look beyond the rating and reach a more comprehensive understanding of the product through other reviews. In conclusion, while this particular review could initially decrease my chances of purchasing the product, it is necessary to use critical thinking skills while evaluating the reviews on any product. A single review might not provide enough information or an accurate depiction of the product's quality; it is crucial to look at various reviews and feedback to make a well-informed decision. However, if there are multiple reviews indicating delivery issues or poor seller reputation, this would certainly affect my decision to buy the product negatively."},{"question":"Instructions: In this task, you are given a sentence which contains a motion and your task is to identify the physical entities involved in the motion.

He went on to serve his community. Especially he is interested in treating children. One day he saw two children, child M and child N, and found child M is infected with Acute Hepatitis B while child N is infected with Chronic Hepatitis B. Next day he saw two other children, child O and child P. Child O was younger, but child P was older. But I can use this background: Hepatitis B is a contagious virus that affects the liver, infection can last from a few weeks to a serious lifelong illness. Two different types of infection exist for this disease, \\"acute\\" and \\"chronic.\\" Acute Hepatitis B is a short term illness that occurs within 6 months of exposure, Chronic Hepatitis B is long term and happens when the virus remains in the body. The younger the child is, the greater their chance of developing a chronic infection and this risk goes down as the child gets older. Approximately 90% of infected infants will develop a chronic infection.[3] What is an answer for this question: Which child had less chance of developing a chronic infection, child O or child P? The answer is:","response":"Child P had less chance of developing a chronic infection. From the background information provided, we know that the risk of developing a chronic Hepatitis B infection decreases as the child gets older. Since Child O is younger than Child P, it implies that Child O naturally has a higher risk of developing a chronic infection than Child P. The statistics mentioned indicate that approximately 90% of infected infants will develop a chronic infection. Although we don't have the specific ages of Child O and Child P, we can infer that as children get older, their chances of developing a chronic infection will be lower than younger children, thus making Child P less likely to develop a chronic infection as compared to Child O. Additionally, it's crucial to understand the difference between acute and chronic Hepatitis B infections. In the initial situation described, Child M is infected with Acute Hepatitis B, while Child N is infected with Chronic Hepatitis B. The acute infection is typically short-term, happening within the first six months after exposure to the virus. In contrast, a chronic infection persists as the virus remains in the body, leading to long-term health issues. In conclusion, based on the age factor and the background information about Hepatitis B infections, Child P, being the older child, has a lower risk of developing a chronic infection in comparison to Child_O."},{"question":"If 'Of course,' said Greuze., can we conclude that \\"That's right said Greuze.\\"?","response":"Step 1: Analyze the given statement.

Step 4: Compare the two phrases. Both \\"Of course\\" and \\"That's right\\" convey affirmation, agreement, and approval. Step 5: Draw a conclusion. Since both phrases have a similar meaning, we can conclude that if \\"'Of course,' said Greuze.\\" is valid, then \\"That's right said Greuze.\\" can also be considered a valid paraphrase or alternative way of presenting Greuze's response."},{"question":"Build a movie plot around this: who gather together for a birthday party which turns into a philosophical argument? Snaut, Chris, Sartorius, and Hari Answer:","response":"Title: The Birthday Paradox Step 1: Setting the stage The movie takes place in present-day New York City. All four friends, Snaut, Chris, Sartorius, and Hari, live in the city and are professionals working in different fields. They frequently engage in philosophy-based book club meetings and enjoy discussing different theories, personal beliefs, and contemplations. Step 2: The birthday party Hari, a college professor in philosophy, has invited his closest friends, Snaut, Chris, and Sartorius, to his 40th birthday party. Snaut is a theoretical physicist, Chris is a renowned writer, and Sartorius is a molecular biologist. They all gather at Hari's spacious loft, where the party takes place, filled with fine food, drinks, and music. Step 3: The initial conflict As the night progresses, Chris brings up a controversial topic in philosophy and science: the simulation hypothesis, which argues that our reality is potentially an artificial simulation. Hari, the birthday man himself, expresses his doubts about the theory, while Snaut and Sartorius seem to be more open to the idea, focusing on their respective scientific fields to back up the hypothesis. Step 4: The intensification of the argument The discussion begins to heat up as the characters start presenting their perspectives, supporting or rejecting the simulation hypothesis. As they debate, they touch on consciousness, free will, religion, and morality, ultimately coming forth with their own divergent philosophical views: - Snaut argues from a physics perspective, discussing the quantum realm and its implications about the nature of reality. - Chris analyzes the human experience and emotions through the eyes of a writer. He raises the idea of existentialism, highlighting human's search for meaning in life. - Sartorius reflects on advancements in genetic engineering and artificial intelligence that challenge traditional beliefs about the limits of science and humanity. - Hari counters with critical thinking, skepticism, and the limitations of human understanding. Step 5: Culmination and self-reflection As the philosophical argument reaches its climax, the four friends suddenly find themselves put to the test when a mysterious figure, who has been silently observing their conversation, joins the debate. This fifth person provides a unique and thought-provoking perspective that forces them to question not only the validity of their arguments but also confront their personal beliefs and fears surrounding life, love, and existence. Step 6: Resolution and ending Realizing that their search for an ultimate truth might be an endless endeavor, the friends learn that what truly matters is the freedom to explore, question, and grow together. They embrace their differences and appreciate the value of their friendship beyond the boundaries of any theory or belief. In the end, they raise a toast to Hari's birthday and acknowledge that life's paradoxes make it all the more worth living."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: What type of details about vicki gardiner can be gathered from the following bio?

And the answer is...","response":"Step 1: Isolate the variable \\"a\\" on the left side of the equation. We can do this by adding 33 to both sides of the equation to get rid of the constant term. -15 + 33 = -6*a - 33 + 33 Step 2: Simplify the equation. 18 = -6*a Now, we divide both sides of the equation by -6 to get \\"a\\" alone. Step 3: Divide by -6: 18 / (-6) = (-6*a) / (-6) Step 4: Simplify: -3 = a So, the value of \\"a\\" is -3."},{"question":"Answer the following question: As time passes, the number of HIV copies keeps increasing, while the number of helper T cells keeps decreasing. The graph in Figure below shows how the number of T cells typically declines over a period of many years following the initial HIV infection. As the number of T cells decreases, so does the ability of the immune system to defend the body. As a result, an HIV-infected person develops frequent infections. Medicines can slow down the virus but not get rid of it, so there is no cure at present for HIV infections or AIDS. There also is no vaccine to immunize people against HIV infection, but scientists are working to develop one. A doctor tested two people for HIV. Tom had the virus in his blood, while Nick didn't have HIV, he was healthy. Tom has apparently had the virus for 20 years. Which person didn't have the ability of the immune system to defend the body decreasing? Answer:","response":"Nick didn't have the ability of the immune system to defend the body decreasing, as he was healthy and not infected with HIV."},{"question":"Given the background: Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2] The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] and the situation: Dan harvested lots of fruit and decided to candy some of them to preserve them. He left some fruit fresh for the family to enjoy. He candied apples, pears, plums, and quince. He didn't candy oranges, blueberries, apricots and peaches. Answer the following question: Which fruit retained their quality longer, apples or peaches? A:","response":"Apples retained their quality longer, as they were candied and preserved, while peaches were left fresh and not candied."}]`),W={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:B,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.question&&e.question.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.response&&e.response.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},H={class:"card-container"},D={key:0,class:"empty-state"},F=["disabled"],R={key:0},E={key:1};function z(i,e,h,m,o,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return a(),n("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),n("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",H,[(a(!0),n(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(p,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),n("div",D,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
