'' noah and bella took the supplies and went running up to the","response":"playroom, excited to start their new project. Their faces lit up with enthusiasm, knowing that they were about to embark on a fun and creative adventure together. As they entered the playroom, Noah and Bella noticed how colorful and well organized the space was. Shelves neatly lined the walls, containing an assortment of toys, games, books, and craft supplies. The room also featured a large table in the center, which was perfect for their turkey-making activity. Noah and Bella eagerly set up their construction paper and feathers on the table, making sure to spread out their materials so they had plenty of room to work. They began to discuss their plans for the turkeys, excitedly exchanging ideas and suggestions on how to make their creations unique and special. Noah thought it would be a good idea to trace their hands on the construction paper, using the outline as a base for the turkey's body. Bella agreed, and they both took turns carefully tracing each other's hands. After they had each made a handprint, they cut out the shapes with scissors, being cautious not to accidentally snip their fingers. Once the body of the turkey was established, Noah and Bella moved on to decorating the turkeys with feathers. They chose from an array of vibrant colors, such as red, orange, yellow, and even some blues and greens for a more imaginative touch. They glued the feathers onto the turkey's body, experimenting with different arrangements and patterns to make their creations stand out. To ensure they had enough feathers, Savanna had provided a generous amount. Noah and Bella set aside a few extra feathers to add some additional flair to their turkeys. Inspired by the feathers, they crafted intricate designs with the leftover pieces. Noah decided to create a tail for his turkey by gluing multiple feathers together in a fan-like shape, while Bella chose to add some extra feathers around the head of her turkey, giving it a more regal appearance. Next, they needed to create the facial features for their turkeys. Using markers, colored pencils, and googly eyes, Noah and Bella drew and glued on the eyes, beaks, and wattles. They even gave their turkeys unique expressions and details, such as adding blush to Bella's turkey's cheeks and drawing a playful wink on Noah's turkey. As a final touch, Noah and Bella decided to give their turkeys names. After a brief brainstorming session, they settled on naming their turkeys \\"Tom\\" (for Noah's turkey) and \\"Tina\\" (for Bella's turkey). They wrote the names at the bottom of their turkeys so they could easily identify them later. After spending hours working on their creations, Noah and Bella proudly displayed their finished turkeys on a nearby shelf in the playroom. They looked at each other, beaming with pride and satisfaction over their afternoon of creative fun. As they stepped back to admire their handiwork, they realized that not only had they made colorful and unique turkeys, but they had also created lasting memories together in the process. Savanna, hearing their laughter and animated conversations from the office, smiled warmly, knowing that she had provided them with a bonding opportunity and a creative outlet for their youthful energy. As Noah and Bella left the playroom, hand-in-hand, they couldn't help but glance back at Tom and Tina one last time, excited to tell their friends and family about their newest artistic endeavor."},{"question":"What is average acceleration? How does acceleration occur? How can you calculate the average acceleration of an object? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","response":"Hello little one! Let me explain average acceleration to you. Imagine you're playing with toy cars on the floor. Your car starts slow and then goes faster and faster. This change in speed is called acceleration. Now, average acceleration, is like trying to measure how much the toy car's speed changes in a certain period of time. It gives us an idea of how quickly the car is speeding up or slowing down on an average. Acceleration occurs when something like a force, such as a push or a pull, acts on an object, like your toy car. Maybe you push the car to make it go faster, or you pull it back to slow it down. To calculate the average acceleration of an object, we can use a simple formula. We need to know the change in velocity (how much faster or slower the object became) and divide it by the time it took for the change. So the formula is: Average Acceleration = (Final Velocity - Initial Velocity) / Time Now let's talk about the two questions you mentioned. Yes, both questions are asking about the same information. They're trying to understand what average acceleration is, how it happens, and how to calculate it. I hope that helps you imagine average acceleration better!

He is also known as a public intellectual and political commentator. Lewis is the Cleveland E. Dodge Professor Emeritus of Near Eastern Studies at Princeton University. Lewis' expertise is in the history of Islam and the interaction between Islam and the West. Context: In 1936, Lewis graduated from the School of Oriental Studies (now School of Oriental and African Studies, SOAS) at the University of London with a BA in history with special reference to the Near and Middle East. He earned his PhD three years later, also from SOAS, specializing in the history of Islam. Lewis also studied law, going part of the way toward becoming a solicitor, but returned to study Middle Eastern history. He undertook post-graduate studies at the University of Paris, where he studied with the orientalist Louis Massignon and earned the \\"Diplome des Etudes Semitiques\\" in 1937. He returned to SOAS in 1938 as an assistant lecturer in Islamic History. During the Second World War, Lewis served in the British Army in the Royal Armoured Corps and as a Corporal in the Intelligence Corps in 1940-41 before being seconded to the Foreign Office. After the war, he returned to SOAS. In 1949, at the age of 33, he was appointed to the new chair in Near and Middle Eastern History. In 1974, aged 57, Lewis accepted a joint position at Princeton University and the Institute for Advanced Study, also located in Princeton, New Jersey. The terms of his appointment were such that Lewis taught only one semester per year, and being free from administrative responsibilities, he could devote more time to research than previously. Consequently, Lewis's arrival at Princeton marked the beginning of the most prolific period in his research career during which he published numerous books and articles based on previously accumulated materials. After retiring from Princeton in 1986, Lewis served at Cornell University until 1990. In 1966, Lewis was a founding member of the learned society, Middle East Studies Association of North America (MESA), but in 2007 he broke away and founded Association for the Study of the Middle East and Africa (ASMEA) to challenge MESA, which the New York Sun noted as \\"dominated by academics who have been critical of Israel and of America's role in the Middle East.\\" The organization was formed as an academic society dedicated to promoting high standards of research and teaching in Middle Eastern and African studies and other related fields, with Lewis as Chairman of its academic council. In 1990, the National Endowment for the Humanities selected Lewis for the Jefferson Lecture, the U.S. federal government's highest honor for achievement in the humanities. His lecture, entitled \\"Western Civilization: A View from the East\\", was revised and reprinted in The Atlantic Monthly under the title \\"The Roots of Muslim Rage.\\" His 2007 Irving Kristol Lecture, given to the American Enterprise Institute, was published as Europe and Islam. Question: Was he injured during this?. Whats the answer?","response":"The text provided doesn't offer any information about Bernard Lewis suffering any injuries during his lifetime, including his time serving in the British Army during the Second World War, or at any point during his academic or professional career. It appears that the primary focus of his life and career was his academic work in the field of Near and Middle Eastern history and his role as a public intellectual and political commentator. He took part in serving his country during wartime and engaged in the formation and development of important academic societies. He also received significant recognition for his contributions to the humanities. However, without more specific details or additional sources, it can't be definitively answered whether he was ever injured. We can only note that the provided text does not mention any personal injuries or health issues."},{"question":"The island of Trinidad lies opposite the delta of which major South American river?","response":"The island of Trinidad, the larger and more populous of the two islands that make up the Caribbean nation of Trinidad and Tobago, is located opposite the delta of the Orinoco River, a major South American river that stretches for approximately 2,250 kilometers (1,400 miles). The Orinoco River originates in the Parima Mountains, on the borders between Venezuela and Brazil in the Amazon Basin. It is the third-longest river in South America, after the Amazon and Paraná rivers. Flowing through Venezuela, it forms parts of the country's borders with Colombia, where it swells to a vast delta before emptying into the Atlantic Ocean. The Orinoco Delta is one of the world's largest, covering an area of over 22,500 square kilometers (8,400 square miles). The river features a diverse range of ecosystems, including rainforests, wetlands, and savannas. These regions are inhabited by numerous species of flora and fauna, some of which are endemic to the area. The Orinoco River Basin is home to over 1,000 species of birds, 350 species of mammals, and around 500 species of fish, providing an essential habitat for the region's biodiversity. Moreover, the river plays a vital role in the local human settlements and the overall economy of the region. The Orinoco River has been a critical cultural and geographical landmark throughout its history, providing a means of transportation, sustenance, and settlement. The river and its tributaries have been vital for the indigenous peoples who cultivated its rich alluvial soils and relied on its abundant fish resources. Today, the river sustains various industries, such as agriculture, forestry, and fishing, as well as several large cities and numerous smaller communities located along its banks. In terms of natural resources, the Orinoco River Basin is known to possess significant reserves of crude oil in the Orinoco Belt. This vast petroleum deposit extends across 50,000 square kilometers (19,000 square miles) and contains some of the world's most significant heavy crude oil reserves. The development and extraction of these oil reserves have become essential for the region's economic growth, particularly for Venezuela. Lastly, the proximity of the island of Trinidad to the Orinoco Delta has had various historical and environmental implications. This proximity resulted in Trinidad becoming an extension of the South American continent's biogeographic realm, with numerous species of plants, animals, and even indigenous cultures making their way to the island via the river. Over time, both the human inhabitants of Trinidad and the island's ecosystems have been influenced by this connection to the Orinoco River and mainland South America."},{"question":"Q:\\"Slow City\\" -- a recently launched project focused on preserving the traditional quality of life enjoyed in some of Italy's smaller cities and towns. The project was born from the idea of the \\"Slow Food\\" movement -- started in Italy in the 1980s -- which promotes leisurely eating and the growing of local, healthy products to fight against the American fast-food style. \\"The American urban model has invaded our cities, making Italian towns look the same.

To elaborate further on this process: 1. Air is drawn in through the mouth (or nose) and it travels down the trachea. 2. The air then moves through the bronchi, branching out into smaller bronchioles within the lungs. 3. Gas exchange takes place in the tiny air sacs called alveoli, where oxygen diffuses from the inhaled air into the bloodstream, and carbon dioxide is released from the bloodstream into the alveoli. 4. Oxygen-rich blood is then transported back to the heart via pulmonary veins. 5. The heart pumps the oxygen-rich blood throughout the body via the circulatory system, specifically through arteries and capillaries. 6.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) estimates that there are only about 450 North Atlantic right whales left after 17 were reported dead this year, according to Phys.org. And the news of such high mortality was exacerbated by a low number in births in 2017. Per the Guardian, there are only about 100 breeding female whales active in the species, making the fear of extinction all the more real. \\"You do have to use the extinction word, because that's where the trend lines say they are,\\" says John Bullard, NOAA’s Northeast Regional Administrator. \\"That's something we can't let happen.\\" Along with the low number of breeding females, a study published in Endangered Species Research suggests that entrapment in fishing lines spikes stress levels in males, reducing their ability to reproduce. Co-author of the study Elizabeth Burgess says her colleagues are seeking solutions with the fishing community. (NOAA temporarily suspended its rescue operations this summer after a right whale struck and killed the rescuer untangling it from fishing lines.) Collisions with ships is another major cause of right whale death, and a study in Nature reports that the whales are seeking food outside protected areas. The problem will likely worsen, it states, “as water temperatures continue to rise, forcing movements towards both favorable oceanographic conditions and food sources elsewhere.” Expand this summary.","response":"The future of endangered North Atlantic right whales looks increasingly bleak as scientists report high mortality rates coupled with low birth rates in 2017. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) estimates that only around 450 of these whales remain in existence, with 17 reported deaths this year. This alarming situation is exacerbated by the fact that there are only approximately 100 breeding female whales active within the species, raising legitimate concerns regarding possible extinction in the future. John Bullard, the Northeast Regional Administrator for NOAA, stresses the gravity of the situation by asserting that the term \\"extinction\\" must be added to the discussions, as that's where the trend lines currently indicate they are headed. The idea of extinction is a reality that must be faced and prevented at all costs. One of the significant contributors to the low reproductive rates amongst right whales is entanglement in fishing lines, which causes substantial spikes in stress levels for male whales, consequently reducing their ability to reproduce. A study in the journal Endangered Species Research highlights this issue, with co-author Elizabeth Burgess, along with her colleagues, working closely with the fishing community to explore viable solutions to this critical problem. It should be noted that NOAA temporarily suspended its rescue operations earlier this year after a tragic incident in which a right whale struck and killed the person attempting to untangle it from fishing lines. Another significant factor contributing to the distressing decline in right whale numbers is the impact of collisions with ships. A recent study published in the journal Nature revealed that the endangered whales are venturing out in search of food outside of protected zones, putting them at a higher risk of being hit by vessels. The situation is likely to worsen as water temperatures continue to rise due to climate change, forcing the whales to journey further afield in search of both favorable oceanographic conditions and food sources elsewhere. These compounding factors necessitate urgent action, with collaborative efforts between scientists, the fishing community, as well as governments and international organizations, to ensure that suitable measures are put in place to protect endangered right whales. Strategies to mitigate the impacts of fishing lines, reduce the risk of collisions with ships, and effective management of protected zones have become essential factors in preventing the extinction of these magnificent marine mammals. Time is running out, and every effort must be made to reverse the trend towards extinction and secure a future for the North Atlantic right whales."},{"question":"Given this review: \\"Nice Nice\\" Would you recommend this app to a friend?

Is there anything else you need assistance with?"},{"question":"Paragraph: Water flowing over Earths surface or underground causes erosion and deposition. Water flowing over a steeper slope moves faster and causes more erosion. How water transports particles depends on their size. When water slows down, it starts depositing sediment. This process starts with the largest particles first. Runoff erodes the land after a heavy rain. It picks up sediment. Runoff carries most of the sediment to bodies of water. Mountain streams erode narrow, V-shaped valleys and waterfalls. Erosion and deposition by slow-flowing rivers create broad floodplains and meanders.

Yes or no? Answer: The maximum allowed voucher is 2200 a month. Question: what is section eight housing Answer:","response":"Section 8 housing refers to the Housing Choice Voucher Program, a U.S. federal government initiative aimed at providing safe, decent, and affordable rental housing to eligible low-income families, the elderly, and individuals with disabilities. It is overseen by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and administered by local Public Housing Agencies (PHAs). The name \\"Section 8\\" comes from Section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937, which established the concept of providing federal housing assistance in the form of vouchers to private landlords. These vouchers act as subsidies to bridge the gap between the rent payments tenants can afford and the actual market rate for rental housing. Eligibility for Section 8 housing is based on several factors, including total household income, family size, and citizenship or eligible immigration status. In general, families and individuals whose income is below 50% of the Area Median Income (AMI) qualify for the program. However, PHAs must prioritize providing assistance to those whose income is below 30% of the AMI. Upon determining eligibility, the PHA issues a housing voucher to the applicant. The recipient can then search for suitable rental housing within their area, negotiating lease terms with private landlords who agree to participate in the Section 8 program. The maximum voucher amount allowed varies by location and is determined by the PHA based on the Fair Market Rent (FMR), which is established by HUD. FMR is calculated to correspond to the 40th percentile of the local rental market rates, ensuring that a sufficient number of rental units are available to voucher holders. While the specific amount of 2,200 a month mentioned in your question may be an accurate voucher limit in some jurisdictions, it is not a standard figure nationwide. Voucher limits are adjusted according to family size, location, and specific housing needs. In most cases, the voucher recipient is expected to contribute 30% of their adjusted monthly income towards rent and utilities. The remaining amount, up to the maximum allowed voucher limit, is paid directly to the landlord by the PHA. In summary, Section 8 housing is a federal assistance program that provides eligible low-income families, the elderly, and individuals with disabilities access to safe, decent, and affordable rental housing through a voucher-based subsidy system. The maximum voucher amount allowed varies by location, family size, and specific housing needs, and it is not universally capped at 2,200 a month."},{"question":"Based on the premise \\"My poor Emily. \\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"Emily has something lucky happened to Emily.\\" is true (see options)?

FILE PHOTO - A North Korean flag flies on a mast at the Permanent Mission of North Korea in Geneva October 2, 2014. REUTERS/Denis Balibouse/File Photo Kim Jong Un, in his annual New Year’s Day speech, called for reduced tensions on the Korean peninsula and flagged the North’s possible participation in the Games next month, just across the border in Pyeongchang. South Korea has been eager to involve North Korea to ensure the Games are not disrupted by any further nuclear or missile tests and as a way of re-establishing dialogue with the reclusive state. Analysts say Kim’s gambit is aimed at driving a wedge between Seoul and Washington, which has advocated a strategy of maximum pressure and insisted that all options, including military ones, are on the table. But the move also targets the broader international consensus involving major players China, Russia and Japan that has tightened sanctions and deepened isolation for North Korea in recent months. “A major part of the Kim family playbook is to exploit and to widen the divergences in the interests, in the first instance between the U.S. and South Korea, but more broadly among the five major neighbors,” said Daniel Russel, the top U.S. diplomat for East Asia until last April and now at the Asia Society Policy Institute. North Korea has long followed such a strategy of intense provocations followed by conciliatory phases aimed at exposing rifts, he said. “This is a classic united we stand, divided we fall situation,” Russel said. “It’s always easier to maintain five party solidarity when North Korea is behaving badly.” U.S. President Donald Trump has led a drive to step up global sanctions on North Korea as it seeks to develop nuclear-tipped missiles capable of hitting the United States. On Tuesday, Trump said sanctions and other pressures were starting to have a big impact on North Korea but he withheld judgment on Pyongyang’s offer to talk. “Rocket man now wants to talk to South Korea for first time,” Trump wrote in a Twitter post, using his nickname for Kim. “Perhaps that is good news, perhaps not - we will see!” Washington says the full cooperation of China, Russia and other countries is vital to the success of this effort, which includes significant restrictions on trade and other ties with North Korea. China, which remains North Korea’s major partner, has curtailed trade in line with United Nations sanctions, but Washington has called for it to do more to isolate Pyongyang. For a multimedia coverage of North Korea, click www.reuters.com/north-korea/ “ABSURD OVERTURE” South Korea’s government publicly welcomed Kim’s overture, and President Moon Jae-in has pushed to ease tensions ahead of the Games by postponing joint military drills with American troops until after the Olympics. Moon also said on Tuesday the improvement of inter-Korean ties was linked to resolving North Korea’s nuclear program. The White House has yet to make a detailed response. However, powerful Republican Senator Lindsey Graham suggested the United States would boycott the Games if North Korea attends. “Allowing Kim Jong Un’s North Korea to participate in Winter Olympics would give legitimacy to the most illegitimate regime on the planet,” Graham said on Twitter. “I’m confident South Korea will reject this absurd overture and fully believe that if North Korea goes to the Winter Olympics, we do not.” The participation of North Korean athletes and officials in Olympic events may create some awkward moments for international leaders who have spent months painting the country as a pariah state, said Robert Kelly, a professor at South Korea’s Pusan National University. “It puts the South Koreans in a weird position because it potentially creates tension between U.S. and Japan who have gone to lengths to isolate the regime,” he said. Japan’s relationship with South Korea is already seen as under some strain, with one former Japanese diplomat saying Tokyo was suffering from “fatigue” with Seoul and lacking confidence in Moon. Still, analysts were skeptical Kim’s gambit would do lasting damage to the alliance between Seoul and Washington, or to the international push for sanctions. “I doubt that there will be a substantial reversal in global economic and political isolation measures in the near term,” said Scott Snyder, director of U.S.-Korea policy at the Council on Foreign Relations. MORE MISSILE TESTS At the heart of analysts’ scepticism is Kim’s apparent lack of appetite for compromise on the main points of nuclear weapons, missile testing, or human rights. “Participation in things like the Olympics are pseudo-concessions, because the North doesn’t actually have to give up anything,” Kelly said. In his speech, Kim vowed he would spend 2018 “mass-producing nuclear warheads and ballistic missiles” to “give a spur to the efforts for deploying them for action.” That means further missile tests are almost certain, with more focus on “realistic” exercises than developmental tests, said Joshua Pollack, a senior researcher at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California. “The major theme here for strategic forces is shifting from development to serial production, deployment, and increased readiness,” he said. If the United States wants to take advantage of any possible easing in tensions, it needs to drop its demands for a halt in testing as a precondition for talks, said Leon Sigal, director of the Northeast Asia Cooperative Security Project in New York. “The most important reciprocal step would be to scale back - not (just) postpone - the spring joint exercises,” he said. “Failure to try these steps will only ensure that unbridled North Korean weapons development continues.” ||||| Seoul, South Korea (CNN) South Korean President Moon Jae-in welcomed Kim Jong Un's apparent willingness to enter into dialogue and called for swift measures to help North Korea participate in the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang during a Cabinet meeting Tuesday in Seoul. The North Korean leader struck an unusually conciliatory note in his annual New Year's Day address, declaring his hope \\"for (a) peaceful resolution with our southern border.\\" In the televised speech on Monday, Kim called for peace on the Korean Peninsula and said North Korean representatives should start talks with their South Korean counterparts \\"as soon as possible\\" about sending a delegation to the 2018 Winter Games next month in Pyeongchang, South Korea.

Soldiers are dangerously fleeing to South Korea. Rocket man now wants to talk to South Korea for first time. Perhaps that is good news, perhaps not - we will see! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 2, 2018 Kim's comments appear to have galvanized efforts within Moon's administration to secure North Korea's participation in the Games. On Tuesday, South Korean Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon suggested high-level government talks with North Korea could be held as soon as January 9 in the border village of Panmunjom in the Demilitarized Zone. \\"The government proposes the North to hold high-level, inter-Korean government talks at the Peace House of Panmunjom in consideration that the Winter Olympics is about a month away and to discuss related matters such as the participation of North Korea's delegation in the Pyeongchang Olympics,\\" Cho said during a press briefing in Seoul. Cho added his government would remain \\"open to suggestions\\" as to the \\"timing, venue and format\\" of any future dialogue with the North. When asked for her reaction to the potential upcoming talks between the two countries, US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said Tuesday the United States won't take any North Korea talk seriously \\"if they don't do something to ban all nuclear weapons in North Korea.\\" North Korea has yet to respond to the South's offer. Indeed, it has long been difficult to reach North Korea for direct communication, the South's Unification Ministry says. North Korean officials haven't answered the South's calls on a hotline at Panmunjom since February 2016 when the South suspended operations at the joint Kaesong Industrial Complex , a business park where South Korean companies employed North Korean workers just north of the border separating the countries, a ministry spokeswoman said. Since then, the ministry has called the North on the hotline twice a day, Monday through Friday, but the North has not answered, the spokeswoman said. That includes two unanswered calls on Tuesday, a day after Kim's message, she said. Nevertheless, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs welcomed the efforts from both the North and South to improve relations. Moon has championed the 2018 Winter Olympics, set to begin February 9, as a possible means of easing tensions on the Korean Peninsula. In a November interview with CNN , the South Korean leader described the Games as an opportunity for inter-Korean peace and reconciliation, and expressed his hope that the North would participate.

To date, only two North Korean athletes have qualified for the Games -- pairs figure skaters Ryom Tae-Ok and Kim Ju-sik . However, the country's National Olympic Committee did not meet an October 30 deadline toaccept their spot. There has been talk of the International Olympic Committee granting an additional quota, something previously proposed by Choi Moon-soon, governor of the Gangwon province that will host the Winter Games. Follow-up measures Kim's sudden willingness to reach out to the South has surprised analysts, leading to suggestions it may be part of a strategy to drive a wedge between Seoul and Washington. Rodger Baker, vice president of strategic analysis for the intelligence firm Stratfor, told CNN that Kim may be seeking to \\"exploit Seoul's sense of insecurity\\" by enlisting it in pushing back against tighter US containment. \\"By suggesting North Korea will send a delegation to the Olympics, the North may also add impetus to the South's offer to delay joint defense exercises with the US, and may add to some of the differences between Seoul and Washington in coordinated North Korea policies,\\" said Baker, referring to Moon's comments to NBC in November hinting at the possibility of delaying joint military exercises with the US until after the Olympics. Since coming to office in May, Moon has appeared willing to seek a diplomatic solution to the Korean crisis that has seemed at odds with that of the United States, and in particular, that of Trump. In September, Trump accused Moon of seeking \\"appeasement\\" with North Korea following the successful completion of Pyongyang's sixth and most powerful nuclear test. Moon's stance has been compared to the so-called Sunshine Policy of the liberal governments of 1998 to 2008. Under it, Seoul actively engaged Pyongyang, which led to closer relations and saw two South Korean leaders visit the North Korean capital. However, the approach failed to halt North Korea's nuclear weapons program. JUST WATCHED What it's really like to be inside North Korea Replay More Videos ...

(Associated Press) South Korean Unification Minster Cho Myoung-gyon leaves after a press conference at the government complex in Seoul, South Korea, Tuesday, Jan. 2, 2018. Cho on Tuesday offered high-level talks with rival North Korea meant to find ways to cooperate on the Winter Olympics set to begin in the South next... (Associated Press) SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea on Tuesday offered high-level talks with rival North Korea to find ways to cooperate on next month's Winter Olympics in the South. Seoul's quick proposal following a rare rapprochement overture from the North a day earlier offers the possibility of better ties after a year that saw a nuclear standoff increase fear of war on the Korean Peninsula. In a closely watched New Year's address, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said Monday that he was willing to send a delegation to the Olympics, though he also repeated fiery nuclear threats against the United States. Analysts say Kim may be trying to drive a wedge between Seoul and its ally Washington in a bid to reduce international isolation and sanctions against North Korea. Kim's overture was welcome news for a South Korean government led by liberal President Moon Jae-in, who favors dialogue to ease the North's nuclear threats and wants to use the Olympics as a chance to improve inter-Korean ties. Moon's unification minister, Cho Myoung-gyon, proposed in a nationally televised news conference that the two Koreas meet Jan. 9 at the shared border village of Panmunjom to discuss Olympic cooperation and how to improve overall ties. Earlier Tuesday, Moon spoke of what he described as Kim's positive response to his earlier dialogue overtures and ordered officials to study how to restore talks with North Korea and get the North to participate in the Olympics. North Korea did not immediately react. But if there are talks, they would be the first formal dialogue between the Koreas since December 2015. Relations between the Koreas have plunged as North Korea has expanded its weapons programs amid a hard-line stance by Moon's conservative predecessors. Last year, North Korea conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test and test-launched three intercontinental ballistic missiles as part of its push to possess a nuclear missile capable of reaching anywhere in the United States. The North was subsequently hit with toughened U.N. sanctions, and Kim and President Donald Trump exchanged warlike rhetoric and crude personal insults against each other. Kim said in his speech Monday that North Korea last year achieved the historic feat of \\"completing\\" its nuclear forces. Outside experts say that it's only a matter of time before the North acquires the ability to hurl nuclear weapons at the mainland U.S., but that the country still has a few technologies to master, such as a warhead's ability to survive atmospheric re-entry. Talks could provide a temporary thaw in strained inter-Korean ties, but conservative critics worry that they may only earn the North time to perfect its nuclear weapons. After the Olympics, inter-Korean ties could become frosty again because the North has made it clear it has no intention of accepting international calls for nuclear disarmament and instead wants to bolster its weapons arsenal in the face of what it considers increasing U.S. threats. \\"Kim Jong Un's strategy remains the same. He's developing nukes while trying to weaken international pressure and the South Korea-U.S. military alliance and get international sanctions lifted,\\" said Shin Beomchul of the Seoul-based Korea National Diplomatic Academy. He said the North might also be using its potential Olympic participation as a chance to show its nuclear program is not intended to pose a threat to regional peace. In his address Monday, Kim said the United States should be aware that his country's nuclear forces are now a reality, not a threat. He said he has a \\"nuclear button\\" on his office desk, warning that \\"the whole territory of the U.S. is within the range of our nuclear strike.\\" He called for improved ties and a relaxation of military tensions with South Korea, saying the Winter Olympics could showcase the status of the Korean nation. But Kim also repeated that South Korea must stop annual military exercises with the United States, which he calls an invasion rehearsal against the North. About 28,500 American troops are stationed in South Korea to help deter potential aggression from the North, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War, which ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty. ||||| What is a summary?","response":"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has proposed a possible participation in the Winter Olympic Games taking place in South Korea next month.

Premise: 1. Rome was leaving a decisive imprint on the Iberian peninsula's language, culture, and government. 2. Roman engineering genius was particularly evident in the construction of roads, aqueducts, and monuments in the Iberian peninsula. Hypothesis: 1. Rome conquered the Iberian peninsula. 2. Rome forced its culture on the people of the Iberian peninsula. Step 1: Compare the components - Premise (1) has some correlation to Hypothesis (2), as a decisive imprint on language, culture, and government suggests significant influence from Rome. - Premise (2) doesn't directly relate to either part of the hypothesis, but the widespread presence of Roman engineering contributions can also imply a deeper level of Roman influence. Step 2: Analyze the relationships - Although the premise clearly states that Rome had a major impact on the Iberian peninsula, it doesn't explicitly mention conquest or the forceful imposition of Roman culture on the inhabitants. - The premise also suggests that Roman influence was more significant in certain areas like engineering, but doesn't specify any other areas where their influence was significantly felt. Step 3: Determine if the premise entails the hypothesis - Based on the comparison and analysis, the premise doesn't fully entail the hypothesis. While there is an indication of strong Roman influence, the premise doesn't provide enough information to determine whether Rome actually conquered the Iberian peninsula or forcefully imposed its culture on the local population.

For those confident in their capabilities, their social standing (in their companies/communities etc), and their abilities, the pill goes down a little easier. For those who experience imposter syndrome, feel insecure about their work, or are new in their careers, it is more difficult. Here’s the thing: these are not binary personalities. While some people are overly confident about themselves, and some people are overly insecure about themselves, most people have a blend of both. As such, even the most confident people can feel the sting when they get critical feedback or screw something up. This is a guide with some things I have learned over the years about how to turn feedback and failure to your advantage. In my not-so-humble opinion, the perfect blend of a human being is confidence in their ability to execute and accomplish their goals, but with a healthy dose of awareness of their current limitations.

An understanding of our current limitations is healthy. When we understand we are not great at something, but we are eager to learn and improve, it opens us up to counsel and tuition. The confidence piece plays an important role in helping us to remember: “I might suck now, but I am going to learn and get better”. When we have this in our heads it makes the journey more palatable: we know that our failure to succeed right now is temporary and it will improve. What is probably true about most people? Pick the correct answer from the following options: - not enough information - most people want to be timid - most people want to be criticized - most people probably want to be confident A:","response":"most people probably want to be confident"},{"question":"Read this and answer the question.

Esaaf Al-Ahmed arrived in Bradford with her family last year. She is one of three Syrian mothers speaking about the reality of life in their home country and the terror that made them flee to the UK. A national survey carried out last year revealed two-thirds of 11 to 25-year-olds were most likely to speak to their mother if they considered travelling to a conflict zone.

A mother who tried to abduct her two children to live in Syria under the so-called Islamic State was jailed last week for five years and four months.

In August 1993, they debuted as the tag team Harlem Heat, with Booker renamed Kole and Lash renamed Kane. They became heels and were on Harley Race and Col. Rob Parker's team in the WarGames match at Fall Brawl on September 19 against Sting, Davey Boy Smith, Dustin Rhodes, and The Shockmaster. They lost the match but were over as heels because of the caliber of faces they wrestled. In 1994, they acquired the services of Sensational Sherri, dubbed 'Sister' Sherri, as their manager and changed their names back to Booker T and Stevie Ray, at their request. By the end of 1994, they held the WCW Tag Team Championship after defeating Stars and Stripes (The Patriot and Marcus Alexander Bagwell) in December. After dropping the title to The Nasty Boys, Harlem Heat regained the belts on June 24, 1995. Afterward, Harlem Heat got into a feud with Col. Parker's \\"Stud Stable\\" of \\"Dirty\\" Dick Slater and Bunkhouse Buck. Parker and Sherri were carrying on a love affair and Parker eventually left the Stud Stable in favor of the Heat to be with Sherri. Harlem Heat won the WCW World Tag Team titles at Fall Brawl 1995, defeating Dick Slater and Bunkhouse Buck. Their third title reign only lasted one day, but the duo regained the tag team title nine days later from The American Males (Buff Bagwell and Scotty Riggs). On the June 24, 1996 Nitro, Harlem Heat defeated Lex Luger and Sting to capture their fifth WCW World Tag Team titles. Three days after losing the tag team titles to the Steiner Brothers, Harlem Heat regained the titles back from the Steiners on July 27. On September 23, Booker T and Stevie Ray were defeated by Public Enemy (Rocco Rock and Johnny Grunge) but took the titles back for the seventh time on October 1. They lost the Tag Team Championship to the Outsiders (Kevin Nash and Scott Hall) on October 27. Subsequently, they fired Col. Parker and beat him up and became full-fledged faces. They then entered into a brief feud against Col. Parker's newest team The Amazing French Canadians, a feud they won. In 1997, they feuded with Public Enemy (Grunge & Rocco), The Steiners, and the nWo. In fall 1997, they fired Sherri and added a new manager, Jacqueline. They were briefly put out of action by the nWo and returned to feud with the Faces of Fear (Meng and The Barbarian). Stevie then took five months off from WCW to recover from an ankle injury and Jacqueline left for the WWF. How did Harlem Heat start?","response":"Harlem Heat is a team created by two brothers, Booker T and Stevie Ray. They were suggested to join the World Championship Wrestling, a big wrestling company, by a friend named Sid Vicious. They first appeared as Harlem Heat in August 1993, but they were given different names - Kole for Booker and Kane for Lash. Later, they asked to use their real names again and also had a lady named Sherri as their guide. They worked really hard and by the end of 1994, they won the WCW Tag Team Championship, which is like a big prize for being the best wrestling team."},{"question":"Oh why is there always less time than tasks? Describe the sentiment embodied by this tweet.","response":"The sentiment embodied by this tweet is that of feeling overwhelmed or stressed due to a multitude of tasks and limited time to complete them.

Does the response correctly answer the question?","response":"b). yes."},{"question":"Generate a context and a hypothesis.","response":"Context: The recent decline in pollinators such as bees, butterflies, and other insects has led to a reduction in crop production in many agricultural regions. Pollinators play a critical role in plant reproduction, as they transfer pollen between flowers, thereby fertilizing plants and enabling them to produce fruits, seeds, and more. The decline in pollinator populations has been attributed to several factors, including habitat loss, pesticide exposure, diseases, and climate change. As a result, there has been growing concern among farmers, ecologists, and policy makers on how to address this problem and find sustainable solutions to protect and preserve these vital species. Hypothesis: The implementation of pollinator-friendly agricultural practices and habitat restoration efforts, in conjunction with reduced pesticide usage, have the potential to substantially increase pollinator populations and thereby improve crop production. To determine the effectiveness of these methods, we can conduct a longitudinal study across multiple agricultural regions, comparing the impact of these practices on pollinator populations and crop yields. We predict that agricultural regions implementing these approaches would experience a resurgence in pollinator populations, leading to increased crop yields and healthier ecosystems. This hypothesis could be tested and investigated by incorporating the following approaches: 1. Selection of multiple agricultural regions that vary in their current pollinator populations, crop types, and agroecological conditions for the study. 2. Implementation of pollinator-friendly agricultural practices such as: a. Planting wildflower strips and flowering hedgerows in and around agricultural fields to provide food and nesting resources for pollinators. b. Introducing or maintaining native plants that support local pollinator species. c. Establishing or restoring natural habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and forests in the vicinity of agricultural landscapes. 3. Monitoring the use of pesticides in the selected agricultural regions, and testing alternative pest management strategies, such as: a. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) methods that use a combination of biological, cultural, and chemical controls. b. Increasing awareness among farmers regarding the potential risks that certain pesticides pose to pollinators and encouraging the use of alternative, safer options. 4. Longitudinal monitoring and assessment of pollinator populations, including: a. Regular surveys of pollinator diversity and abundance, using methods such as transect walks and pan trapping. b. Tracking and evaluation of pollinator health through genetic and physiological examinations. 5. Longitudinal monitoring and assessment of crop yields in each agricultural region, considering variables such as: a. The diversity, abundance, and pollination rates of pollinators visiting crop flowers. b. Weather conditions and other environmental factors that may affect pollination success and crop yield. 6. Data analysis and comparison between agricultural regions implementing pollinator-friendly practices and those that do not. 7. Identifying the factors that contribute to the success or failure of implemented practices, and using this information for further research and policy development to ensure long-term sustainability in agriculture and conservation efforts. By designing, conducting, and analyzing this study, we could gain valuable insights into the effectiveness of pollinator-friendly agricultural practices and habitat restoration efforts, as well as how such approaches may contribute to the revival of pollinator populations and the enhancement of crop production in affected regions."},{"question":"Write an article based on this summary: Clean your ears with a salt water solution.

Setting: A cafe on a weekend afternoon, where Anne and Ben are catching up on life and discussing the dynamics of living together with their respective partners. --- Anne: Thanks for joining me today, Ben. It's been a while since we've sat down to chat like this. Ben: Absolutely, Anne! I've missed our conversations. How have you been? Anne: Things have been going well. Sarah and I just moved in together, and we're enjoying discovering each other's habits and quirks. Ben: That's great! You know, it's funny you mention that. Kate and I are also living together now. It's interesting to observe the differences in dynamics between same-sex and opposite-sex couples. How has it been for you and Sarah? Anne: It's been wonderful. It's true that the dynamics might be different in some ways, but I think that, ultimately, much of the experience depends on the individuals involved. In any relationship, communication is essential, and that's something Sarah and I have always excelled at. Ben: I totally agree about the importance of communication. Kate and I have found that the more we live together, the better we become at understanding each other's needs. How do you and Sarah approach dividing chores and responsibilities around the home? Is it any different because you're both women? Anne: In some ways, yes. Growing up, our families had traditional gender roles, but in our relationship, we try to challenge those ideas. We focus on our strengths and interests rather than assuming certain roles based on our gender. For example, Sarah loves cooking, while I have a passion for organizing and cleaning. So, we work together based on what we enjoy and what we're good at. Ben: That's a great way to approach it. Kate and I have also talked about gender roles, and we try not to fall into stereotypes. I actually love cooking, too, and she's more of a do-it-yourself person, constantly fixing things around the house. It's important to recognize that everyone has unique skills to contribute to a household. Anne: Absolutely. In terms of emotional support and intimacy, I feel that living together has brought Sarah and me even closer. I've heard from some of my heterosexual female friends that they often feel a certain level of emotional labor falls on them in their relationships with men. Do you think it's different in same-sex relationships? Ben: Honestly, that's something Kate and I have discussed too. I recognize that, historically, women have often taken on emotional labor in relationships, and I've tried to be more aware and proactive in providing emotional support to Kate. We're constantly working on that balance. I imagine it could be different in a same-sex relationship because both partners may be more accustomed to sharing that emotional support. Anne: You've hit the nail on the head. Sarah and I both naturally take on the role of providing emotional support to each other. It may be different for others, but for us, there's been an equal sharing of responsibility when it comes to our emotions. Ben: It's nice to see that, despite some differences in relationship dynamics, both heterosexual couples and lesbian couples can learn from each other and grow together. Anne: Yes, at the end of the day, love, trust, and communication are universal aspects of any healthy and successful relationship, regardless of gender or sexual orientation. Ben: Absolutely. Relationships are a constant learning experience, and I'm grateful for our conversations, Anne. It helps me better understand and appreciate various perspectives. Anne: Same here, Ben. Here's to growing together and always being open to learning from one another.

A: The answer is:","response":"During meiosis, each parent synthesizes gametes that contain only half of their complement of chromosomes. Meiosis is a type of cell division that results in the production of gametes (sperm and egg cells) which are required for sexual reproduction. In humans, for instance, the normal number of chromosomes (diploid) is 46 while the gametes (haploid) contain only 23 chromosomes. This reduction in chromosome number is essential for maintaining a constant number of chromosomes in offspring during sexual reproduction. When fertilization occurs, the sperm and egg cells combine, restoring the diploid number of chromosomes in the newly-formed zygote, which then develops into an embryo and eventually, a fully developed organism."},{"question":"Kaikki 1480 uusien jäsenvaltioiden edustajien tointa on tällä hetkellä täytetty.

In monogamous species incubation duties are often shared, whereas in polygamous species one parent is wholly responsible for incubation. Warmth from parents passes to the eggs through brood patches, areas of bare skin on the abdomen or breast of the incubating birds. Incubation can be an energetically demanding process; adult albatrosses, for instance, lose as much as 83 grams (2.9 oz) of body weight per day of incubation. The warmth for the incubation of the eggs of megapodes comes from the sun, decaying vegetation or volcanic sources. Incubation periods range from 10 days (in woodpeckers, cuckoos and passerine birds) to over 80 days (in albatrosses and kiwis).\\" Answer:","response":"From the given context, the term that is not a part of birds' bodies is \\"brood.\\" The passage describes the incubation process in birds, and mentions \\"breast\\" and \\"abdomen\\" as parts of the incubating birds' bodies. These areas possess brood patches, which are bare skin areas that provide warmth for the developing eggs. In contrast, \\"brood\\" is a term referring to a group of young birds that are being cared for by their parents; it is not an anatomical feature. To further clarify the distinctions, let's analyze each term in greater detail: 1. Breast: The breast is the frontal part of a bird's body, containing pectoral muscles that facilitate powerful wing movements. In some birds, the breast may possess brood patches during incubation to pass warmth to the eggs for proper chick development. This is an essential component of birds' anatomy and plays a significant role in their overall function and ability to fly. 2. Abdomen: The abdomen is the lower part of a bird's body, housing the digestive and reproductive organs. Similar to the breast, the abdomen may also have brood patches during incubation to transfer warmth to the eggs. Another indispensable element of birds' anatomy, the abdomen ensures the proper functioning of vital body systems, such as digestion and reproduction. 3. Brood: Unlike breast and abdomen, brood is not a body part but a term that represents a group of bird offspring that are under the care and protection of their parents. This may include nestlings (newly hatched birds that cannot leave the nest yet) or fledglings (young birds that have left the nest but still depend on their parents for food and protection). Brood can also refer to the action of keeping eggs warm for optimal chick development, typically through incubation. However, it does not describe a physical component of birds' bodies. In summary, both breast and abdomen are integral parts of birds' bodies, while the term brood refers to a group of young birds under parental care or the process of keeping eggs warm for development. Therefore, \\"brood\\" is not a part of birds' bodies."},{"question":"Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context?

Context: So this thing happened today. I am living in a society where there are almost 90 houses and almost all of them are occupied. We have one sweeper hired for whole society to collect waste and sweep out dust from our society roads. BTW her name is Hira masi (my brother calls her diamond masi :p). And she is extremely poor and she lives in those slums where almost nothing is available. She earns 50/100 per house each month. (Source) As she is extremely poor, all the society people help her a lot. From giving 2 times food to giving clothes and giving bonuses on special occasion as much as Rs. 1000, they almost help her in each and every aspect. And this is by far the most incredible thing our society has which is humanity. But the twist comes here. On the other side, she is extremely cunning. She rarely cleans the road, takes rarely wastes from homes, gives excuses that she is sick and does not come for work, etc. She does not do her work properly. She also request money from us saying that her family members are ill as much as Rs 10000, even if they are not. So this thing was discussed in our meeting and there some decided to continue her as she was very poor and some decided to leave her. But my mom today told me a great thing- If a person is doing her work seriously, then we will surely help him in every way, even if it is a matter of money, but the person who is not sincere and not doing work properly, then sometimes we have to step back from humanity and be strict. If the person is honest and he is REALLY in need of help, we should definitely help them. But the person who just fakes that he is in need, we should be strict/ignore them, else they will not do any work, and just simply rely on us. Sometimes, being strict and giving up humanity will make the person grow.

She was raised in Wequetequock, Connecticut, in a rock house overlooking the ocean at Wequetequock Cove, where her father owned Buzzi Memorials, a business still operated by her older brother, Harold. Her father was born in Arzo, Switzerland, in the Italian-speaking canton of Ticino. He carved the marble eagles at Penn Station in New York, the granite Leif Erikson memorial in Providence, Rhode Island, the animals seen in relief on the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, and made thousands of tombstones. In the late 1960s, Ruth Buzzi appeared in every episode of The Steve Allen Show, a comedy-variety series starring Steve Allen. Her character parts in the Allen sketches led her to be cast for NBC's new show Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In. She was the only featured player to appear in every episode of Laugh-In including the pilot for the show and the Laugh-In television special. A versatile comedian and accomplished singer, Buzzi played everything from dowdy old women to tipsy drunks, from Southern belles to flashy hookers. Among her recurring characters on Laugh-In were Busy-Buzzi, a Hedda Hopper-type Hollywood gossip columnist; Doris Swizzler, a cocktail-lounge habituee who always got riotously smashed with husband Leonard (Dick Martin); and one of the Burbank Airlines Stewardesses, teaming with Debbie Reynolds as two totally inconsiderate flight attendants. Her most famous character was dowdy spinster Gladys Ormphby, clad in drab brown with her bun hairdo covered by a visible hairnet knotted in the middle of her forehead. Buzzi first used this look when she played Agnes Gooch in a school production of Auntie Mame. In most sketches, she used her lethal purse, with which she would flail away vigorously at anyone who incurred her wrath. On Laugh-In, Gladys most often appeared as the unwilling object of the advances of Arte Johnson's \\"dirty old man\\" character Tyrone F. Horneigh. In a typical exchange, Tyrone accosts Gladys and asks, \\"Do you believe in the hereafter?\\" \\"Of course I do!\\" Gladys retorts defensively. Delighted, Tyrone shoots back: \\"Then you know what I'm here after!\\" NBC collectively called these two characters The Nitwits when they went to animation in the mid-1970s as part of the series Baggy Pants and the Nitwits. Buzzi and Johnson both voiced their respective roles in the cartoon. Buzzi, as Gladys, was featured in most of the Dean Martin Roasts from the MGM Hotel in Las Vegas. Memorable shows included her intense comedic dialogue, ranting about notable roastees including Muhammad Ali, Frank Sinatra, and Lucille Ball, to name a few. In each case, Gladys Ormphby pugnaciously attacked the honoree with her flailing purse to the screams and howls of the Las Vegas audience. Martin would also suffer Gladys's purse assaults for his remarks about her unappealing looks and poor romantic prospects. In one such exchange, Gladys accusingly questioned Martin about who had been chasing her around a hotel room in the wee hours; Martin's response (\\"The exterminator!\\") earned him a beating as he broke up laughing along with the audience. Gladys then declared to the audience that, when Martin and other men looked at her, only one thing came to their minds. Martin, still laughing, could barely get out the answer: \\"Rabies!\\" This earned him an even fiercer beating from Gladys. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Did she start with any other known actor?","response":"Yes, she started with other known actors. In the article, it states, \\"In the late 1960s, Ruth Buzzi appeared in every episode of The Steve Allen Show, a comedy-variety series starring Steve Allen.\\" Additionally, on Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In, she appeared alongside \\"Arte Johnson's 'dirty old man' character Tyrone F.

Here is a detailed and long answer regarding the translation and information about the text: The statement emphasizes the enthusiasm for a more active involvement of the European Union in all aspects of relations with the Black Sea region as the European Union develops a Common Foreign and Security Policy. To provide a broader context on this matter, the European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of 27 European countries, which aims to promote peace, stability, and prosperity within Europe. The Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) is an important component of the EU's external action and is designed to enhance coordination and decision-making amongst member states concerning diplomacy, defense, and crisis response. The Black Sea region has particular strategic importance due to its location at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. This region includes countries such as Turkey, Ukraine, Georgia, Bulgaria, Romania, and Russia, and has been a significant area of economic and political interest for the EU, both in terms of its neighborhood policy and in the broader context of global security and stability. The EU's involvement in the Black Sea region has been generally focused on promoting regional cooperation, fostering good governance, as well as encouraging trade, investment, and infrastructure development. The EU has also been offering support to democratization, conflict resolution, and energy security efforts in the region. As part of the CFSP, EU has been working closely with other international organizations and regional actors to address shared challenges and to build stronger partnerships. In summary, the text in German refers to the anticipation of a more active role of the European Union in various aspects of its relations with the Black Sea region, in line with the development of a Common Foreign and Security Policy.

The film starts with a murder of their friend TJ while cruising for sex in the local park at night and, while Caz is cut up by the death of his friend, Chris seems to want to push forward towards a professional career in commercial radio. They both want to promote soul music while the prevailing popular music is punk.Chris meets Tracy at the recording studio and persuades her to get his audition tape heard but he is not ready to sell out his identity to get a job in the mainstream. Caz meets a punk Billibud who talks about communism and the Socialist Workers Party, while wearing (admittedly nicked) Vivienne Westwood designer T-shirts. The murder and the different paths they seem to be taking causes tension between the buddies Chris and Caz. Chris discovers that he has a tape recorded of the murder but fails to hand it in as evidence. He is then pulled in by the police as a suspect because he was in possession of TJ's cassette radio. He tries to call Caz but Caz is busy with his new boyfriend and trying to get a bigger aerial for their pirate radio station. He calls Tracy and she helps him to get a solicitor. He tells her about the tape and she advises him to hand it in as evidence, but again, he puts...

The director does a wonderful job following through with the title of his film, truly portraying a picture of madness. I think the fact that this film is silent adds to the resemblance of madness, helping the viewer experience the characters inner world rather than the world outside his mind. This film just added to my feelings about foreign silent films vs. American, in that the foreign films work much more to exercise your mind and make you think rather than going for the fluffy film always with the happy ending, exercising the imagination very little.

Article: If cars had wings, they could fly and that just might happen, beginning in 2012. The company Terrafugia, based in Woburn, Massachusetts, says it plans to deliver its car-plane, the Transition, to customers by the end of 2012. \\"It's next 'wow' vehicle,\\" said Terrafugia vice president Richard Gersh. \\"Anybody can buy a Ferrari, but as we say, Ferraris don't fly.\\" The car-plane has wings that unfold for flying-a process the company says takes one minute-and fold back up for driving. A runway is still required to take off and land. The Transition is being marketed more as a plane that drives than a car that flies, although it is both. The company has been working with FAA to meet aircraft regulations, and with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to meet vehicle safety regulations. The company is aiming to sell the Transition to private pilots as a more convenient and cheaper way to fly. They say it saves you the trouble from trying to find another mode of transportation to get to and from airports: You drive the car to the airport and then you're good to go. When you land, you hold up the wings and hit the road. There are no expensive parking fees because you don't have to store it at an airport-you park it in the garage at home. The car-plane is designed to fly primarily under 10,000 feet. It has a maximum takeoff weight of 1,430 pounds, including fuel and passengers. Thrrafugia says the Transition reduces the potential for an accident by allowing pilots to drive under the bad weather instead of flying into marginal conditions. The Transition's price tag: 194,000. But there may be additional charges for options like a radio, , a transponder or a GPS. Another option is a full-plane parachute. \\"If you get into a very awful situation, it is the necessary safety option.\\" Gersh said. So far, the company has more than 70 orders with deposits. \\"We're working very closely with them, but there are still some remaining steps,\\" Brown said. Question: It takes the car-plane one minute to _ . - fold and unfold its wings - unfold wings for flying - land in the airport - meet flying safety regulations A:","response":"unfold wings for flying"},{"question":"Q: In this task you will be given a list of numbers and you should remove all duplicates in the list.

Nevertheless, their 1992 release \\"Adrenalize\\" did reach the top spot. Regarding their singles, several songs have reached high positions on the charts, including the US Billboard Hot 100. For example, their track \\"Love Bites\\" hit number one in 1988. However, it's important to mention that Def Leppard's chart success is not limited to a single noteworthy achievement.

A Twitter product for developers called Digits will let users log into apps with a phone number. While most apps require an email address to log in, Digits lets you register for apps with phone numbers instead. By entering a phone number, selecting your home country and entering a one-time passcode into the app (sent via SMS), you'll be ready to go. Digits is a part of Twitter Fabric, a toolkit designed to help developers build better, more lucrative apps. But it doesn't actually have anything to do with Twitter; Digits is a standalone service any app developer can use. An example of a user receiving a passcode from Twitter's Digits service via SMS, then using that passcode to log into an app. The announcement came on stage at the first Twitter Flight conference for mobile developers in San Francisco. The company said Digits will launch in 216 countries and in 28 languages on iOS, Android and the web later today. Twitter notes that logins are an issue in emerging markets because many people don't have PCs and email addresses; because smartphones are cheaper, it's more common to have a phone number. By relying on phone numbers, Digits could let some apps tap into a large group of new users. Markets aside, Digits solves a problem that faces every mobile user: the need to remember usernames and passwords — often long and complicated ones — to get up and running on an app. But companies can get creative, too. McDonald's is one of the first companies to use the service via its McDonald's Alarm app. This lets friends share coupons and offers with others; to redeem the offer, the user must prove they're a real person. \\"McDonald’s felt social sign-ins put too much burden on a user to share personal details, and that email addresses and passwords were too often forgotten or onerous to manage,\\" Twitter said in an official blog post. \\"Digits enables McDonald’s to quickly authenticate real users and get them into the app with a minimum of friction.\\" Developers will be able to build Digits into apps for free.

A detailed analysis of the review reveals the following concerns and negative experiences: 1. Impracticality: The reviewer explicitly states that the product is \\"Not very practical.\\" This demonstrates that the product did not meet their expectations in terms of usability and functionality. A practical product should be easy to use and serve its intended purpose efficiently. 2. Difficulty in positioning the product correctly: The reviewer mentions that they are having a hard time keeping the back part centered. This issue indicates that the product may be poorly designed or difficult to maneuver and adjust to fit the individual's needs. A well-designed product should be easy to position and provide the desired support and comfort. 3. Feeling suffocated or unsupported: The reviewer also points out that they either feel suffocated or experience no help in their posture while using the product. This observation is a major concern, as it suggests that the product is not only uncomfortable but also ineffective in addressing the issue it is designed to solve. People typically buy posture-correcting products to improve posture and alleviate any discomfort. However, this product appears to be causing more discomfort rather than providing a solution. 4. Overall negative tone: The language and tone used throughout the review convey dissatisfaction with the product.

As the audience begins to believe that Kaufman may have no real talent, his previously timid \\"foreign man\\" character puts on a rhinestone jacket and does a dead-on Elvis impersonation. The audience bursts into applause, realizing Kaufman had tricked them. He catches the eye of talent agent George Shapiro, who signs Kaufman as a client and immediately lands him a network TV series, Taxi, much to Kaufman's dismay, since he dislikes sitcoms. Because of the money, visibility, and a promise that he can do his own television special, Kaufman accepts the role, turning his foreign man into a mechanic named Latka Gravas. Secretly he hates doing the show and expresses a desire to quit. Invited to catch a different act at a nightclub, Shapiro witnesses a performance by a rude, loud-mouthed lounge singer, Tony Clifton, whom Kaufman wants to guest-star on Taxi. Clifton's bad attitude is matched by his horrible appearance and demeanor. But backstage, when he meets Shapiro in person, Clifton takes off his sunglasses and reveals that he is actually Kaufman. Clifton is a \\"villain character\\" created by Kaufman and his creative partner, Bob Zmuda. Once again, the gag is on the audience. Kaufman's profile increases with appearances on Saturday Night Live, but he has problems with his newfound fame. When performing live, audiences dislike his strange anti-humor and demand that he perform as Latka. At one show, he deliberately antagonizes attendees by reading The Great Gatsby aloud from start to finish. Kaufman shows up on the Taxi set as Clifton and proceeds to cause chaos until he is removed from the studio lot. He relates to Shapiro that he never knows exactly how to entertain an audience \\"short of faking my own death or setting the theater on fire.\\" answer the following question: What type of TV show is Kaufman's first?

(August 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) is released from a mental institution after spending 22 years in confinement. Lila Loomis (Vera Miles), sister of Marion Crane, vehemently protests with a petition that she has been circulating with signatures of 743 people, including the relatives of the seven people Norman killed prior to his incarceration, but her plea is dismissed. Norman is taken to his old home behind the Bates Motel by Dr. Bill Raymond (Robert Loggia), who assures him everything will be fine. Norman is introduced to the motel's new manager, Warren Toomey (Dennis Franz). The following day, Norman reports to a prearranged job as a dishwasher and busboy at a nearby diner, run by a kindly old lady named Emma Spool (Claudia Bryar). One of his co-workers there is Mary Samuels (Meg Tilly), a young waitress. After work, Mary claims she has been thrown out of her boyfriend's place and needs a place to stay. Norman offers to let her stay at the motel, then extends the offer to his home when he discovers that Toomey has turned what had been a shabby but respectable motel into a sleazy adult one. Norman's adjustment back into society appears to be going along well until \\"Mother\\" begins to make her presence known. Norman gets mysterious notes from \\"Mother\\" at the house and diner. Phone calls come from someone claiming to be Norman's mother. The next day, a drunk Toomey picks a fight at the diner after Norman fires him. Later, a figure in a black dress stabs Toomey to death with a kitchen knife as he is packing to leave the motel. As Norman begins to reconstruct his motel, he begins to doubt his sanity when he begins hearing voices in the house. He enters his mother's bedroom to find it looks exactly as it did 22 years ago. A sound lures him to the attic, where he is locked in. At the same time, a... A:","response":"In \\"Psycho II,\\" the mysterious notes to Norman Bates are sent by \\"Mother.\\" Throughout the movie, Norman receives notes and phone calls from someone claiming to be his mother, causing him to question his sanity and whether \\"Mother\\" is still controlling his actions. The notes and other incidents seem to imply that Norman's mother is still a presence in his life, even after his release from the mental institution. However, as the story unfolds, it is revealed that there are other forces at work, attempting to manipulate Norman and drive him back to his former psychotic state. Emma Spool, the kindly old lady who runs the nearby diner where Norman works, is eventually revealed to be behind these mysterious incidents. She claims to be Norman's biological mother, and through her actions, she sets in motion a series of events that push Norman to the edge. Emma Spool had ulterior motives to manipulate Norman in an attempt to regain control over her lost son. She was creating an illusion of \\"Mother\\" to confuse and deceive him. However, it is worth noting that there is a possibility that Emma may not have been the only person involved in manipulating Norman with the mysterious notes, as Mary Samuels, a young waitress who becomes Norman's friend, is also aware of the truth about \\"Mother\\" and is working with Dr. Bill Raymond to try to keep Norman's sanity in check. In conclusion, the primary sender of the mysterious notes to Norman Bates in \\"Psycho II\\" is Emma Spool, who claims to be his real mother. Her actions are an effort to manipulate Norman and drive him back to his former psychotic state, believing that they can be a family again. This reveal adds a layer of complexity to an already intricate plot full of suspense, mystery, and psychological manipulation. When considering whether to invest in a film proposal like this, it is essential to examine the depth of the characters, the intricacy of the plot, and its potential to engage audiences with intense suspense and thought-provoking themes."},{"question":"Given the question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.

Movie title: Persuasion Context: The film opens by cutting back and forth between scenes of a naval ship carrying Admiral Croft (John Woodvine), and a buggy carrying Mr. Shepherd (David Collings) and his daughter Mrs. Clay (Felicity Dean) to Kellynch Hall. Shepherd and Clay are accosted by creditors due to the debts owed by the residence's owner, Sir Walter Elliot (Corin Redgrave), while Croft discusses the end of the Napoleonic Wars with fellow men of the navy. Sir Walter, a vain foppish baronet, is faced with financial ruin unless he retrenches. Though Sir Walter initially opposes the idea, he eventually agrees to temporarily move to Bath while the hall is let; the idea came from Shepherd, family friend Lady Russell (Susan Fleetwood), and Sir Walter's second eldest daughter, the intelligent Anne (Amanda Root). Anne is visibly upset upon learning that the new tenant of Kellynch Hall will be Admiral Croft, who is the brother-in-law of Frederick Wentworth (CiarÃ¡n Hinds)âa naval captain she was persuaded to reject in marriage nine years previously because of his lack of prospects and connections. Wentworth is now wealthy from serving in the Wars, and has returned to England, presumably to find a wife. Later, Anne expresses to Lady Russell her unhappiness at her family's current financial predicament, and her past decision to reject the captain's proposal of marriage. Anne visits her other sister Mary (Sophie Thompson), a hypochondriac who has married into a local farming family. Anne patiently listens to the various complaints confided in her by each of the Musgrove family; this includes Mary's husband Charles, sisters-in-law Louisa (Emma Roberts) and Henrietta (Victoria Hamilton), and parents-in-law Mr and Mrs Musgrove (Roger Hammond and Judy Cornwell). Captain Wentworth comes to dine with the Musgroves, but Anne avoids going when she volunteers to nurse Mary's injured son.

The Takasakiyama Natural Zoological Garden, popular among visitors as a feeding ground for wild macaques inhabiting the surrounding area, launches a public poll for naming the first macaque born each year. The name had been inspired by Charlotte Elizabeth Diana, the newborn second child of Britain’s Prince William and his wife Catherine. She is the younger sister to Prince George, who is in line to inherit the British throne. It was the top choice with 59 of 853 total votes. Also in the running were Kei, after Japanese tennis player Kei Nishikori, and Elsa, a character in the Disney film Frozen. ”The name was publicly solicited and Charlotte suddenly became the most popular choice – with 59 votes out of the total 853 – after the British baby princess’s name was announced,” a zoo official said. “There was no vote for ‘Charlotte’ before the Monday night announcement.” The zoo announced the naming after a zookeeper spotted this year’s firstborn, a healthy baby girl, clinging to her mother yesterday. But the zoo soon met a barrage of phone calls and emails demanding a retraction and asking the zoo to imagine what the Japanese people would think if a British monkey were named after a member of Japan’s imperial family. “Since we announced the name we’ve been receiving calls and emails from people mostly complaining that it is rude to British people” to give a monkey the same name as a member of their royal family, the zoo official said. “This morning a TV commentator said he thinks it is alright, but most voices are against the idea,” he added. A zoo official reached for comment said they are discussing a possible name change for the baby macaque. Princess Charlotte’s birth caused an outbreak of patriotic fervour in Britain, where the press and public lauded her names, seen as a triple homage to her grandfather Prince Charles, great-grandmother Queen Elizabeth II and William’s late mother Diana. Britain’s royals are immensely popular in Japan, where their easy familiarity with the public stands in marked contrast to the austere image of the country’s own imperial clan. A recent visit by Prince William – who left heavily pregnant Kate at home – was followed in minute detail by Japan’s media, which revelled in the chance to show pictures of him dressed as a samurai lord. ||||| TOKYO (AP) — A Japanese zoo has apologized for naming a baby monkey Charlotte after the newborn British princess following complaints at home.

The Japanese... (Associated Press) The Takasakiyama Natural Zoological Garden said Thursday it was considering renaming the macaque. It was flooded with angry calls and emails Wednesday hours after announcing the name for its first monkey born this year, a tradition at the city-run zoo in southern Japan. Charlotte was the favorite in a public ballot, receiving 59 out of 853 votes in just over a month until Wednesday, when the female monkey was born. Opponents largely said giving the princess' name to a monkey is disrespectful to British royals. According to zoo official Akira Asano, some of them said that the Japanese people would feel offended if a monkey were named after Japanese princesses. He said the zoo has also received support for Charlotte, and the views are now largely divided. \\"We deeply apologize for causing trouble to many people over the naming of the first baby (monkey),\\" said a statement posted on the zoo website. \\"We take these opinions seriously.\\" Asano said he was not aware of any complaints from British citizens. Officials of the zoo and the city of Oita were still discussing what to do with the monkey's name. The British Embassy in Tokyo declined to comment, while Japan's foreign ministry said it was not involved with the issue. ||||| Image copyright AFP Image caption More than 1,300 monkeys roam freely at the zoo in southern Japan A Japanese zoo has apologised after naming a baby monkey Charlotte in honour of the newborn British princess, it's reported.

The zoo says the name was chosen after a public vote, a tradition for their first newborn macaque monkey each year. Charlotte received the most votes, although it wasn't exactly a runaway winner, with 59 out of 853 people choosing it. But other members of the public felt that it was disrespectful to the British royal family to name a monkey after a princess.

By the time El Greco arrived in Rome, Michelangelo and Raphael were dead, but their example continued to be paramount, and somewhat overwhelming for young painters. El Greco was determined to make his own mark in Rome defending his personal artistic views, ideas and style. He singled out Correggio and Parmigianino for particular praise, but he did not hesitate to dismiss Michelangelo's Last Judgment in the Sistine Chapel; he extended an offer to Pope Pius V to paint over the whole work in accord with the new and stricter Catholic thinking. When he was later asked what he thought about Michelangelo, El Greco replied that \\"he was a good man, but he did not know how to paint\\". And thus we are confronted by a paradox: El Greco is said to have reacted most strongly or even condemned Michelangelo, but found it impossible to withstand his influence. Michelangelo's influence can be seen in later El Greco works such as the Allegory of the Holy League. By painting portraits of Michelangelo, Titian, Clovio and, presumably, Raphael in one of his works (The Purification of the Temple), El Greco not only expressed his gratitude but also advanced the claim to rival these masters. As his own commentaries indicate, El Greco viewed Titian, Michelangelo and Raphael as models to emulate. In his 17th century Chronicles, Giulio Mancini included El Greco among the painters who had initiated, in various ways, a re-evaluation of Michelangelo's teachings.Because of his unconventional artistic beliefs (such as his dismissal of Michelangelo's technique) and personality, El Greco soon acquired enemies in Rome. Architect and writer Pirro Ligorio called him a \\"foolish foreigner\\", and newly discovered archival material reveals a skirmish with Farnese, who obliged the young artist to leave his palace. On 6 July 1572, El Greco officially complained about this event. A few months later, on 18 September 1572, he paid his dues to the Guild of Saint Luke in Rome as a miniature painter. At the end of that year, El Greco opened his own workshop and...

Since the constant term on the left side is -237, we can add 237 to both sides of the equation to cancel it out: -45 * s - 237 + 237 = -12 + 237 -45 * s = 225 Step 3: Solve for the variable (s) Now that we have the term with the variable (s) isolated on one side, we can determine the value of the variable by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of the variable, which is -45: -45 * s / -45 = 225 / -45 s = -5 So the answer is s = -5."},{"question":"Room facilities: Additional Toilet, Additional bathroom, Air conditioning, Alarm clock, Bath or Shower, Bathroom, Cable Channels, Carpeted, Coffee machine, Desk, Dining area, Dishwasher, Flat-screen TV, Free toiletries, Hairdryer, Heating, Iron, Kitchen, Kitchenware, Linen, Microwave, Pay-per-view Channels, Radio, Refrigerator, Safety Deposit Box, Satellite Channels, Seating Area, Shower, Sofa, Sofa bed, Stovetop, TV, Tea/Coffee Maker, Telephone, Toilet, Toilet paper, Towels, Upper floors accessible by lift, iPod dock Please remove spaces between words.","response":"Roomfacilities:AdditionalToilet,Additionalbathroom,Airconditioning,Alarmclock,BathorShower,Bathroom,CableChannels,Carpeted,Coffeemachine,Desk,Diningarea,Dishwasher,FlatscreenTV,Freetoiletries,Hairdryer,Heating,Iron,Kitchen,Kitchenware,Linen,Microwave,Pay-per-viewChannels,Radio,Refrigerator,SafetyDepositBox,SatelliteChannels,SeatingArea,Shower,Sofa,Sofabed,Stovetop,TV,Tea/CoffeeMaker,Telephone,Toilet,Toiletpaper,Towels,Upperfloorsaccessiblebylift,iPoddock"},{"question":"Wenn die sudanesische Regierung die Bemühungen der internationalen Gemeinschaft in Darfur weiter behindert, muss sie bestraft werden.

Concise communication is an essential skill when it comes to effective information exchange, either in written or verbal forms. A brief sentence can convey the necessary information without extraneous details that could potentially confuse readers or listeners. Brevity can often enhance the clarity of a message by boiling it down to its most crucial elements. That being said, several factors play a critical role in crafting a succinct yet informative message. Firstly, the language used in a sentence is essential. Choosing precise and specific words can significantly impact the level of understanding. In addition, appropriate language can help address the intended audience, whether it is a professional, casual, or academic setting. Moreover, syntax and grammatical structure influence the effectiveness of a brief sentence, as improper construction can lead to ambiguity or misinterpretation. Secondly, context plays a significant role. One must be aware of the knowledge and background that the audience possesses, as well as common shared experiences or perspectives to make the brief sentence more meaningful and relatable. In some cases, this can also involve the use of familiar examples or analogies. Lastly, the intention behind the message is another crucial factor. Before crafting a brief sentence, it's essential to determine the purpose of the communication, such as to inform, persuade, entertain, or provoke thought. Clarity on the message's purpose can pave the way for shaping a more effective and poignant sentence. In conclusion, a brief sentence has the potential to convey vital information in a clear and concise manner. To achieve this, one must pay attention to the language used, the context and background knowledge of the audience, and the overall intention of the message."},{"question":"Article:The company, which sells passes for gyms around the UK, acknowledged that 300,000 email addresses and passwords of its members had been accessed on Thursday.

Options: - indigestion - heartburn - stomach ache - gain energy - overeating Explain why a human would choose \\"overeating\\" to answer the question above: A:","response":"A human might choose \\"overeating\\" as an answer to the question above because it is one of the most immediate and noticeable consequences of not choosing the right amount of food during breakfast or any meal, respectively. Overeating occurs when a person consumes more food than is necessary for their body's energy needs. This can be due to various factors, such as not measuring portions, emotional eating, or lack of awareness of hunger cues. When a person does not portion their food correctly or is unsure how much they should consume during breakfast, they may continue eating until they feel full or uncomfortable. This can lead to immediate issues like indigestion, heartburn, and stomach aches. However, it also has long-term consequences, including the possibility of weight gain, metabolic issues, and an increased risk for chronic health conditions such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and obesity. Eating large quantities of food during breakfast can cause indigestion, as the body struggles to break down and process the surplus of food. This can lead to feelings of discomfort, fullness, and bloating. Moreover, heartburn may arise when a person consumes fatty, spicy, or high-acidic foods that can irritate the stomach lining or cause acid reflux. Stomach aches can also be experienced after overeating, as the stomach expands to accommodate the excessive amount of food consumed. This expansion can cause stomach cramps or pain, which could continue for hours after the meal. If overeating becomes a frequent habit, these symptoms may become more severe. While eating breakfast is essential to gaining energy for the day, consuming too much food can have the opposite effect. Overeating may cause fatigue and sluggishness due to the body directing most of its energy resources towards digesting and processing the consumed food. In summary, a human would likely choose \\"overeating\\" as an answer to the question because it is one of the most apparent and direct results of not choosing the correct amount of food during breakfast or any meal. Overeating not only leads to immediate discomfort, such as indigestion, heartburn, and stomach aches but can also contribute to long-term health issues, making it an essential aspect to consider when discussing the effects of not regulating meal portions effectively."},{"question":"Translate to German: THERE ARE QUITE A NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTS AND FORMS, AS WELL AS THERE ARE OTHER CUSTOMS PROCEDURES.

Planning is progressing for both the upcoming summit between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in at the end of April and the expected meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim in late May or early June. President Trump said Tuesday that there had been talks at “extremely high levels” between his administration and the North Korean government. Later it was reported that Mike Pompeo, the director of the Central Intelligence Agency and a secretary of state nominee, met recently with Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang. Trump also noted the talks have been marked by “a lot of goodwill” and that “there has been a major change in terms of North Korea’s behavior,” since Kim’s Olympic outreach this year, in which he sent a large delegation to the Pyeongchang Winter games in South Korea, suspended nuclear and missile tests, and expressed a willingness to engage in denuclearization talks. The turn toward diplomacy has reduced, for now, the potential for conflict over the North’s accelerated efforts last year to develop an operational nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the U.S. mainland. The North Korean leader’s decision to engage in denuclearization talks was likely motivated by both Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign, which increased sanctions and the threat of military action against the North, and by South Korean President Moon’s reassuring outreach efforts to improve inter-Korean relations. Trump’s motivation in pursuing a nuclear deal with North Korea, in addition to resolving a growing national security threat, could also have a political component. According to North Korea analysts at the Sejong Institute in South Korea, the Trump administration is likely calculating how achieving such an agreement could help boost the president’s chances for re-election in 2020. “If I were Trump, I...

The 19-year-old was hooked by Van Gaal after only 39 minutes at St Mary's Stadium on Monday night during Manchester United's 2-1 victory over the Saints. McNair was struggling to contain Southampton strikers Shane Long and Graziano Pelle, forcing Van Gaal into replacing him prematurely. Paddy McNair (centre) was substituted after only 39 minutes for Manchester United against Southampton. McNair (centre) takes his seat in the stands having been replaced by his manager on Monday night. United boss Louis van Gaal admitted he 'had to' substitute McNair against Southampton. McNair shakes Van Gaal's hand as he leaves the field having been replaced during United's 2-1 victory. Speaking to Sky Sports after the match, Van Gaal explained: 'He (McNair) hadn't any confidence. He had already given three big chances away. 'I had to (substitute him), it's very disappointing for me and also for Paddy, but I had to because as a manager, I'm responsible to win. 'And I think, after the change, we played a little better.' Robin van Persie's brace, either side of a Pelle strike, ensured United left the south coast with three points. McNair (right) slices the ball forward off his foot during the early stages of the Southampton clash. Robin van Persie scored what turned out to be the winning goal for Manchester United. But in spite of the fact United won the game, McNair was exposed time after time in defence and was substituted - even though Chris Smalling had already departed early with an injury. Jonny Evans came on to replace Smalling, before McNair made way for midfielder Ander Herrera as Michael Carrick dropped back in to the centre of defence in Van Gaal's 3-5-2 system. And, despite admitting it will be difficult for McNair to accept being replaced so early, Van Gaal insisted that it was a necessity which will serve the Northern Irishman well long term. Van Gaal continued: 'Of course, it's tough (for McNair), but it's also in his best interests.' The victory moved United up to third in the Premier League - their highest position since they claimed the title in 2012-13 under Sir Alex Ferguson.

The struggling Web pioneer said Thursday the stolen info included names, e-mail addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, passwords and, in some cases, encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers. Yahoo’s probe of the breach — the biggest ever in terms of the number of accounts affected — turned up no evidence that hackers got credit-card data or bank account information, it said, noting it doesn’t store that on the affected network. “The investigation has found no evidence that the state-sponsored actor is currently in Yahoo’s network,” the company said in a statement, without naming the country. Yahoo is working “closely with law enforcement” as a probe of the incident continues, it said. Analysts said the breach could end up lowering the 4.8 billion price that Verizon Communications agreed to pay to acquire Yahoo this summer. “We understand that Yahoo is conducting an active investigation of this matter, but we otherwise have limited information and understanding of the impact,” Verizon said, adding it had learned of the breach two days earlier. Yahoo said it’s notifying affected users and has taken steps to secure their accounts, including asking potentially affected users to change their passwords. Yahoo said earlier this summer that it was investigating a data breach after hackers boasted about the attack.

Ramirez hit the post with a low shot and struck the bar directly from a corner as Boro continued strongly. But Shaqiri's effort went in off the upright to level with 25 minutes left. The Switzerland international's left-footed strike had too much curl and power for Boro's debutant keeper Victor Valdes - formerly of Barcelona and Manchester United - who could only palm on to the post and in. Shaqiri had been quiet until that point - Boro dominated the first half entirely - and although Stoke improved after the break their equaliser came through their only shot on target, with Marko Arnautovic and Bojan also disappointing in attack. There were five competitive debuts for Middlesbrough including the impressive Ramirez, who joined on a free transfer after a successful loan spell last season. The 10 signings Boro have made is more than any other Premier League side and Negredo's goal was a promising sign of what might come. The Spaniard rose strongly to force the ball over the line under pressure from the Stoke defence - a combination of head and shoulder proving enough to beat the 40-year-old Shay Given. But Boro face losing £11.75m midfielder Marten de Roon to injury after the Belgian was forced off with an apparent hamstring problem early in the first half. There were a few nervy moments for Valdes, who was particularly exposed when mis-directing a punched clearance into Negredo's face under pressure, with Ramirez having to clear from under his own crossbar. Middlesbrough's success last season was built on a solid defence that saw them concede just eight goals at home all season and Antonio Barragan slotted in comfortably alongside Ben Gibson at centre-back with Daniel Ayala out injured. Mark Hughes' Stoke were far less busy in the transfer market. Wales midfielder Joe Allen did join from Liverpool after being named in the Euro 2016 team of the tournament, and Egyptian winger Ramadan Sobhi from Al Ahly came in for a fee that could rise to £5m. But Allen was named on the bench and had little impact after coming on with just over 10 minutes to play, while Sobhi was not in the squad. Back-up goalkeeper Given started for the Potters because England keeper Jack Butland suffered an ankle injury in training before today's game. Butland hurt the same ankle he broke when playing in the 3-2 friendly win over Germany in March, but a scan has shown the injury is not serious. Before kick-off he tweeted: \\"Great news from my scans, ankle is solid but I've damaged some scar tissue which is giving me the pain, will settle down quick, back soon.\\" And speaking after the game, Stoke boss Mark Hughes said Butland would be out for a \\"couple of weeks rather than anything more sinister\\". Ramirez went some way towards proving he can repeat his excellent form from last season with a lively and inventive display. The Uruguayan produced some lovely touches, linked up with Negredo well, and had his low driven shot found the inside rather than the outside of the post, Boro may well have been celebrating victory in the top flight for the first time since 2009. Media playback is not supported on this device Middlesbrough manager Aitor Karanka: \\"We played an amazing game. Three months ago we were in the Championship and played today against a team that has finished ninth in the Premier League in the last three seasons. \\"For us it was a difficult test, a good test, with all the pressure of the first game in the Premier League, but I'm really pleased. \\"Alvaro and Gaston are the reflection of the team.

He picked up a dish from a table, and suddenly a snake appeared and bit him on the hand. A few days earlier, the snake came to the restaurant from Asia in a box of bananas. It climbed out of the box and hid under the dish. \\" I tried to pick it up and it bit me. I threw it away, but it landed in the fridge. So I closed the door.\\" Jackson said. Anyway, Jackson was cool and he took a photo of the snake with his mobile phone. Soon his hand began to ache and he went to hospital. Then his chest began to hurt.

His predecessor and Lang's aide, Mike McAra, has recently died in an apparent drowning accident. The writer travels to Old Haven on Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, where Lang and his wife Ruth (Olivia Williams) are staying, along with Lang's personal assistant (and implied mistress), Amelia Bly (Kim Cattrall). Amelia forbids the writer to take McAra's manuscript outside, emphasizing that it is a security risk. Shortly after the writer's arrival, former Foreign Secretary Richard Rycart (Robert Pugh) accuses Lang of authorizing the illegal seizure of suspected terrorists and handing them over for torture by the CIA, a possible war crime. Lang faces prosecution by the International Criminal Court unless he stays in the U.S. (or one of the few other countries that does not recognise the court's jurisdiction). While Lang is in Washington, the writer finds items in McAra's room suggesting he might have stumbled across a dark secret. Among them is an envelope containing photographs and a phone number the writer discovers is Rycart's. During a bike ride, the writer encounters an old man (Eli Wallach) who tells him the current couldn't have taken McAra's body from the ferry where he disappeared to the beach where it was discovered. He also reveals a neighbour saw flashlights on the beach the night McAra died, but later fell down the stairs and went into a coma. Later, Ruth admits to the writer Lang had never been very political, and until recently always took her advice. When he tells her the old man's story, she suddenly rushes out into the rainy night to \\"clear her head.\\" Upon returning, she reveals Lang and McAra had argued the night before his death.

And I was wondering What will Ash want to do next? A:","response":"Given the situation you described, Ash has started the engine of a lawnmower to mow the lawn. Considering the potential steps that Ash might take next, I would like to break it down into a few categories: 1. Safety measures 2. Ensuring equipment is working efficiently 3. Lawn mowing techniques 4. Lawn care and maintenance. 1. Safety measures: Before starting the actual mowing process, Ash would want to ensure they are taking all necessary safety precautions to avoid accidents and injuries. Some steps they might follow include: a) Wearing proper protective equipment, such as close-toed shoes, gloves, long pants, and, if needed, safety glasses and earmuffs. b) Checking the lawn for any debris, rocks, or hazards that could be thrown by the lawnmower or possibly damage the machine. c) Ensuring no children or pets are in the vicinity before starting to mow 2. Ensuring equipment is working efficiently: Ash may want to examine the lawnmower and ensure everything is in working order to avoid potential malfunctions or breakdowns. Some steps they could follow include: a) Ensuring the fuel tank is filled with the appropriate fuel. b) Checking the oil levels and topping off if necessary. c) Inspecting the mower blades for sharpness and damage, and replacing or sharpening if required. d) Confirming that the lawnmower setting is adjusted to the desired grass height. e) Inspecting the wheels and wheel height adjusters. f) Verifying that all the nuts, bolts, and fastenings are tightened securely. g) Checking the air filter for dirt and debris. 3. Lawn mowing techniques: To achieve an even and visually appealing cut, Ash might want to adopt certain lawn mowing techniques that can optimize efficiency as well as improve the health of the grass. Some strategies they could follow include: a) Mowing in straight lines by selecting a point in the distance to focus on and maintain that consistent direction for each row. b) Changing the mowing pattern with each session to avoid the grass being depressed or matted in a specific direction. c) Avoiding mowing the lawn when it's wet to ensure better control and prevent clumping of grass clippings. d) Adjusting the mowing speed based on the grass type, terrain, and overall mower efficiency. e) Mowing around the edges of the property first and then working on the interior. 4. Lawn care and maintenance: After the mowing process, Ash may want to follow good lawn maintenance practices to keep the yard healthy and visually appealing. Some steps they could follow include: a) Using a grass catcher or bag attachment to collect clippings or, alternatively, using a leaf blower or rake to remove any leftover clippings from the lawn. b) Watering the lawn after mowing, especially during dry spells or in hot weather. c) Applying fertilizer as needed for optimal nutrient distribution and growth. d) Edging along sidewalks, driveways, and garden beds to maintain a clean and polished appearance. e) Aerating the soil to improve oxygen flow and support root growth. f) Regularly inspecting the lawn for any weeds or pests and treating them accordingly. In conclusion, once Ash has started the lawnmower engine and is ready to mow, they would first want to consider safety measures, inspect the equipment to ensure it is working efficiently, follow proper lawn mowing techniques, and perform lawn care and maintenance. This comprehensive approach will not only result in a well-manicured lawn but also contribute to the overall health and appearance of the yard."},{"question":"Create a set of triples that describes the content in the following sentence.

Been here three times and man, this place is mostly bad. First experience here: party of eight, Friday night, every other place around (despite the negative temperatures) was packed. We sat, ordered drinks, ordered food. Place was empty. Drinks kept coming and after 45 minutes, we began to ask about our food. The waitress nervously informed us \\"it was coming\\". About 15-30 minutes later, we were informed that our ticket was lost and all food would be comped. Second trip was St. Patty's Day -- they were advertising beer specials and corned beef and cabbage. Went to the bar to order and the exasperated waitress said \\"Nothing here is managed well!! It's going to take well over an hour for your food\\" We got Thai that night. Third trip (what, we're gluttons for punishment!) we were overcharged from the advertised drink specials. Waitress was very nice, but not great at getting things spot on (come on, fried potatoes do not count as a salad!). Other than that, things were okay. Food is fine -- typical mass distributor American fare, but not bad at all. Mixed drinks were weak. Waitresses have always been pretty good/fast and apologetic for their working conditions. I will go back, because I love the patio and the fact that it rarely ever seems busy, which is good when you are not looking for the typical college crowd hangout and just want a big place to order some mediocre food and have a few drinks.","response":"The sentiment of this review can be described as mixed or even leaning negative. Although the reviewer experienced several issues with the establishment, they also found some positive aspects. On the negative side, the reviewer recounts multiple instances of bad service, unorganized management, and management not honoring advertised promotions. Issues such as long wait times for food, lost tickets, and being overcharged were mentioned. They also commented on weak mixed drinks and mass distributor fare as average or unremarkable. However, some positive aspects were noted in the review as well. The reviewer appreciated the friendliness and general efficiency of the waitresses while also noting their empathy towards the staff for the working conditions. They seemed to be fond of the establishment's patio and the quieter atmosphere when compared to busier college bars. The reviewer even mentioned a willingness to return due to these positive aspects. Overall, it appears that the reviewer has mixed feelings towards the establishment. They recognize its flaws and negative aspects, but still find redeeming qualities that continue to draw them back to the place for a relaxing and relatively secluded experience."},{"question":"What are some extracurricular activities I could do to improve my chances at getting into Ivy League schools?

By making your children obey the rules at home, you're actually doing them a favor in the long run. Don't ever punish your children unless they're disrespectful, but when they are, don't hesitate to show them that they've done something wrong. Your rules should be reasonable, simple, and consistent. Be clear with your children about what the rules in your house early on. Don't get upset if your children break a rule that they weren't even aware of. When your child is disrespectful to you, you have two choices: you can lash out in the same way, or you can fight to stay calm. The former option teaches your child that it is acceptable to be rude when someone starts frustrating you. The latter, which is the better choice, teaches that it's important to stay respectful even in the face of people who won't do the same for you. If you can manage to stay respectful, your children will thank you when they eventually have to deal with an annoying boss or an unpleasant teacher. This is vital. Consistent enforcement of your rules shows your children that it's not possible to weasel out of their responsibilities. On the other hand, if you fail to teach your children respect when you're tired or when it's inconvenient, they'll quickly learn that they can get away with bad behavior sometimes. Children are smarter than they're often given credit for. If there's a way for them to get out of learning a valuable lesson, they'll often find it. It's also important to make sure your partner is on the same page as you here. Having one caretaker who is \\"hard\\" and another who is \\"soft\\" will just teach your children to go to the soft one when they've misbehaved. Whenever you can, have the punishment for disrespect be the natural consequences of your child's actions. In other words, if their disrespect causes something bad to happen to them, let this happen (as long as it is not a serious, physical danger, obviously). The earlier children learn that being disrespectful only creates problems for themselves, the better. For example, if your child is repeatedly rude to her friend when they are playing together, a good natural consequence might be to send the friend home, have your child hand-write an apology letter, and hand-deliver it.","response":"The article emphasizes the importance of teaching children to obey rules and respect others. Rules should be reasonable, simple, and consistent, and children must be made aware of them early on. When a child is disrespectful, the parent should remain calm and model respectful behavior. Consistent enforcement of rules is crucial to prevent children from thinking they can avoid responsibilities. Parents and caretakers should work together to avoid confusing children with mixed messages. Natural consequences can be an effective way to teach children the negative outcomes of disrespect, such as having them apologize and mend relationships when they've been rude to others."},{"question":"Fossils give clues about major geological events.

HBO’s “The Jinx” has been all over the news for concluding with an apparent murder confession by its subject, Manhattan real estate scion Robert Durst. But that’s just the most extreme example. Less splashy films such as “Marwencol” (2010) and “The Overnighters” (2014) pulled revelatory, last-act rabbits out of the hat as well. In most cases the twists are all the more impressive because not even the filmmakers (presumably) saw them coming. Such a reversal jolts “An Honest Liar,” Justin Weinstein and Tyler Measom’s freewheeling and beguiling documentary about master illusionist and disillusionist James “The Amazing” Randi. Now 86, the white-bearded, fast talking, gnomic Randi first fell under the spell of magic when as a boy in Toronto he watched Harry Blackstone levitate a woman onstage. He couldn’t figure out how Blackstone did it, but he wanted to do the same. At the age of 17, in a move that would lack all credibility in a fictional narrative, Randi ran away from home and joined a carnival. Thereafter, Randi’s life played much like a history of TV talk shows. In a montage of clips, he’s seen dazzling hoary hosts such as Mike Douglas, Merv Griffin, and amateur magician Johnny Carson with his tricks, many of which are masochistic improvements on escape stunts by Houdini. At times it seems as though the film is becoming a chronology of Carson’s different suit jackets and ties. But at the age of 55, after Randi nearly died while locked inside a milk can filled with water, he called it quits. “There comes a time,” he explained, “when you don’t want to see a little old guy come out of a can.” Then began his career of disillusionment. As one of his admirers and fellow magicians relates, in a Faustian moment early in his career Randi found himself swarmed by desperate people who saw him as a seer and offered him money to reassure them about their future. More tempting than the money was the feeling of power that comes with such grandiose deception. But Randi rejected the temptation, and became — again, like Houdini — a debunker of phony faith healers, charlatans and, repeatedly, Uri Geller. But it takes one to show one. Randi employed deceits of varying complexity to unmask the deceivers, some with unexpected consequences. He promoted his young partner Jose Alvarez as a mystic who could channel “Carlos,” a prophetic, 35,000-year-old spirit. Carlos became an overnight superstar until Randi exposed the believers’ credulousness by uncovering the man behind the curtain. But the repercussions of the well-intended fraud would haunt him in his old age. It would violate a taboo to relate how this movie magic, masterfully orchestrated by Weinstein and Measom, is done. Their film is as smooth as Randi’s patter and demonstrates how the documentarian’s camera is quicker than the eye. What was this article about?","response":"This article is a review of the documentary \\"An Honest Liar\\" by Justin Weinstein and Tyler Measom. The documentary is centered around the life and career of master illusionist and disillusionist James \\"The Amazing\\" Randi. The film delves into Randi's beginnings, his escape from his family to join a carnival at the age of 17, and his career as a magician on various TV talk shows. It also delves into Randi's transition from magician to debunker of charlatans, faith healers, and other tricksters. The documentary successfully combines elements of surprise with a smooth narrative, offering a detailed portrayal of Randi's life and demonstrating the filmmakers' skillful documentarian techniques."},{"question":"Nach einem 18 Monate dauernden, arbeitsintensiven Umbau, der hauptsächlich von Joël en Julie selbst durchgeführt wurde, stehen nun die Türen des Casa Rural Arroyo de la Greda offen.

As Kenya's Kipsang, 31, approached the finish in front of Berlin's iconic Brandenburg Gate, for a new world record of 2 hrs 3 mins and 23 secs, he was briefly joined by a man in running kit and a race number.Having leapt from the crowd, the intruder, an ambush marketer wearing a t-shirt promoting an escort website, broke the tape just before the bemused Kipsang.The intruder was chased by race staff in the finish area before being handed over to police.A Berlin police spokesman confirmed that the man has been charged with trespassing and has subsequently been banned from future events run by the Berlin marathon's organizers.Security had been tightened at this year's Berlin race in the wake of April's bomb attack on the Boston marathon which left three dead and 250 injured and for the first time the Berlin finish area was closed off.Kipsang's new mark was the ninth time a world marathon record has been set in Berlin. The Kenyan shaved 15 seconds off compatriot Patrick Makau's mark set two years ago in the German capital. ||||| “And now I have achieved the dream,” Kipsang said. Although security in Berlin had been increased after the bombings at the Boston Marathon in April, a man wearing a yellow T-shirt stepped out of the crowd near the finish line and raised his arms, breaking the tape just ahead of Kipsang in an apparent stunt of ambush marketing. According to Agence France-Presse, the man was promoting a Web site for an escort service. He was intercepted by race staff, handed over to the police and charged with trespassing, the news agency reported. Video showed Kipsang steering clear to the man’s left and also raising his arms in victory, then smiling as he wrapped himself in the Kenyan flag. Photo Eliud Kipchoge of Kenya finished second in 2:04:05 in only his second marathon, and Geoffrey Kipsang of Kenya — no relation to Wilson — took third in 2:06:26. Florence Kiplagat of Kenya won the women’s race in 2:21:13. As Sunday’s race unfolded, Kipsang patiently hung near the rear of the lead pack of 8 to 10 runners, assured in knowing that the pacesetters were part of his training group.

At about 35 kilometers, or 21.7 miles, with the pace now about 20 seconds slower than Makau’s record time, Kipsang surged to the front and eventually subdued all challengers. After two years of trying, he had the world record to himself. Running elegantly and carrying his arms low, Kipsang challenged Makau’s record in the fall of 2011 at the Frankfurt Marathon and missed by only four seconds with a finish of 2:04:42. At the time, it was the second-fastest marathon ever run. Kipsang then won the 2012 London Marathon and became a favorite at the London Games. But the Olympic race came on a hot and humid day on a course with so many turns it must have seemed at times like a Formula One race. Kipsang settled for a bronze medal while Stephen Kiprotich, a Ugandan who trains in Kenya, won the gold. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Kipsang was scheduled to run the 2012 New York City Marathon last November and had arrived in the city along with tens of thousands of other runners, only to learn that the race had been canceled after Hurricane Sandy. Elite marathon runners generally run only two marathons a year, which means each race is hugely important to their potential earnings. Kipsang was attempting his third marathon in an Olympic year. He missed out on a chance at the 130,000 prize for first place. “I was a little disappointed when there was no race, but we saw on TV that there was a lot of destruction and loss of life,” Kipsang said in an interview at the time. “We understand.” On Sunday, Kipsang won 54,000 in prize money and 68,000 in bonus money for the world record. And he prevailed in front of previous world-record holders from Berlin on hand to mark the race’s 40th year. “Looking at my marathon progress and career so far, I still think I have the potential to run faster,” Kipsang told reporters. “Anything under 2:03:23 would do.” ||||| What is a summary?","response":"A man trespassed at the Berlin marathon and broke the finish tape ahead of the winner and world-record holder Wilson Kipsang.

Translate to English English:","response":"It is easy to understand the people's nonexistent interest in such European construction, which is done behind their backs and where their everyday concerns are not considered. This statement criticizes an interpretation of the institution-building process for the European Union (EU). Here, the speaker seems to claim that the institutions and systems that form the EU are designed and put into practice without the involvement of the populace that these institutions are supposed to serve. This method of approaching political institution-building—the 'top-down' approach—is seen by the speaker as a reason for the lack of public interest and engagement with the process of European construction. The speaker is suggesting that if the people are not included or consulted during the process, then they will ultimately show a lack of interest and potentially resentment or disappointment in the result. Furthermore, there’s also the implication that the concerns of the everyday people are not taken into account during this European construction process. \\"Everyday concerns\\" might mean anything from economic issues, such as jobs and housing, to social issues, like education and health care, to more systemic issues, such as rules and regulations that affect their daily life. The speaker implies that those responsible for the construction of Europe are more focused on their political, ideological, or econometric models rather than the day-to-day reality of the people they purport to serve. In democracy, public engagement and consultation are critical in the formation of any institution or policy. When the people do not feel heard or feel left out, it can create disillusionment and lack of trust towards the institutions, potentially undermining their legitimacy in the eyes of the public. The speaker’s critique may be urging those involved in European construction to include public involvement and consideration of everyday concerns in their processes to foster greater public interest, support, engagement, and ultimately, the success of European construction. Finally, the statement also contains an underlying assumption: that people would be interested and willing to actively engage in the construction of Europe if they were included in the process and if their daily concerns were taken into account. This may be a call for both greater transparency in the European construction process as well as more robust mechanisms for public input and engagement."},{"question":"Translate the following sentence to German: That directive is certainly in need of improvement, but in its own context and not this one.","response":"Diese Anweisung muss sicherlich verbessert werden, aber in ihrem eigenen Zusammenhang und nicht in diesem.

The target remained in Indianapolis Center's airspace for another six minutes, then crossed into the western portion of Washington Center's airspace at 9:10. As Indianapolis Center continued searching for the aircraft, two managers and the controller responsible for American 77 looked to the west and southwest along the flight's projected path, not east-where the aircraft was now heading. Managers did not instruct other controllers at Indianapolis Center to turn on their primary radar coverage to join in the search for American 77. In sum, Indianapolis Center never saw Flight 77 turn around. By the time it reappeared in primary radar coverage, controllers had either stopped looking for the aircraft because they thought it had crashed or were looking toward the west. Although the Command Center learned Flight 77 was missing, neither it nor FAA headquarters issued an all points bulletin to surrounding centers to search for primary radar targets. American 77 traveled undetected for 36 minutes on a course heading due east for Washington, D.C. By 9:25, FAA's Herndon Command Center and FAA headquarters knew two aircraft had crashed into the World Trade Center. They knew American 77 was lost. At least some FAA officials in Boston Center and the New England Region knew that a hijacker on board American 11 had said \\"we have some planes.\\" Concerns over the safety of other aircraft began to mount. A manager at the Herndon Command Center asked FAA headquarters if they wanted to order a \\"nationwide ground stop.\\" While this was being discussed by executives at FAA headquarters, the Command Center ordered one at 9:25. The Command Center kept looking for American 77. At 9:21, it advised the Dulles terminal control facility, and Dulles urged its controllers to look for primary targets. At 9:32, they found one. Several of the Dulles controllers \\"observed a primary radar target tracking eastbound at a high rate of speed\\" and notified Reagan National Airport. FAA personnel at both Reagan National and Dulles airports notified the Secret Service. Do you have any questions?","response":"Based on the radar reconstruction and the details provided, American Airlines Flight 77 was lost and undetected for 36 minutes. Primarily due to the misdirection of search efforts by controllers and managers and the lack of an all points bulletin to surrounding centers to search for primary radar targets. When it comes to concerns over the safety of other aircraft and the response of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), it appears that a nationwide ground stop was being discussed by executives at FAA headquarters. The decision to order a nationwide ground stop eventually came from the Command Center at 9:25 AM. Moreover, at 9:21 AM, the Command Center advised the Dulles Terminal Control Facility about the missing Flight 77, prompting controllers at Dulles to search for primary targets. The primary radar target was finally detected at 9:32 AM, moving eastbound at a high rate of speed. Following this detection, personnel at both Reagan National Airport and Dulles Airport notified the Secret Service. It's clear that the tracking and communication regarding American Airlines Flight 77 had numerous challenges. The Indianapolis Center's failure to see Flight 77 turn around and their search towards the west rather than the east contributed to the aircraft traveling undetected for a potentially vital 36 minutes. In conclusion, the radar reconstruction highlights the challenges that emerged during the tracking and communication for American Airlines Flight 77, the subsequent nationwide grounding of aircraft, and the eventual detection of the aircraft heading for Washington, D.C. These issues raise questions about the efficiency and effectiveness of the FAA's communication, collaboration, and response during crisis situations."},{"question":"Jackie, je to on.

A cliche is a description that has been so overused it has lost its meaning. Many readers will gloss over a cliche and/or question the poet’s creativity when they come across a cliche. Avoid leaning on cliches in your writing and focus on creating more unique and unfamiliar ways of approaching darkness. Try to stay away from cliches like “dark as night”, “lost and alone” or “so lonesome I could cry”. Come up with more original descriptions and images in your poem, especially when you are addressing dark themes and elements. One way you can address cliches in your writing is to go over your poem and look for any familiar terms or phrases. You should then underline them and focus on replacing certain words or replacing the phrase so it is less familiar and feels more original. Make sure you are using sensory detail in your poem, as this will make the poem come alive and contain descriptions that are memorable. Think about how a moment looks, sounds, tastes, smells, or feels. Use all five senses to create detailed moments in your poem. For example, maybe you are writing a poem about your grandfather’s death. You may focus on the smell of the white lilies at his grave or the gray, thin appearance of your grandfather in his casket. You may also describe the food you ate at his wake and the feeling of holding your grandmother’s hand at the funeral. Literary devices like metaphor, simile, and rhyme can help to strengthen the language in your poem and add depth to your writing. Try to use literary devices strategically, especially in a shorter poem. Every line should not be full of metaphors or similes only. You should vary up how you use these literary devices so your poem still flows well and does not seem wordy or long-winded. For example, you may use a metaphor to describe the loneliness of standing in the girl’s bathroom at school. You may write, “The stalls are blank eyes in the face of this room”. Or, you may use a simile to describe the look and smell of the bathroom. You may write, “The floor is as slick as the surface of a lake” and “The sinks smell like rotten eggs”. Some poets, such as Rossetti in “Song”, also use rhyme in their dark poetry. Rhyme can be useful for adding some levity and lightness to a poem about heavy, dark subject matter. But it can also make your poem sound too sing-songy and silly. Use rhyme sparingly. Once you have written your first draft, you should read your poem out loud to yourself or to a sympathetic audience. Listen for any awkward phrases or words and highlight them. Ask the listener for feedback on your writing. You should also pay attention to any images that are confusing or lines that are not as strong as they could be. Make sure you are not using cliches in your writing. Your poem should use unfamiliar and interesting images and descriptions that are true to your style and voice. You should go back and edit the poem for clarity once you have read it out loud. Adjust any problem phrases or words you identified and make sure you are using strong, interesting language throughout the poem.","response":"Imagine you're writing a story about things that are sad or a little bit scary, like being alone or when someone dies. It can be very easy to use words and ideas that lots and lots of people have used before - we call these 'cliches'. Cliches are a bit boring for the person reading your story - it's like hearing a joke you've heard lots of times before. To make your story really great, try to think of new and different ways to talk about sad or scary things. Instead of saying it's \\"as dark as night\\", you might say it's \\"as dark as a black cat in a coal mine\\". When you're writing your story, try to think about all of the things you can sense, what you can see, hear, smell, taste, and touch. This makes your story feel really alive! So, if you're writing about when your granddad died, you could talk about the smell of the flowers at his funeral, or how his hand looked. There are clever tricks in writing called 'literary devices', like comparing one thing to something else, that can make your story more interesting. But you shouldn't use these tricks all the time, because then they might get boring, too. Finally, after you've written your story, read it aloud. Listen for any words or parts that sound weird, and fix them. Ask someone else to listen to your story, too, and see what they think. Then go back and make your story even better! And remember, no boring cliches!"},{"question":"Answer based on context: Subsequent negotiations led by Jesuit papal legate Antonio Possevino resulted in the 1582 Truce of Jam Zapolski between Russia and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. This was a humiliation for the Tsar, in part because he requested the truce. Under the agreement Russia would surrender all areas in Livonia it still held and the city of Dorpat to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, while Polotsk would remain under Commonwealth control. Any captured Swedish territory—specifically Narva—could be retained by the Russians and Velike Luki would be returned from Batory's control to Russia. Possevino made a half-hearted attempt to get John III's wishes taken into consideration, but this was vetoed by the Tsar, probably in collusion with Batory. The armistice, which fell short of a full peace arrangement, was to last ten years and was renewed twice, in 1591 and 1601. Batory failed in his attempts to pressure Sweden into relinquishing its gains in Livonia, particularly Narva. Following a decision by John, the war with Russia ended when the Tsar concluded the Truce of Plussa with Sweden on 10 August 1583. Russia relinquished most of Ingria but left Narva and Ivangorod under Swedish control. Originally scheduled to last three years, the Russo-Swedish truce was later extended until 1590. During the negotiations, Sweden made vast demands for Russian territory, including Novgorod. Whilst these conditions were probably only for the purposes of negotiation, they may have reflected Swedish aspirations of territory in the region. Which came first, the Truce of Jam Zapolski or the Truce of Plussa?","response":"The Truce of Jam Zapolski came first, as it was signed in 1582 between Russia and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.

Your goal is to examine every number in the list and filter out all non-integer numbers. This means that the final list should only contain whole numbers, with no fractions or decimals. Here are the guidelines to accomplish the task: 1. Start by reviewing the given list of numbers. 2. Identify which numbers are integers (whole numbers) and which are not. Recall that an integer is a whole number without a decimal point. For example, -62 is an integer whereas 8.404 is not. 3. Remove all numbers that are not integers from the list. In our given list, we need to remove 8.404 and -42.909. 4. If every number in the list is found to be a non-integer, return an empty list, represented by \\"[]\\". 5. But, if there are integers in the list, return the list in brackets with each integer separated by a comma.

Why You Should Interview Real Estate Agents Truth be told, I have only purchased one house and I’m in the process of selling it. My husband and I thought long and hard about whether we would try to sell our property on our own or hire someone to represent us. In the end, we chose the latter. If you have ever shared with friends or family that you’re looking for a home or thinking of selling your own, most everyone says something along the lines of, “Oh! I know a realtor I can recommend!” Many of you may know a real estate agent personally as well. I still think it makes sense to interview any prospective agents because they are being paid by you. When you hire someone to do work on your home, you get estimates and gather information about how and when the work will be done. When you are looking for babysitters, you meet them and see how they’ll interact with your child. When you’re an employer, you interview any potential employees. Don’t Take The Easy Route with Previous Agents and Friends Just because a friend is a realtor, doesn’t mean they’ll be the best real estate agent for you. Just because a friend recommends their realtor to you, doesn’t mean you have to hire him/her. It’s business and nobody should take it personally. Interviewing real estate agents just makes sense. Oftentimes, people don’t. Why not just use the realtor that sold you the house you’re currently in? Well, you can.

Pick a site with part shade to full sun.\\" Article:","response":"Title: The Perfect Growing Conditions: Planting When Temperatures are Just Right Introduction Gardening is an enjoyable and rewarding activity that allows you to connect with nature, enhance the aesthetics of your surroundings, and even grow your own food. To achieve success in the garden, it's important to understand the key factors affecting plant growth and adapt your gardening practices to suit the specific needs of your plants. One of the most crucial factors to consider when planting is temperature. This article will focus on the importance of planting when temperatures do not exceed 68° F (20° C) daily, and selecting the optimal site with part shade to full sun for your plants. Section 1: The Importance of Temperature in Plant Growth Temperature plays a significant role in determining the growth and development of plants. Each plant species has its own unique temperature requirements, which must be met for optimum growth. It's important to understand that although plants are quite hardy and can adjust to varying temperatures, prolonged exposure to temperatures outside of their preferred range can cause stress and reduce overall growth and productivity. Planting when daily temperatures do not exceed 68° F (20° C) offers several benefits: 1. Enhanced germination: Warm temperatures are generally more suitable for seed germination. However, extremely high temperatures can be detrimental to seeds, as they can lead to desiccation and reduced germination rates. Planting at 68° F (20° C) enhances the chances of successful seed germination. 2. Reduced transplant shock: Transplant shock occurs when plants experience stress during transplantation from one location to another. Planting when temperatures are moderate helps to minimize this shock, making it easier for plants to adapt to their new environment. 3. Improved root development: Moderate temperatures are favorable for root growth, which is crucial for nutrient and water uptake. With better-developed root systems, plants are more likely to grow well and produce bountiful harvests. 4. Lower risk of heat-related stress: Excessively high temperatures can cause plants to suffer from heat stress, which may result in wilting, sunburn, and reduced productivity. Planting at the recommended 68° F (20° C) helps to avoid these issues. Section 2: Selecting the Optimal Site with Part Shade to Full Sun Sunlight is another essential factor for plant growth as it provides the energy needed for plants to undergo photosynthesis, the process by which they convert light energy into the chemical energy needed for growth and development. Choosing the right site with the appropriate sunlight conditions is vital to ensure healthy and thriving plants. 1. Part shade: Part shade refers to areas that receive 4-6 hours of direct sunlight per day, with the rest of the day being shaded. This is ideal for plants that can tolerate lower light conditions, such as ferns, hostas, and certain flowering plants like impatiens and begonias. Planting in part shade ensures that these plants receive enough sunlight to grow well without being exposed to excessive light that can cause issues like sunscald or overheating. 2. Full sun: Full sun areas receive at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily. Many vegetable plants, such as tomatoes, peppers, and cucumbers, as well as herbs and flowering plants like marigolds, sunflowers, and lavender, thrive in full sunlight. Providing these plants with the optimal light conditions will result in better growth and increased productivity. Conclusion Both temperature and sunlight are critical factors to consider when planning and implementing your gardening activities. By planting when temperatures do not exceed 68° F (20° C) daily and choosing a site with the appropriate sunlight conditions, you can significantly improve the growth and overall health of your plants. Regardless of whether you're an experienced gardener or a complete beginner, understanding and applying these principles will help you create a thriving, flourishing garden in any climate or environment. So grab your gardening gloves, choose the perfect site, and get ready to enjoy the rewards of a beautiful and productive garden."},{"question":"How is \\"IATA lost their challenge and no other referral has been made to the European Court of Justice on this matter.\\" said in German?","response":"In German, the sentence \\"IATA lost their challenge and no other referral has been made to the European Court of Justice on this matter.\\" can be translated as: \\"Die IATA hat ihre Herausforderung verloren und es wurde keine weitere Vorlage an den Europäischen Gerichtshof in dieser Angelegenheit gemacht.\\" Here's a breakdown of the translation: - \\"Die IATA\\" refers to \\"IATA\\" (International Air Transport Association) with the definite article \\"the\\". - \\"hat ihre Herausforderung verloren\\" means \\"lost their challenge\\". \\"Hat\\" is the auxiliary verb \\"to have\\" conjugated in the third person singular. \\"Ihre\\" is the possessive adjective \\"their\\" and \\"Herausforderung\\" is the noun \\"challenge\\". \\"Verloren\\" is the past participle of \\"verlieren\\" (to lose). - \\"Und\\" is the coordinating conjunction \\"and\\" connecting the two parts of the sentence. - \\"Es wurde\\" is the passive construction \\"was\\" or \\"has been\\" in English. \\"Wurde\\" is the simple past of \\"werden\\" (to become). - \\"Keine weitere\\" means \\"no other\\". \\"Keine\\" is the negative form of \\"eine\\" (a, one) and \\"weitere\\" is the adjective \\"other\\" or \\"additional\\". - \\"Vorlage\\" is the noun \\"referral\\" and \\"an\\" is a preposition equivalent to \\"to\\". - \\"Den Europäischen Gerichtshof\\" is the term for \\"the European Court of Justice\\" with the definite article and the adjective \\"europäischen\\" in the accusative case. - \\"In dieser Angelegenheit\\" refers to \\"on this matter\\". \\"In\\" is a preposition and \\"dieser\\" is the demonstrative adjective \\"this\\". \\"Angelegenheit\\" is the noun \\"matter\\" or \\"issue\\"."},{"question":"Q: I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: what is soy made from Suggested answer: The beans contain significant amounts of phytic acid , alpha-linolenic acid , and isoflavones .

A: Answer:","response":"Dry soils are relatively unproductive because plants need a sufficient quantity of liquid water to carry out the process of photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is an essential process in which plants convert light energy from the sun into chemical energy in the form of glucose or other sugars. This process requires water, carbon dioxide, and sunlight to take place. Water plays several crucial roles in photosynthesis: 1. Water is the source of hydrogen (H) atoms needed to form glucose molecules through the process of carbon fixation. 2. It maintains the plant's cellular structure, helping cells remain turgid and functional, allowing efficient photosynthetic reactions to occur within the chloroplasts. 3. The flow of water through the plant helps transport essential nutrients, such as minerals and nutrients dissolved in water, from the soil to different parts of the plant, including the leaves where photosynthesis takes place. 4. Transpiration, the loss of water through stomata (tiny pores) in the leaves, helps regulate temperature and maintain a high humidity within the plant, providing an optimal environment for photosynthetic enzymes to function. In dry soils, water is scarce, hindering the plant's ability to perform these critical functions, thereby limiting the rate of photosynthesis. As a result, plants grown in dry soils tend to be unproductive due to the insufficient availability of water to support the vital process of photosynthesis effectively."},{"question":"Q: In this task, you're given four sentences of a story written in natural language, and one last sentence (Sentence5).

With humanity now in the 21st century, many of the predictions of these works have so far been proven obsolete. This page lists only \\"predictions\\" regarding the 21st century, as opposed to contemporary accounts of the actual 21st century, which would be too numerous to list. Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"Contemporary accounts of the 21st century are more interesting than predictions made by science fiction writers.\\"?","response":"We cannot definitively conclude that \\"Contemporary accounts of the 21st century are more interesting than predictions made by science fiction writers\\" based solely on the paragraph provided. The paragraph describes that many of the predictions made in science fiction works regarding the 21st century have been proven obsolete, and that contemporary accounts of the actual 21st century would be too numerous to list. It does not directly compare the level of interest between contemporary accounts and science fiction predictions. To make a fair comparison, we should consider some factors and perspectives. First, let's analyze the purpose and appeal of both contemporary accounts and science fiction predictions. Contemporary accounts of the 21st century serve to document and analyze current events, technological advancements, and social changes. They often consist of factual and evidence-based information, aiming to provide readers with accurate portrayals of ongoing developments in the world. These accounts offer insights into the current state of society, politics, economy, and technology, which enables readers to stay informed and make informed decisions. On the other hand, science fiction predictions are imaginative and speculative by nature, exploring possibilities of what the future may hold. These predictions stimulate thought and discussion about potential future developments and the ethical, social, and technological implications of the choices we make today. The appeal of science fiction lies in its creativity, innovation, and ability to present alternative visions of the future, even when those visions do not always materialize or prove accurate. Now, let's consider the level of interest for the two types of accounts. The interest in contemporary accounts may largely depend on the reader's preference for factual information and a desire to stay updated on current events and developments. Some readers may find these accounts extremely interesting and valuable, particularly if they have a direct impact on their lives or professions. In contrast, the interest in science fiction predictions might be based on the reader's enjoyment of speculative fiction and the exploration of futuristic ideas and possibilities. Some readers may be more drawn to the imaginative and thought-provoking nature of science fiction, despite the fact that many of these predictions have been proven obsolete. Ultimately, whether contemporary accounts of the 21st century are more interesting than predictions made by science fiction writers is subjective and depends on individual preferences. Both types of accounts offer unique perspectives and insights, and it could be argued that they serve different purposes and cater to different readers. It is possible that some people might find contemporary accounts more interesting because they provide factual, up-to-date information, while others might enjoy science fiction predictions as they stimulate the imagination and present alternative visions of the future."},{"question":"Q:The Melbourne tram Route 57 as a railway station at the corner of Flinders and what street?

Fact 2: Humans use both eyes to see a single image. Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"What do humans use to see an image?\\" with the following options: - keratin - light - heat - fibers - calcite - mussels - photons - Neuron. The answer to this question is:","response":"Light and neurons. Given Fact 1, when light enters the eye through the pupil, it falls on the retina. This fact indicates that light plays a crucial role in the process of seeing an image. Further, light can be composed of particles known as photons, which interact with the receptors present in the retina. These light-sensitive cells, called photoreceptors (rods and cones), are responsible for detecting light and color variations in the image. These photoreceptors then convert the received light into electrical signals, which travel through the retina's network of neurons. The transmission of these electrical signals moves from the retina to the optic nerve and, ultimately, towards the brain's visual cortex through a series of complex neuronal connections. Given Fact 2, humans use both eyes to see a single image. This fact highlights that the neural pathways from each eye work in coordination and merge the information received from both eyes to create a single, coherent image, taking advantage of binocular vision. Binocular vision allows for better depth perception and an expanded field of view which contributes to more accurate and complete perception of our surroundings. Therefore, considering the options provided, humans use light, particularly photons, to initiate the process of seeing an image, along with neurons, which transmit the visual information and process it within the brain to ultimately allow us to see the image."},{"question":"Premise: when my first real involvement with the military started um naturally we were at the time the Soviet Union was considered to be the big military power and the big threat so we got lots quite a bit of information as well as indoctrination on Soviet tactics and weapons Hypothesis: The Soviet's military has always been considered a joke.

Which Italian had Beethoven, Liszt and Schubert as pupils?","response":"The renowned Italian composer, music teacher, violinist, and conductor Antonio Salieri had a profound influence on the musical landscape of his time. Born on August 18, 1750, in Legnago, Italy, Salieri pursued a prolific career during the classical and early Romantic eras. His impact as a composer and pedagogue earned him the distinct honor of working with some of the most exceptional musical talents of his time, including Ludwig van Beethoven, Franz Liszt, and Franz Schubert. Salieri moved to Vienna at the age of 16, where he studied under the guidance of composer Florian Leopold Gassmann. In time, Salieri was appointed the court composer to the Holy Roman Emperor, Joseph II, replacing Christoph Willibald Gluck. In this influential position, Salieri was able to contribute significantly to the Viennese musical landscape during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. As a music teacher, Salieri was considered one of the preeminent pedagogues in Vienna. His teaching philosophy and ability to impart knowledge to his students garnered him a highly respected reputation. He taught many future renowned musicians, some of whom include Ludwig van Beethoven, Ignaz Moscheles, Karl Czerny, Giacomo Meyerbeer, and Antonio Casimir Cartellieri. Salieri focused primarily on teaching composition, fostering a strong relationship with his students and promoting their careers. Although there is no definitive historical record of direct tutelage between Salieri and Franz Liszt or Franz Schubert, it is highly likely that he encountered and possibly instructed them during his tenure as a respected music teacher. Both Liszt and Schubert spent considerable time in Vienna and were undoubtedly influenced by the musical environment Salieri played a significant part in shaping. In Franz Schubert's case, he briefly attended the same school that Ludwig van Beethoven did, where Salieri taught, and it is reported that Salieri was among those that Schubert showed his compositions to. The extent of the interaction and teaching relationship between them is not well documented. However, Salieri's impact on the Viennese musical scene and his interactions with Schubert likely played a part in Schubert's development as a composer. As for Franz Liszt, there is no concrete evidence of him being directly instructed by Salieri. Nevertheless, considering Salieri’s status in the Viennese musical community, and that Liszt studied in Vienna for a few years, it is plausible to assume that the young Liszt was exposed to Salieri’s teachings, either directly or indirectly. In conclusion, Antonio Salieri was an influential Italian composer and teacher who had an impact on many great musicians of his time, including Ludwig van Beethoven, Franz Schubert, and Franz Liszt. Through his teaching, compositions, and his active participation in shaping the musical landscape in Vienna, he left a lasting legacy that continued to influence the world of classical music long after his death on May 7, 1825."},{"question":"Sentence 1: Finally, we discuss two measures of the cost of universal service, the entry pricing measure and the net avoided cost measure in the context of delivery profits.

Motorists have been warned to expect a hike in gas prices as the first nationwide refinery strike in 35 years has reduced American oil production by a fifth. The United Steelworkers union have said that workers at the largest refinery in the country, Motiva Enterprises refinery in Port Arthur, Texas, started their strike at midnight on Friday. Employees at two other refineries and a chemical plant in Louisiana also planned to strike. The union said in a statement that it expanded a strike that started February 1 at refineries largely in Texas and California because the industry has refused to 'meaningfully address' safety issues through good-faith bargaining. The union also wants to discuss staffing levels and seeks limits on the use of contractors to replace union members in doing daily maintenance work. Negotiations for a new contract began on January 21 with Shell Oil Company, which is serving as the lead company in bargaining talks. Shell spokesman Ray Fisher said in an email that the company was 'extremely disappointed' with the latest development. Mr Fisher said: 'We believe this move sets the wrong tone for both parties to move forward and reach an agreement. 'We remain committed to continued safe operations and productive negotiations.' United Steelworkers represents about 30,000 workers at refineries, terminals, petrochemical plants and pipelines across the country. The walk out started with about 3,800 workers at nine refineries and then grew to include locations in Indiana and Ohio. This latest expansion adds another 1,350 employees to the strike. The workers who were to begin striking on Saturday at midnight work at Motiva refineries in Convent and Norco, Louisiana, and a Shell Chemical plant in Norco. The Port Arthur site is a joint venture between Shell and Saudi Refining Inc. It produces more than 600,000 barrels per day. Oil companies and energy experts have said that improved plant technology and strike-contingency plans should ease the blow to production from these strikes. The United Steelworkers Union said in a statement that it expanded a strike that started February 1 at refineries largely in Texas and California because the industry has refused to 'meaningfully address' safety issues through good-faith bargaining. But economists say pockets of the country served by refineries targeted in these strikes have likely already seen some impact to gas prices. That includes California, which depends more on in-state refineries for its fuel, said Amy Myers Jaffe, an energy economist at the University of California, Davis. 'The price of gasoline didn't soar in California, but it went up a little bit after the strike,' she said. She added that the labor dispute's influence on price may grow as refineries finish the maintenance work they typically do at this time of year and start preparing to increase gasoline production. She added: 'The longer it goes on, then the more likely it is going to influence gas prices.' Summarize the highlights of this article.","response":"The first nationwide refinery strike in 35 years has reduced American oil production by a fifth, causing motorists to expect a hike in gas prices.

The toy was not modeled after any specific breed of dog. In the Toy Story movie, Slinky Dog's appearance is a cross between a dachshund, due to his elongated body and short legs, and a spaniel, due to his floppy ears and general facial features.

The given sentence states that a driver is sitting in a Team Penske race car. This indicates that there is at least one driver present, which contradicts the statement that there are no drivers on the track. 2. The initial sentence does not specify whether the Team Penske race car is on the track or not. However, since race cars are typically associated with race tracks, it is reasonable to infer that the car and the driver may be on the track. 3. Even though the driver is sitting in the car and not actively racing, they still count as a driver on the track. The statement \\"There are no drivers on the track\\" implies that the track is completely devoid of drivers, which is not the case according to the given sentence. 4. More context is necessary to definitively conclude whether the driver is on the track or not. However, as long as the possibility exists that the driver is on the track, we cannot confirm the statement \\"There are no drivers on the track\\" to be true.

Despite this \\"stumbling block\\", Bright said that Windows 8's interface worked well in some places, but began to feel incoherent when switching between the \\"Metro\\" and desktop environments, sometimes through inconsistent means. Tom Warren of The Verge wrote that the new interface was \\"as stunning as it is surprising\\", contributing to an \\"incredibly personal\\" experience once it is customized by the user, but had a steep learning curve, and was awkward to use with a keyboard and mouse. He noted that while forcing all users to use the new touch-oriented interface was a risky move for Microsoft as a whole, it was necessary in order to push development of apps for the Windows Store. Others, such as Adrian Kingsley-Hughes from ZDNet, considered the interface to be \\"clumsy and impractical\\" due to its inconsistent design (going as far as considering it \\"two operating systems unceremoniously bolted together\\"), and concluded that \\"Windows 8 wasn't born out of a need or demand; it was born out of a desire on Microsoft's part to exert its will on the PC industry and decide to shape it in a direction—touch and tablets -- that allows it to compete against, and remain relevant in the face of Apple's iPad.\\"\\".

Awkwardness with keyboard and mouse: The touch-oriented interface was designed for touch devices, and as a result, it was awkward and challenging to use with traditional input devices like a keyboard and mouse. 3. Incoherent switching between environments: Warren mentioned that the interface felt incoherent when switching between the \\"Metro\\" and desktop environments, which sometimes occurred through inconsistent means. 4.

The prize went to John B. Gurdon of the University of Cambridge in England, who was among the first to clone an animal, a frog, in 1962, and to Shinya Yamanaka of Kyoto University in Japan who in 2006 discovered the four genes necessary to reprogram an adult cell back to an embryonic state. Sir John Gurdon, who is now a professor at an institute that bears his name, earned the ridicule of many colleagues back in the 1960s when he set out on a series of experiments to show that the development of cells could be reversed. At the time, biologists knew that all cells in an embryo had the potential to become any cell in the body, but they believed that once a developmental path was set for each cell — toward becoming part of the brain, or a nerve or muscle — it could not be returned to its embryonic state. The thinking was that as a cell developed, it would either shed or silence the genes it no longer used, so that it would be impossible for a cell from an adult animal, for example, to return to its embryonic state and make other cells. (MORE: Stem Cell Miracle? New Therapies May Cure Chronic Conditions Like Alzheimer’s) Working with frogs, Gurdon proved his critics wrong, showing that some reprogramming could occur. Gurdon took the DNA from a mature frog’s gut cell and inserted it into an egg cell. The resulting egg, when fertilized, developed into a normal tadpole, a strong indication that the genes of the gut cell were amenable to reprogramming; they had the ability to function as more than just an intestinal cell, and could give rise to any of the cells needed to create an entirely new frog. Just as Gurdon was facing his critics in England, a young boy was born in Osaka, Japan, who would eventually take Gurdon’s finding to unthinkable extremes. Initially, Shinya Yamanaka would follow his father’s wishes and become an orthopedic surgeon, but he found himself ill-suited to the surgeon’s life. Intrigued more by the behind-the-scenes biological processes that make the body work, he found himself drawn to basic research, and began his career by trying to find a way to lower cholesterol production. That work also wasn’t successful, but it drew him to the challenge of understanding what makes cells divide, proliferate and develop in specific ways. In 2006, while at Kyoto University, Yamanaka stunned scientists by announcing he had successfully achieved what Gurdon had with the frog cells, but without using eggs at all. Yamanaka mixed four genes in with skin cells from adult mice and turned those cells back to an embryo-like state, essentially erasing their development and turning back their clock. The four genes reactivated other genes that are prolific in the early embryo, and turned off those that directed the cells to behave like skin. (MORE: Ovary Stem Cells Can Produce New Human Eggs) By that time, researchers had already shown that cells taken from embryos at their earliest stages could also yield such embryonic stem cells, but Yamanaka rewrote biology by demonstrating that it was possible to turn adult cells into stem cells — cells that are now known as induced pluripotent stem cells, or iPS cells — without the help of either an egg (and whatever factors within eggs that influence early development) or an embryonic cell. Taken together, Gurdon’s and Yamanaka’s discoveries have turned fundamental biological concepts on their head. Their experiments prove that every cell, whether young or old, in embryos or in adults, has a similar ability to reprogram itself to become “young” again, and thus capable of becoming any cell in the body. What’s more, Yamanaka’s advance provided a practical solution to a thorny issue plaguing researchers interested in pursuing stem cell biology: that the only source of human embryonic stem cells are embryos, which must be destroyed in the process — a problem that was morally sticky enough to compel President George W. Bush to issue in 2001 a ban on the creation of new stem cell lines from excess embryos discarded during fertility treatments (the ban was removed by President Barack Obama in 2009). (MORE: Early Success in a Human Embryonic Stem Cell Trial to Treat Blindness) “The prize is very well justified and they chose two of the most deserving people,” says Douglas Melton, co-director of the Harvard Stem Cell Institute and a former student of Gurdon’s. “I’m just sorry it’s taken 50 years to recognize John Gurdon’s contribution in establishing that all cells in our body have this amazing potential inside of them, and that they retained all of their genes. Yamanaka followed up on that, revealing that potential in a more practical way.” Yamanaka’s method further creates the possibility for each patient to become his own resource for replacement cells — thus treating disease. Within weeks of Yamanaka’s published report on his discovery in 2006, laboratories around the world had adopted the “Yamanaka factors,” as they are called, to generate abundant lines of stem cells from skin and other mature cells. Within a year, Yamanaka had taken the next important step in his research — applying his achievements with mouse cells to human skin cells and turning them back to an embryo-like state. “What we have is the discovery of a game-changer in terms of how we approach human disease in the coming years,” Dr. Deepak Srivastava, director of the Roddenberry Center for Stem Cell Biology and Medicine at the Gladstone Institutes, where Yamanaka completed a postdoctoral fellowship and remains a faculty member, said during a press conference celebrating the Nobel announcement on Monday. “In the next five to 10 years we are likely to see the same technology regenerate organs and create new treatments in regenerative medicine for many different human diseases.” Indeed, just over a year ago, the first groups of human patients received treatment with embryonic stem cells. In a clinical trial designed to test the safety of the treatment, Sue Freeman and Rosemary (who declined to use her real name for reasons of privacy) became the first patients to receive retinal cells that had been grown in the lab from stem cells. Each woman suffered from a different form of macular degeneration, and both were gradually becoming blind. Their doctor, Dr. Steven Schwartz at the University of California, Los Angeles, told them that the cells they received could stop their disease from robbing them completely of their vision. But there was also the chance that the cells would do nothing at all, and possibly even cause them harm, by forming tumors or other abnormal growths in the eye — a gamble that had to be anticipated, given that the treatment was unproven and never before tested in humans. (MORE: A Stem Cell First: Using the ‘Dolly’ Method on Human Cells) While Freeman and Rosemary are among the pioneers of human embryonic stem cell research (a previous human trial also using cells made from embryonic stem cells, to treat spinal cord injury, was halted by the company sponsoring the studies for financial reasons), it won’t be long before embryos may not be needed at all. Using Yamanaka’s method, labs around the world have generated lines of heart, brain, nerve and muscle cells made from iPS cells from patients with diseases ranging from Alzheimer’s to spinal cord injury and diabetes, all in the hope of understanding where in development these cells go awry and how to develop new treatments that address these aberrations. Already, Yamanaka says that researchers at the Center for iPS Cell Research at Kyoto University, which he heads, are preparing to transplant retinal cells made from iPS cells into patients with macular degeneration next year. “The biggest hurdle is safety,” he told reporters during a teleconference about moving iPS cells into the clinic. “Especially in regenerative medicine, you have to double check that you won’t see any severe side effects in patients. We need to confirm the technology is safe.” The concern is that because iPS cells are made from already mature cells that have been manipulated to become other types of cells, they may interact with chemicals and other tissues once in the body to form abnormal growths, or they may fail to develop into the cells required to treat a disease. Studies by stem cell scientists show that while iPS cells are, for the most part, nearly indistinguishable from embryonic stem cells, they do show some differences that aren’t fully understood yet. (MORE: Stem Cell Research: The Quest Resumes) Still, the technology, as the Nobel Prize committee acknowledged, represents a breakthrough in our understanding of cellular development, and could provide the key to finally curing disease such as diabetes or Alzheimer’s, in which patients’ diseased or failing cells could one day be replaced by healthy ones they grow themselves. “It’s spectacular that the Nobel committee recognizes the contribution of these scientists,” says Schwartz. “I think it helps the public get enthusiastic about regenerative medicine and to catch up with the science.” And, even more importantly, inspire a new generation of scientists who can turn Gurdon’s and Yamanaka’s discoveries into routine treatments. “I’m hoping a lot of young people see this award and say that’s a field that I’d like to work in,” says Melton. “The Nobel legitimizes [stem cell science] and shows that it’s an honorable thing that our society thinks is important.” MORE: Stem Cells That Kill MORE: Banking on Stem Cells Alice Park is a writer at TIME and the author of The Stem Cell Hope, which details the contributions of leading stem cell scientists, including Gurdon and Yamanaka, to the emerging field of regenerative medicine.

Lord Chesterfield and Bishop Warburton (and others) initially thought that the work was genuinely by Bolingbroke rather than a satire. All the reviews of the work were positive, with critics especially appreciative of Burke's quality of writing. Some reviewers failed to notice the ironic nature of the book, which led to Burke stating in the preface to the second edition (1757) that it was a satire.\\" Answer: Answer:","response":"The individual who satirized Bolingbroke's arguments by expanding them was Edmund Burke, an Irish statesman, political theorist, and philosopher. In his famous work, \\"A Vindication of Natural Society,\\" published in 1756, Burke aimed to criticize and satirize the arguments made by Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke, against revealed religion. Bolingbroke was a prominent English politician and philosopher who held deist beliefs and questioned the foundations of revealed religion. In his writings, Bolingbroke expressed skepticism towards traditional religious beliefs and questioned the authenticity of divine revelations. Burke took Bolingbroke's ideas and expanded them to show that his arguments, if taken to their logical conclusion, could also be applied to undermine social and civil institutions. In \\"A Vindication of Natural Society,\\" Burke writes in the persona of Bolingbroke, presenting arguments that critique not only revealed religion, but also the establishment of government, law, and other societal structures. By taking this approach, Burke aimed to expose the potential dangers of Bolingbroke's line of thought and also to highlight the importance of established social and political institutions. At the time of publication, several prominent figures, including Lord Chesterfield and Bishop Warburton, mistakenly believed that \\"A Vindication of Natural Society\\" was a genuine work by Bolingbroke, rather than a satire by Burke. This confusion was primarily due to the strength of Burke's imitation of Bolingbroke's writing style and his skilled presentation of arguments. The critical reception of the work was overwhelmingly positive, with many reviewers praising the quality of Burke's writing. However, some critics failed to recognize the satirical nature of the book, which led to Burke including a statement in the preface to the second edition (1757), clarifying that it was, in fact, a satire. In conclusion, Edmund Burke was the individual who satirized Bolingbroke's arguments by expanding them in his work \\"A Vindication of Natural Society.\\" By doing so, Burke demonstrated the potential implications of Bolingbroke's anti-revelation ideas on other social and civil institutions and effectively criticized his line of thought through satire."},{"question":"Q: You will be given a sentence containing a pronoun/person name and an emotion.

Based on the given facts, we need to find mammals that have a high energy requirement and generate heat. Step 2: Make a connection between the facts provided. Fact 1 states that mammals generate heat mainly by keeping their metabolic rate high. Fact 2 states that birds have a high metabolic rate and a high energy requirement. We can infer that in mammals, a high metabolic rate may also be associated with a high energy requirement. Step 3: Apply the connection to the mammals. Mammals with a high metabolic rate are likely to have a high energy requirement and generate heat. Step 4: Provide examples of mammals that meet the criteria. Some examples of mammals with high energy requirements and generate heat are: 1. Bats: Bats have a high metabolic rate due to their active flight and need to maintain their body temperature, particularly during cold nights. 2. Shrews: Shrews have a very high metabolic rate because of their small size and need to eat almost constantly to maintain their energy levels. 3. Arctic mammals like the polar bear and Arctic fox: These mammals need to maintain a high metabolic rate to keep warm in extremely cold environments. 4. Endothermic marine mammals like whales, dolphins, and seals: These mammals need to maintain a high energy requirement to generate heat to survive in cold water temperatures. In conclusion, mammals that have a high energy requirement and generate heat are those with high metabolic rates, usually due to their size, activity level, or living in extreme environmental conditions.

Direct sale by appointment refers to a selling approach in which customers make an appointment to come and view or purchase products directly from the seller. This is typically done in a more personalized and one-on-one setting, as opposed to traditional retail environments. In direct sale by appointment, potential buyers are usually given personalized attention from the seller or sales representative, who will take the time to understand their needs, preferences, and budget. This helps to create a tailored and more efficient shopping experience for the customer. Here are some reasons that direct sale by appointment is a popular option for both businesses and customers: 1. Personalized Experience: Direct sale by appointment allows the customer to receive one-on-one attention and personalized service. This can lead to a better understanding of the customer's needs and preferences, and, in turn, a higher likelihood of making a sale. 2. Better Time Management: By scheduling appointments, sellers can plan their day and allocate their time efficiently.

Question: suppose a lot of bacteria will enter happens, how will it affect LESS SEVERE disease occurring. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect The answer is:","response":"B: less Step 1: Analyze the question The question asks how the presence of a large amount of bacteria entering a wound will affect the occurrence of a LESS SEVERE disease. We will look at the relationship between the amount of bacteria and the severity of the disease. Step 2: Recall the process The given process describes how a skin cut or damage can lead to a bacterial infection, which can cause symptoms and eventually develop into a disease. The key point to note here is that the severity of the disease is most likely related to the number of bacteria and how fast they reproduce and spread. Step 3: Relate the quantity of bacteria to disease severity If a large number of bacteria enter the wound, it is reasonable to assume that the infection may become more severe, as there will be more bacteria initially reproducing and spreading throughout the body. This would likely lead to a more severe disease. Step 4: Determine the effect on less severe disease occurrence Given that a higher number of bacteria increases the severity of infection, it is likely that the occurrence of a less severe disease will be decreased. This is because the large amount of bacteria would make it more difficult for the body to effectively fight off the infection, resulting in a more severe disease. Step 5: Choose the appropriate answer The answer is B: less. The presence of a large amount of bacteria entering a wound will likely lead to a decreased occurrence of less severe disease, as the body may struggle to effectively fight off the increased bacterial load, resulting in a more severe disease overall."},{"question":"Question: Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: tommy hilfiger birch Review: Better than I expected.

The document is now in the public domain, being carefully perused and passionately picked apart. Battle lines are being drawn by lawmakers at the US Congress, who have 60 days to review the deal. In Iran, too, opponents and advocates in parliament are vociferously taking sides. A growing swirl of reaction underlines that an agreement to significantly curb Iran's nuclear programme for 10 to 15 years in exchange for the lifting of sanctions - as momentous as that is - is being widely seen as much more than an arms control accord. US President Barack Obama's constant refrain is that this deal \\"solves one particular problem, which is making sure they don't have a bomb\\". But for many, it is also a moment laced with both political potential as well as peril. It could amount not just to a turning point, but a possible \\"transformation\\" of Iran and its place in the region and beyond. The issue matters because even before the deal enters into force, many are asking what kind of Iran will there be a decade on, when many of the restrictions on its nuclear programme expire. Will an Iran emerge that has resolved its enmities with regional rivals and opened up at home, or a nuclear threshold state still be seen in many capitals as a threat? For Iran, the change, at least on the level of significant symbols, is already in train. This week began with the unanimous vote at the UN Security Council on a new resolution that paves the way for the eventual lifting of most international sanctions once Iran complies with its obligations under the nuclear agreement. \\"Iran never got a fair treatment from â€ª#UNSC in the last 35 yrs,\\" wrote Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on Twitter. \\"Expect to see evidence of 'fundamental shift' promised in today's resolution.\\" For Mr Zarif, who was the permanent representative to the UN in New York when sanctions were first imposed by the Security Council in 2006, removing the stigma embodied in seven punishing UN resolutions was a crucial step towards recognition of Iran's rightful place at the world's top tables. And for Iran's negotiators, there is more to it than that. \\"Our biggest achievement is the stamp by the UN Security Council confirming [uranium] enrichment in Iran,\\" Mr Zarif told the Iranian parliament on Tuesday when he urged MPs to back what he called a \\"balanced\\" deal. The accord severely diminishes Iran's nuclear infrastructure, including its level of uranium enrichment. But it does not completely dismantle its programme or achieve the \\"zero enrichment\\" the deal's strongest critics in the US and Israel argue should still be the goal. But while a chorus of criticism rises, Iran's place on the geopolitical map is already changing. There is a diplomatic dash to visit this newest must-see destination. No sooner was the news announced in Vienna then Germany's Vice-Chancellor and Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel was on his way to Tehran, along with a 100-member delegation, including leading business executives, for the highest level visit in 13 years. France's Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius is heading there next week with French firms keen to take advantage of a new opening. On Monday, the European Union also approved the Iran deal, paving the way for the end of European sanctions. But restrictions linked to human rights issues will remain in place as well as an arms embargo which, under the nuclear accord, will not be lifted for the next five to eight years. Europe's agenda is not just about the opportunities which now emerge but also the risks. Mr Gabriel, mindful of his country's close ties to Israel, also used his visit to emphasise that \\"there can be no political questioning of the right of Israel to exist\\". Regional worries are what drive the post-deal travel diaries of top American officials. Defence Secretary Ashton Carter immediately set off for Israel with pledges of military support to an ally that has vowed to do all in its power to destroy the Iran deal. Secretary of State John Kerry will soon be travelling to the Gulf to reassure Arab leaders of Washington's backing to help them \\"push back\\" against Iranian involvement in the region. In public, Arab officials have given the deal a guarded welcome. In private many are sharply critical of what they view as the destabilising prospect of a resurgent Iran, freed from punishing sanctions with money to spend in what are seen as proxy wars in Syria, Iraq and Yemen. \\"The choice belongs, now, to Iran,\\" wrote UAE Foreign Minister Anwar Gargash in an op-ed for the Financial Times. \\"On our list of priorities, our region is our highest priority,\\" Mr Zarif told me in an interview in Vienna after the deal was announced. But he placed the onus to start this new dialogue on the other side. \\"We call on our neighbours to set aside illusions about being able to portray Iran as a threat and start engaging seriously,\\" he said. If Iran can make a deal with the \\"The Great Satan\\", could it not do the same with regional heavyweights like Saudi Arabia, especially when threats like the rise of the so-called Islamic State pose dangers to all? Poisonous sectarian fault lines in the region and conflicting political agendas on battlefields like Syria make a dialogue that much harder closer to home. \\"We'll be watching Iran over the next year to see if this is a new face or just a new phase,\\" is how one Arab ambassador put it. Those hoping for change point to the possibilities offered in a keynote speech in April by Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. \\"If the other side [the US] sets aside its bad behaviour, this will become a new experience for us that will tell us we can also negotiate with them about other issues,\\" he said. Others hold up his more strident comments this week - in a speech marked by crowds chanting the old slogans of \\"Death to America and Israel\\"- that \\"US policies in the region are 180 degrees in contrast to Iran's policies\\". Iranians who spilled onto the streets in joyous celebration last week see in this deal the prospect of greater political and personal freedoms. Iranian business executives, relieved to once again have access to international markets, are pushing for economic reform and a crackdown on corruption to make this new opening even wider. They know all too well that as their country moves forward, it could also lurch back as conservative elements retaliate against this greater engagement with the West. \\"In the Middle East, a decade is an eternity,\\" remarked former Israeli spy chief Efraim Halevy in an op-ed in Yedioth Ahronoth that urged Israeli officials not to make \\"a rush at Washington\\" to try to destroy the deal. For now, negotiators for the world powers who bargained long and hard insist there is now one main question: \\"Does it stop Iran from producing a bomb?\\" Their answer is a resounding \\"yes\\". Iran's reply is that it never intended to produce one. Many other questions will continue to be asked, and, like the main question, will soon be answered.

Seven states have made emergency declarations. New York's LaGuardia Airport will shut down Tuesday. Facebook Twitter Google Plus Embed autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog — BY ERIN McCLAM Tens of millions of people in the Northeast hunkered down on Monday for a historic blizzard that was expected to drop more than 2 feet of snow, whipped around by winds approaching hurricane force — enough to bring New York, Boston and most of the northeast corridor to an eerie standstill. More than 7,000 flights were scrapped, and the major airlines warned that practically nothing would take off or land in New York, Boston and Philadelphia as the worst of the storm sweeps in overnight and Tuesday morning. Store shelves emptied, schools shut their doors, and authorities either pleaded with people to stay home or outright closed the roads to all but emergency vehicles. The snow began to lighten up in New York around 8 p.m., but Mayor Bill de Blasio warned residents not to drop their vigilance. He cited forecasts for snow to fall at a rate of 2 to 4 inches per hour overnight, although meteorologists later predicted only about 1- 2 inches per hour in the city around midnight. By 12:30 a.m. Tuesday, there was 5.5 inches on the ground in New York's Central Park, with forecasts for an additional 5 to 8 inches, according to The Weather Channel.

A road travel restriction began at the same time, meaning that all cars other than emergency vehicles were banned in 13 counties, including those in New York City and Long Island. \\"It's dangerous to be out there now. It's going to get more dangerous. And at one point it's irresponsible,\\" Cuomo said. A similar travel ban in New Jersey began at 11 p.m. ET, Gov. Chris Christie announced. The move excludes emergency and public safety personnel, utility companies and others assisting in storm recovery. It will be \\"subject to revocation at daybreak depending on conditions then,\\" Christie said on Twitter. Boston suspended all public transit for Tuesday and Massachusetts officials pleaded for people to go home and keep put. \\"The bottom line is it's going to be the kind of night where the best thing anyone can do is to stay inside,\\" Massachusetts Gov.

Rush hour came early in many places, as commuters raced home before the brunt of the storm hit. New York's Penn Station was jammed with riders trying to board the day's last trains. Broadway went dark, and Central Park was closed. Banks branches shuttered early. Power crews from as far as Michigan traveled east to help deal with likely outages. At least one town in Massachusetts turned off power preemptively, while at least 3000 customers in the Bay state and hundreds of people in Connecticut lost electricity overnight, utility officials said.. Forecast snow totals were changing quickly, but The Weather Channel said some places outside Boston and on Long Island, New York, could get more than 2 feet of snow. The Massachusetts coast and eastern Long Island could each see 30 inches, The Weather Channel reported. Bill Karins, a meteorologist for NBC News, called for snow totals of 20 inches in Hartford, Connecticut, 18 inches in New York and 10 inches in Philadelphia. The wind forecasts were nightmarish: The Weather Channel called for gusts of 65 mph in Plymouth, Massachusetts, just shy of hurricane force, 60 mph in Boston and 50 mph in New York. The worst of it was expected Monday overnight and Tuesday morning. Blizzard warnings covered 250 miles of the Northeast while snow fell steadily for most of the day Monday across the region and authorities warned that it would get much heavier. \\"Don't panic.

The state of Massachusetts had 250,000 tons of salt and 420,000 gallons of deicing liquid at the ready. Boston had 700 pieces of equipment to prepare the roads and plow them later. \\"Very highly populated areas of the Northeast are going to get crushed with snow,\\" said Tom Moore, coordinating meteorologist for The Weather Channel. \\"Everywhere ... you're going to get hit very hard by this storm.\\" Coastal Massachusetts braced for wind gusts that could reach 75 mph, enough when paired with the snow to create whiteout conditions.

Question: Where are many Ashkenazi Jews from? Context: A 2006 study found Ashkenazi Jews to be a clear, homogeneous genetic subgroup. Strikingly, regardless of the place of origin, Ashkenazi Jews can be grouped in the same genetic cohort – that is, regardless of whether an Ashkenazi Jew's ancestors came from Poland, Russia, Hungary, Lithuania, or any other place with a historical Jewish population, they belong to the same ethnic group. The research demonstrates the endogamy of the Jewish population in Europe and lends further credence to the idea of Ashkenazi Jews as an ethnic group. Moreover, though intermarriage among Jews of Ashkenazi descent has become increasingly common, many Haredi Jews, particularly members of Hasidic or Hareidi sects, continue to marry exclusively fellow Ashkenazi Jews. This trend keeps Ashkenazi genes prevalent and also helps researchers further study the genes of Ashkenazi Jews with relative ease. It is noteworthy that these Haredi Jews often have extremely large families.

Col. Christopher Logan, a Pentagon spokesman. The statement said that disinviting China from the 2018 RIMPAC is an “initial” response to Beijing’s South China Sea activities. It did not specify what other steps may be taken. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China’s activity in the South China Sea was for self-defense and that it was a “much smaller scale” than what the United States had done in Hawaii and Guam. “We hope that the U.S. will change such a negative mindset,” he said at a joint news conference with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Since 2014, China has taken part in RIMPAC, the world’s largest international maritime drill, which is held every two years in Hawaii. It’s a reflection of expanding U.S.-China military ties, despite tensions over Beijing’s construction of man-made islands in the South China Sea, some of which have been militarized. \\"We have strong evidence that China has deployed anti-ship missiles, surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems, and electronic jammers to contested features in the Spratly Islands region of the South China Sea. China's landing bomber aircraft at Woody Island has also raised tensions,\\" the Pentagon statement said. \\"We have called on China to remove the military systems immediately and to reverse course on the militarization of disputed South China Sea features,\\" the statement added. \\"We believe these recent deployments and the continued... According to the above context, answer the following question. After the end of the text, how will the public view of China's military change? The answer is:","response":"The public view of China's military might change in several ways after the end of the text. People might see China's military as: 1. Assertive: China's Defense Ministry has referred to the U.S. decision as \\"unconstructive\\" and reaffirmed China's commitment to playing a role in maintaining peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region. 2. Expanding its military presence: The text highlights China's construction of man-made islands in the South China Sea, some of which have been militarized. This could indicate China's intent to expand its military presence. 3. Concerning in terms of regional stability: The U.S. has accused China of \\"destabilizing behavior\\" in the South China Sea. Additionally, the Pentagon's statement claims that China's deployment of anti-ship missiles, surface-to-air missile systems, and electronic jammers to contested features in the South China Sea raises tensions and destabilizes the region. 4. Not necessarily seeking confrontation: Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has stated that China's activity in the South China Sea is for self-defense and on a much smaller scale compared to the United States' military actions in Hawaii and Guam. Overall, the public view of China's military might become more wary and alarmed due to their actions in the South China Sea and the U.S. response, but it could also be seen as not entirely confrontational since China insists its actions are for self-defense purposes."},{"question":"Student: Can we conclude from \\"People in a carcass of a building sort and select wooden planks.\\" that \\"People sorting lumber.\\"?

How would you consider the linguistic integrity of the preceding sentence? Choose your answer from: I. unacceptable II. acceptable","response":"I would consider the linguistic integrity of the preceding sentence to be II. acceptable. The sentence is composed of a subject, verb, and object, which properly demonstrates the SVO (subject-verb-object) pattern, characteristic of English sentences. In this sentence, \\"Louis\\" is the subject, which refers to the main person or thing the sentence is about. The verb, \\"was forgiven,\\" conveys a passive voice and shows the action of forgiving that happened to Louis. Finally, \\"by Susan\\" indicates the object and, in this case, acts as an agent that performed the action. Apart from maintaining the SVO pattern, this sentence also uses appropriate verb tense, as the verb \\"was forgiven\\" is in passive voice in past simple tense, which is necessary to describe a completed past action. Furthermore, the preposition \\"by\\" is suitable for the passive voice context as it introduces the agent of the intended action. The linguistic integrity of the sentence may not be perfect, as it does not provide deeper contextual information about the story, nor does it use complex structures or varied vocabulary. Nevertheless, it conveys a clear and concise meaning and adheres to the grammar rules and syntax of the English language, making it an acceptable sentence."},{"question":"Choose from the options at the end.

WASHINGTON â President Obama on Monday seized on the fifth anniversary of the 2008 financial collapse to warn that House Republicans would reverse the gains made and willfully cause âeconomic chaosâ with the uncompromising stands they have staked out on looming budget deadlines. âBudget battles and debates, those are as old as the republic,â Mr. Obama said before a friendly audience assembled in a White House annex. But, he added, âI cannot remember a time when one faction of one party promises economic chaos if it canât get 100 percent of what it wants.â A bloc of conservative House Republicans have said that unless Mr. Obamaâs signature health insurance law is delayed or repealed, they will not support financing for government operations in the new fiscal year starting Oct. 1 or an essential increase in the nationâs borrowing limit in mid-October. Failure to act on federal funding would provoke a government shutdown; even worse, failing to increase the debt limit would leave the government unable to pay bills and creditors and ultimately threaten the nationâs default. âThe last time the same crew threatened this course of action back in 2011, even the mere suggestion of default slowed our economic growth,â Mr. Obama said, recalling that summerâs market-rattling showdown. Mr. Obamaâs remarks followed his administrationâs release of a report chronicling the actions taken since 2008 to encourage job creation, save the auto industry, revive and regulate banking, and expand education opportunities. But he spoke at a time when the economy, as he acknowledged, is still struggling to create enough jobs and his agenda faces opposition mostly from Republicans but also from some Democrats increasingly emboldened against a second-term lame-duck president. Still, on the budget fight, most Democrats in Congress support the president, and with his comments he sought to rally them and to set up Republicans for blame should the fiscal fights end badly. Mr. Obama noted that in the past Republicans fought for more spending cuts to reduce deficits but that now, with annual deficits declining, they were making their fight over the health care law. âThe Affordable Care Act has been the law for three and a half years now,â Mr. Obama said. âIt passed both houses of Congress. The Supreme Court ruled it constitutional. It was an issue in last yearâs election, and the candidate who called for repeal lost. The Republicans in the House have tried to repeal or sabotage it about 40 times. They failed every time. Meanwhile the law has already helped millions of Americans.â The president repeated his warning against âself-inflicted woundsâ at the event, which was moved from the Rose Garden to the Eisenhower Executive Office Building because of rain. He proceeded with the event even as a shooting unfolded at a naval office building in Southeast Washington. Mr. Obama was joined onstage by a group of people that White House officials said included âsmall-business owners, construction workers, homeowners, consumers and tax cut recipients.â The president has struggled for years to balance the desire to claim credit for a slowly improving economy against the need to make sure he acknowledges the pain that many people still feel. At the event on Monday, Mr. Obama recalled how close the country, and the world, came to another depression after the collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers in September 2008. The Lehman bankruptcy caused the credit markets to seize up, the unemployment rate to sour and economic activity to plummet. Mr. Obama and his allies have for a long time said that the administrationâs actions in early 2009, while extremely unpopular, were critical to holding off a worse collapse. Those include the decision to support President George W. Bushâs bailout of Wall Street, Mr. Obamaâs own bailout for the auto industry and the passage of the economic stimulus program. But while the unemployment rate has fallen to 7.3 percent â down from a high of 10.1 percent in late 2009 â millions of Americans are still struggling to find a job, and millions more are working at low-wage or part-time jobs and having trouble making ends meet. That has been Mr. Obamaâs message in the last several months as he has delivered speeches arguing for what he calls a âbetter bargain for the middle class.â In those speeches, he argues for investments in infrastructure, education, college aid and housing as a way to help middle-class Americans and those trying to get into the middle class. The president is scheduled to deliver another one of his âbetter bargainâ speeches in Kansas City, Mo., on Friday when he visits a Ford Motor Company assembly plant. Write a title for it.","response":"\\"President Obama Reflects on 2008 Economic Collapse, Warns of Potential Economic Chaos Due to House Republicans' Stance on Budget Deadlines\\""},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Given the following context: Gaby is a ballet dancer in 1944 London who runs into corporal Gregory Wendell while rushing to catch the bus.

On that day, the 10,192 ton ferry sailed out of Manila with about 900 passengers and crew on board. A television set filled with 8 lb. of TNT had been placed on board. 90 minutes out of port, the bomb exploded. 63 people were killed instantly and 53 were missing and presumed dead. Despite claims from terrorist groups, the blast was initially thought to have been an accident caused by a gas explosion. However, after divers righted the ferry five months after it had sunk, they found evidence of a bomb blast. A man called Redendo Cain Dellosa admitted to planting the bomb for Abu Sayyaf. Six suspects were arrested in connection with the bombing while the masterminds, Khadaffy Janjalani and Abu Sulaiman, were killed. Answer this question based on the article: How many passenger and crew survived Philippines worst terrorist attack on the Superferry 14?","response":"On the Superferry 14, there were about 900 passengers and crew on board. 63 people were killed instantly, and 53 people were missing and presumed dead, which makes a total of 116 people. To find out how many people survived, we will subtract the number of people who died from the total number of people on board: 900 - 116 = 784 people. So, around 784 passengers and crew survived the Philippines' worst terrorist attack on the Superferry 14."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the woman who's letter unbalanced the woman that signed her suicide note \\"Your poor insane mother\\"?, using the article: After leaving the army in January 1919, Grainger refused an offer to become conductor of the Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra and resumed his career as a concert pianist. He was soon performing around 120 concerts a year, generally to great critical acclaim, and in April 1921 reached a wider audience by performing in a cinema, New York's Capitol Theatre. Grainger commented that the huge audiences at these cinema concerts often showed greater appreciation for his playing than those at established concert venues such as Carnegie Hall and the Aeolian. In the summer of 1919 he led a course in piano technique at Chicago Musical College, the first of many such educational duties he would undertake in later years.Amid his concert and teaching duties, Grainger found time to re-score many of his works (a habit he continued throughout his life) and also to compose new pieces: his Children's March: Over the Hills and Far Away, and the orchestral version of The Power of Rome and the Christian Heart both originated in this period. He also began to develop the technique of elastic scoring, a form of flexible orchestration which enabled works to be performed by different numbers of players and instrument types, from small chamber groups up to full orchestral strength.In April 1921 Grainger moved with his mother to a large house in White Plains, New York. This was his home for the remainder of his life. From the beginning of 1922 Rose's health deteriorated sharply; she was suffering from delusions and nightmares, and became fearful that her illness would harm her son's career. Because of the closeness of the bond between the two, there had long been rumours that their relationship was incestuous; in April 1922 Rose was directly challenged over this issue by her friend Lotta Hough.

Given the context: What does Taylor need to do before this? Possible answers: empty the wash bucket, dip the mop in the bucket, dip the broom in the bucket Answer:","response":"Before Taylor starts mopping the floor for an hour, diligently ensuring every little bit of filth is cleaned, they should take a few preparatory steps to ensure a smooth and efficient cleaning process. Here's a detailed breakdown of the steps Taylor needs to take: 1. Gather the necessary cleaning tools and materials: Taylor should assemble the required tools and materials for the task ahead. These will typically include a mop, cleaning solution, wash bucket with water, a broom, and a dustpan. 2. Sweep the floor: Before mopping, Taylor should sweep the floor using the broom and dustpan to remove any loose dirt, dust, and debris. Mopping without sweeping may result in wet clumps of dirt that are difficult to clean and could potentially damage the floor. 3. Prepare the wash bucket: Once the floor is properly swept, Taylor should fill the wash bucket with warm water and add the appropriate amount of cleaning solution. It's essential to check the product label for proper dilution recommendations. If needed, Taylor can also set up a separate bucket filled with clean water to rinse the mop during the cleaning process. 4. Dip the mop in the bucket: Next, Taylor would need to dip the mop into the prepared wash bucket, ensuring the mop head is saturated in the cleaning solution. To avoid over-wetting the floor and creating an excessively slippery surface, Taylor should wring out any excess water from the mop before it comes in contact with the floor. With these steps completed, Taylor is now prepared to mop the floor for an hour, ensuring every little bit of filth is thoroughly removed. Throughout the process, it's essential to rinse the mop in the wash bucket or clean water bucket periodically, empty and refill the wash bucket if it becomes too dirty, and repeat the mopping process as needed to achieve a satisfactory level of cleanliness."},{"question":"Pick the option in line with common sense to answer the question.

One fascinating and unique subject would be the world of octopuses. Octopuses are considered as one of the most intelligent animals in the ocean. These boneless creatures belong to a group of mollusks called cephalopods, which also includes other species such as squids and cuttlefish. Despite being invertebrates, octopuses possess a remarkably complex nervous system, with a large portion of their neurons residing in their arms. Now, here's an intriguing fact about octopuses: they have three hearts. Yes, you read that right, not one, not two, but three hearts! Two of these hearts, known as branchial hearts, are responsible for pumping blood to each of the two gills of the octopus. These hearts actually stop beating when the octopus is swimming, explaining why octopuses prefer to crawl than swim, as swimming exhausts them. The third heart, known as the systemic heart, pumps blood to the rest of the octopus' body after the blood has been oxygenated by the gills. Unlike in humans, octopuses have \\"blue blood\\". This is due to the presence of a copper-rich protein, hemocyanin, in their blood, which is efficient at transporting oxygen in cold and low-oxygen conditions - common conditions in underwater environments. Moreover, octopuses are known for their impressive survival tactics, which include squirting ink at predators, camouflaging themselves, and even self-amputation of their limbs, which can regrow. But perhaps the most impressive is their ability to manipulate their RNA - a process known as RNA editing. This, in essence, allows them to alter the instructions of their DNA, thereby adapting their nervous system to various environmental changes and threats, revealing an extraordinary level of genetic complexity. In essence, octopuses are marvelous, intelligent, and remarkably adaptable creatures with their three hearts, blue blood, and advanced survival tactics.

The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\" - A composer (Latin \\"compn\\"; literally \\"one who puts together\\") is a person who creates or writes music, which can be vocal music (for a singer or choir), instrumental music (e.g., for solo piano, string quartet, wind quintet or orchestra) or music which combines both instruments and voices (e.g., opera or art song, which is a singer accompanied by a pianist). The core meaning of the term refers to individuals who have contributed to the tradition of Western classical music through creation of works expressed in written musical notation (e.g., sheet music scores). - Slovenia, officially the Republic of Slovenia (Slovene: , abbr.: \\"RS\\"), is a nation state in southern Central Europe, located at the crossroads of main European cultural and trade routes. It is bordered by Italy to the west, Austria to the north, Hungary to the northeast, Croatia to the south and southeast, and the Adriatic Sea to the southwest. It covers and has a population of 2.06 million. It is a parliamentary republic and a member of the United Nations, European Union, and NATO. The capital and largest city is Ljubljana. - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets. - Dragotin Cvetko ( 19 September 1911 -- 2 September 1993 ) was a Slovenian composer and musicologist . - Sheet music is a handwritten or printed form of music notation that uses modern musical symbols to indicate the pitches (melodies), rhythms and/or chords of a song or instrumental musical piece. Like its analogs printed books or pamphlets in English, Arabic or other languages the medium of sheet music typically is paper (or, in earlier centuries, papyrus or parchment), although the access to musical notation since the 1980s has included the presentation of musical notation on computer screens and the development of scorewriter computer programs that can notate a song or piece electronically, and, in some cases, \\"play back\\" the notated music using a synthesizer or virtual instruments. - Opera (English plural: \\"operas\\"; Italian plural: \\"opere\\" ) is an art form in which singers and musicians perform a dramatic work combining text (libretto) and musical score, usually in a theatrical setting. In traditional opera, singers do two types of singing: recitative, a speech-inflected style and arias, a more melodic style. Opera incorporates many of the elements of spoken theatre, such as acting, scenery, and costumes and sometimes includes dance. The performance is typically given in an opera house, accompanied by an orchestra or smaller musical ensemble, which since the early 19th century has been led by a conductor. Given the information, choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'languages spoken or written'.

Fact 2: Infection is a major pathway to ultimate amputation. Given the two facts above, a possible outcome of scraping oneself on a contaminated object? Answer:","response":"Given the two facts above, a possible outcome of scraping oneself on a contaminated object is that the individual may develop an infection. If the infection is not properly treated and managed, it may lead to complications such as tissue damage, gangrene, and systemic infection. In severe cases, these complications may necessitate amputation as a last resort to prevent further health complications or to save the individual's life. However, it is essential to note that this is an extreme outcome and proper wound care, hygiene, and timely medical intervention can significantly reduce the likelihood of amputation resulting from an infection."},{"question":"What is the solution? Solve f - 1 = -0*f for f.","response":"The equation you have given is f - 1 = -0*f. First, let's simplify the equation. The term -0*f equals 0 because any number multiplied by zero always equals zero. So, now the equation transforms from f - 1 = -0*f to f - 1 = 0. Afterward, let's isolate the variable \\"f\\" by using the simple algebraic manipulation. To do this, add 1 to both sides of the equation. The \\"+ 1\\" on the left side cancels out the \\"- 1\\" on the left side, so the \\"f\\" alone remains on the left side of the equation: f - 1 + 1 = 0 + 1 This simplifies to: f = 1 Therefore, the solution to the equation f - 1 = -0*f is f = 1. This means that the value of f that makes the original equation true is 1. Whenever you substitute 1 for f back into the equation, it should satisfy the given equation. Therefore, let's check our solution: f - 1 = -0*f Substitute f = 1, 1 - 1 = -0 * 1 0 = 0 Both the left hand side equals the right hand side, therefore the solution f = 1 is correct. This is the solution to the problem."},{"question":"A boomslang is what type of creature? What is the answer?","response":"A boomslang (Dispholidus typus) is a type of creature belonging to the reptile class, specifically a venomous snake. The name 'boomslang' originates from the Afrikaans and Dutch languages, in which the words 'boom' means 'tree' and 'slang' means 'snake,' essentially translating to \\"tree snake.\\" The boomslang is native to sub-Saharan Africa and is predominantly found in regions such as South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, and Swaziland. The boomslang is a medium-sized snake, typically ranging from 3.3 to 5.2 feet (1 to 1.6 meters) in length. The snake exhibits sexual dimorphism, with males usually exhibiting vibrant green hues, while females and juveniles display a more subdued brown coloration. These colors enable the boomslang to camouflage itself effectively amongst the trees and bushes in its typical habitat. As an arboreal snake, the boomslang spends most of its time in trees and shrubs in search of prey, which usually consists of chameleons, small mammals, birds, and eggs. It is well-adapted for climbing, showcasing incredible agility as it navigates the tops of trees and uses its keen eyesight to spot potential prey from a distance. The boomslang possesses a potent hemotoxic venom, which impacts the blood clotting process and leads to uncontrolled, potentially fatal internal and external bleeding in its victims. This snake has rear fangs set far back in its mouth, requiring it to chew on its prey to effectively introduce venom into the wound. While not generally aggressive, the boomslang may become defensive if harassed or threatened, and its venom can be dangerous to humans. In the event of a bite, the victim should seek immediate medical attention. Despite its dangerous reputation, the boomslang plays an essential role in its ecosystem by maintaining the balance of its prey populations and acting as a food source for predators such as birds of prey and other larger snakes. This fascinating reptile showcases the beauty and diversity of ambushing predators in the natural world and provides a glimpse into the incredible adaptations of the animal kingdom."},{"question":"Хочу проснуться я В изнеженных твоих руках, Смотреть, как солнца луч Играет на твоих губах...

Its unusual name, coined by Thomas Carlyle in 1858, refers to an ear severed from Robert Jenkins, a captain of a British merchant ship. There is no evidence of the stories that the severed ear was exhibited before the British Parliament. The seeds of conflict began with the separation of an ear from Jenkins following the boarding of his vessel by Spanish coast guards in 1731, eight years before the war began. Popular response to the incident was tepid until several years later when opposition politicians and the British South Sea Company hoped to spur outrage against Spain, believing that a victorious war would improve Britain's trading opportunities in the Caribbean. Also ostensibly providing the impetus to war against the Spanish Empire was a desire to pressure the Spanish not to renege on the lucrative asiento contract, which gave British slavers permission to sell slaves in Spanish America. The war resulted in heavy British casualties in North America. After 1742, the war was subsumed by the wider War of the Austrian Succession, which involved most of the powers of Europe. Peace arrived with the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748. From the British perspective, the war was notable because it was the first time that a regiment of colonial American troops was raised and placed \\"on the Establishment\\" - made a part of the regular British Army - and sent to fight outside North America. Question: How many more years after major operations largely ended did The War of Jenkins' Ear last for? Answer:","response":"After the major operations of The War of Jenkins' Ear largely ended in 1742, the conflict continued for six more years until its conclusion in 1748 with the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle.

The movie masterfully combines sci-fi, romance, and fantastical elements to explore the themes of love, acceptance, and defiance of societal norms. Set in the early 1960s Cold War-era America, \\"The Shape of Water\\" tells the story of a mute janitor, Elisa Esposito (played by the incredibly talented Sally Hawkins), who works at a top-secret government facility. Elisa's life consists of mundane routines, and she maintains close friendships with her aging neighbor, Giles (Richard Jenkins), and her co-worker, Zelda (Octavia Spencer). The film truly begins with the arrival of an amphibious creature (a mesmerizing performance by Doug Jones), captured in the South American jungle and brought to the facility by the merciless Richard Strickland (a brilliantly terrifying Michael Shannon). The creature serves as a race against time for the United States, as the government seeks to gain an edge in the space race against the Soviet Union. As Elisa forms a bond with the enigmatic creature, the film takes us through an emotional rollercoaster, allowing us to witness the complexities of love, vulnerability, and what truly makes us human. The performances by the entire cast are phenomenal, with Sally Hawkins delivering a heart-wrenching portrayal of loneliness and longing without uttering a single word. Michael Shannon’s character, Strickland, serves as a perfect foil, his ruthless ambition and obsession with control embodying the dehumanization and malicious intent prevalent in society. Visually, \\"The Shape of Water\\" is a feast for the eyes. From the dreamlike aquatic cinematography to the detailed, darkly beautiful set designs, del Toro enriches the screen with an immersive and nostalgic palette. The visual effects, especially the creature design, come together seamlessly to create a truly extraordinary character that resonates with the audience. The film's score, composed by the renowned Alexandre Desplat, is yet another masterpiece that reflects both the whimsical nature of the story and the underlying melancholy that seeps through the plot. With its romantic, sweeping melodies and bittersweet undertones, the music elevates the emotion in each scene, creating a harmonious combination of sight and sound. \\"The Shape of Water\\" is a celebration of love in all its forms, and its portrayal of acceptance and empathy could not be more timely in today's world. The film succeeds in making us ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about our prejudices and the importance of understanding those who are different from us. It challenges us to confront our fears and look deeper into the hearts and souls of those we might initially dismiss or fear. In summary, \\"The Shape of Water\\" is a modern cinematic fairy tale that effortlessly melds sci-fi, fantasy, and romance to create a timeless story, featuring some of the most memorable characters and performances in recent years. With its evocative visuals, haunting score, and heartfelt storytelling, Guillermo del Toro's masterpiece is an unforgettable cinematic experience, deserving of all praise and accolades it received, including the Best Picture and Best Director Oscars. This enchanting film leaves a lasting impression, reaffirming the undeniable power of love in the face of adversity."},{"question":"Write some highlights for the following article: By. Jonathan O'Callaghan for MailOnline. In the summer of 1989 Nasa’s Voyager 2 became the first, and to date only, spacecraft to visit the planet Neptune. During the brief flyby of the planet on 25 August, the probe returned images of its natural satellite Triton, a giant moon bigger even than the dwarf planet Pluto. And now a map and video have been revealed stitching together the images in unprecedented detail, creating the most comprehensview of its surface ever seen. Scroll down for video. Footage of Voyager 2's flyby of Neptune's largest moon (animation above) has been restored by Dr Paul Schenk of the Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI). The movie, using the best Voyager map in colour, recreates the encounter with Triton as Voyager 2 ended its tour of the giant planets and began its trek into deep space in 1989. The footage was restored by Dr Paul Schenk of the Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI) in Houston, Texas. It. is 37 years since the twin Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft were launched and. the pair continue to explore where nothing from Earth has flown before. Their primary mission was the exploration of Jupiter and Saturn. After. making a string of discoveries there - such as active volcanoes on. Jupiter's moon Io and intricacies of Saturn's rings - the mission was. extended. Voyager 2 went on to explore Uranus and Neptune, and is still the only spacecraft to have visited those outer planets. The. current mission for both spacecraft, the Voyager Interstellar Mission,. is to explore the outermost edge of the Sun's domain and beyond. The map has a resolution of 1,970 feet (600 m) per pixel, while the approximately natural colours have been enhanced to bring out the contrast. Voyager 2's ‘eyes’ saw colours slightly different from human eyes, and this map was produced using orange, green and blue filter images. When it passed in 1989, most of the Northern Hemisphere was in darkness and was unseen. Because of the speed of Voyager's visit - about 15 miles (25 km) per second, and the slow rotation of Triton - only the Southern Hemisphere was seen clearly at close distance. The rest of the surface was either in darkness or seen as blurry markings. 'The biggest challenge in \\"restoring\\" this map was the color of Triton,' Dr Schenk tells MailOnline. 'We had considerable difficulty because some of the colour images were smeared or noisy, and there is some uncertainty in the absolute calibration of the colour images. 'We also do not know exactly what the colour of Triton was in those days. Earth-based observations gave very different answers. 'We did our best to give at least an impression of what the colour of this very active body at the edge of the Solar System looks like.' And on his website Dr Schenk explains what is being seen in the video and images. ‘Voyager 2 made a hair-raising pass over Neptune’s large moon Triton in August 1989,’ he wrote. ‘Approaching from the deep south, Voyager passed over the north pole of cloud-swept Neptune, almost close enough to brush the far-attenuated upper atmosphere. ‘The gravity of Neptune pulled the spacecraft down toward Triton, passing over the unlit north pole of that bitterly cold icy moon.’ When Voyager 2 passed in 1989, most of the Northern Hemisphere (left) was in darkness and was unseen. Because of the speed of Voyager's visit, about 15 miles (25 km) per second, and the slow rotation of Triton, only the Southern Hemisphere (right) was seen clearly at close distance. Voyager 2 is the only spacecraft ever to have visited Neptune, seen here. Dark, cold and whipped by supersonic winds, Neptune is the last of the hydrogen and helium gas giants in the solar system. More than 30 times as far from the sun as Earth, the planet takes almost 165 Earth years to orbit the sun. Triton is 1,681 miles (2,706 km) across, making it the 16th largest body in the solar system. It is also thought to have an icy surface, and may even have clouds in its skies. In fact, the moon is thought to bear some similarities to Pluto, which makes these recent restorations all the more interesting. Next year on 14 July, Nasa’s New Horizons probe will flyby the dwarf planet, and by using the experiences of Voyager 2 at Triton, engineers hope to get as much data as possible out of the mission. 'The new map of Triton sharpens the details. a bit but also shows us the entire surface, at least as far as Voyager. could see it,' Dr Schenk continues to MailOnline. 'It gives us a sense of how dynamic and active this place. is. More importantly we can compare it with other active worlds like. Europa and Enceladus. 'Perhaps the most important feature of the map is. that it gives us a complete and up-to-date picture of Pluto, her twin,. so that we will be ready when New Horizons gets there next summer.' And on whether he hope a mission visits again in the future, he added: 'I. certainly hope we go back. 'Uranus and Neptune and their strange moons. are among the largest bodies on the Solar System. 'After we go back to. Europa, the next targets should be Uranus, Neptune or both, with modern. scientific instruments like Cassini at Saturn has.' In another historic milestone for the. Voyager mission, 25 August also marks the two-year anniversary of. Voyager 1 reaching interstellar space. It is 37 years since the twin Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft (illustrated) were launched and the pair continue to explore where nothing from Earth has flown before.Their primary mission was the exploration of Jupiter and Saturn. Voyager 2 went on to explore Uranus and Neptune, the only spacecraft to have visited those planets. Triton is 1,681 miles (2,706 km) across, making it the 16th largest body in the solar system. It is also thought to have an icy surface (illustration shown), and may even have clouds in its skies. In fact, the moon is thought to bear some similarities to Pluto, which makes these recent restorations all the more interesting.","response":"In 1989, NASA's Voyager 2 spacecraft became the first and only probe to visit Neptune and its largest moon Triton. Dr. Paul Schenk of the Lunar and Planetary Institute has restored footage from Voyager 2's flyby of Triton, creating a detailed map and video of the moon's surface. This restored footage brings unprecedented detail, with a resolution of 1,970 feet (600 meters) per pixel. The footage has also enhanced the color contrast to bring out features of the surface. At the time of the flyby, Voyager 2 moved at a speed of about 15 miles (25 kilometers) per second, and given Triton's slow rotation, only the Southern Hemisphere was seen clearly. The Northern Hemisphere was either in darkness or seen as blurry markings. Dr. Schenk's restoration of the footage sharpens the details of Triton's surface, allowing scientists to compare it with other active celestial bodies like Europa and Enceladus. Triton is known for having an icy surface and potentially even clouds in its skies, bearing similarities to Pluto. As NASA's New Horizons probe prepares for its flyby of Pluto on 14 July next year, scientists are using Voyager 2's experiences at Triton to gather as much data as possible for the mission. Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 were launched 37 years ago with their primary mission being the exploration of Jupiter and Saturn. Voyager 2 then went on to explore Uranus and Neptune, marking its place in history as the only spacecraft to have visited the outer planets. Today, both Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 continue their exploration in the Voyager Interstellar Mission, studying the outermost edge of the Sun's domain and beyond."},{"question":"1.

Whether you are starting a business from the ground up or are managing an existing business, you need to examine your staffing needs. You need to think about the tasks that get done and decide how much one person can do. This analysis may show you that you need more people than you have, or it may tell you that you need to reassign staff that you already have. Focus on the tasks rather than individual people and personalities. For example, suppose you are managing a store that employs sales clerks. You could analyze your sales records and find when your busy periods occur. Then hire an additional clerk for the busiest times of the day. If you observe an employee who seems to have too much free time, you should consider increasing that employee's duties. If you don't have additional work for that employee, you may need to cut back the hours or eliminate the position completely. Develop written job descriptions for each role in your business. The job description should include an outline of the tasks to be performed, the expected working hours, the person supervising the role, and a general statement of goals for the position. Advertise, interview, and hire staff members who will best serve each position. For more help on hiring, you may want to read this helpful article. As part of your hiring process, if you are starting a new business, you must attend to certain federal and state regulations. You need to get a federal employer identification number (FEIN), register with your state’s labor office, and obtain worker’s compensation insurance. Having employees requires you to pay your employees, on time and correctly. You need a reliable payroll system that accounts for employee hours and pay rates. You must withhold the proper amounts for federal, state and local taxes, and deposit those as required with the taxing authorities. Establish a consistent system for payment, whether weekly or bi-weekly. For help with federal tax requirements, the IRS has put out two publications, the Employer’s Tax Guide, Publication 15, and the Employer’s Supplemental Tax Guide, Publication 15a. You can find both publications at the IRS publications page, at www.irs.gov/forms-pubs. An employee handbook is a written collection of all the rules and expectations for your staff. It should also set out what the staff can expect from the company. It will explain the employees’ rights as well as the legal obligations for both employees and the employer. You should include the following topics in a well-designed employee handbook: Anti-discrimination policies. Compensation and payroll schedules. Work schedules. Expected standards of conduct. Safety and security. Acceptable computer/technology use policy. Media relations. Leave policies and other employee benefits. A good manager will communicate regularly with staff. You need to know what they are observing in the business, how they feel about their jobs, and whether any problems are brewing. It also helps for the staff to hear from you and know, in advance, if any changes are coming or anything else that will affect their work. Regular communication can resolve many problems before they even start. Depending on the size of the business and your position as a manager, you may communicate through any or all of the following: Regularly scheduled staff meetings. Written newsletter or other bulletins. Regular informal email communications. A company bulletin board (either a real physical bulletin board or an online virtual site). A shared calendar of events. Summary:","response":"This article emphasizes the importance of analyzing staffing needs, effective hiring processes, and regulatory compliance for both new and existing businesses, and outlines best practices, including clear job descriptions, understanding employee rights and obligations, consistent payroll systems, and maintaining open communication with staff to ensure a productive work environment."},{"question":"Q:That fall came and I went back to Michigan and the school year went by and summer came and I never really thought about it. I'm not even sure if I was officially asked, I just wound up heading back to New Jersey when school was out. I think my parents thought it was a good enough deal. They were already having some problems and without Nonna there anymore to take care of me I think my cousin's house on the coast seemed like as good a spot as any to stick me for the summer. It certainly wasn't because of any great love between me and my cousin. We weren't really very good friends at that point. I think she saw me as sort of foisted off on her and getting in the way of her summers. Which was a fair enough judgment. But she could have been nicer. It's pretty amazing that she wound up as my Maid of Honor. Time does strange things. Your lovable jack-ass of a father would mention something about magic in here. You know if you took a group of fifty strangers, had them chat with your father for half an hour then with me for half an hour, then told them that one of us was an English Professor and one of us was head of distribution in the northeast for a large soft drink manufacturing concern, I'm pretty sure all fifty would peg your father as the English Professor and me as the head of distribution. He's honestly so good at what he does that I can almost allow him to claim it's magic except that it'd be nice if he took credit for some of the things he's done with his life.

Breaking bad habits is a process that involves looking closely at your behavior and trying to determine what triggers your bad habit. However, you can break bad habits by identifying the things that trigger your habit, learning how to break the cycle, and rewarding yourself when it works. You can also develop a plan to help you deal with your triggers. Choose a good time to try to break a habit. It might be easier to try to break a bad habit while you are on vacation. Although it might not be possible to wait to break a habit until you go on vacation, you might at least want to choose a time when you are not too stressed to work on breaking a bad habit. Try to be patient. Keep in mind that it can take anywhere from 18 to 66 days to break a habit. Don’t become discouraged if you find it difficult to break the habit at first. Remember to reward yourself. If you’ve had a great day where you did really well in your new habits and routines, praise yourself and give yourself a reward. Maybe eat a bowl of ice cream or go see a movie. Little rewards can affirm your progress, and they teach your brain to associate these new routines with pleasure. Perhaps you are struggling in a new career or you want to make a difference in your community. Ask an experienced person in that area to mentor you. Meet once a week or month to discuss your goals. Your mentor will share the struggles that they faced getting to the point where they are now. They can give you advice on your own hurdles and help you realize your potential. As you reinvent yourself, talk to your close friends about your progress. Tell them the kind of person you want to be, and as you face success and failure, talk through your thoughts and feelings. Good friends will provide positive affirmation, and a strong support group can increase your chances of success. If your friends tell you that you don’t need to change, try not to listen to them. They may have good intentions, but if you are unhappy with your current state of being, such advice can be discouraging. Thank them for their concern, but emphasize that this is something you want to continue.

Given the context: What will Kendall want to do next? Possible answers: impress Jordan with a party, be jealous of Jordan, make sure Jordan had a good time Answer:","response":"Based on the given context, it is likely that Kendall would want to make sure Jordan had a good time at the birthday party held at Jordan's house. Kendall, who is the celebrant, would appreciate the fact that Jordan allowed the use of their house for the party, and therefore would want to ensure it was an enjoyable and memorable experience for Jordan. Impressing Jordan with a party is unlikely to be Kendall's primary focus because Kendall is celebrating their own birthday. However, a well-planned and enjoyable party will in itself impress Jordan implicitly as it indicates that Kendall put in the effort to make the event successful. Being jealous of Jordan does not make sense in this context, as there is no indication that there is competition or rivalry between the two characters. Furthermore, Kendall is the center of attention at their own birthday celebration, so jealousy seems misplaced. Therefore, Kendall would want to make sure Jordan had a good time at the party as a sign of their gratitude and friendship. They might do this by engaging Jordan in conversations, ensuring their favorite activities or food options were available, and including them in any games or group activities. Additionally, Kendall could also be attentive and observant to Jordan's preferences and needs throughout the event, ensuring that Jordan feels included and has a great experience. Finally, after the celebration, Kendall might thank Jordan for their generosity and kindness in hosting the event and express how much it meant to them.

These steps, although simple, require careful execution to uphold the delicacy of the violets. 1. **Candying the violets**: After ensuring the violets are organically grown and edible, you'll need to candy them, if not already done. To candy the violets, dissolve around 3 cups of sugar with one cup of water over low heat in a pan. Stir continuously to prevent the sugar from hardening. Once the sugar is completely dissolved, take a small, clean paintbrush, dip it in the sugar syrup and paint each violet petal with sugar, ensuring all parts are coated. Handle the flowers gently to maintain their shape. 2. **Preparing for drying**: Once candy-coated, use tweezers to place the violets on a rack with a tray beneath it to catch any drippings. This is crucial as the violets should be well-spaced; they should not touch each other to ensure uniform drying. 3. **Air drying**: Let the violets sit for around 24 to 48 hours in a dry, well ventilated and warm area but out of direct sunlight. The reason for avoiding sunlight is to prevent the violets from losing their color. The air will naturally circulate around the violets and evaporate the water content in them, leaving behind candied, dried violets. 4. **Know when they are dried**: The violets are dried adequately when they feel dry to the touch and have a crusty sugar coating around them. 5. **Storage**: After they are dried completely, they should be stored in an airtight container in a cool, dark and dry place to maintain the quality and prolong the shelf-life. Remember, the process for drying candied violets might be a tad drawn out as natural air drying is used instead of other quick drying methods.

Little is known for certain of Josquin's early life. Much is inferential and speculative, though numerous clues have emerged from his works and the writings of contemporary composers, theorists, and writers of the next several generations. Josquin was born in the area controlled by the Dukes of Burgundy, and was possibly born either in Hainaut (modern-day Belgium), or immediately across the border in modern-day France, since several times in his life he was classified legally as a Frenchman (for instance, when he made his will). Josquin was long mistaken for a man with a similar name, Josquin de Kessalia, born around the year 1440, who sang in Milan from 1459 to 1474, dying in 1498. More recent scholarship has shown that Josquin des Prez was born around 1450 or a few years later, and did not go to Italy until the early 1480s.Around 1466, perhaps on the death of his father, Josquin was named by his uncle and aunt, Gille Lebloitte dit Desprez and Jacque Banestonne, as their heir. Their will gives Josquin's actual surname as Lebloitte. According to Matthews and Merkley, \\"des Prez\\" was an alternative name.According to an account by Claude Hémeré, a friend and librarian of Cardinal Richelieu whose evidence dates as late as 1633, and who used the records of the collegiate church of Saint-Quentin, Josquin became a choirboy with his friend and colleague the Franco Flemish composer Jean Mouton at Saint-Quentin's royal church, probably around 1460. Doubt has been cast on the accuracy of Hémeré's account, however. Josquin may have studied counterpoint under Ockeghem, whom he greatly admired throughout his life: this is suggested both by the testimony of Gioseffo Zarlino and Lodovico Zacconi, writing later in the 16th century, and by Josquin's eloquent lament on the death of Ockeghem in 1497, Nymphes des bois/Requiem aeternam, based on the poem by Jean Molinet.

After the car speeds by the person on the left (position A), the sound waves get more and more spread out, so they have a lower frequency. This makes the siren sound lower in pitch. A change in the frequency of sound waves, relative to a stationary listener, when the source of the sound waves is moving is called the Doppler effect . You’ve probably experienced the Doppler effect yourself. The next time a vehicle with a siren races by, listen for the change in pitch. For an online animation of the Doppler effect, go to the URL below. Now, I have a new situation: A scientist is analyzing two different sounds, one from a deer and one from a zebra, with a device that allows her to see the sound waves of each noise. While looking at the results, she sees that the sound waves for the deer are more closely packed together, but the zebra's sound has very spread out waves. Answer this question please: Which animal's sound has a higher pitch?

The Ancient Greek prólogos included the modern meaning of prologue , but was of wider significance , more like the meaning of preface . The importance , therefore , of the prologue in Greek drama was very great ; it sometimes almost took the place of a romance , to which , or to an episode in which , the play itself succeeded . It is believed that the prologue in this form was practically the invention of Euripides , and with him , as has been said , it takes the place of an explanatory first act . This may help to modify the objection which criticism has often brought against the Greek prologue , as an impertinence , a useless growth prefixed to the play , and standing as a barrier between us and our enjoyment of it . The point precisely is that , to an Athenian audience , it was useful and pertinent , as supplying just what they needed to make the succeeding scenes intelligible . But it is difficult to accept the view that Euripides invented the plan of producing a god out of a machine to justify the action of deity upon man , because it is plain that he himself disliked this interference of the supernatural and did not believe in it . He seems , in such a typical prologue as that to the Hippolytus , to be accepting a conventional formula , and employing it , almost perversely , as a medium for his ironic rationalismo . - A book is a set of written, printed, illustrated, or blank sheets, made of paper, parchment, or other materials, fastened together to hinge at one side, with text and/or images printed in ink. A single sheet within a book is a leaf, and each side of a leaf is a page. A set of text-filled or illustrated pages produced in electronic format is known as an electronic book, or e-book. - A preface or proem is an introduction to a book or other literary work written by the work's author. An introductory essay written by a different person is a \\"foreword\\" and precedes an author's preface. The preface often closes with acknowledgments of those who assisted in the literary work. - A foreword is a (usually short) piece of writing sometimes placed at the beginning of a book or other piece of literature. Typically written by someone other than the primary author of the work, it often tells of some interaction between the writer of the foreword and the book's primary author or the story the book tells. Later editions of a book sometimes have a new foreword prepended (appearing before an older foreword if there was one), which might explain in what respects that edition differs from previous ones.

He bench presses 15 pounds for 10 reps and does 3 sets. How much total weight does he move? Give me reasons, before answering the question","response":"To determine the total weight John moves while bench pressing, we need to consider the weight he's lifting, the number of repetitions per set, and the total number of sets he performs. Here's the breakdown: 1. Weight he's lifting: John is lifting 15 pounds per repetition. 2. Number of repetitions per set: He performs 10 reps in each set. 3. Number of sets: He completes 3 sets of repetitions. Now, we can calculate the total weight John moves by multiplying these three numbers together. Total weight moved = Weight per repetition × Repetitions per set × Number of sets In this case, the calculation looks like this: Total weight moved = 15 pounds × 10 reps × 3 sets Total weight moved = 15 × 10 × 3 Total weight moved = 450 pounds So, John moves a total of 450 pounds while completing his bench press workout."},{"question":"** NMDC Ltd, India's biggest iron ore producer, falls 1.3 pct ** Motilal Oswal Securities downgrades the stock to \\"sell\\" from \\"buy\\" and cuts price target to 104 rupees from 161 ** NMDC's pricing still non-competitive, despite steep price cuts, says Motilal Oswal ** Cuts EBITDA estimates by 36 pct and 42 pct for FY16 and FY17, respectively ** Steep correction in iron ore prices and rising capital commitment to the steel project will squeeze dividend payout-Motilal Oswal (Reuters Messaging: indulal.p.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net) Based on that paragraph can we conclude that this sentence is true?

Cowboy drifter Jim Garry is summoned by his friend, smooth-talking Tate Riling. Garry rides into an Indian reservation and finds himself in the middle of a conflict between a cattle owner and some homesteaders. He meets cattle owner John Lufton, and eventually his daughters Amy and Carol. The Luftons suspect that Garry is on Riling's side and are initially hostile, especially Amy. Garry readily admits that he is going to work for his friend. Riling tells Garry that he and Indian agent Jake Pindalest have devised an elaborate scheme to force Lufton into selling his herd cheaply. Pindalest has gotten the government to order Lufton to remove his cattle from the reservation in a week. Meanwhile, Riling has organized the homesteaders into blocking the move, conning them into believing that he is working in their best interests. With no other option, Lufton would have to sell his herd at bargain prices or lose everything. Lufton would never sell to Riling, but he would to a stranger like Garry. Pindalest would then see that the government buys the herd at an inflated price. Garry would get 10,000 for his part in the swindle. Lufton manages to outsmart Riling and move his herd unimpeded, but Riling and his men stampede and scatter the cattle back onto the reservation. It would take several days to gather the herd, more time than Lufton has before the deadline. Garry becomes disgusted when a man is killed in the stampede, and he switches sides. Amy still does not trust him. She suspects Garry of betraying the contents of a letter to Riling, unaware that Carol is enamored with Riling and is the one passing information to him.

From the moment my friends and I walked through the door, we were transported into a warm, inviting, and truly memorable dining experience. I am excited to share my positive experience at Sunshine Restaurant, highlighting the exceptional service, tantalizing menu, and the charming ambiance that makes this restaurant a must-visit gem. Upon entering the establishment, we were greeted with welcoming smiles and promptly seated by the courteous host, who guided us to a cozy table near the floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the picturesque city. The lighting was soft and warm, creating a serene atmosphere while enhancing the elegant decor. Paintings and photographs from local artists adorned the walls, lending the space an air of sophistication and a strong connection to the community. Our server, Sarah, approached the table with genuine enthusiasm and an excellent knowledge of the menu. She took the time to answer our questions and offered personalized recommendations based on our dietary preferences and culinary interests. Her attentive and sincere demeanor significantly contributed to our enjoyable dining experience. Sunshine Restaurant's menu is a spectacular fusion of global flavors combined with fresh, local ingredients. For starters, we ordered the Crispy Calamari with citrus aioli and the Beet and Goat Cheese Salad. The calamari was crisp on the outside and tender on the inside - a true delight for the senses. The tangy citrus aioli added a delightful contrast to the dish's rich flavors. The salad, composed of perfectly roasted beets, creamy goat cheese, aromatic arugula, and crunchy walnuts, was dressed with a slightly sweet balsamic glaze that brought the dish together harmoniously. For our main courses, I had the Seared Scallops with sweet corn purée, pancetta, and charred cherry tomatoes, while my friends enjoyed the Pistachio-crusted Rack of Lamb and the house specialty Lobster Ravioli. The scallops were perfectly cooked - golden brown and tender, with the sweetness of the corn purée enhancing their delicate flavor. The savory pancetta and the burst of acidity from the cherry tomatoes created an exquisite symphony of taste. Both the rack of lamb and the lobster ravioli received equally glowing reviews from my friends, and we were all impressed by the artful presentation and perfect execution of each dish. Dessert was the grand finale - a decadent Chocolate Fondant Cake with raspberry coulis and a dollop of vanilla bean ice cream, alongside an expertly crafted Cappuccino to round out the meal. The cake's richness and the bright raspberry notes were a match made in heaven, while the cappuccino provided a soothing and satisfying conclusion to our feast. In summary, our experience at Sunshine Restaurant was one of those rare moments where exceptional service, delectable food, and a captivating ambiance merge to create an unforgettable dining experience.

If not, how can I get odor-less sweat? Second question: Why my feces smell like sweat? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","response":"First question: Is sweat supposed to smell sour or like vinegar? If not, how can I get odor-less sweat? Step 1: Understand the components of sweat. Sweat is primarily composed of water, minerals (such as sodium, potassium, and calcium), and small amounts of lactate and urea. It does not typically have a strong smell on its own. Step 2: Understand the source of odor in sweat. The odor associated with sweat is usually the result of bacteria on the skin breaking down the sweat, specifically the proteins and fatty acids in the sweat produced by the apocrine glands. This breakdown causes the release of substances with a distinct smell, sometimes sour or vinegar-like. Step 3: Answer the first part of the question. Sweat itself is not supposed to smell sour or like vinegar, but the odor may arise from bacterial breakdown of sweat on the skin. Step 4: Provide guidance for reducing odors in sweat. To minimize the odor associated with sweat, consider the following: - Maintain good personal hygiene, especially by showering regularly and using antibacterial soap. - Change and wash clothes, especially underwear and socks, after sweating. - Use an antiperspirant or deodorant to help control sweat production and mask odor. - Keep body hair trimmed to minimize the areas where bacteria can thrive. - Consider your diet, as certain foods can affect the smell of sweat (e.g., spicy food, garlic). Second question: Why my feces smell like sweat? Step 1: Understand the factors influencing feces smell. The smell of feces comes from the combination of waste products, bacteria, and undigested food. A person's diet, hydration, and gut health can all influence the smell of their feces. Step 2: Consider possible causes for feces smelling like sweat. There could be a few reasons why your feces smell like sweat, including: - A similar mixture of bacteria present in both the gut and on the skin. - Consuming foods that affect both the smell of sweat and feces, such as garlic or certain spices. - Dehydration, which could concentrate the smell in both sweat and feces. Step 3: Answer the second part of the question. The smell of your feces resembling that of your sweat could be due to shared factors like diet, bacterial composition, or dehydration. Lastly, are these two questions asking the same thing? These two questions are related but not exactly the same. The first question is asking about the normal smell of sweat and how to make it odorless, while the second question is asking why the user's feces smell like their sweat. While both questions deal with body odors, they address different aspects of the issue and have distinct answers."},{"question":"Question: FINAL EXAM Question 1.

CHAPTER XVII Old Man Coyote is Disappointed. Old Man Coyote lay stretched out in his favorite napping place on the Green Meadows. He was thinking of what he had found out up in the Green Forest that morning--that Paddy the Beaver was living there. Old Man Coyote's thoughts seemed very pleasant to himself, though really they were very dreadful thoughts. You see, he was thinking how easy it was going to be to catch Paddy the Beaver, and what a splendid meal he would make. He licked his chops at the thought. \\"He doesn't know I know he's here,\\" thought Old Man Coyote. \\"In fact, I don't believe heaven knows that I am anywhere around. Of course he won't be watching for me. He cuts his trees at night, so all I will have to do is to hide right close by where he is at work, and he'll walk right into my mouth.

They will make you comfortable while they are around. You feel at ease while talking to them. How is it done? Here are several skills that good talkers have. If you follow the skills, they'll help people feel relaxed and make friends with them quickly. First of all, good talkers ask questions. Almost anyone, no matter how shy he is, will answer a question. One well-known businesswoman says, \\"At business lunches, I always ask people what they did that morning. It's a common question, but it will get things going.\\" From there you can move on to other matters--sometimes to really personal questions. And how he answers will let you know how far you can go. Second, once good talkers have asked questions, they listen to the answers. This point seems clear, but it isn't. Your questions should have a point and help to tell what kind of person you are talking to. And to find out, you really have to listen carefully and attentively. Real listening at least means some things. First it means not to change the topic of conversation. If someone insists on one topic, it means he's really interested in it. Real listening also means not just listening to words, but to the voice. If the voice sounds bored, then, it's time for you to change the topic. Finally, good talkers know well how to deal with the moment of saying good-bye. If you're saying it, you may give him a handshake and say, \\"I've really enjoyed meeting you.\\" If you want to see that person again, don't keep it a secret. Let people know your thoughts. Generally speaking, good talkers are persons who _ . A) are not good at making any topic interesting B) never talk too much or too little C) always speak in a gentle way D) know when they should change the topic of the talk The answer is:","response":"D) know when they should change the topic of the talk The passage mentions that good talkers have a few skills: they ask questions, they listen to the answers, and they know how to handle the end of a conversation. Crucially, as part of the skill of listening, they need to pay attention not just to the words, but also the tone of voice of the person they are speaking with. This is where option D is relevant. If their conversation partner sounds bored, a good talker knows it's time to change the topic. So, they need to possess the ability to assess when a topic change is required to keep the conversation engaging and comfortable. They make sure not to drag an uninteresting or exhausted topic. The options A, B, and C are not explicitly mentioned or suggested as characteristics of a good talker in the given text. So those options can be ruled out."},{"question":"Translate the following sentence to Russian: Please notice that the deadline for a cancellation of an order is 48 hrs. before the beginning of a service.

Barbara Lee called the proposed platform of the Democratic party a \\"truly progressive platform draft.\\" | AP Photo Former Progressive Caucus co-chair hails DNC draft as 'imperfect' but 'truly progressive' Rep. Barbara Lee, a former co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, is praising the draft of the 2016 Democratic Party platform as a \\"truly progressive platform draft\\" even though it doesn't include everything she wanted. Lee's comments, shared first with POLITICO on Monday, follow the Democratic National Convention Drafting Committee approving the draft early Saturday. Fourteen of the 15 members of the committee supported the draft. Cornel West, a Sanders-backed member on the committee, abstained. The draft now goes before the entire platform committee in July during a meeting in Orlando. Both former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders lauded the committee, made up of members picked mostly by the two candidates, for producing a draft satisfying most of their policy goals. Clinton senior policy adviser Maya Harris called the draft \\"the most ambitious and progressive platform our party has ever seen.\\" The draft includes language opposing the death penalty (which Clinton supports under certain circumstances), supporting a 15 minimum wage, and calls for new legislation similar to the Glass-Steagall Wall Street reform Act, all of which have been priorities for Sanders and his liberal allies. It also pushes for expanding Social Security and improving the nation's infrastructure. \\"We were able to unite around many progressive issues including the need to make sure all Americans earn at least 15 an hour and can join a union; asking the wealthy pay their fair share through a multi-millionaire surtax; breaking up too big to fail financial institutions that pose a systemic risk to the stability of our economy; expanding social security; helping those in poverty, in part through an expansion of the earned income tax credit for childless workers and expanding the child tax credit to lift more children out of poverty; increasing resources for community health centers; declaring our opposition to the Hyde and Helms amendments which restrict women’s access to safe abortions at home and abroad; and abolishing the death penalty,\\" Lee said in the statement set to go out Monday morning. Sanders himself praised the draft as a \\"very good start\\" but said there's still more changes to be made. \\"The platform drafted in St. Louis is a very good start, but there is no question that much more work remains to be done by the full Platform Committee when it meets in Orlando on July 8 and 9,\\" Sanders said in a statement on Sunday. Sanders also noted that the Clinton-backed allies on the drafting committee voted down a provision opposing Congress vote on the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\\" Lee conceded that the draft wasn't perfect as well and noted she opposed TPP but that overall it was a move in the right direction. \\"I recognize there are bound to be some who are disappointed with the outcome. But our Party’s platform has always been both aspirational and imperfect. In fact, on issues like climate change, I voted with Senator Sanders, and didn't get everything I was hoping for. This is how our democracy functions. Additionally, as a member of Congress, I will continue to oppose TPP,\\" Lee said. ||||| Just 24 hours after Bernie Sanders' big win in Michigan, he and Hillary Clinton are battling it out in the Sunshine State. The two Democratic hopefuls are offering their final pitches to Florida voters before they hit the polls next Tuesday. Here are the best lines of tonight's debate hosted by Univision and the Washington Post: ON THE MICHIGAN PRIMARIES CLINTON: “I was pleased that I got 100,000 more votes last night than my opponent and more delegates. So this is a marathon, and it's a marathon that can only be carried out by the kind of inclusive campaign that I'm running.\\" “It was a very close race. We've had some of those. I've won some. I've lost some,” she added. SANDERS: “We have come a long way in 10 months.” “I believe that our message of the need for people to stand up and tell corporate America and Wall Street that they cannot have it all is resonating across this country.” ON HILLARY CLINTON’S EMAIL CONTROVERSY CLINTON: “There's a lot of questions in there. And I'm going to give the same answer I've been giving for many months.” When asked by Univision’s Jorge Ramos whether she would drop out of the race if she were indicted, Clinton fired back: “Oh, that's not going to happen. I'm not even answering that question.” ON DONALD TRUMP CLINTON: “I called him out when he was calling Mexicans rapists, when he was engaging in rhetoric that I found deeply offensive. I said, ‘Basta [enough].” SANDERS: “I think that the American people are never going to elect a president who insults Mexicans, who insults Muslims, who insults women, who insults African-Americans and let us not forget that several years ago, Trump was in the middle of the so-called birther movement trying to delegitimize the president of the United States of America. “My dad was born in Poland. I know a little bit about the immigrant experience. Nobody has ever asked me for my birth certificate. Maybe it has something to do with the color of my skin,” the Vermont senator added. ON BERNIE SANDERS’ FLIP-FLOPPING ON IMMIGRATION SANDERS: “What I believe right now is not only that we need comprehensive immigration reform. If the Congress does not do its job, as president of the United States I will use the executive powers of that office to do what has to be done to do what President Obama did and expand on that.” ON DEPORTING UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS CLINTON: “I will not deport children. I would not deport children. I do not want to deport family members, either. I want to prioritize who would be deported: violent criminals, people planning terrorist attacks, anybody who threatens us.” SANDERS: “I will not deport children from the United States of America.” “I can make that promise,” Sanders repeated. SANDERS vs. CLINTON’S RECORD SANDERS: “I will stand -- my career, political career fighting for workers, fighting for the poorest people in this country. Madam Secretary, I will match my record against yours any day of the week.” ON TRUMP’S WALL PROPOSAL CLINTON: “He's talking about a very tall wall, a beautiful tall wall, the most beautiful tall wall, better than the Great Wall of China that would run the entire border, that he would somehow magically get the Mexican government to pay for, and, you know, it's just fantasy.” ON CLINTON’S RELATIONSHIP WITH WALL STREET SANDERS: “Secretary's words to Wall Street has really intimidated them, and that is why they have given her 15 million in campaign contributions.” “Wait a minute. I just think it's worth pointing out that the leaders of the fossil fuel industry, the Koch brothers, have just paid to put up an ad praising senator Sanders,” Clinton interjected. ON BENGHAZI CLINTON: “This is not the first time we lost Americans in a terrorist attack. We lost 3,000 people on 9/11. We lost Americans serving in embassies in Tanzania and Kenya when my husband was president. We lost 250 Americans when Ronald Reagan was president in Beirut. At no other time were those tragedies politicized. Instead people said let's learn the lesson and save lives.” ON COLLEGE TUITION CLINTON: “The government has to quit making money off of lending money to young people to get their education.” Sanders responded saying: “What secretary Clinton said is absolutely right. I think I said it many months before she said it, but thanks for copying a very good idea.” Clinton touted back, “Senator Sanders has talked about free college for everybody, he's talked about universal single payer health care for everybody, and yet when you ask questions it's very hard to get answers.” ON SANDERS CLINTON: “I wish he would criticize and join me in criticizing George W. Bush, who I think wrecked the economy and created the conditions for the great recession.” SANDERS: “I gather Secretary Clinton hasn't listened to too many of my speeches or followed my work in the congress because very few people stood up to George W. Bush, whether it was the war in Iraq or any other of his policies.” ON US INTERVENTIONS IN LATIN AMERICA SANDERS: “The United States was wrong to try to invade Cuba. The United States was wrong trying to support people to overthrow the Nicaraguan government, the United States was wrong to try to overthrow the democratically elected government of Guatemala. Throughout the history of our relationship with Latin America we've operated under the so-called Monroe doctrine, and that said the United States had the right do anything they wanted do in Latin America.” ||||| Never miss the best of FiveThirtyEight.

Danny made drastic healthier lifestyle choices, while Bill moved on and continued with his fast-food died , tanning saloons and smoking tobacco. Which person didn't start avoiding carcinogens? The answer to this question is:","response":"Bill is the person who didn't start avoiding carcinogens. Unlike Danny, who made drastic healthier lifestyle choices after reading about how lifestyle choices can influence the risk of getting cancer, Bill continued with his unhealthy habits, which expose him to carcinogens. It is essential to understand that carcinogens are substances or factors that can cause or promote the development of cancer by damaging the DNA or causing abnormal cell growth. Many lifestyle choices increase our exposure to carcinogens and correlating risks. In Bill's case, his continued indulgence in fast food, tobacco smoking, and tanning salons contribute significantly to his higher cancer risk. Fast food is often high in unhealthy fats, sugars, salt, and additives, which can contribute to obesity, inflammation, and insulin resistance, all of which are risk factors for several types of cancer. Furthermore, some fast-food cooking methods, such as deep-frying, can produce harmful chemicals that may have carcinogenic properties. Tobacco smoking is well known for its many hazardous effects on health, with numerous carcinogenic chemicals present in tobacco smoke. According to the American Cancer Society, smoking accounts for about 30% of all cancer deaths in the United States. Additionally, smoking is a major cause of lung cancer and has strong links to cancers of the oral cavity, throat, esophagus, pancreas, bladder, kidney, cervix, and more. Tanning salons expose individuals to artificial ultraviolet (UV) radiation, which is a known carcinogen. The risk of developing skin cancers, including malignant melanoma (the most dangerous form of skin cancer), increases with the use of tanning beds and sunlamps. The World Health Organization (WHO) has classified UV-emitting tanning devices as \\"carcinogenic to humans.\\" Danny, on the other hand, reduced his exposure to carcinogens by adopting a healthier lifestyle. This likely included eating a balanced and nutritious diet, rich in fruits and vegetables that provide cancer-fighting antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals. He probably also refrained from smoking and excessive alcohol consumption, as well as avoided prolonged exposure to the sun or artificial UV radiation, and engaged in regular physical activity - all of which aid in reducing cancer risk. In conclusion, Bill failed to make necessary changes in his lifestyle to avoid carcinogens, whereas Danny made conscious efforts to minimize his exposure to cancer-causing factors. Consequently, Bill is at a higher risk of developing cancer due to his continued unhealthy habits and ignorance of the dangerous consequences associated with such lifestyle choices."},{"question":"Do you work for any nonprofit agency and helped save the life of an animal Please fix the punctuation.","response":"\\"Do you work for any nonprofit agency, and have you helped save the life of an animal?\\" Step 1: Identify the independent clauses, which are \\"Do you work for any nonprofit agency\\" and \\"have you helped save the life of an animal.\\" Step 2: Add a comma (,) before the conjunction \\"and\\" to separate the independent clauses.

The Romans later paved the route, which then connected the Kentish ports of Dubris (Dover), Rutupiae (Richborough), Lemanis (Lympne), and Regulbium (Reculver) to their bridge over the Thames at Londinium (London). The continuation northwest passed Verulamium (St Albans) on its way to Viroconium (Wroxeter). The Romans considered the continuation on to Blatobulgium (Birrens) beyond Hadrian's Wall to be part of the same route, leading some scholars to call this Watling Street as well, although others restrict it to the southern leg. Watling Street was the site of Boudica's defeat by the Romans and the southwestern border of the Danelaw. In the early 19th century, the course between London and the sea was paved and became known as the Great Dover Road. Today, the route from Dover to London forms part of the A2 road and the route from London to Wroxeter forms much of the A5 road. - Loughborough (or ) is a town within the Charnwood borough of Leicestershire, England. It is the seat of Charnwood Borough Council and home to Loughborough University. The town had a population of 57,600 in 2004, making it the largest settlement in Leicestershire outside the city of Leicester. The town is close to the Nottinghamshire border and is within a short distance of locations such as Nottingham, the East Midlands Airport and Derby. - Loughborough University (abbreviated as Lough for post-nominals) is a public research university located in the market town of Loughborough, Leicestershire, in the East Midlands of England. It has been a university since 1966, but the institution dates back to 1909, when the then Loughborough Technical Institute began with a focus on skills and knowledge which would be directly applicable in the wider world. In March 2013, the university announced it had acquired the former broadcast centre at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park which opened as a second campus in 2015. It was a member of the 1994 Group until the group was dissolved in November 2013. - Jodie Swallow ( born 23 June 1981 ) is a British triathlete from Loughborough , Leicestershire .

Lucky me got picked to sit here and play the waiting game . I had a great experience the last time I served jury duty , sitting for a murder trial , so I ' m hoping I land something just as fascinating . The only problem I have is the waiting . Why is the narrator waiting around ?","response":"The narrator, who happens to be in the Queens County Supreme Court jury room, is waiting around because he or she has been selected for jury duty. Jury duty is the civil obligation of every eligible citizen to potentially serve as a juror in a legal proceeding. Jurors are selected randomly from the community and are required to appear in court on the specified date. Part of the jury duty process involves waiting. From the alluding text, it seems like the narrator is currently at the stage of jury selection, also known as \\"voir dire.\\" This is a preliminary examination to determine whether prospective jurors are qualified to serve on a jury. The judge and the attorneys for both sides will start questioning the prospective jurors. They aim to uncover any biases that could interfere with a juror's ability to decide the case impartially or any specific conditions that could prevent them from serving. This practice, in some cases, can be time-consuming, thus leading to periods of waiting. The requirement to wait also arises because the courtroom needs to arrange all the elements needed for the trial. It includes getting all parties, including the defense and prosecution attorneys, plaintiffs, defendants, court reporters, and in many cases, witnesses, all in one place at the same time and ready to proceed. There may also be delays due to last-minute discussions, negotiations, or legal arguments before the trial commences. Additionally, there could be a dozen to hundreds of people called for jury duty on any given day. The waiting allows the court to process everyone effectively, from conducting an initial roll call to instructions about the day, and finally, the jury selection process for different trials. As such, the waiting time can be variable and lengthy. The narrator's comment about hoping to land something \\"fascinating\\" suggests that he or she is waiting to be potentially selected in a trial after the voir dire process. The mention of the \\"murder trial\\" implies a preference for complex, high-stakes cases. In summary, the combination of all these processes is why the narrator is waiting around in the jury room."},{"question":"Choose your answer from options.

Bob was a regular guy, but he believed in doing the right thing. He was rightly recognized as an epitome of decency and loyalty within his community. On the other hand, in the same town lived an arrogant woman named Diana Hempstead. She was notorious for her haughty behavior and reckless driving. It wasn't a surprise to Lakeside residents when one day she was pulled over by Herman for speeding through a pedestrian zone. Herman was a highly-respected policeman in the town. Known for his adept problem-solving skills, he was cherished for the fact that he bolstered a sense of security and peace. Coincidentally, on the same day they had a prominent visitor, a keenly anticipated dignitary was visiting Lakeside. Due to his notable stature, a superior level of security was required. Indeed, who better than Herman and Bob, Lakeside's very own dynamic duo, to shoulder this responsibility? Their unquestionable loyalty and sense of duty were sure to keep the dignitary safe.

They exposed Nabob's bluff and managed to arrest him, thereby pervading a sense of serenity and security once again in the town.

Oklahoma is the 20th-most extensive and the 28th-most populous of the 50 United States. The state's name is derived from the Choctaw words \\"okla\\" and \\"humma\\", meaning \\"red people\\". It is also known informally by its nickname, \\"The Sooner State\\", in reference to the non-Native settlers who staked their claims on the choicest pieces of land before the official opening date, and the Indian Appropriations Act of 1889, which opened the door for white settlement in America's Indian Territory. The name was settled upon statehood, Oklahoma Territory and Indian Territory were merged and Indian was dropped from the name. On November 16, 1907, Oklahoma became the 46th state to enter the union. Its residents are known as \\"Oklahomans\\", or informally \\"Okies\\", and its capital and largest city is Oklahoma City. - As general terms, Indian Territory, the Indian Territories, or Indian country describe an evolving land area set aside by the United States Government for the relocation of Native Americans who held aboriginal title to their land.

The early Spanish explorers of the mid-16th century encountered Mississippian-culture villages and chiefs. The anthropologist John Swanton suggested that the Choctaw derived their name from an early leader. Henry Halbert, a historian, suggests that their name is derived from the Choctaw phrase \\"Hacha hatak\\" (river people). - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America.

Article: Who taught you to speak English? Your parents, while you were a child? Your teacher at school? Perhaps even the BBC as a grown-up. Whoever it was, somehow you have developed an understanding of what is rapidly becoming a truly global language. There are now about 376 million people who speak English as their first language, and about the same number who have learnt it in addition to their mother tongue. There are said to be one billion people learning English now and about 80% of the information on the Internet is in English. Is this a good thing, or a bad thing? Should we celebrate the fact that more and more of us can communicate, using a common language, across countries and cultures? Or should we worry about the dangers of \\" mono-culturalism\\", a world in which we all speak the same language, eat the same food and listen to the same music?

Here are possible answers to this question: - shopping bag - hardware store - landfill - junk yard - antique store I believe the correct choice is \\"landfill\\", here's why: Answer:","response":"The correct answer to the question \\"Where is tin stored forever?\\" is indeed \\"landfill\\". To provide a comprehensive understanding of this choice, let's examine each of the provided options in detail and understand why landfill is the most appropriate answer. 1. Shopping Bag: A shopping bag is not a suitable place to store tin forever. Although a shopping bag can temporarily hold tin products or tin cans, it is not a permanent or long-lasting storage solution. Furthermore, shopping bags are designed for carrying items from one place to another, not for storing materials indefinitely. 2. Hardware Store: A hardware store is a commercial establishment where tin and its products can be purchased. It might hold tin temporarily until a customer buys it. However, the primary purpose of a hardware store is to sell items, not to store them forever. Once a tin item is sold, it will no longer be stored in the store, making this option unsuitable. 3. Landfill: Landfills are waste disposal sites where garbage, including tin products, is buried. It is the most appropriate answer to the question because when tin items are discarded, they generally end up in a landfill. Tin has low natural degradation rates, and it takes an exceptionally long time to break down. Therefore, when it is discarded in a landfill, tin can stay there for a very long period, effectively preserving it forever. It is important to note that storing tin in landfills has detrimental effects on the environment, but unfortunately, this is where items end up when discarded. 4. Junk Yard: A junkyard is a place where discarded items, including tin products, are stored and sometimes recycled. While tin materials may stay in a junkyard for a long time, the primary goal of a junkyard is to recycle and repurpose materials. If tin gets recycled, it will be transformed into new products, making the junkyard an inadequate location to store tin forever. 5. Antique Store: An antique store is a place where valuable and old items are sold. Indeed, some tin items could end up in an antique store if they are deemed historically or aesthetically valuable. However, the purpose of an antique store is to retail unique items rather than store them indefinitely. Also, not all tin products will have an antique value that deems them worthy of preservation in such stores. In conclusion, the most accurate answer to the question \\"Where is tin stored forever?\\" is landfill. Although the other options can temporarily hold tin or tin products, none of them offer a long-term or permanent storage solution. Landfills serve as the final resting place for many discarded items, including tin, where they can remain preserved for a very long time due to their low degradation rates. However, it is important to emphasize efforts to minimize tin waste production and encourage recycling to reduce the environmental impact of discarding valuable resources in landfills."},{"question":"Attributes: name = Loch Fyne, eatType = restaurant, food = Chinese, familyFriendly = yes.

Question: suppose more magma cools happens, how will it affect more magma become igneous rocks. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","response":"The process described outlines the rock cycle, a series of geological processes that continually transform rocks from one type to another. Magma plays a critical role in this cycle, as it is the source of all igneous rocks. If there were more instances of magma cooling, it would contribute to an increase in the formation of igneous rocks. To further elaborate on the impact of more magma cooling, let's examine each step of the process: 1. Magma forms through various geological processes, including volcanic eruptions and the melting of the Earth's crust or mantle due to tectonic activity. 2. When magma cools, it solidifies into igneous rocks. This process can occur either on the Earth's surface (as in volcanic eruptions) or below the surface (as in the formation of intrusive igneous rocks). The rate and the conditions at which the magma cools determine the size and types of crystals formed in these igneous rocks. 3. Over time, weathering and erosion break down these igneous rocks into smaller fragments or sediments. These sediments accumulate in layers, eventually becoming compacted and cemented together to form sedimentary rocks. 4. The combination of heat and pressure from plate tectonic movements can alter the mineral composition and structure of sedimentary rocks, transforming them into metamorphic rocks. 5. As metamorphic rocks are subjected to even more extreme temperatures and pressures, they may eventually melt and return to their original state as magma, completing the rock cycle. So, if there were more instances of magma cooling, it would result in an increase in the formation of igneous rocks (Answer A: more). This could potentially lead to a higher rate of weathering and erosion, which would break down more igneous rocks into sediments. As these sediments accumulate and become compacted, more sedimentary rocks would form. Additionally, with more plate tectonic activity generating heat and pressure, the increased number of sedimentary rocks could lead to more instances of metamorphic rock formation. In the extreme, some of these metamorphic rocks may even return to the magma state, contributing to more occurrences of magma cooling and igneous rock formation. In summary, an increased magma cooling rate would directly contribute to greater formation of igneous rocks, with a possible cascading effect on the other types of rocks involved in the rock cycle."},{"question":"An example of playing a musical instrument is strumming a guitar string School children often play a musical instrument by Possible answers: 1). sweeping thumb across elastic band over a beverage carton; 2). making rubber band chain bracelets; 3). wearing rubber bands with braces; 4). shooting rubber band with one hand;","response":"School children often play a musical instrument by Answer: 1). sweeping thumb across elastic band over a beverage carton.

Plot title: On the Beach Movie plot: The USS Charleston (SSN-704) is equipped with a caterpillar drive and is on station following a nuclear exchange, under the command of Dwight Towers. The nuclear war which contaminated the northern hemisphere was preceded by a standoff between the United States and China after the latter blockaded and later invaded Taiwan. Both countries are destroyed, as is most of the world. The submarine crew finds refuge in Melbourne, Australia, which the radioactive fallout has not yet reached (though radio communications with several radio operators farther north than Australia indicate that radiation has reached their countries and will be in Australia in a few months). Towers places his vessel under the command of the Royal Australian Navy and is summoned to attend a briefing. When Towers (Armand Assante), Australian scientist Julian Osborne (Bryan Brown) and Australian liaison officer Peter Holmes (Grant Bowler) find out there is an automated digital broadcast coming from Alaska in the Northern Hemisphere, the submarine is sent to investigate. En route, the submarine surfaces in San Francisco, where the Golden Gate Bridge has collapsed and the city shoreline is in ruins. A crew member who is from San Francisco abandons ship, planning on dying in his home city, and is left by his shipmates after it is argued that the length of time he has spent outside has already made him sick with radiation sickness. Upon reaching Alaska, Towers and his executive officer go ashore to find no survivors. Entering a house and seeing a dead family huddled on a bed, Towers thinks of his own family and what they must have gone through. The source of the automated digital broadcast is traced to a television station whose broadcast, Towers and his executive officer discover, comes from a solar powered laptop trying to broadcast a documentary via satellite.

Sentence 2: I absolutely disliked the idea of working in the dark. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","response":"Let's analyze the sentences step-by-step. Sentence 1: - The speaker says they \\"would have preferred\\" working in the dark, which indicates that they may not necessarily be against working in the dark and might even prefer it under certain circumstances. - In the latter part of the sentence, the speaker acknowledges that the opinion of a Belgian policeman doesn't carry enough weight, possibly connecting this to their preference for working in the dark. Sentence 2: - The speaker clearly expresses their opposition to the idea of working in the dark by saying they \\"absolutely disliked\\" it.

What might be the first step of the process? The answer to this question is:","response":"The first step of the process is when the caterpillar hatches from its egg and starts to eat constantly in order to grow bigger. To provide a detailed explanation of the entire metamorphosis process, we need to break down each step: 1. Egg-laying: It all begins when a female butterfly lays her eggs on the leaves of a host plant, which is the plant that will provide the necessary nutrients for the caterpillar once it hatches. These eggs are very small and typically laid in clusters or individually, depending on the butterfly species. 2. Hatching and Feeding: After a certain period, usually ranging from a few days to several weeks, the caterpillar emerges from the egg by chewing its way out. This newly-hatched larva, or caterpillar, is quite small and has an insatiable appetite. It will constantly eat the leaves of its host plant in order to grow and develop. As the caterpillar consumes food, its body grows and undergoes a series of molts, shedding its old exoskeleton to accommodate its increasing size. 3. Growth and Development: During this stage, the caterpillar will molt multiple times as it continues to grow. Depending on the species, the caterpillar may change its appearance or develop specialized features like spines or camouflage patterns to better protect itself from predators. Simultaneously, it is also internally preparing for its transformation into a butterfly, as certain cells, called imaginal discs, begin developing the structures necessary for its adult form. 4. Pupation: Once the caterpillar has reached its full size, it will enter the pupation stage, during which it forms a protective casing around itself called a chrysalis or cocoon. This is where the major transformation occurs; the caterpillar's body undergoes a process known as metamorphosis. During this phase, it completely restructures itself, breaking down its old body and reorganizing its cells to form the adult butterfly. 5. Emergence: After a period of time, which can vary widely among species and can last from several days to multiple weeks or even months, the adult butterfly is now fully formed within the chrysalis. It will then break through the protective casing and emerge as a beautiful, fully-formed butterfly. Initially, its wings are soft and crumpled, so it needs to pump fluids from its abdomen into the wings in order to expand and harden them. 6. Mating and Reproduction: As adult butterflies, their primary focus now shifts to finding a mate and reproducing, thus ensuring the continuation of their species. After mating, the female butterfly begins searching for a suitable host plant to lay her eggs, and the cycle starts anew. In summary, the first step of the process is the hatching of the caterpillar and the beginning of its constant feeding in order to grow and develop. From there, the fascinating and intricate process of metamorphosis ultimately leads to the birth of a beautiful butterfly."},{"question":"Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative (see options at the end)? on humor that is not even as daring as john ritter 's glory days on three 's company Pick your answer from: A. negative B. positive","response":"A. negative The sentiment of the sentence is negative because it compares the humor to \\"john ritter 's glory days on three 's company\\" and implies that it is not even as daring as that.

We have the equation: -66 * k = 26 * k - 17 * k + 450 First, let's simplify it by combining the terms with \\"k\\" on the right side: 26 * k - 17 * k = 9 * k (Because 26 minus 17 is 9) So now the equation looks like this: -66 * k = 9 * k + 450 Now let's move all \\"k\\" terms to one side by adding 66*k to both sides: -66 * k + 66 * k = 9 * k + 66 * k + 450 This simplifies to: 0 = 75 * k + 450 (Because -66 plus 66 is 0, and 9 plus 66 is 75) Now we want to get \\"k\\" all by itself on one side of the equation, so let's subtract 450 from both sides: 0 - 450 = 75 * k + 450 - 450 This becomes: -450 = 75 * k Now to find the value of \\"k\\", let's divide both sides of the equation by 75: -450 ÷ 75 = 75 * k ÷ 75 This gives us: -6 = k (Because -450 divided by 75 is -6) So there you go, the value of \\"k\\" is -6!"},{"question":"Add spaces between the words in the following text: Thepackageincludes:assemblyinstructions,usermanual,warrantycardbrandedwiththesealofTexassellerlistofservicecenters.","response":"The package includes: assembly instructions, user manual, warranty card branded with the seal of Texas seller list of service centers."},{"question":"I consider that to be a superficial argument, because all the fundamental decisions will in future still have to be taken by a unanimous vote in the ECOFIN Council.

Write 'true' if it's correct, 'false' otherwise. Review: I was very much looking forward to our stay at this hotel, after hearing all the good things about it. Unfortunately, it was a very underwhelming experience, to say the least. But let me begin with the things that I do like about the hotel. First off, it is located my favorite part of Chicago - the leafy, affluent part of town that is Chicago's equivalent of Manhattan's Upper East Side, complete with sidewalks, quiet tree-lined streets, real old-school townhouses (instead of ugly towering monstrosities that are 21st century condominiums), cute boutiques (instead of Gap, Banana Republic and other mainstream mass-produced brands) and, of course, Hermes of Paris (which warrants a separate mention). I also like the small intimate lobby area with old leather couches, cherry colored wooden furnitures, area rugs and distinct artwork. The very reason why I always tend to gravitate toward smaller boutique hotels instead of impersonal chains. I definitely love the room. While the space issue is not as bad in Chicago as it is in Manhattan, getting a 400-sqft guestroom for our weekend getaway is not an easy task. So we were delighted to see that our room comes with generous, ample bathroom, double sink, massive king bed AND still enough space to walk around, do a chicken dance, and strut my Herve and Louboutins in. My only reservation was the lack of natural light - the windows were definitely inadequate to allow sunlight to find its way into our 11th-floor room, but then again Delaware St is not exactly the widest street in town and there are buildings in front of us, so can't have it all! Yet one thing that really disappointed us was the service, or lack thereof. I mean, seriously. They don't call it the 'hospitality' industry for no reason. I did pay a premium to stay in smaller boutique hotels such as this so I do get a service that is a little bit more personalized than the kind that I would be getting from say, a 3000-room Vegas hotel. First, I called in to reconfirm my reservation. The lady on the phone was anything but courteous and competent. First off, she was not able to find my reservation and I was transferred to the front desk staff, to whom I had to explain myself all over again (my pet peeve when it comes to on-the-phone customer service). The person who manned the reception desk was not friendly, nor was he at all competent either. Case in point - he had to send the slip of paper on which I agree to the nightly rate and duration of stay up to the room after we checked in, which clearly indicated that he must have forgotten when we were actually down there. But the real kicker was when we ordered room service after arriving - it was about 1AM. As a general rule, I am never, ever, a big fan of room service, having had my fair share of bad food that they slap 18% gratuity, 10.5% tax (and still expect a tip) on during my days globetrotting on the company's expense account. Think overcooked steaks, lukewarm soup, bread hard enough to knock someone out, and ice-creams that are already half melted by the time it reaches your suite. So I really wasn't expecting hotels as small as Talbott to have a 24-hour room service, but lo and behold, they do. I placed an order of chicken BLT, which (to my initial delight) came in within 20 minutes. Then after the customary of the invoice and the involuntary yet customary tip of 2 on top of the 18% service fee (refer above) I opened the cover only to find something that looked like it was picked up from the garbage bin, microwaved and served on a plate with a bag of Lay's chips (lightly salted flavor). The bread looked like someone stomped on it, the L and T looked like it was 2 days old, the B was unrecognizable, and the chicken was burnt and cold. It was pathetic room service at its finest. We did get the item taken off our bill (rightfully so too) but the front desk person was, instead of apologetic, defiant. The whole thing was just very upsetting and for a hotel as high-end as this to be able to leave such a bad impression within the first hour of arriving, it's quite an accomplishment in and of itself. We won't be coming back, unfortunately.

Traditionally this has always been somewhat ad-hoc: people join a team and work on whatever they feel like. Ideas are ten-a-penny though. For most teams that work on larger projects (such as events, software, products and more) to actually be productive, coordinating this work can be complex: some projects require coordination across many people with different skill-sets, time-availability and resources. Something I would like us to work towards in the Ubuntu community is encouraging a culture of best-practise in how we plan our work and coordinate our awesome teams to work together on projects. I believe this kind of coordination can help our teams increase the opportunity for success in their work, feel more empowered and productive and provide greater insight to people outside those teams on what the team is doing. An effective way of doing this is to build a Roadmap for each cycle. This provides an opportunity to capture a set of goals the team will work together to achieve in each six-month period. This article outlines how to build such a Roadmap. While at first a roadmap can feel a little like a nod to the gods of bureaucracy, they actually possess many benefits: * Direction – one of the biggest complaints teams often report is a lack of direction. If a team gets into the habit of creating a roadmap at the beginning of a cycle, it gives the team a sense of focus and direction for the coming cycle. * Documented commitments are more effective – a common rule in Project Management training is that actions assigned to people in a shared document are more effective than ad-hoc or private commitments. By documenting who will work on what in a cycle and putting their name next to an action can help seal a sense of accountability for their contributions to the project. * Feeling of success – regularly revisiting a roadmap and...

Freedom was in the air and it was not just for people. The wall between East and West Germany had also kept a large population of wild pigs within the eastern forests of Brandenburg.The wall's falling down made it easier for the big pigs--a very big one can weigh over 300 pounds--to leave the woodlands and walk into the town. Warm winters and easy access to food have helped the population increase. Now about 10,000 wild pigs walk around Berlin. The nature of the beast has added to the boom .\\"The pigs are intelligent,\\" says Marc Franusch, a spokesman for the Berlin forestry department. \\"They learn to use the neighborhoods.They get used to people, dogs, and traffic.\\" The wild pigs tend to travel in small groups and have been found searching rubbish and gardens, feeding their piglets in the shadow of parked cars, and crossing busy roads.On average, the animals are involved in one traffic accident every day. And despite the fact that it's illegal, some Berliners have been known to give the pigs food. Though wild pigs are protected under German law, the city's forestry department is permitted to kill 2,000 of the creatures every year, targeting mostly young adult animals in forests surrounding Berlin.

These people are called \\"unemployed\\". Economists made predictions about how many people would be unemployed, but their guess wasn't perfect. To understand the difference between their guess and the real number of unemployed people, we'll need to know two things: 1. The number of unemployed people that economists thought there would be in 2011 (their estimate). 2. The actual number of unemployed people in 2011 (the real number). Unfortunately, without knowing the specific estimate and real number for 2011, I can't tell you the exact difference. However, I can help you understand why there might have been a difference between the economists' estimate and the real number. Economists base their estimates on lots of factors, like how businesses are doing and how many people usually have jobs. But sometimes, things happen that are hard to predict, or guess. For example, if a big company suddenly closes and many people lose their jobs, that might lead to more people being unemployed than the economists had guessed. In short, the number of \\"shorts\\" or the difference between economists' estimates and the actual number of unemployed people in 2011 depends on the specific numbers.

Question: suppose utlise less water happens, how will it affect MORE salt being removed from the water. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect","response":"Let's analyze each step of the process to understand the factors that affect the salt removal from the water: 1. Place the water in a pot: The amount of water placed in the first pot determines the initial salt concentration. 2. Cover the pot with a slightly too large cover: The cover allows water vapor to escape the pot and condense on the cover, leaving salt behind in the first pot. 3. Place a larger pot under the first: The second pot is used to collect the condensed water vapor. Since it does not impact the salt separation, it does not affect the amount of salt removed. 4. Heat water to evaporation: The heat energy provided to the water determines the rate at which the water evaporates. Lesser water in the first pot means it will heat up and evaporate faster. 5. Water vapor will collect on the lid: As water evaporates, it leaves salt behind in the first pot, concentrating the salt content. 6. Drip into the second pot as fresh water: The condensed water vapor, which should not contain salt, drips into the second pot. 7. Salt is left behind in the original pot: As more water evaporates, more salt is left behind in the first pot. Now let's address the question: if less water is used, how will it affect more salt being removed from the water? A: more - The evaporation rate will be faster and higher due to less water needing to be heated. This might result in more salt being left behind in the first pot as the water evaporates faster. However, the overall amount of salt removed depends on the initial salt concentration in the water. B: less - Less water ultimately means less overall volume to remove salt from, which could result in less salt removal. C: no effect - The efficiency of the process depends primarily on the initial salt concentration in the water and the rate of evaporation. Less water in the first pot may not necessarily impact salt removal if other conditions remain constant. Considering these factors, option A seems more plausible: using less water would lead to faster evaporation, which may cause more salt to be left behind in the first pot, thus removing more salt from the water. However, this conclusion assumes that the initial salt concentration remains the same, regardless of the water volume."},{"question":"Premise: \\"Unlike the great capital cities of Europe, there is no prevailing style of architecture here, no monumental core for a new building to harmonize or clash with.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"There were no creative architects to create a dominant style.\\"?","response":"Imagine you're looking at a big box of crayons with all sorts of different colors. In some places, most of the drawings use just one or two colors, like red and blue, because the people who drew them really like those colors. These are like the big cities in Europe, where most of the buildings look similar because they all follow a special style or design. Now, think about a place where the drawings have lots and lots of different colors, like green, orange, and purple. This place isn't like the cities in Europe with one main style. Instead, it has many different styles because people like to use all sorts of different colors and designs. This is the place the premise talks about where there's no one main architecture style. Now, let's think about the hypothesis that says there were no creative architects to create a dominant style. But, just because there isn't one main style, it doesn't mean that the architects weren't creative. It could mean that they were so creative that they decided to use all the different colors and designs instead of sticking to just one or two.

Given the question \\"How would you describe Bailey?\\", is \\"cares about their company\\" a valid answer? The answer is:","response":"Yes, \\"cares about their company\\" is a valid answer when describing Bailey. This is because Bailey's actions of hoping to meet a deadline and feeling pressure at work both indicate their commitment towards the success and progress of the company. These sentiments reveal that Bailey is conscientious and dedicated to their role, as well as being concerned about the possible consequences of not meeting their professional responsibilities. It is evident that Bailey does not wish to disappoint their colleagues or superiors, and instead strives to do their best in order to contribute positively to the overall functioning of the company. However, it is also important to note that while it is valid to say that Bailey cares about their company, this description may not be the only one, or even the most appropriate one, depending on other circumstances and details. In order to understand Bailey's situation better, it is necessary to delve deeper into their professional environment and personal characteristics. For instance, another valid description for Bailey might be \\"passionate about their job\\" if they show genuine interest and enthusiasm towards their work. This can be manifested through a positive attitude, proactive and creative problem-solving, volunteering for additional responsibilities, or regularly seeking feedback to improve performance. Furthermore, Bailey's stress and anxiety could be indicative of a number of other factors, such as feeling overwhelmed by the volume of work or having difficulties balancing their professional and personal life. In these cases, describing Bailey as \\"struggling with time management\\" or \\"seeking work-life balance\\" might be more appropriate. It would also be essential to address these issues and provide support, whether it is through improved task prioritization, delegation, or flexibility in scheduling. Additionally, the pressure Bailey experiences might be driven by factors such as high expectations from their manager or team, an overly competitive work environment, or simply personal ambition. In any of these cases, it would be important to foster a more supportive and collaborative atmosphere in the workplace, ensuring recognition for individual accomplishments and promoting open communication between team members. Overall, while \\"cares about their company\\" is a valid answer to describe Bailey, it is crucial to remember that it is only one of the many possible descriptions. Understanding Bailey's situation in-depth, taking into account their actions, motivations, and struggles, would allow for a more nuanced and accurate portrayal of their character and professional experience."},{"question":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

And now that we are planning both for the party of the seniors leaving and our party after the dances. we came to a conclusion that everyone should pay 20 euros so we can pay for both. And if you didn't want to take part in our party after the dance you just wouldn't pay 10 euros and not come to the party, And also if you didn't want to pay for the seniors goodbye party then you just wouldnt be able to join next year when the current second graders would pay for you. quite simple. &amp;#x200B; So now we are at the point where everything is basically figured out and done. But my friend has strong beliefs against alcoholism and didn't want to support the drinking or drink himself. I of course assumed that he would just pay his part on everything else since the was a good planning for budget and all expenses were figured out so he just wouldn't pay his part for the alcohol costs. &amp;#x200B; Here is where is was really surprised that almost everyone started to scream to him that just pay the fucking 20euros and get this done with and don't fuck around. he explained that he just felt that he wouldn't like to part of supporting heavy drinking and just not pay for the alcohol and not drink it by himself now or the next year when we get the party. even after he gave a proper explanation people still talked shit about him that \\"always like this, never willing to co-operate\\" which is partially true but in this matter I couldn't really understand why he wouldn't be able to just pay his part of the other costs like rent and food. And people kept telling him that just pay the fucking 20 euros and we can use it to buy foor and not alcohol so everyone will be happy, but as obviously terrible argument as that is because simply there would be more money to buy alcohol since someone else wouldn't pay for the food and buy more alcohol which would still support heavy drinking. &amp;#x200B; I most often can relate to other views or atleast understand them but in this case i truly can't understand why wouldn't he be able to just pay his part in other costs so he would just be able to join the party and not dring because i was basically the only one that got his back. so is my friend truly an asshole?","response":"In this situation, it seems OTHER is not entirely wrong.

Based on the information given, Remy's artwork was described as \\"just divine,\\" which implies that the outcome of her work was highly appreciated and lauded.

The excitement can be attributed to the joy and satisfaction that comes from seeing one's work being well-received, as well as the personal fulfillment that arises from successfully completing a project. In the case of this artwork, Remy's excitement could also stem from the opportunity to showcase her artistic prowess, as well as the pleasure that comes with knowing that her artistic interpretation of Casey has struck a chord with others. This sense of excitement can reinforce her motivation and passion for her craft, while also serving as a source of encouragement for her to continue developing and honing her artistic skills.

He became a highly respected and decorated Union officer, reaching the rank of brigadier general (and brevet major general). He is best known for his gallantry at the Battle of Gettysburg, for which he was awarded the Medal of Honor. Chamberlain was commissioned a lieutenant colonel in the 20th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment in 1862 and fought at the Battle of Fredericksburg. Chamberlain was born in Brewer, Maine, the son of Sarah Dupee (nee Brastow) and Joshua Chamberlain on September 8, 1828. Chamberlain was of English ancestry, and could trace his family line back to twelfth century England, during the reign of King Stephen. He was the oldest of five children. It is said that he was his mother's favorite while his father was tough on him. He was very involved in his church, mostly singing in the choir. His mother encouraged him to become a preacher while his father wanted him to join the military, but he felt a reluctance towards both options. He suffered a speech impediment until shortly after graduating from Bowdoin College. He entered Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, in 1848 with the help of a local tutor, professor William Hyde. Chamberlain learned to read Ancient Greek and Latin in order to pass the entrance exam. While at Bowdoin he met many people who would influence his life, including Harriet Beecher Stowe, the wife of Bowdoin professor Calvin Stowe. Chamberlain would often go to listen to her read passages from what would later become her celebrated novel, Uncle Tom's Cabin. He also joined the Peucinian Society, a group of students with Federalist leanings. A member of the Phi Beta Kappa academic honor society and a brother of the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity, Chamberlain graduated in 1852. He married Fanny Adams, cousin and adopted daughter of a local clergyman, in 1855, and they had five children, one of whom was born too prematurely to survive and two of whom died in infancy. Chamberlain studied for three additional years at Bangor Theological Seminary in Bangor, Maine, returned to Bowdoin, and began a career in education as a professor of rhetoric. He eventually went on to teach every subject in the curriculum with the exception of science and mathematics. In 1861 he was appointed Professor of Modern Languages. He was fluent in nine languages other than English: Greek, Latin, Spanish, German, French, Italian, Arabic, Hebrew, and Syriac. Chamberlain's great-grandfathers were soldiers in the American Revolutionary War. One, Franklin Chamberlain, was a sergeant at the Siege of Yorktown. His grandfather, also named Joshua Chamberlain, was a colonel in the local militia during the War of 1812 and was court-martialed (but exonerated) for his part in the humiliating Battle of Hampden, which led to the sacking of Bangor and Brewer by British forces. His father also had served during the abortive Aroostook War of 1839.

With the standard variation, you place your hands shoulder-width apart on the barbell, start with your elbows fully extended, and curl your arms upward to bring the barbell up to your chest. Keep your elbows fixed and back straight for proper form. This positioning and technique not only promotes an effective isolation of the bicep muscles, but it also helps minimize the risk of injury and ensures that you maintain proper posture throughout the entire movement. As you progress, consider incorporating variations such as the wide-grip or close-grip curl to target different sub-regions of your bicep and help build overall muscle mass and definition. In addition to standing barbell curls, consider adding supplementary bicep exercises into your routine to maximize your gains. Exercises like hammer curls, preacher curls, or concentration curls are great alternatives or additions that focus on the brachialis and brachioradialis muscles, further increasing the overall size and strength of the arms. To optimize muscle growth and recovery, ensure that you are following a structured training plan with proper rest periods and a balanced nutritional intake. A well-rounded routine will include exercises for other major muscle groups, in addition to your bicep-focused workouts, ensuring a proportional physique and avoiding muscle imbalances that could lead to injury. Lastly, be patient and persistent with your bicep development. Building muscle takes time and dedication, and the results will not appear overnight. By consistently focusing on proper form and technique, introducing exercise variety, and maintaining a holistic approach to training and nutrition, you can achieve impressive bicep growth and significantly improve overall upper body strength."},{"question":"The Duke Energy Center for the Performing Arts complex houses the Raleigh Memorial Auditorium, the Fletcher Opera Theater, the Kennedy Theatre, and the Meymandi Concert Hall.

He gives each student 10 index cards. He teaches 6 periods a day and each class has 30 students. If a 50 pack of index cards cost 3 how much did he spend on them all? Let's be accurate as possible.","response":"First, let's find out how many index cards Carl needs in total. He gives each student 10 index cards and each class has 30 students. So each class requires 10 * 30 = <<10*30=300>>300 index cards. Carl teaches 6 periods a day, so he needs 300 index cards * 6 classes = <<300*6=1800>>1800 index cards in total. Now, let's find out how many packs of index cards he needs to buy. A pack contains 50 index cards, so Carl needs to purchase 1800 index cards ÷ 50 index cards/pack = <<1800/50=36>>36 packs. Each pack of index cards costs 3.

Waterlogged archaeological wood can be severely damaged if it is allowed to dry and therefore must be kept constantly wet during its excavation (Photo courtesy of the Institute of Nautical Archaeology at Texas A&M; University /M. Jones) Archaeological excavations in Turkey that began in 2004 have yielded a unique historical treasure — 37 shipwrecks from the Byzantine Empire, eight of which are now described in a new report. The shipwrecks were discovered at a site called Yenikapi, in Istanbul, in what was a port of the ancient city, then called Constantinople. The ships date back to the fifth to 11th centuries, and are in exceptionally good condition, archaeologists say. \\"Never before has such a large number and types of well-preserved vessels been found at a single location,\\" said study author Cemal Pulak, of the Institute of Nautical Archaeology at Texas A&M University. The eight shipwrecks highlighted in the new report, which date from the seventh to 10th centuries, show that the shipbuilders at the time were using a more complex process than previously thought, according to the researchers. [Photos: 8 Byzantine Empire Era Shipwrecks Excavated in Turkey] Each of the ships the researchers examined in the report incorporated elements characteristic of two ship-building methods. In one method, the shell of a ship was built first, and in the other, the ship's skeleton was constructed first, and then the planks were attached. The researchers' analysis showed that a transition from a shell-first to a skeleton-first approach was already well underway by the seventh century. \\"It is through meticulous and time-consuming detective work that we slowly begin to understand how these ships were built, modified, overhauled and used,\\" Pulak told Live Science.\\"By such means, we try to understand the minds of the shipbuilders and their design and conceptualization processes, in order to better comprehend the history of science and engineering.\\" Of the eight ships that the researchers examined for the report, six were classified as \\"round ships,\\" which means that they were propelled primarily or entirely by sail. The length of the round ships ranged from 26 to 48 feet (8 to 14.7 meters), and they were between 8 and 16 feet (2.5 and 5 m) wide. The other two ships the researchers examined were galleys — long, oared ships, about 100 feet (30 m) long and 13 feet (4 m) wide. Among all of the 37 shipwrecks discovered at Yenikapi, there were a total of six Byzantine galleys, \\"notably the first shipwrecks of this type discovered from the Byzantine period,\\" the researchers wrote in their report. Previously, Byzantine galleys were known only from books and artwork dating to the time period, and such sources tend to be difficult to interpret. Therefore the well-preserved remains of these vessels at Yenikapi play a crucial role in archaeologists' study of Byzantine ships, the researchers said. Until recently, much of the information about Byzantine ships had come from the several medium-size seagoing ships that had been excavated in the Mediterranean, Pulak said. \\"Yenikapi has yielded a wide array of small rowboats, fishing boats, utility vessels and even naval ships, all directly from Constantinople itself, the capital of the Byzantine Empire,\\" he added. A large museum in Istanbul is being planned to exhibit many of the wrecks, Pulak said. But it could take several years to restore the timbers of each ship's hull, he said. The report was published online Dec. 8 in the International Journal of Nautical Archeology. Follow Agata Blaszczak-Boxe on Twitter. Follow Live Science @livescience, Facebook& Google+. Originally published on Live Science. ||||| Yenikapı Byzantine Shipwrecks Excavation and Study – Istanbul, Turkey The Yenikapı site, located in the Istanbul neighborhood of the same name, was first revealed in 2004 during the construction of a subterranean rail line and station for a new rail link between Europe and Asia. Archaeologists from the Istanbul Archaeological Museums quickly realized they had discovered the ancient harbor of Theodosius, one of Constantinople's trade harbors, built during the reign of Theodosius I (AD 379-395). A major trade center from the 4th century AD until river silt filled it in around 1500, the harbor, its stone walls, and amazingly well-preserved remnants of the port’s activities lay forgotten for centuries. Since 2004, the site has been one of the world’s largest archaeological digs. Each day, hundreds of laborers dug under the direction of the Istanbul Archeological Museums. Yenikapı’s wet soils have revealed everything from the foundations of wattle-and-daub mud huts and burials from the Neolithic period (approximately 6000 BC) to Ottoman structures, and myriad artifacts including Byzantine wooden combs and leather shoes, the bones of hard-worked dockside horses and camels, and even human skulls that may have come from criminals whose severed heads were tossed in the harbor. Archaeologists also uncovered dozens of shipwrecks and hundreds of anchors from what was once the harbor floor. Now that these excavations are nearing completion, the remains of 37 separate vessels dating from the 5th to the 11th centuries AD have emerged from the mud. The first archaeological examples of Byzantine rowed ships—almost certainly warships—as well as merchant vessels, some with cargoes, were preserved thanks to their burial in a thick layer of wet mud. The removal, documentation, conservation, and reconstruction of the Yenikapı shipwrecks have been divided between Istanbul University’s Conservation Department and the Institute of Nautical Archaeology. Eight shipwreck hulls dating from the early 7th to the late 10th centuries were turned over to INA Vice President and Texas A&M University professor Cemal Pulak by the Istanbul Archaeological Museums. With his characteristic attention to detail and meticulous scholarship, Cemal approached this formidable project with the aid of nautical archaeologists Sheila Matthews, Rebecca Ingram, Michael Jones, and Orkan Köyağasıoğlu, along with other experienced archaeologists and graduate students. This hard-working team labored for over three years through the heat and dust of summer as well as the sleet and mud of winter in an active construction site, carefully documenting and recovering the ship remains in tent-covered pits. While many of the timbers are solid and well preserved, with original tool marks and fine surface detail visible, others are weak and fragile, having the consistency of wet cardboard. It makes the job even more challenging, and yet the patience and persistence of Cemal’s team made a significant difference. Although the eight shipwrecks have been removed from the work site, research into the construction, repair, and use of these fascinating vessels continues. INA staff archaeologist Köyağasıoğlu continues his meticulous documentation of the timbers of galley YK 4 and is creating scale drawings of hundreds of stone anchors from the site. Ingram and Jones recently completed doctoral dissertations on merchantmen YK 11 (early 7th century) and YK 14 (9th century), respectively. Some of the INA team’s work is featured in the 2013 Istanbul Archaeological Museums’ exhibition, Stories from the Hidden Harbor. The Yenikapı dig was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to work with a diverse collection of hulls from this period. It also means that in time, after analysis, the work at Yenikapı will revolutionize our knowledge of shipbuilding as well as the role of maritime trade in the history of Constantinople and the later Roman Empire. Read more about the documentation of these shipwrecks in the Summer 2010 Issue of the INA Quarterly (p. 21) or the 2010 INA Annual (pp. 8-17). ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","response":"Archaeological excavations in Istanbul, Turkey, have uncovered 37 shipwrecks from the Byzantine Empire, including eight that are exceptionally well preserved and provide new insights into shipbuilding techniques of the time.

The discovery is significant due to the number and condition of the ships, revealing shipbuilders utilized more complex processes than previously thought and showing a shift in ship-building methods. The wrecks will eventually be displayed in a museum in Istanbul after several years of restoration work."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: China’s Defense Ministry said Thursday that a U.S. decision to disinvite China from a major international maritime exercise is “unconstructive.” A ministry statement said despite the decision, China will continue playing a role in “maintaining peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.” The United States announced its move Wednesday, saying Beijing’s “destabilizing behavior” in the South China Sea is inconsistent with the principles of the U.S.-led drill. “China’s continued militarization of disputed features in the South China Sea only serve to raise tensions and destabilize the region,” read a statement from Lt. Col. Christopher Logan, a Pentagon spokesman. The statement said that disinviting China from the 2018 RIMPAC is an “initial” response to Beijing’s South China Sea activities. It did not specify what other steps may be taken. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China’s activity in the South China Sea was for self-defense and that it was a “much smaller scale” than what the United States had done in Hawaii and Guam. “We hope that the U.S. will change such a negative mindset,” he said at a joint news conference with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Since 2014, China has taken part in RIMPAC, the world’s largest international maritime drill, which is held every two years in Hawaii. It’s a reflection of expanding U.S.-China military ties, despite tensions over Beijing’s construction of man-made islands in the South China Sea, some of which have been militarized. \\"We have strong evidence that China has deployed anti-ship missiles, surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems, and electronic jammers to contested features in the Spratly Islands region of the South China Sea.

Answer:","response":"The East Texas Oil Field was discovered on October 3, 1930, following the drilling of a well that led to a significant oil discovery. The well, aptly named the Daisy Bradford No. 3, was located near Turnertown and Joinerville, two small towns in Rusk County, Texas. The discovery can be attributed to the persistent efforts of independent oilman Columbus Marion \\"Dad\\" Joiner and his drilling partner A.D. \\"Doc\\" Lloyd. The duo began exploring the East Texas region during the late 1920s, believing that it held vast reserves of oil. Their initial attempts were unsuccessful, but they remained determined to find the \\"black gold.\\" The turning point for Joiner and Lloyd's fortunes occurred when they partnered with Haroldson Lafayette \\"H.L.\\" Hunt, who later became a legendary oil tycoon. With the financial backing that Hunt provided, they drilled the Daisy Bradford No. 3 well. When the well struck oil, it signaled the start of a new era in the American oil industry. The East Texas Oil Field would go on to become the largest and most productive oil reservoir in the contiguous United States. Spanning over 140,000 acres across five counties, the field would play a significant role in shaping the American economy during the subsequent decades. The discovery of the East Texas Oil Field had far-reaching consequences for both Texas and the United States. The oil boom attracted thousands of workers to the region, creating a thriving industry that supported the growth of towns and cities. Moreover, the abundance of oil drove entrepreneurship, technological advancements, and contributed to America's rise as an industrial superpower. Moreover, the discovery led to the establishment of the Texas Railroad Commission, which effectively controlled and managed oil production to prevent overproduction and waste in the industry. The East Texas Oil Field became a symbol of American ingenuity and determination, showcasing the nation's ability to tap into its natural resources and fuel its growth into the 20th century. In summary, the East Texas Oil Field was discovered on October 3, 1930, following the drilling of the Daisy Bradford No. 3 well by oilmen Columbus Marion \\"Dad\\" Joiner and A.D. \\"Doc\\" Lloyd. This discovery marked the beginning of a transformative era for the American oil industry and contributed significantly to the nation's economic expansion."},{"question":"Strict separation of powers did not operate in The United Kingdom, the political structure of which served in most instances[citation needed] as a model for the government created by the U.S. Constitution.[citation needed] Under the UK Westminster system, based on parliamentary sovereignty and responsible government, Parliament (consisting of the Sovereign (King-in-Parliament), House of Lords and House of Commons) was the supreme lawmaking authority. The executive branch acted in the name of the King (\\"His Majesty's Government\\"), as did the judiciary. The King's Ministers were in most cases members of one of the two Houses of Parliament, and the Government needed to sustain the support of a majority in the House of Commons. One minister, the Lord Chancellor, was at the same time the sole judge in the Court of Chancery and the presiding officer in the House of Lords. Therefore, it may be seen that the three branches of British government often violated the strict principle of separation of powers, even though there were many occasions when the different branches of the government disagreed with each other. Some U.S. states did not observe a strict separation of powers in the 18th century. In New Jersey, the Governor also functioned as a member of the state's highest court and as the presiding officer of one house of the New Jersey Legislature. The President of Delaware was a member of the Court of Appeals; the presiding officers of the two houses of the state legislature also served in the executive department as Vice Presidents. In both Delaware and Pennsylvania, members of the executive council served at the same time as judges. On the other hand, many southern states explicitly required separation of powers. Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina and Georgia all kept the branches of government \\"separate and distinct.\\" If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Which political structure served as a model for the United Kingdom government?","response":"The political structure that served as a model for the United Kingdom government was the British constitutional monarchy, specifically the Westminster system, which was developed over centuries. The UK's political system has its roots in the Magna Carta, the 1689 Bill of Rights, the Glorious Revolution of 1688, and the gradual evolution from absolute monarchy to a more democratic parliamentary system. The Westminster system, which is a central component of the UK's political structure, is characterized by the presence of a constitutional monarch, the separation of powers among the executive, legislative, and judicial branches, and parliamentary sovereignty. The monarch, while being the head of state, has limited powers and mainly serves a symbolic and ceremonial role. In the UK, the executive powers are vested in the government headed by the Prime Minister, who is the leader of the majority party in the House of Commons. The legislative power is held by the Parliament, which consists of two houses: the House of Commons and the House of Lords. The judiciary in the UK functions independently of the executive and legislative branches. Although the UK Westminster system does not adhere to a strict separation of powers, it is balanced by checks and balances, ensuring that no single branch dominates the other. It is important to note that the UK does not have a codified constitution, unlike the United States, and relies on various statutes, conventions, and historical documents to guide its governance. While the U.S. Constitution was influenced by the political structure of the United Kingdom, it sought to address the shortcomings of the UK system by implementing a strict separation of powers among the three branches of government, as well as by adopting a federal system, which divides powers between the national government and individual states. This served as a means to limit the concentration of power and protect individual liberties."},{"question":"Copper recoups losses London Metal Exchange (LME) copper recouped earlier losses to finish Wednesday #39;s open outcry trade unchanged, getting little direction from a mixed set of US economic data.

Physical reasoning requires an understanding of the principles of physics and mechanics, as well as the ability to visualize, predict, and manipulate objects and their behavior under varying conditions. Such a task should push a person to apply their knowledge of basic laws of motion, force, and energy while considering factors like weight, friction, momentum, and more. One example of such a task is designing and building a Rube Goldberg machine. A Rube Goldberg machine is a deliberately complex contraption that is designed to perform a simple task using a chain reaction of interconnected components. Building a Rube Goldberg machine requires the participants to put their physical reasoning skills to work by understanding and applying the principles of mechanics, engineering, and physics. Here are some key elements the task should encompass: 1. Define a simple goal: The task should have a clear, straightforward objective, such as turning on a light, popping a balloon, or closing a door. 2. Encourage creativity: Participants should have the freedom to use a range of materials and components that inspire creative thinking and problem-solving. This can include everyday objects like dominoes, pulleys, levers, gears, marbles, or anything they can imagine. 3. Apply basic physics principles: The task should push the participants to demonstrate their understanding and application of essential physics concepts, such as gravity, force, energy conservation, and momentum. 4. Appropriate complexity: The task should have a balanced level of complexity, challenging participants not only to think about individual components but also consider how they will interact within the broader system. This encourages them to analyze, predict, and troubleshoot potential issues. 5. Collaboration: If applicable, teamwork can be encouraged by dividing the task into smaller sub-tasks, assigning different roles to participants, and promoting communication and collaboration to achieve the common goal. 6. Time constraint: Introducing a time limit can add an extra layer of challenge, prompting the participants to think and work efficiently while managing resources and prioritizing essential aspects. 7. Iterative process: As with any engineering or problem-solving task, the process of designing and building a Rube Goldberg machine should be iterative, giving participants the opportunity to test, analyze, and refine their designs. 8. Evaluation: Finally, the task should have a clear method of evaluation, whether it is measuring the success of the contraption in achieving the defined goal, assessing the creativity and ingenuity of the design, or considering the efficient use of materials and time. By incorporating these elements, a task that tests someone's ability to perform physical reasoning will be engaging, challenging, and educational, ultimately providing a rich learning experience related to critical thinking and real-world problem-solving."},{"question":"lauriska , 26 years old, kirby hill, united kingdom Can you repeat this sentence, but capitalize it correctly?","response":"Lauriska, 26 years old, Kirby Hill, United Kingdom"},{"question":"Premise: Looking north from the high ground of the Old Town, the first street you can see is Princes Street.

Based on their new study, it could hurt your hearing. How does one go about studying such a thing? Well, scientists at the McGill University Auditory Sciences Laboratory who suspected certain substances hurt the ear's ability to recover exposed a group of female albino guinea pigs to 110-dB \\"pure tone sound\\" (the equivalent of a rock concert) for a full hour on two occasions, reports the McGill Reporter. Half were given 25mg/kg of caffeine for 15 days, while the other half went without. A day after listening to the sound, both groups showed similar hearing impairment. But after eight days, the caffeine-free group's hearing had recovered almost completely, whereas the caffeine group still had difficulty. \\"Our research confirmed that exposure to loud auditory stimuli coupled with daily consumption of 25mg/kg of caffeine had a clear negative impact on hearing recovery,\\" researcher Faisal Zawawi says. While the Consequence of Sound notes you can always avoid coffee or soda temporarily after a concert or other noisy encounter, those working in industries like aviation, mining, construction, and manufacturing could be doing a lot of damage to their ears without even knowing it. \\"When the ear is exposed to loud noise, it can suffer from a temporary hearing reduction, also called auditory temporary threshold shift,\\" Zawawi says. \\"This disorder is usually reversible in the first 72 hours after the exposure, but if symptoms persist, the damage could become permanent.\\" (These firefighters are suing over painful sirens.) Expand this summary.","response":"A recent study conducted by scientists at McGill University Auditory Sciences Laboratory has found that the consumption of caffeine could potentially hinder the ear's natural ability to recover from exposure to loud noises. In the study, female albino guinea pigs were exposed to 110-dB \\"pure tone sound\\" — equivalent to a rock concert — for a full hour on two occasions. Half of the guinea pigs were administered 25mg/kg of caffeine for 15 days, while the other half went without. After exposure to the sound, both groups showed similar hearing impairment. However, after eight days, the caffeine-free group's hearing had almost entirely recovered, whereas the caffeine group continued to experience difficulty. Researcher Faisal Zawawi revealed that the combination of loud auditory stimuli and daily consumption of 25mg/kg of caffeine demonstrated a clear negative impact on hearing recovery. The phenomenon of temporary hearing reduction, also known as auditory temporary threshold shift, occurs when the ear is exposed to loud noise. This disorder is usually reversible within the first 72 hours following exposure, but if symptoms persist, the damage could become permanent. While people attending concerts can avoid consuming caffeine to minimize hearing damage, individuals working in industries such as aviation, mining, construction, and manufacturing may be causing long-term damage to their ears without even realizing it if they consume caffeine regularly. The findings from this study serve as an important reminder for people who are regularly exposed to loud noises to be aware of their caffeine consumption, particularly after exposure to noise, to protect their hearing. Although more research is needed to clarify the exact link between caffeine and hearing recovery, taking steps to reduce caffeine intake after noise exposure could potentially make a significant difference in maintaining healthy hearing over time."},{"question":"graz - austria - photo gallery Can you repeat this sentence, but capitalize it correctly?","response":"Graz - Austria - Photo Gallery Step 1: Identify the proper nouns and gallery in the sentence - \\"Graz\\", \\"Austria\\", and \\"Photo Gallery\\".

The 67-year-old defeated incumbent president Dervis Eroglu, a conservative elected five years ago. He has said he would work with renewed urgency to find a peace deal on Cyprus after four decades of division. The island was divided in 1974 by a Turkish invasion staged in response to a short-lived Greek-inspired coup staged to secure a union with Greece. In 1983 the Turkish-held area declared itself the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. Peace negotiations came to a halt last October, when Greek Cypriots walked out in protest at the presence of a Turkish ship prospecting for natural gas off the island's south coast. Correspondents say that Mr Akinci is viewed as a moderate who can push forward the stalled reunification talks that are expected to resume next month. The new leader capitalised on a wave of discontent against Mr Eroglu, who failed to unite right-wing supporters. \\"We achieved change and my policy will be focused on reaching a peace settlement,\\" Mr Akinci told thousands of joyful supporters at a victory rally. \\"This country cannot tolerate any more wasted time.\\" Mr Akinci said that he had already spoken to Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades and that they had agreed to meet soon. \\"[Mr] Anastasiades and I are [of] the same generation... If we can't solve this now, it will be a tremendous burden on future generations,'' he said, pointing out that the strength of his victory was a riposte to those who accused him of selling out to Greek Cypriots.

This is important information because the length of the runway helps to ensure that the airplanes at this airport can take off and land safely.

Despite recent rumors to the contrary, Lincoln displayed no vampiric powers in his early presidency. But it is true that he could appear many places at the same time, thanks to a chemical process that seemed to borrow as much from the dark arts as from science. Disunion follows the Civil War as it unfolded. Photography was a fluid technique in 1861, in every sense. It had made rapid strides since the first inchoate smudges of a backyard in France were captured in 1826, the year that Jefferson and Adams died. (That first photo, locked in a vault in Texas, can be seen here.) Improvements followed fast and furious; the daguerreotype in 1839; the ambrotype in 1851; the tintype in 1856. The United States had no shortage of tinkerers, and like characters in Hawthorne short story, these wizards drew from science, experimenting with bits of silver, iodine and even egg whites to cheat nature out of her secrets. Hawthorne placed a daguerreotypist in “The House of the Seven Gables,” and like many other writers, believed that there was something supernatural about creating perfect portraits — “ghosts,” in his words — that would live on long after death. Who needs vampires? The process of creating ghosts was messy and slow. Photographers were artists as well as scientists, and many of the earliest pioneers, like Samuel F. B. Morse, were painters, deeply enamored with the human form. An early student of Morse’s, a failed painter with terrible vision named Mathew Brady, borrowed from both science and art as he established a thriving photography business in New York and Washington. For Lincoln, this dark technology was a godsend. Despite his penchant for making fun of his appearance, Lincoln knew that his “phiz” was instantly recognizable, all the more so after hair began to appear on it. And recognizability was an asset when all known facts relating to the government of the United States were up for grabs. Presidents have to be everywhere and nowhere at the same time; highly visible to the public on certain stage-managed occasions, and then quite invisible when there is work to be done. (It is still the same in 2011, when there is always an effervescent “Photo of the Day” on the White House Web site.) In the early months of his presidency, Lincoln more than tolerated his photographers; he intuitively understood that they were helping him a great deal as he tried to give the Union a face — his own. Over the spring of 1861, as the new government came into focus, so did Lincoln. It was natural that he would be drawn to Mathew Brady, the self-made man whose studio was just down Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House. Lincoln said, “Brady and the Cooper Institute made me president.” For on the same day that he gave the great Cooper Union address, in February 1860, he did something just as significant when he stopped at Brady’s New York studio for a likeness. Brady, the former painter, was not averse to certain forms of retouching (he made Lincoln’s neck less scrawny by artificially enlarging his collar), and the result was a surprisingly normal-looking candidate. Not a savage from the wilds of Illinois, or a baboon, as he was often called, but a reasonable facsimile of a human being. That image was widely disseminated during the tumultuous campaign, as Americans by the thousands bought small buttons with his tintyped image affixed to them. But that was then, in the distant antebellum. Now that war had broken out, Americans needed to see their president as he actually looked that spring. In an age that was tiring of romantic clichés and simply wanted facts, the photograph was emerging as the portrait of choice. So Lincoln came to Brady. Repeatedly. He did so as soon as he arrived in Washington in late February, taking a photograph just after the wild train journey that brought him to the White House. That image was widely disseminated in Harper’s Weekly on April 27. And he did so again in May, most likely on May 16, thanks to recent research. In 2003, Thomas F. Schwartz discovered that an artist named Arthur Lumley had drawn Lincoln in the act of being photographed (one form of art capturing another), and had written the date “May 16/61” at the bottom of the page. The images that resulted from that session, his first serious sitting as president, are striking. This is not a teller of jokes, or an escapee from the back woods. What the English journalist William Howard Russell called his “wild republican hair” has been subdued and rests in place. He sits regally in an elegant chair – a chair, in fact, that Lincoln had given to Brady, after having rescued it from the House of Representatives. It was likely his former chair when he was a representative. The mood is somber, serious, and intense at times. He is no longer a mere politician — this is the president of the United States. These six images, presented above courtesy of the Meserve-Kunhardt Foundation, show a variety of moods and shadings. They show him standing and sitting, in profile and staring straight at the camera and the nation behind it. One striking image shows him deep in thought, seated like the Rodin sculpture “The Thinker,” which would not be cast until 1902. He was perhaps reflecting on the great message to the American people that he was in the act of writing, which would be released on July 4. It is impossible to know, precisely, which problem he was thinking about — he had more than his share. But in all of these photographs, there is one trait that dominates. There is no equivocation. The Lincoln that emerges from the shadows is a force of nature, who looks like he could break an assailant in half. John Hay wrote of his ability to overwhelm a visitor: “He looked through the man to the buttons on the back of his coat.” We feel that force in these images, particularly in the photograph that is broken, almost as if by the strain of trying to capture him. In so many other portraits, Lincoln displays the passive body language of a man of peace, responding to events rather than initiating them. Here he leans forward, taut, belligerent. This is no spectator. Of course, he was never captured entirely. Many contemporaries wrote of the inadequacy of his portraits. John Nicolay said it perfectly: Graphic art was powerless before a face that moved through a thousand delicate gradations of line and contour, light and shade, sparkle of the eye and curve of the lip, in the long gamut of expression from grave to gay, and back again from the rollicking jollity of laughter to that serious, far-away look that with prophetic intuitions beheld the awful panorama of war, and heard the cry of oppression and suffering. There are many pictures of Lincoln; there is no portrait of him. Walt Whitman wrote something similar: Probably the reader has seen physiognomies (often old farmers, sea captains, and such) that, behind their homeliness, or even ugliness, held superior points so subtle, yet so palpable, making the real life of their faces almost as impossible to depict as a wild perfume or fruit taste, or a passionate tone of the living voice — and such was Lincoln’s face, the peculiar color, the lines of it, the eyes, mouth expression. Of technical beauty it had nothing — but to the eye of a great artist it furnished a rare study, a feast and fascination. The current portraits are all failures — most of them caricatures. But on this May day in 1861, he came closer than usual. Between the White House and the Capitol, Lincoln and Brady advanced the idea of representative democracy in their own way, by representing the leader of the government to the American people. In so doing, they created six indelible images of a nation girding itself for the struggle to come. Sources: James Mellon, “The Face of Lincoln”; Philip B. Kunhardt III, Peter W. Kunhardt, Peter W.

Choices: - stationary fluid - hydrothermal fluid - impregnation fluid - supercritical fluid A: The answer to this question is:","response":"- Supercritical Fluid A supercritical fluid is the phase that exists when all the water in a container has physical properties intermediate between those of the gaseous and liquid states. In this unique state, the supercritical fluid possesses properties of both liquids and gases, making it highly valuable in scientific and industrial applications. To understand the concept of supercritical fluids, it's essential to know the critical points of a substance. The critical point is the temperature and pressure at which the distinction between the liquid and gaseous phases of a substance ceases to exist. Above the critical point, a substance is in its supercritical state, commonly referred to as a supercritical fluid. For water, the critical point occurs at a temperature of 647.1 kelvins (374°C or 705.2°F) and a pressure of 22.1 MPa (3,206 psi or 218.3 atm). When water is heated and pressurized above these values, it becomes a supercritical fluid and exhibits properties of both liquids and gases. Some key properties shared by supercritical fluids include: 1. Density: While not as dense as liquids, supercritical fluids are denser than gases, allowing them to dissolve and transport substances more effectively than gases. This property makes supercritical fluids ideal for use in processes like extraction, where solvents are required to dissolve and carry substances from one phase to another. 2. Viscosity: Supercritical fluids have lower viscosity than liquids, enabling them to flow through porous materials more efficiently. This characteristic enables supercritical fluids to be used in enhanced oil recovery, where they can penetrate and recover oil from reservoirs that would be difficult for conventional liquid solvents. 3. Diffusivity: The rate at which substances diffuse in supercritical fluids is higher than in liquids, but lower than in gases. This means that substances can move more freely within supercritical fluids, making them excellent for applications like chemical reactions where efficient mixing of reactants is necessary. 4. Compressibility: Supercritical fluids are highly compressible, meaning their density can be significantly altered by changes in pressure. This property allows researchers and engineers to fine-tune the solubility and transport capabilities of supercritical fluids, optimizing them for specific applications. Some common applications of supercritical fluids include: - Supercritical fluid extraction (SFE): A widely-used technique for extracting and purifying substances from natural sources, plant materials, and food products. Common examples include the extraction of essential oils, caffeine removal from coffee beans, and producing decaffeinated tea. - Supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC): A separation technique that uses supercritical fluids as the mobile phase. SFC is particularly useful for separating complex mixtures of compounds, such as pharmaceuticals and chemical substances. - Enhanced oil recovery: In this application, supercritical fluids are injected into oil reservoirs to improve the recovery of petroleum products. The low viscosity, high diffusivity, and solubility properties of supercritical fluids allow them to improve the flow of oil and enhance extraction efficiency. - Supercritical fluid dyeing: A process that uses supercritical fluids, typically carbon dioxide, to dye textiles, while reducing the environmental impact of traditional dyeing methods. In summary, a supercritical fluid is the phase that occurs when water reaches a temperature and pressure beyond its critical point, exhibiting properties intermediate between those of liquids and gases. Supercritical fluids possess unique properties that make them invaluable in various scientific and industrial applications, such as extraction, chromatography, and enhanced oil recovery."},{"question":"Teacher:In this task, you are given a sentence from the Bible in Persian, and your task is to translate it into English.

He saw now that the fire of that final night's battle, now fifteen days past, had left no structure standing but the stone keep. Inside the limestone walls stood forlorn, crude shelters made of tent cloths spread over blackened beams. Cries of farewell and loud wailing came from the battlements above and from the open gateway, as the condemned emerged from the fortress, a long line of men and women in black. Roland's heartbeat broke its rhythm. During the fifteen days of grace granted under the terms of surrender, he had waited in camp with the other crusaders. Now that Diane and Perrin were safely off on the road to Paris, he felt impelled to be with the Cathars in their final moments, to bear witness. He had volunteered, despite his dread, to help escort the prisoners to their execution. Those Cathars who joined the Catholic religion would now be allowed to leave in peace, though they would be forced to give everything they owned to the Church and wear the yellow crosses for the rest of their lives. But those who clung to their faith would die. As the Cathars emerged, a man-at-arms directed each to stop at a table beside the doorway, where two Dominican friars sat with parchment scrolls. The friars recorded the name of each person about to die. This meticulous record-keeping, Roland thought, was one source of the Inquisition's power. At the head of the procession was the Cathar bishop. Bertran d'en Marti's head glowed with the red-gold rays of the low afternoon sun striking his white hair, as if it were already enveloped in flames. \\"Form around them,\\" called the leader of Roland's party. Roland reluctantly stepped forward with the other crusaders. His longsword and dagger swung heavy at his waist. He wore them only because, as a knight, he was expected to. He had left his helmet and mail shirt back in his tent. What did the friars record on their parchment scrolls? - terms of surrender - names of prizoners to die - not enough information - something religious. Answer:","response":"The friars at the table beside the entrance were meticulously recording the names of each person about to die on their parchment scrolls. This record-keeping was one of the vital sources of the Inquisition's power, as it allowed the Catholic Church to keep track of those who remained defiant in their faith and those who had converted to Catholicism. The parchment scrolls served as a testament to the Church's unrelenting pursuit of rooting out heresy and maintaining complete control over the religious beliefs of its followers. The Cathar prisoners were given a choice: to abandon their faith and join the Catholic religion, or to face execution for continuing to hold onto their heretical beliefs. Those who chose to convert would be allowed to leave in peace, but they would have to forfeit all their possessions to the Church, and wear the yellow crosses for the rest of their lives. This was a way for the Church to publicly mark and identify the converted heretics, ensuring that they would always be treated with suspicion and constant vigilance by other members of the community. The terms of surrender were enforced by the Dominican friars and the accompanying crusaders. As each prisoner approached the table where the friars sat, they made their choice, either to abandon their faith or to embrace their fate and face execution. The friars recorded these decisions on their scrolls, ensuring that the Church was aware of the fate of each Cathar, allowing them to maintain an iron grip on the spread of heretical beliefs and maintain their position of religious authority in medieval Europe. The meticulous documentation of the names and fates of the Cathars highlights the ruthlessness of the Inquisition and the lengths that the Catholic Church was willing to go to eradicate any dissent or heresy. The parchment scrolls served as a symbol of the Church's determination to maintain control over the spiritual lives of its followers, ensuring that no heretical beliefs could challenge its dominance and threaten the spiritual order it sought to impose."},{"question":"Definition: In this task, you are given an input list.

What is ranch dressing made of? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","response":"Well, those questions are not exactly the same but they are quite closely related. When you ask, \\"Is ranch dressing good for you?\\", you're wondering about how healthy or beneficial ranch dressing might be. So, if I were to answer that, I would try to explain how it depends on how much of it you eat, because while it has some healthy ingredients, it also has quite a bit of fat and calories. Now, when you ask \\"What is ranch dressing made of?\\", you are asking about the ingredients that go into making ranch dressing. Ranch dressing is usually made of buttermilk, salt, garlic, onion, mustard, herbs, and spices mixed into a sauce based on mayonnaise or another oil emulsion. So while the two questions relate to ranch dressing, the first is about its health impact, and the second is about its ingredients."},{"question":"Student: Given the sentence \\"A man spending time with his toddler son.\\" is it true that \\"Who is holding a white cup.\\"?.

As a result of this conflict, Italy captured the Ottoman Tripolitania Vilayet , of which the main sub-provinces were Fezzan, Cyrenaica, and Tripoli itself. These territories together formed what became known as Italian Libya. During the conflict, Italian forces also occupied the Dodecanese islands in the Aegean Sea. Italy had agreed to return the Dodecanese to the Ottoman Empire in the Treaty of Ouchy in 1912 Treaty of Lausanne). However, the vagueness of the text allowed a provisional Italian administration of the islands, and Turkey eventually renounced all claims on these islands in Article 15 of the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne. Although minor, the war was a significant precursor of the First World War as it sparked nationalism in the Balkan states. Seeing how easily the Italians had defeated the weakened Ottomans, the members of the Balkan League attacked the Ottoman Empire starting the First Balkan War before the war with Italy had ended. The Italo-Turkish War saw numerous technological changes, notably the airplane. On October 23, 1911, an Italian pilot, Captain Carlo Piazza, flew over Turkish lines on the world's first aerial reconnaissance mission, and on November 1, the first ever aerial bomb was dropped by Sottotenente Giulio Gavotti, on Turkish troops in Libya, from an early model of Etrich Taube aircraft. The Turks, lacking anti-aircraft weapons, were the first to shoot down an aeroplane by rifle fire. Which treaty was signed last, Lausanne or Ouchy?","response":"The last treaty that was signed was the Treaty of Lausanne. The Treaty of Ouchy was signed in 1912, while the Treaty of Lausanne was signed in 1923."},{"question":"Read this article and answer this question Exceptions to this claimed general rule were the Lancastrian looting of Ludlow after the largely bloodless Yorkist defeat at Ludford Bridge in 1459, and the widespread pillaging carried out by Queen Margaret's unpaid army as it advanced south in early 1461. Both events inspired widespread opposition to the Queen, and support for the Yorkists. Many areas did little or nothing to change their city defences, perhaps an indication that they were left untouched by the wars. City walls were either left in their ruinous state or only partially rebuilt. In the case of London, the city was able to avoid being devastated by convincing the York and Lancaster armies to stay out after the inability to recreate the defensive city walls. Few noble houses were extinguished during the wars; in the period from 1425 to 1449, before the outbreak of the wars, there were as many extinctions of noble lines from natural causes as occurred during the fighting from 1450 to 1474. The most ambitious nobles died and by the later period of the wars, fewer nobles were prepared to risk their lives and titles in an uncertain struggle. The kings of France and Scotland and the dukes of Burgundy played the two factions off against each other, pledging military and financial aid and offering asylum to defeated nobles and pretenders, to prevent a strong and unified England from making war on them. What happened second: Yorkist defeat at Ludford Bridge or widespread pillaging by Queen Margaret?","response":"The Yorkist defeat at Ludford Bridge happened first, followed by the widespread pillaging carried out by Queen Margaret's unpaid army. The Ludford Bridge incident took place in 1459, which led to the Lancastrian looting of Ludlow. In contrast, the widespread pillaging by Queen Margaret's army occurred as it advanced south in early 1461. These events played a significant role in inspiring opposition to the Queen and increasing support for the Yorkists."},{"question":"Parlamentul şi-a exprimat deja opinia privind acest subiect, atât prin adoptarea unei rezoluţii care cuprinde propunerile noastre, cât şi prin adoptarea propunerii Comisiei de a extinde perioada de intervenţie pentru laptele praf şi unt, la care am adăugat cererea pentru măsura privind depozitarea privată a brânzeturilor.

Teacher: Let's think:","response":"The hypothesis \\"The person is performing the ice-bucket challenge\\" is not entailed by the premise \\"A person is taking a blue bucket full of water and pouring it over themselves.\\" The reason for this is that there could be other reasons for a person to pour water over themselves besides participating in the ice-bucket challenge. For example, the person could be: 1. Cooling off on a hot day 2. Participating in a water-related game or activity 3. Washing themselves outdoors 4.

Here are possible answers to this question: - wedding - fraternity house - friend's house - school - bar I believe the correct choice is \\"fraternity house\\", here's why:","response":"To determine the correct choice, let us analyze each option in relation to the question and compare them: 1. Wedding: While it is possible for friends to get drunk at a wedding, it is not very likely that they would attend a wedding and then return to their sorority. This option seems less likely than others. 2. Fraternity house: This option makes a lot of sense. A fraternity house is a place where college students often gather to party and socialize. It is likely that the two friends would go to a fraternity house to party and get drunk before returning to their sorority. 3. Friend's house: Though it is possible for them to party and get drunk at a friend's house, the context of the question suggests that they were attending an event or gathering, which would be more likely to occur at a location like a fraternity house rather than a friend's house. 4. School: It is not very likely that the two friends would drink and party at their school before returning to their sorority, as most schools have strict rules against alcohol consumption on campus. 5. Bar: While it's definitely possible for friends to get drunk at a bar, the context of the question seems to suggest a party or gathering which is more synonymous with college events like those that occur at a fraternity house. Based on this analysis, I also agree that the correct choice is \\"fraternity house\\". This is because the context of the question implies a college setting, and fraternity houses are more likely to host parties and gatherings where college students would drink and socialize. Additionally, the close proximity of fraternity and sorority houses on college campuses makes it likely that the two friends would return to their sorority after attending a party at a fraternity house."},{"question":"Give a stream of consciousness and then the final answer.

Page, who was still struggling with his health issues and had stated that his interest was in working with the group's original line-up, was subsequently asked to extend his stay until the end of the year so he would leave alongside Cook and Fatt, to which he agreed. Cook reported that the original members were confident that the new group would be accepted by the fans because they passed on their founding concepts of early childhood education to Watkins, Gillespie, and Pryce. The new members, like Moran, who was not approached to return, were salaried employees.The group, for their farewell tour, visited 8 countries and 141 cities, for a total of almost 250 shows in over 200 days for 640,000 people. Watkins, Gillespie, and Pryce wore \\"In Training\\" T-shirts, and debuted the song \\"Do the Propeller!\\" during these concerts. The final televised performance of the original band members, along with the new members, was on 22 December 2012, during the annual Carols in the Domain in Sydney.

This action signifies that he is content with the process and it was a success. Option A (closes the contact lens and puts it back into the contact) contradicts the previous action of the man taking a contact from a new package, and it doesn't make sense to take out and then put the contact lens back in the package without inserting it. Option C (uses the contact lens to look at something) is somewhat plausible, but it doesn't provide a clear indication of the man's emotions or satisfaction after inserting the contact lens. Option D (sits the contact into his eye then puts it on) is repetitive and doesn't advance the scenario, as the man has already inserted the contact lens into his eye."},{"question":"Answer the following question given this paragraph: Dehydration and hydrolysis reactions are catalyzed, or “sped up,” by specific enzymes; dehydration reactions involve the formation of new bonds, requiring energy, while hydrolysis reactions break bonds and release energy. These reactions are similar for most macromolecules, but each monomer and polymer reaction is specific for its class. For example, in our bodies, food is hydrolyzed, or broken down, into smaller molecules by catalytic enzymes in the digestive system. This allows for easy absorption of nutrients by cells in the intestine. Each macromolecule is broken down by a specific enzyme. For instance, carbohydrates are broken down by amylase, sucrase, lactase, or maltase. Proteins are broken down by the enzymes pepsin and peptidase, and by hydrochloric acid. Lipids are broken down by lipases. Breakdown of these macromolecules provides energy for cellular activities. Q: Lipids are broken down by what?

What is this text about?","response":"This text is about a statement made by SOCCEROOS' coach, Frank Farina, regarding the impact of Harry Kewell's return on the team's performance for an upcoming match against the Solomon Islands. To give a detailed analysis, we must first understand the context in which this statement was made. The SOCCEROOS refers to Australia's national soccer team. Frank Farina, who was the head coach for the team, expressed that the return of the renowned player Harry Kewell had boosted the team's morale and improved their overall performance. Kewell had likely been away from the team due to injury or personal reasons, and his comeback was seen as a positive development by the coach. The term \\"dead rubber\\" in the text indicates that the match against the Solomon Islands was a game with little to no significance in terms of overall standings or qualifications – it could be because either the teams' fates in a tournament or qualifier had already been decided, or this game had lesser weightage on the final outcome. Despite the match being a dead rubber, Frank Farina believed that Kewell's return reinvigorated the team and thus, this game still held importance for the SOCCEROOS as an opportunity to experiment with strategies and boost the players' confidence, especially with an influential player like Harry Kewell back on the pitch. In conclusion, this text discusses the significance of Harry Kewell's return to the SOCCEROOS, as perceived by their coach, Frank Farina. Farina believed that Kewell's involvement in their upcoming \\"dead rubber\\" match against the Solomon Islands had breathed new life into the team, raising their spirits and improving their performance, even though the match itself may not have had a major impact on their overall standings or qualifications."},{"question":"Generate an approximately fifteen-word sentence that describes all this data: Fitzbillies eatType restaurant; Fitzbillies priceRange less than £20; Fitzbillies area city centre; Fitzbillies familyFriendly no","response":"Fitzbillies, a city centre eatery, offers delectable dining options under £20, tailor-made for adults seeking non-family-friendly ambiance."},{"question":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

The police tell Mildred that the murderer is her first husband, Bert Pierce, after he is interrogated and confesses to the crime. Mildred protests that he is too kind and gentle to commit murder, and reveals her life story to the investigating officer in flashback. Mildred and Bert are unhappily married. Mildred must bake and sell pies and cakes to support the family after Bert splits with his business partner, Wally Fay. Bert bitterly accuses Mildred of favoring their daughters, especially Veda, over him. Their quarrel intensifies after a phone call from Bert's mistress, Maggie Biederhof, and they decide to separate. Mildred retains custody of her two daughters, the 16-year-old Veda, a bratty social climber and aspiring pianist, and 10-year-old Kay, a tomboy. Mildred's principal goal is to provide material possessions for Veda, who longs for a social status above that of her family and is ashamed of her mother's work as a baker. When Mildred is forced to take a job as a waitress, she tries to hide the fact from Veda, but Veda learns the truth and treats her mother with derision. Mildred meets Monte Beragon, a Pasadena society playboy and heir whose inheritance is almost depleted. Beragon owns the building that Mildred wants to purchase for a restaurant, and he pursues a romantic interest in her. While the two are at his beach house during a weekend jaunt, Kay contracts pneumonia and dies after a trip with Veda and Bert. Mildred channels her grief into work and throws herself into opening a new restaurant. With the help of her friend and former supervisor, Ida Corwin, Mildred's restaurant is a success.

Instead, it's purposeful practice. Top performers spend more hours practising their craft. If you wanted to picture how a typical genius might develop, you'd take a girl who possessed a slightly above average language ability. It wouldn't have to be a big talent, just enough so that she might gain some sense of distinction. Then you would want her to meet, say, a novelist, who coincidentally shared some similar qualities. Maybe the writer was from the same town, had the same family background, or shared the same birthday. This contact would give the girl a vision of her future self. It would give her some idea of a fascinating circle who might someday join. It would also help if one of her parents died when she was 12, giving her a strong sense of insecurity and fuelling a desperate need for success. Armed with this ambition, she would read novels and life stories of writers without end. This would give her a primary knowledge of her field. She would be able to see new writing in deeper ways and quickly understand its inner workings. Then she would practise writing. Her practice would be slow, painstaking and error-focused. By practising in this way, she delays the automating process. Her mind wants to turn conscious, newly learned skills into unconscious, automatically performed skills. By practising slowly, by breaking skills down into tiny parts and repeating, she forces the brain to internalize a better pattern of performance. Then she would find an adviser who would provide a constant stream of feedback, viewing her performance form the outside, correcting the smallest errors, pushing her to take on tougher challenges. By now she is redoing problems--how do I get characters into a room--dozens and dozens of times.

Just as Christianity introduced Mediterranean culture into northern Europe, so Buddhism brought Chinese culture into Japanese society. Throughout the seventh and eighth centuries numerous Japanese monks, scholars, and artists made the perilous trip west across the Sea of Japan to study Chinese religion, history, music, literature, and painting — later to be brought back for further development in Japan. An outstanding figure of this time was Prince Shotoku, who in 604 developed the \\"Seventeen-Article Constitution,\\" outlining a code of human conduct and the ideals of state as a basic law for the nation. He also established relations with the Sui dynasty in China. Through him, the Japanese imperial court developed Chinese patterns of centralized government, with its formal bureaucracy of eight court ranks. The Chinese calendar was used to calculate the year of Japan's foundation by counting back the 1,260 years of the Chinese cosmological cycle. Thus, 660 b.c. is still the official date celebrated nationwide. At this early stage in its history Japan was already (for the most part) only nominally ruled by the emperor. De facto power was exercised by the militarily and economically strongest family. The Sogas had promoted Buddhism as an imperially sanctioned counterweight to the native Shinto religion, along with the new Chinese customs, to weaken the influence of their more conservative rivals. But they in turn were ousted in a.d. 645 by Nakatomi Kamatari, founder of the great Fujiwara clan, which was to rule Japanese affairs for hundreds of years and provide prominent advisers to the emperor even up to the 19th century. Question: \\"Who established relations with China's Sui Dynasty?\\" Answer: \\"Nakatomi Kamatari\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","response":"No, the answer to the question is incorrect. The correct answer is: Prince Shotoku established relations with China's Sui Dynasty."},{"question":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: People have always wanted to speak with animals. There are many books about this, especially children books. Now there are also movies, such as Dr. Doolittle. When you watch animals, it seems clear that they can communicate with each other. Many people wonder why people can't also communicate with them. Scientists know how some animals communicate. Bees, for example, use their bodies. They do a kind of dance to give information about food. Birds, on the other hand, share information with sounds. They use certain sounds to protect their homes and to stay together when they fly. Some male birds use lovely songs to attract a female . Other animals communicate with both body movements and sounds. For example, dogs wag their tails when they are happy, and they bark when they are excited. People used to think it was possible to teach human language to animals. Parrots and other birds, for example, can learn to say words. But the birds just repeat the words. They don't understand them. Some American scientists tried to teach English to chimpanzees , close s of human beings. However, this was impossible. Chimpanzees can't move their mouths the right way. They could never learn to speak like people. Then scientists tried to teach human language to chimpanzees in other ways. Some tried with American Sign Language (ASL). Others tried with a simple computer. But chimpanzees could only learn to use a few words. They could never learn to use grammar. Their brains are very different from the brains of human beings. Now some scientists are studying the same points between human and animal language. In fact, some animals use sounds like people do. Dogs, for example, use an unpleasant, low sound to tell other dogs to stay away. People, too, use that kind of voice to say the same things. A dog's noisy bark communicate that something is happening.

Lépine purchased a rifle on November 21, 1989, in a Checkmate Sports store in Montreal. He had told the clerk that he was going to use it to hunt small game. Lépine had been in and around the École Polytechnique building at least seven times in the weeks leading up to December 6. Lépine first sat in the office of the registrar on the second floor for a while. While there, he was seen rummaging through a plastic bag. He did not speak to anyone, even when a staff member asked if she could help him. Lépine left the office and was subsequently seen in other parts of the building before entering a second-floor mechanical engineering class of about sixty students at about 5:10 p.m. After approaching the student giving a presentation, he asked everyone to stop everything and ordered the women and men to opposite sides of the classroom.

EMBED More News Videos Tim Fleischer reports on the aftermath of the deadly storms. The National Weather Services says at least three tornadoes touched down in the New York area during powerful storms that tore through the region Tuesday , as communities across the New York area continue to assess the damage and injury toll.Two of the tornadoes were in Putnam County, while the other, an EFO tornado, struck Newburgh with winds of up to 85 mph.The storms crippled mass transit during the busy evening rush and led to widespread power outages, and so far, five deaths are being blamed on the weather.The National Weather Service said Wednesday afternoon that an EF2 tornado with estimated peak winds of 110 mph moved through a path of 100 yards in Kent, according to a preliminary survey. An EF1 tornado with estimated peak winds of 100 mph also moved through a discontinuous path of 75 yards in Patterson.Two people were killed in Newburgh, including an 11-year-old girl who died when a tree fell on her family's car as it sat in the driveway. Authorities say the girl and her mother had arrived at their Robinson Avenue home around 4:15 p.m. and were unloading the car when police say the wind caused a large tree to topple. The girl was extricated by the fire department and transported to St. Luke's Hospital, where she was pronounced dead. The mother suffered minor injuries.The victim's identity has not yet been released. The second death happened on Albany Post Road, where a woman was killed when a tree toppled onto her car.Two fatalities were also reported in Connecticut. Authorities say a person died when a tree fell on a car on Brush Hill Road in New Fairfield, and a man doing yard work at a residence at Candlewood Lake in Danbury took shelter in his pickup truck before a tree fell on top of it. Danbury Mayor Mark Boughton said a teenager suffered serious injuries when he was hit by the roof of a dugout on a baseball field.Finally, Ramapo police said an 80-year-old Chestnut Ridge woman died when her car was struck by a falling tree while traveling south on Red Schoolhouse Road just before 5 p.m.Trees toppled onto homes and cars across New Jersey, and a 100,000 show car was destroyed when a tree crushed the owner's garage in Mahwah.\\"I looked out my window and I saw my garage crushed,\\" Al Vallese said.Fortunately, the man and his family were not injured.On Jefferson Street in Passaic, a roof peeled off a nursery school with children and adults inside.

The Candlewood Lake area was heavily damaged by Tuesday's storm. Residents on Woodview Drive in Brookfield clear their street and property of downed trees on Wednesday. The Candlewood Lake area was heavily damaged by Tuesday's storm. \\"It sounded like a freight train coming through\\" said Bob Marks, \\"and it came on just like that!\\" That was just before a huge tree feel directly on his Elbow Hill Rd in Brookfield near Candlewood Lake where hundreds of trees were uprooted, snapped and twisted like dominoes after severe storms ripped through the state Tuesday afternoon and early evening leaving many without power in the southern parts of the state. \\"It sounded like a freight train coming through\\" said Bob Marks, \\"and it came on just like that!\\" That was just before a huge tree feel directly on his Elbow Hill Rd in Brookfield near Candlewood Lake where hundreds of trees were uprooted, snapped and twisted like dominoes after severe storms ripped through the state Tuesday afternoon and early evening leaving many without power in the southern parts of the state. Eversource expects to restore power by Sunday to the thousands of homes that went dark after Tuesday’s storms, which included four separate tornadoes, according to the National Weather Service. Beacon Falls, Hamden, Oxford, Southbury, Winsted and Barkhamsted were all hit by the four tornadoes. The Brookfield area was hit with a macroburst packing 110 mph winds, according to the NWS. At midday Thursday, 60,000 Connecticut homes were without power. The towns with the most outages were Bethany, Southbury, Seymour, New Fairfield and Brookfield. Craig Hallstrom, the company’s president in Connecticut and Massachusetts, said he expected power to return to most customers by midday Sunday — even in Brookfield, Newton, Danbury and Monroe, the four communities Eversource considers hardest-hit. The company has shifted crews that normally work with natural gas to clearing debirs, Hallstrom said, so that electrical crews can focus on restoring the company’s damaged grid. Two people were killed and residents are still sifting through damaged homes and businesses. The weather service dispatched teams Wednesday to survey damage in Brookfield, Danbury, New Milford, Newtown, Oxford, Ridgefield, Southbury, Winsted, Bethany, Hamden, Cheshire and Durham. “It has been determined that an EF1 tornado with estimated peak winds of 110 mph moved along a 9.5 mile path between Beacon Falls and Hamden. Numerous trees were uprooted along this path,” the weather service said in a press statement. The tornado that struck Southbury and Oxford traveled along a 4.5 mile path and had winds that reached 100 mph. The NWS said it will release its final assessment Thursday. In Danbury’s Candlewood Lake section, a man was killed after he took refuge from the storm in his truck and a tree fell on the vehicle, Mayor Mark Boughton said. A state police spokeswoman said a 41-year-old woman died when a tree fell on her car on Brush Hill Road in New Fairfield. A 3-year-old child inside the car survived. Officials closed roads as emergency crews rushed to calls of wires and trees fallen on cars and roadways. They said the clean up could take several days. Travel in several of the hardest hit communities was impossible in some places where debris and downed trees covered the roadways. Many roads were closed throughout the day Wednesday as emergency crews rushed to calls of downed live wires and large trees on cars. They said the clean up could take several days. On Wednesday night Gov. Dannel P. Malloy signed a Declaration of Civil Preparedness Emergency to assist the state and its municipalities with response and recovery efforts. The emergency order will give state agencies flexibility in assisting municipalities to respond to and recover from the damages from the storms. In addition, the Governor has directed emergency management officials to begin the initial evaluation process to determine whether the federal thresholds to request a Major Disaster Declaration from President Trump can be met, which could permit the state and its eligible municipalities to receive federal aid that can offset some of the costs of debris removal and restoration. “Yesterday’s storms caused a lot of damage to infrastructure, public facilities, and private property,” Malloy said. “We have already begun the process to collect damage costs. This declaration will provide our state and municipal agencies with additional authority to help residents in the affected towns to expedite debris removal and deal with the ongoing restoration efforts.” In the neighborhood just east of and above Candlewood Lake, the day after a suspected tornado swept through, ripping the tops off massive trees or toppling them, neighbors worked together to begin the cleanup. In some cases, there was only so much people could do. On Elbow Hill Road, Bob and Deborah Marks watched as some contractors worked to cut branches off a massive oak tree that was uprooted and fell on their house. In the backyard, every tree appeared to be down. Bob Marks went to work Wednesday morning with a reciprocating saw to try to clear a path for his dog to run outside. “How much can you do with a Sawzall?” he said. His goal Wednesday was to get the tree off the roof to ease the stress on the damaged structure. A crane was reported on the way to lift the tree, more than two feet across at its base. The Marks’ insurance company told them to get a hotel, but Bob Marks said the available rooms are too far off so he’s planning to stay home. He pointed out the damage inside and outside the house, including a joists that punched through the ceiling in the master bedroom. There’s damage elsewhere in the house too. “We’ve got to tarp it up and see if we can secure it somehow,” he said. And then he gazed out the back window at the devastation behind the house. He just looked and said nothing. Marks and his wife were both home when the storm hit. Deborah Marks was out in the garage, but could not make it back to the house because the storm was so violent. Bob Marks said he ran to close a window as the rain began. “All of a sudden I heard the crash,” he said. “The whole house shook.” In the garage, Deborah Marks said she kept hearing “pops.” She said she thought they were electrical wires. “It was the trees coming down – every tree in my backyard,” she said. “It happened in seconds.” As she watched the workmen attack the massive tree, she was in relatively good spirits. “I always wanted a skylight in my bedroom,” she said. A 100 or so yards south of the Marks house, the residents of Woodview Drive were attacking the mess the storm left behind. Their road was blocked in two places Tuesday night, but Jesse Ricciardi and a friend cut back some downed trees to allow one car to pass. Wednesday morning, Justin Luis cut the fallen trees back some more to widen the road further, then moved about 40 yards east two attack a tangle of three trees that fell across Woodview and were blocking Mario Paxinos’ driveway. He was joined by several neighbors who hauled away the logs and branches as he cut them. “He put some chewing tobacco in his mouth, started the saw and went to it,” Rick Garofalo said of Luis, a neighbor he met for the first time Wednesday. “He’s the man.” “This is a wonderful thing,’ Paxinos said. “It’s what neighbors are all about.” Garofalo was home when the storm came through and he’s convinced a tornado ripped through his neighborhood heading northwest to southeast. “It was the classic freight train sound,” he said. “You could hear it roaring through like it was coming through your house. The next sound was trees cracking.” Garofalo said he tried to watch the storm from his open garage, but ran into the house. “I’ve never been scared like that,” he said. It was incredible. It was just surreal.” And just like that, the storm was over, Garofalo said. “It was over in five minutes,” he said. Paxinos said he arrived home from work just as the storm hit. He said he pulled his car into his driveway and the trees fell right behind him. “I opened the door and ran inside the house,” he said. “I did not know about those power lines.” He was grateful to his neighbors for helping to clear the road and his driveway. Luis, the man with the saw, said after clearing some trees further up the street, he saw the cluster of fallen trees by Paxino’s house and realized many in the neighborhood were trapped. “They’re locked in. That’s not fair,” Luis said. Trees fell in his yard on Horseshoe Drive, but they aren’t blocking anything and can wait, he said. “I’ll get it so cars can get through.” Hildy Ricciardi said she knew a big storm was coming, but was stunned by what she saw. Outside “you couldn’t see. It was brown wind.“ She went to her basement for shelter. “I kept hearing bangs,” she said. She thought it was a loose storm door, but it turned out to be trees coming down. One hit her house, but she said she doesn’t think the damage is too serious. In the immediate aftermath of the storm, people in cars were stranded because of downed trees. A young mother with her two children pulled onto Woodview Drive and into Ricciardi’s driveway. She went out to the car and asked if everyone was OK. They were shaken, but physically OK. A moment later they knocked at Ricciardi’s door and she invited them in. They stayed about three hours. They talked, changed the baby’s diaper and waited for Candlewood Lake Road to be cleared so they could continue on their way home. “I gave them a glass of wine because they needed it,” Ricciardi said. Jerry Paulinsky was outside with friends and relatives clearing the fallen limbs from his yard. In the back, he looked at his 18-foot boat. A large oak branch fell and crushed it. His friend joked that he was going to offer to buy it, but figured the price should now be lower. Paulinsky laughed. “My attitude is the boat can be replaced, people cannot.” Down on Horseshoe Drive Lynn Dostilio was sweeping the front of her house. The storm shredded leaves and plastered them to anything its way – houses, cars, sheds. “Well, I can get a little bit off before it hardens and dries and before the sun bakes it on,” she said. For the shredded leaves higher up, she said she figured she’d need a power washer. Brandy Smith and her 8-year-old daughter Brianna rode out the storm in their basement. “All we heard was thump, thump, thump and we felt thump, thump, thump,” she said, although she could not figure out what made the noise. Trees fell, but none hit the house. “We’re very lucky,” Joshua Smith said. “It could have been a lot worse.” He said he was on the phone with his wife as he drove home and he thought she was exaggerating about the storm’s strength. “When I got home I apologized,” he said. On Cheshire’s Sorghum Mill Drive, Carol Skowronski had just put a “for sale” sign outside her home of 42 years before a tree came crashing through the second floor into the master bedroom. “If anyone had been in this bed they’d be dead,” she said during an interview Wednesday while standing in the bedroom. She was still taking in the devastation early Wednesday. “How ironic — I just put it on the market,” Skowronski said. “I’m heartbroken.” Strong storms moved through Connecticut Tuesday, bringing rain, hail, lightning and tornado warnings. Eversource officials said early Wednesday that they were bringing in crews from New Hampshire and across Massachusetts to assist the full complement of Connecticut-based crews. They said the company was also taking on additional tree contractors to clean roads. Tornado warnings, coupled with strong wind, rain and hail, made their way across Connecticut Tuesday afternoon, disrupting the afternoon commute and leaving a trail of downed trees, power outages and travel delays in its wake. The wild weather certainly left an impact on social media too, where... “We are estimating a multiple-day restoration day here,” said Frank Poirot, a company spokesman. “With 84,000 people still without power, we’ve got a lot of work ahead of us.” More than a dozen state roads were closed by downed wires through the day on Wednesday, officials said. At a news conference at the Brookfield Police Department at noon, Malloy said he expected power outages to last for days. “If you get it back quickly you’re one of the lucky ones,” he said. “I think there are going to be a lot of people that are going to be without power for days. … Everything that can easily be brought back has been, now we’re in for a slog.” Malloy said there were at least 1,800 damaged locations that utility crews had to repair. Malloy, who has overseen the state response to a number of severe weather events, said it would be up to meteorologists to determine whether a tornado touched down. “I’m not the weather guy but it was very severe weather,” he said. “We have had tornado experiences in Connecticut. If it proves to be a tornado that’s not an outlier.” The state Department of Transportation held crews over in anticipation of the storm and those crews were able to respond Tuesday night to clear highways and state routes that were blocked by storm debris. Violent storms swept across Connecticut Tuesday, leaving more than 100,000 homes in the dark, hundreds of roads impassable and two people dead. Here’s a look at the deadly storm by the numbers: 2 Deaths 2 Deaths At least two people were killed and many more injured when the storm swept through western Connecticut.... “It’s nothing that’s not manageable. We’ve had crews out around the state. There’s been different levels of impact as you move around the state,” said Kevin Nursick, a DOT spokesman. As the storm moved into Connecticut, the National Weather Service issued tornado warnings – meaning a tornado was occurring or about to occur – in five of the state’s eight counties. The NWS will spend the next few days determining whether a tornado actually hit the state, or if it was simply a violent thunderstorm. Two residents of Brookfield, however, said they thought they saw the funnel of a tornado early Tuesday evening. The weather service said a rare weather event was recorded Tuesday when the rapid drop in air pressure caused what its known as a “meteotsunami,” or a large wave created by this change in weather. The Pine Grove at Quinnipiac University was devastated by Tuesday's storm. The Pine Grove at Quinnipiac University was devastated by Tuesday's storm.

In Danbury, a teen was badly injured when he was struck by the roof of a dugout on the baseball field at Henry Abbott Technical High School. Powerful winds apparently peeled the roof off the dugout, Boughton said. “He’s banged up pretty good,” Boughton said. “It’s very serious.” In Brookfield, a man and woman suffered nonlife threatening injuries when a tree fell on them while they were walking along the Still River Greenway, according to Brookfield First Selectman Stephen C. Dunn. The couple crawled to the nearby police station where they got first aid, but police officials said it took a long time to get them an ambulance as roads were largely blocked. “It’s a real mess,” Dunn said Tuesday night of the damage in Brookfield, which prompted him to declare a local emergency. “It’s the worst I’ve ever seen it. There are literally hundreds of trees down, wires down, many roads are impassable. Most of our roads are impassable.” By morning, Dunn said the situation remained dire. He said all of the roads in town had downed wires and that there was a citizen corps in some neighborhoods out with chainsaws to make roads passable. Police officials said they have 160 personel from roughly 20 agenices in town to help, including the state’s Urban Search and Rescue Team, as well as emergency EMS and fire task forces. Many were out through the night checking on the well-being of residents trapped by the downed trees. The DOT dispatched six front-end loaders and three tree crews to help crews access areas of Brookfield, but officials said travel is limited and people should remain in their homes. “It just came so quickly, all of the sudden it go dark and super, suiper windy,” said Amanda Koschell of Woodview Drive. When it started, she took her 4-month-old infant into the basement. When they came back up after the storm passed, the damage was apparent. “We went upstairs and all we could see was green everywhere,” Koschell said of discovering a tree in the living room and kitchen. Debbie Demander was with her husband and son Lars in a greenhouse on their farm when the storm hit in Bethany Tuesday evening. The farm, Clover Nook Farm, has been in the family’s name for 253 years. Two barns have been leveled because of different storms, including what the family calls their storage barn — the horse barn. Debbie Demander, the seventh generation farmer, said they saw the warning for the storm and the three went out to batten down some of the tarp flaps of the greenhouse. Another greenhouse next lifted up and landed on the corner of the one they were in. As they ran across Fairwood Road to their home, Debbie said she saw the barn starting to lean and then fell. Lars said he fell down in the yard and was dragged “like a rag doll.” Another barn on the farm was leveled from a hurricane in 1938, Debbie said. In addition to the barn, a chicken coop was dragged and destroyed — the chicken and other animals, including beef cattle, lambs and goats were all OK, they said. “It’s gonna be a long summer,” Lars said. “It’s a bad way to start the growing season.” On Sorghum Mill Drive in Cheshire, a tree fell into a house, crashing through the two-car garage. Noel and Chris Fletcher have lived in the home for more than six years, and though they’ve had other storms through the area, Noel Fletcher said “nothing has caused this much damage.” Noel Fletcher was home with her daughter at the time of the storm, when the sky turned “pitch black” around 5:15 p.m. The two went to their basement and that’s when Noel heard what she thinks was the large tree land on their garage. Cheshire police Chief Neil Dryfe said some of his officers ferried firefighters into a Hamden neighborhood in a police cruiser to respond to a propane leak, because the fallen trees and lines made bringing in a truck impossible. Dryfe said about 20 streets were “totally impassable.” “It’s as bad as I’ve seen it here since that October snowstorm five or six years back,” he said. In Hamden, emergency crews found roads so impassable they resorted to using TV vehicles to respond to medical calls, Mayor Curt Leng said. “We are having many, many issues throughout town,” he wrote in an email. Busy Route 10 was closed in both directions, halting traffic through the morning rush hour. Route 10 in northern Hamden was swamped with trees limbs and power lines sagging from utility poles knocked crooked by Tuesday's winds. Hamden police had blocked off about a half mile of the road as utility crews sought to first power down the drooping lines and then untangle them from the trunks, brush and limbs that littered the road. The roadway smelled like a Christmas tree lot as workers sawed the debris into manageable chunks. In front of one home, four shattered stumps were all that remained of a stand of pine. Lorraine Denaro, 61, emerged from the thicket around noon, having walked about two miles from her home. Like all of the homes in her neighborhood, Denaro's is without power. She and her boyfriend had come home around 5:15 Tuesday when a gust of wind toppled a tree in her yard; the tree crumpled her Subaru crossover just one minute after they'd gotten out of the car, she said. \\"If we'd been in that car one more minute -- if I'd gone back for my bag, or something -- I think we would've been crushed.\\"Because the debris and live wires made driving impossible, Denaro said all of her neighbors were walking around Tuesday evening, in a daze. An intense storm slammed Connecticut Tuesday afternoon, with strong winds, heavy rain and hail bringing significant damage to parts of the state. Two people were killed as a result of the storm, and as of Wednesday morning, around 90,000 homes were still without power. As communities clean up,... Gary Lessor, chief meteorologist at the Western Connecticut State University’s Weather Center, said two lines of powerful thunderstorms moved into Connecticut Tuesday afternoon. The arrived in Litchfield County about 3 p.m. and moved east toward Granby and Somers, where it weakened. On the way, it dropped damaging hail and rain, with strong winds. At the height of the storm, 122,000 homes were without power. A second line of storms moved across Danbury, Brookfield, New Fairfield, Newtown and Southbury and continued east, causing extensive tree and wind damage as it continued through the Naugatuck Valley and into Cheshire, Hamden and Wallingford. East of Hartford, the storm fronts combined and moved into eastern Connecticut, causing damage as far east as Ashford, Pomfret, Woodstock, Plainfield, Lessor said. Through the storm, some people in northern Connecticut reported seeing hail the size of baseballs — a rare occurence in Connecticut. A Norfolk man’s windshield was shattered in the process. Bradley International Airport briefly grounded all flights after evacuating its Air Traffic Control Tower at around 4:30 p.m., but the airport reopened the tower a half-hour later and resumed flight operations. Metro-North’s New Haven Line trains returned to a limited service with heavy delays at about 7:30 p.m. Fallen trees on the Waterbury and Danbury branches caused delays.

(Jonathan Barbagall / Handout) In the southwestern corner of the state, Ridgefield First Selectman Rudy Marconi declared a local emergency at 6 p.m., after the storm knocked down wires and trees — some of which slammed into homes. “We have arcing wires everywhere in the road,” Marconi said in the evening. The Danbury-Brookfield area were hit especially hard, and Brookfield resident Michael Zacchea said he felt something strike his car as he drove along Route 133. He sought shelter at a nearby house, and took refuge under a garage overhang. “Within about 10 yards of where I was standing, three trees went down,” Zacchea said. “In the back a tree went down, hit the house and stove-in the roof.” ||||| An 11-year-old girl died when a tree toppled onto a car outside her house in Newburgh as her mother was unloading the car during the storm.

Radio waves have frequencies as high as 300 GHz to as low as 3 kHz, though some definitions describe waves above 1 or 3 GHz as microwaves, or include waves of any lower frequency. At 300 GHz, the corresponding wavelength is , and at 3 kHz is . Like all other electromagnetic waves, they travel at the speed of light. Naturally occurring radio waves are generated by lightning, or by astronomical objects. - Radio is the technology of using radio waves to carry information, such as sound, by systematically modulating properties of electromagnetic energy waves transmitted through space, such as their amplitude, frequency, phase, or pulse width. When radio waves strike an electrical conductor, the oscillating fields induce an alternating current in the conductor. The information in the waves can be extracted and transformed back into its original form. - Frequency is the number of occurrences of a repeating event per unit time. It is also referred to as temporal frequency, which emphasizes the contrast to spatial frequency and angular frequency. The period is the duration of time of one cycle in a repeating event, so the period is the reciprocal of the frequency. For example, if a newborn baby's heart beats at a frequency of 120 times a minute, its periodthe time interval between beatsis half a second (that is, 60 seconds divided by 120 beats). Frequency is an important parameter used in science and engineering to specify the rate of oscillatory and vibratory phenomena, such as mechanical vibrations, audio (sound) signals, radio waves, and light. - A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \\"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years. United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice. - A county seat is an administrative center, seat of government, or capital city of a county or civil parish. The term is used in the United States, Canada, Romania, China and Taiwan. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, county towns have a similar function. - Ernie Manouse ( born September 1 , 1969 , in Binghamton , New York ) is an American television host , radio personality , writer and producer .

His work with HoustonPBS has met critical acclaim in the southern United States , earning him numerous KATIE awards and regional Emmy Awards - The amplitude of a periodic variable is a measure of its change over a single period (such as time or spatial period). There are various definitions of amplitude (see below), which are all functions of the magnitude of the difference between the variable's extreme values. In older texts the phase is sometimes called the amplitude. - Binghamton is a city in, and the county seat of, Broome County, New York, United States.

Incredibly, the resident killer whales of the San Juan Islands are the most studied whales in the world; they, in turn, have observed humans for at least six thousand years. Stable family groups, called pods, represent several generations and include grandmothers (the pod leaders), adolescents, infants, and huge bulls. Each family member is recognized by its distinctive markings and can live as long as a human. Much of what is known about the orca whale’s highly-organized social life has been learned from the resident pods in the San Juan Islands of Washington.

The Broncos grabbed the early lead, when defensive tackle Mitch Unrein, lining up as a fullback, caught a 1-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Peyton Manning. The Buccaneers responded, with a 31-yard field goal by placekicker Connor Barth, then grabbed the lead at the end of the first quarter, with quarterback Josh Freeman connecting on an 11-yard touchdown pass to tight end Dallas Clark. After a scoreless second quarter, the Broncos re-claimed the lead for good with 21 unanswered points, consisting of two Manning touchdown passes to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas&#8212;from 8 and 10 yards, followed by linebacker Von Miller returning an interception off Freeman 26 yards for a touchdown. After a Manning interception late in the third quarter, a 50-yard field goal by Barth to begin the fourth quarter narrowed the gap to 28-13, but the Broncos countered with a 31-yard field goal by placekicker Matt Prater. With 4:37 remaining in the game, the Buccaneers tried to rally, with a 55-yard field goal by Barth, followed by a 5-yard touchdown pass from Freeman to wide receiver Mike Williams with 2:39 remaining. However, the Buccaneers' onside kick attempt was unsuccessful, and the Broncos subsequently ran out the clock. With the win, the Broncos exceeded their win total from 2011, and also clinched their second consecutive AFC West division title. This was the 12th division title in the Broncos' franchise history, tying the Oakland Raiders for the all-time lead in AFC West championships since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger. The Broncos also clinched consecutive division titles for the first time since 1986-87.

Several mansion houses were built for the owners of former mills and factories. Many of Neilston's dwellings are painted in whites or ivories. In his book Ordnance Survey of Scotland (1884), Francis Hindes Groome remarked that Neilston \\"presents an old-fashioned yet neat and compact appearance\\", a view echoed by Hugh McDonald in Rambles Round Glasgow (1910), who stated that Neilston \\"is a compact, neat, and withal somewhat old-fashioned little township\\", although continued that it has \\"few features calling for special remark\\". It is frequently described as a quiet dormitory village, although some sources from around the turn of the 20th century describe Neilston as a town. There is a mixture of suburbs, semi-rural, rural and former-industrial locations in Neilston, but overwhelmingly the land use in central Neilston is sub-urban.

The emotional trauma unlocks Tina's previously latent telekinetic powers, which result in her father's death at the bottom of Crystal Lake. Ten years later, Tina, now a teenager, is still struggling with the guilt surrounding the death of her father. Tina's mother, Amanda, takes her to the same lakeside residence so that her powers can be studied (and unknowingly exploited) by her psychiatrist, Dr. Crews. Dr. Crews begins a series of experiments (verbal assaults) designed to agitate Tina's mental state, forcing her powers to become more pronounced. After a particularly upsetting session with Dr. Crews, Tina runs from the cabin and to the dock thinking about her father's death. While thinking about him, she wishes he would come back. Instead, Tina's psychic powers breaks the chain around the neck of Jason Voorhees, the undead Crystal Lake serial killer. Tina's torment from her powers is increased as Jason emerges from the lake and his reign of terror descends on the area once again. Next door to the Shepard residence is a group of teens who are throwing a birthday party for their friend Michael: preppy Russell and his girlfriend Sandra, Ben and his girlfriend Kate, science fiction writer Eddie, stoner David, perky Robin, shy Maddie, and snobby socialite Melissa. Michael's cousin Nick, who has arrived just for the party takes a liking to Tina, much to the jealousy of Melissa, who bullies Tina.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","response":"The supposed perturbation in this scenario is \\"directly impacting a step of the process.\\" A temperature rise in the zone will have a direct impact on the formation of cracks in rocks. To better understand this, let us analyze the process outlined: 1. Water seeps into rocks: Porous or permeable rocks allow water to enter and fill up the spaces within them. This step could be affected by the temperature rise since higher temperatures may lead to increased evaporation rates, reducing the availability of water to seep into rocks. 2. The water freezes and thaws: The freezing and thawing of water inside rocks contribute to the formation of cracks and further weakening of the rock structure. This is because water expands when it freezes and subsequently contracts when it thaws. The continuous expansion and contraction create stress on the rock, causing it to crack. A temperature increase in the zone could lead to a decrease in freezing and, therefore, a lower frequency of freeze-thaw cycles. This could result in fewer cracks being formed. 3. Cracks form in the rocks: Cracks are created both by the freeze-thaw cycles and also due to thermal expansion and contraction of rocks. When rocks heat up, they expand, and when they cool down, they contract. This process can introduce stress on the rock and contribute to the formation of cracks. The temperature rise in the zone may lead to more frequent thermal expansion and contraction cycles, which could increase the formation of cracks. 4. Cracks also form when rocks heat up: As mentioned, rocks expand when they heat up, leading to the formation of cracks. An increase in temperature would have a direct impact on this step, as it would cause rocks to expand more, possibly resulting in more cracks. 5. The rocks slowly break down: The cracks formed in the previous steps contribute to the overall weakening and disintegration of the rock structure. An increase in temperature may have mixed effects—fewer freeze-thaw cycles may lead to fewer cracks, while more frequent thermal expansion and contraction may result in more cracks. Thus, the actual impact on the breakdown of rocks could vary depending on the magnitude of these changes. In conclusion, the temperature rise in the zone would directly impact several steps of the process, specifically those related to the formation of cracks through both freeze-thaw cycles and thermal expansion and contraction. This would affect the rate at which rocks break down and could lead to various outcomes depending on how this direct perturbation interacts with other environmental factors and the specific type of rock being affected."},{"question":"What is the most memorable dream or nightmare you have had?

However, I can provide an analysis and comparison of the questions posed. The two questions, despite sharing common elements, are sufficiently distinct from one another. The differences primarily lie in the emotional response implied and the subsequent perception of the dream or nightmare. 1. \\"What is the most memorable dream or nightmare you have had?\\" This question encompasses two types of experiences: dreams and nightmares. By using the word \\"memorable,\\" it implies that the person answering should share a dream or nightmare that has left a lasting impression on them. This may include vivid details, a strong emotional response, or a dream that has significantly impacted the person's thoughts and behavior. 2. \\"What is the most amazing dream (or a nightmare) you've ever had?\\" This question is explicitly asking for the most amazing dream the person has had, allowing for the possibility of including a nightmare as well. The term \\"amazing\\" is purposefully vague, which grants the person answering more flexibility in how they interpret and respond to the question. In this context, \\"amazing\\" may encompass dreams that are awe-inspiring, exhilarating, surreal, or even pleasantly surprising. In conclusion, the two questions differ primarily in the specific emotional response they evoke and the breadth of experiences they encompass. The first question focuses on the memorability of dreams and nightmares, whereas the second question seeks the most amazing dream, including the possibility of a nightmare. While there is potential for overlap in the responses, the nuances in the questions are enough to differentiate them."},{"question":"Well, I think the fact that they're facing these repeated call-ups, some of them two and three deployments, and there's a stop- loss policy that prevents people from being able to get out when their time was up, is a reflection of the bad judgment this president exercised in how he has engaged in the world and deployed our forces. Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? The President exercised good judgement in how he has engaged in the world and deployed forces. Select from the following. [1]. Yes [2]. It's impossible to say [3]. No","response":"[3]. No The next sentence does not follow the preceding text, as it contradicts the main argument presented. In the given text, it is stated that the President has exercised bad judgment in engaging with the world and deploying forces. This is supported by mentioning the repeated call-ups and deployment of some individuals two or three times, as well as the stop-loss policy preventing people from leaving the service when their time is up. On the other hand, the next sentence claims that the President has exercised good judgment in engaging with the world and deploying forces. This statement directly opposes the view presented in the original text. The two statements cannot coexist as they express opposite ideas. The text critiques the President's decision-making and policies, whereas the following sentence praises his actions and decisions. Thus, the sentence does not follow the preceding text, as it stands in direct contradiction to the points raised previously."},{"question":"How is Santa Claus known around the world? What are his names? What variations are there to Santa Claus around the world? Do those questions have the same meaning? Possible answers: a). no. b). yes.","response":"a). no. Santa Claus is a legendary figure originating from Western Christian culture who is said to bring gifts to the homes of well-behaved children on the night of Christmas Eve (24th December) or during the early morning hours of Christmas Day (25th December). The figure of Santa Claus has a rich tradition and has different names and representations in numerous countries and cultures around the world. Some of the names and variations of Santa Claus around the world include: 1. United States and Canada: Santa Claus 2. United Kingdom: Father Christmas 3. France: Père Noël 4. Germany: Weihnachtsmann (Christmas Man) 5. Italy: Babbo Natale 6. Spain, Mexico, and other Spanish-speaking countries: Papá Noel 7. Brazil: Papai Noel 8. Netherlands and Belgium: Sinterklaas (Saint Nicholas) (celebrated on December 5th or 6th) 9. Russia: Ded Moroz (Grandfather Frost) 10. Finland: Joulupukki (Yule Goat) 11. Sweden and Norway: Julenissen (Yule Nisse) 12. Denmark: Julemanden (Yule Man) 13. Iceland: Yule Lads, a group of trolls/Gryla and Leppalúði. 14. Greece: Agios Vasilis (Saint Basil) (gifts are given on New Year's Day) 15. Austria, Hungary, and Switzerland: Christkind (Christ Child) or Weihnachtsmann The two questions have different meanings. While the first question asks about Santa Claus's different names and how he is known around the world, the second question is about the variations of Santa Claus across different countries and cultures. The names of Santa Claus vary according to local languages, traditions, and folklore. The variations of Santa Claus not only include the names but also the appearances, customs, and the nature of the celebrations. For example, in the Netherlands and Belgium, Sinterklaas is based on Saint Nicholas, who was a 4th-century Christian bishop. Sinterklaas has a long white beard, wears red and white attire and is often accompanied by helpers called 'Zwarte Pieten' (Black Peters). In Russia, Ded Moroz is a figure with a long white beard, a coat of red, blue or white color, and carries a magical staff. He is also assisted by his granddaughter Snegurochka (The Snow Maiden). Ded Moroz and Snegurochka visit houses and distribute presents to children during the New Year celebrations. Moreover, celebrations may not necessarily occur on the same date as Christmas Day. For example, in Greece, Agios Vasilis visits homes on New Year's Day instead of Christmas Day, bringing presents to children. In conclusion, the two questions have a different focus. One asks about the different names of Santa Claus and the second seeks to understand the variations in appearance, customs, and celebrations in various countries and regions worldwide."},{"question":"Select the correct answer: Which is an appropriate title for this article?

Larry falsely claims Bernie as his uncle, so he can get some of Bernie's possessions including Bernie's credit card. At the insurance company, Larry and Richard are quizzed by their boss and Arthur Hummel, the company's internal investigator, who ask the two if they have the US2 million that Bernie embezzled. They deny knowing where the money is, but their boss believes they're lying and fires them. He also sends Hummel after them, giving him two weeks to prove their guilt. Over dinner (paid for with Bernie's credit card, in one of its many uses), Larry tells Richard he found a key to a safe deposit box in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands and asks Richard if he will use the computer at work to see if the 2 million is in Bernie's account. At first Richard refuses but ultimately gives in. Meanwhile, in the Virgin Islands, a voodoo queen named Mobu is hired by mobsters to find the money Bernie stole. She sends two servants—Henry and Charles (Tom Wright)—to go to New York, get Bernie's body, use a voodoo ceremony to reanimate him, and bring him back to her so he can lead her to the money. Their attempts to bring Bernie back are plagued by accidents. They prepare in a bathroom at a sleazy porno theater for the voodoo ceremony, but having lost the sacrificial chicken, they use a pigeon instead.

The answer is:","response":"The missing first step of the process is: The mature mushroom releases its spores. To provide a detailed and in-depth understanding, let's take a look at the entire life cycle of a mushroom: 1. The mature mushroom releases its spores: When a mushroom reaches maturity, it is ready to reproduce. The mushroom's cap produces millions of tiny spores, which are designed for dispersal to promote the chances of successful reproduction. In many mushroom species, the spores are released in response to specific environmental factors, such as changes in humidity, temperature, or light levels. Once the conditions are optimal, the mature mushroom releases the spores from its gills, pores, or other specialized spore-producing structures. 2. The spores fall to the ground: Following their release, the spores are dispersed by various means, including wind, water, or through animal interactions. The vast majority of these microscopic spores will never find a suitable environment to grow, while some will travel great distances before settling down. Eventually, the spores will land on the ground or on a suitable substrate where they can thrive if conditions are right. 3. The spores germinate: Once a spore finds a suitable environment, it goes through a process called germination. During this process, the spores take in water and nutrients from their surroundings, and the cells within the spore begin to divide. These newly formed cells start to grow hyphae, which are the individual strands that make up mycelium. 4. The spores begin to grow mycelium: As the individual hyphae continue to grow, they form a network of interconnected strands called mycelium. These mycelial networks serve as the root-like structure for the mushroom, absorbing nutrients and water from the surrounding substrate. The mycelium may grow beneath the soil or within decaying wood or other organic material, gradually breaking down and consuming the nutrients within the substrate. 5. The mycelium begins to sprout a bud: When environmental conditions and available nutrients align, the mycelium begins to form a small, compact mass called a primordium. The primordium eventually develops into a recognizable mushroom structure, consisting of a stem, cap, and gills or pores. 6. A new mushroom is formed: As the bud continues to grow and develop, it takes on the recognizable form of a mature mushroom. The mushroom expands and releases more spores, completing the life cycle and starting the process over again. This intricate and fascinating process highlights the complex life cycle of mushrooms, demonstrating the importance of each step in the successful growth and reproduction of these unique organisms."},{"question":"Write an article based on this summary: An inquiry into an altercation between two UKIP MEPs that landed one of them in hospital will begin on Tuesday, stand-in leader Nigel Farage has said.","response":"Title: An Investigation Begins into the Altercation between Two UKIP MEPs: Inside Details from Stand-in Leader Nigel Farage On Tuesday, an official inquiry will begin into an alarming altercation between two UKIP (UK Independence Party) Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) that resulted in one hospitalised. The news of this impending investigation has been confirmed by Nigel Farage, the interim leader of the UKIP. The UKIP, a prominent Eurosceptic, right-wing populist political party in the United Kingdom, is no stranger to internal disputes and controversy. However, the recent physical altercation between two of its MEPs has exceeded previous disagreements and crossed a dangerous line. The incident has rocked public opinion and even prompted internal review measures within the party, leading to the impending official inquiry. The confrontation between the two yet-to-be-named MEPs allegedly turned violent, leading to one member being hospitalised with injuries severe enough to warrant significant medical attention. The complete extent of the injuries incurred and the context in which the altercation took place are currently undisclosed to the public, adding fuel to the growing speculative fire surrounding the incident. Nigel Farage, the man currently at the helm of the UKIP, has detailed that the investigation will begin on Tuesday. The inquiry aims to delve into the circumstances leading up to the incident, the altercation itself, and the immediate aftermath to establish a clear understanding of the events that transpired. Farage, a longstanding member of the party and previous leader, has the responsibility of guiding UKIP through this time of controversy. The inquest will aim to obtain a comprehensive view of the incident, exploring the motivations, key players, and resultant impact within the party. Evidence will be collected from the involved MEPs themselves, any direct witnesses, and existing CCTV footage. Statements will be cross-examined to draw a sequence of events and deduce the exact nature of the altercation. The purpose of such a rigorous inquiry is not only to bring transparency but also to hold the guilty parties accountable and lay down the necessary repercussions. This serious incident comes as a blow to the party known for its influential role in lobbying for Britain's exit from the European Union, hence termed Brexit. The internal turmoil mirrors the significant challenges facing the party over the years, including leadership issues, member disagreements, persistent infighting, and fluctuating public support. Such an incident adds to the existing internal woes and attracts unwanted attention, further straining the party's public image. The findings of the Tuesday inquiry will notably impact the future direction of UKIP and potentially alter the dynamics within the party. Nigel Farage, with his wealth of experience and leadership, has a pivotal role in this process. The UKIP and Farage look to handle this situation decisively, showcasing the maturity and prudence needed in the face of adversity. In a time where unity within the party is paramount, the seriousness of this incident serves as a reminder that escalating disagreements to violent confrontations have no place in politics. Furthermore, it underscores the need for the party to grapple with any existing internal issues promptly and efficiently. The world eagerly awaits the details of the Tuesday inquiry, the revelations it might bring, and the consequences it shall entail for the two unnamed MEPs. Observers are hopeful the UKIP will use this incident as an opportunity to introspect, reflect on their internal systems and strive for better conduct within the ranks in the future. In conclusion, this inquiry marks an essential step towards conflict resolution within the UKIP. Whether it successfully manages to clear the smoke surrounding the unsettling incident and steer the party back on course remains to be seen."},{"question":"Information: - Jakarta , (formerly named Sunda Kelapa, Jayakarta and Batavia) officially the Special Capital Region of Jakarta, is the capital and most populous city of the Republic of Indonesia. - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe.

The survey of more than 1,000 18 to 25-year-olds also found parties needed to use social media more effectively. Demos said Skype or FaceTime MP surgeries, hustings via Facebook and online voting could all boost youth political participation. The research found more than three quarters (77%) intended to vote - but only 30% of young women said they were interested compared with 48% of their male peers. Asked to name the issues they were most concerned about, 69% included the cost of living, 62% affordable housing, 58% unemployment and the same proportion said the NHS. Exactly half put online privacy among their main concerns - more than the environment (45%), immigration (43%), tax avoidance (37%) or Britain's future in the EU (34%). The researchers combined the polling with focus groups asking young people their views on politicians and what would make them more likely to vote. Almost one in five (19%) said celebrity endorsement would make them more likely to vote, while (18%) said it would make them less likely. More than half (56%) said they would be more likely to vote if there were more working class MPs, while fewer (31%) cited more women MPs as a factor, and an even smaller number (27%) cited ethnic minority MPs.

In biology glycosylation mainly refers in particular to the enzymatic process that attaches glycans to proteins, lipids, or other organic molecules. This enzymatic process produces one of the fundamental biopolymers found in cells (along with DNA, RNA, and proteins). Glycosylation is a form of co-translational and post-translational modification. Glycans serve a variety of structural and functional roles in membrane and secreted proteins. The majority of proteins synthesized in the rough ER undergo glycosylation. It is an enzyme-directed site-specific process, as opposed to the non-enzymatic chemical reaction of glycation. Glycosylation is also present in the cytoplasm and nucleus as the O-GlcNAc modification. Aglycosylation is a feature of engineered antibodies to bypass glycosylation. Five classes of glycans are produced: - Synsepalum dulcificum is a plant known for its berry that, when eaten, causes sour foods (such as lemons and limes) subsequently consumed to taste sweet. This effect is due to miraculin. Common names for this species and its berry include miracle fruit, miracle berry, miraculous berry, sweet berry, and in West Africa, where the species originates, agbayun, taami, asaa, and ledidi. - The lemon (\\"Citrus\\" × \\"limon\\") is a species of small evergreen tree native to Asia. - Proteins (or ) are large biomolecules, or macromolecules, consisting of one or more long chains of amino acid residues. Proteins perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalysing metabolic reactions, DNA replication, responding to stimuli, and transporting molecules from one location to another. Proteins differ from one another primarily in their sequence of amino acids, which is dictated by the nucleotide sequence of their genes, and which usually results in protein folding into a specific three-dimensional structure that determines its activity. - Glycoproteins are proteins that contain oligosaccharide chains (glycans) covalently attached to polypeptide side-chains. The carbohydrate is attached to the protein in a cotranslational or posttranslational modification. This process is known as glycosylation. Secreted extracellular proteins are often glycosylated. - Taste, gustatory perception, or gustation is one of the five traditional senses that belongs to the gustatory system. - A sugar substitute is a food additive that provides a sweet taste like that of sugar while containing significantly less food energy. Some sugar substitutes are produced by nature, and others produced synthetically. Those that are not produced by nature are, in general, called artificial sweeteners. - Sugar is the generalized name for sweet, short-chain, soluble carbohydrates, many of which are used in food. They are composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. There are various types of sugar derived from different sources. Simple sugars are called monosaccharides and include glucose (also known as dextrose), fructose, and galactose. The table or granulated sugar most customarily used as food is sucrose, a disaccharide. (In the body, sucrose hydrolyses into fructose and glucose.) Other disaccharides include maltose and lactose. Longer chains of sugars are called oligosaccharides. Chemically-different substances may also have a sweet taste, but are not classified as sugars. Some are used as lower-calorie food substitutes for sugar, described as artificial sweeteners. - Food additives are substances added to food to preserve flavor or enhance its taste and appearance. Some additives have been used for centuries; for example, preserving food by pickling (with vinegar), salting, as with bacon, preserving sweets or using sulfur dioxide as with wines. With the advent of processed foods in the second half of the twentieth century, many more additives have been introduced, of both natural and artificial origin. - In biology, a common name of a taxon or organism (also known as a vernacular name, English name, colloquial name, trivial name, trivial epithet, country name, popular name, or farmer's name) is a name that is based on the normal language of everyday life; this kind of name is often contrasted with the scientific name for the same organism, which is Latinized.

In 2009, Guinness World Records cited her as the most awarded female act of all time. Houston is one of the best-selling music artists of all-time, with 200 million records sold worldwide. She released seven studio albums and two soundtrack albums, all of which have diamond, multi-platinum, platinum, or gold certification. The Clive Davis's pre-Grammy party that Houston was expected to attend, which featured many of the biggest names in music and movies, went on as scheduled although it was quickly turned into a tribute to Houston. Davis spoke about Houston's death at the evening's start: By now you have all learned of the unspeakably tragic news of our beloved Whitney's passing. I don't have to mask my emotion in front of a room full of so many dear friends. I am personally devastated by the loss of someone who has meant so much to me for so many years. Whitney was so full of life. She was so looking forward to tonight even though she wasn't scheduled to perform. Whitney was a beautiful person and a talent beyond compare. She graced this stage with her regal presence and gave so many memorable performances here over the years. Simply put, Whitney would have wanted the music to go on and her family asked that we carry on. Tony Bennett spoke of Houston's death before performing at Davis's party. He said, \\"First, it was Michael Jackson, then Amy Winehouse, now, the magnificent Whitney Houston.\\" Bennett sang \\"How Do You Keep the Music Playing?\\" and said of Houston, \\"When I first heard her, I called Clive Davis and said, 'You finally found the greatest singer I've ever heard in my life.'\\" Some celebrities opposed Davis' decision to continue on the party while a police investigation was being conducted in Houston's hotel room and her body was still in the building. Chaka Khan, in an interview with CNN's Piers Morgan on February 13, 2012, shared that she felt the party should have been canceled, saying: \\"I thought that was complete insanity. And knowing Whitney I don't believe that she would have said 'the show must go on.' She's the kind of woman that would've said 'Stop everything! Un-unh. I'm not going to be there.' [...] I don't know what could motivate a person to have a party in a building where the person whose life he had influenced so enormously and whose life had been affected by hers. They were like... I don't understand how that party went on.\\" Sharon Osbourne condemned the Davis party, declaring: \\"I think it was disgraceful that the party went on. I don't want to be in a hotel room when there's someone you admire who's tragically lost their life four floors up. I'm not interested in being in that environment and I think when you grieve someone, you do it privately, you do it with people who understand you. I thought it was so wrong.\\" Who was Davis to her?","response":"Clive Davis was an influential figure in Whitney Houston's life and career. He was an American record producer, A&R executive, and music industry executive who played a significant role in launching and nurturing the careers of many top artists, including Houston. Clive Davis first discovered Whitney Houston in the early 1980s, when she was just a teenager, and he signed her to his label, Arista Records, in 1983. Davis played an important role in shaping Houston's musical direction, as well as making key decisions regarding her choice of songs, production, and overall artistic presentation. He served as a mentor and professional guide to her throughout her career, helping her achieve her massive success in the music industry. Their relationship went beyond professional, with Houston considering Davis almost like a family member, and Davis deeply caring for her well-being in both her personal and professional life. Thus, Clive Davis was not only immensely influential in Whitney Houston's career, but also a trusted figure and confidant who was deeply affected by her passing."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Process: - Animals and plants die in soft soil or mud - Sediment builds up over the remains - The remains decompose, leaving only trace amounts - The remaining parts over the years are replaced with mineral - A fossil is formed - Question: suppose less rockets will be launched into space happens, how will it affect LESS fossils forming. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","response":"C: No effect The process of fossil formation is entirely geological and biological, taking place over long periods of time. It involves the death of animals and plants and their burial in sediment, which then progressively covers the remains in layers. As decomposition takes place, the remaining parts are slowly replaced with minerals over thousands of years, forming what we know as a fossil. The launching of rockets into space is a human activity that can impact the environment in many ways, such as generating pollution, littering space debris, and potentially disrupting weather patterns and ozone layers for instance. However, there is no direct relationship between space travel and the process of fossil formation. Rockets do not contribute to or takeaway from the factors that cause fossils to form: death, burial, decomposition, sediment accumulation, and mineral replacement over a long period of time. Hence, whether fewer rockets are launched into space or not, it likely won't have a perceivable impact on the formation of fewer or more fossils. It is crucial to understand that both are independent processes influenced by different aspects of human activity and natural occurrences. The process of fossil formation is an ancient natural process, while rocket launching is a comparatively modern human technological endeavor. Therefore, supposing fewer rockets will be launched into space likely has no effect on the formation of fewer or more fossils."},{"question":"Write an article based on this summary: – Theories surrounding the 2001 death of Kathleen Peterson range from the accidental (a fall down the stairs) to the horrifying (killed by home intruders) to the bizarre (an owl attack). But the one that took center stage Friday in Durham, NC, focused on her husband, novelist Mike Peterson, who filed what's called an Alford plea on a voluntary manslaughter charge, more than 15 years after his wife's body was found at the bottom of the stairs in their home, the News & Observer reports. The case, which became the subject of a lengthy documentary, features intriguing details, including family members who've switched sides and even a family friend in Germany who, like Kathleen, was found dead at the bottom of the stairs a few years before Kathleen (and whose daughters Mike Peterson ended up raising). Peterson, 73, was originally convicted in 2003 of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without parole, but he was released in 2011 after the judge who'd presided over the original case ruled that a main prosecution witness had lied, WRAL and the AP report. A new trial was ordered. The Alford plea entered by Peterson Friday allows him to still claim innocence while conceding the prosecution has enough evidence to get a guilty verdict. He walked out free afterward, though his wife's sister declared in court, \\"You will be a convicted felon forever.\\" Peterson had said earlier he didn't want to take the plea, but he didn't think he'd ever get a fair second trial by prosecutors. \\"I am not going to put my life and my freedom in their hands.\\" (Prison inmates say a fellow inmate was thrown down the stairs and killed by the \\"Beat Up Squad.\\")","response":"Once upon a time, a lady named Kathleen Peterson was found at the bottom of the stairs in her house, and no one was sure how she got there. People had many ideas: maybe she fell, maybe someone bad came into her house and hurt her, or maybe a big bird called an owl attacked her. Her husband, Mike Peterson, who liked to write stories, was blamed for her death. Many, many years ago, another lady in Germany was also found at the bottom of the stairs, and Mike helped take care of her daughters. Some people thought this was really strange. Mike was said to be guilty in 2003, but later, someone figured out that a person who spoke in the trial wasn't telling the truth. So, they decided to have another trial. Mike was then able to say \\"I didn't do it, but I understand there is a chance I could be found guilty.\\" They let him go free, but some people still think he's a bad person. This story became very famous and was made into a movie, but no one knows for sure what happened to poor Kathleen at the bottom of the stairs."},{"question":"The Creed family moves into a new home , close to a road where truckers often drive unsafely .

The linea alba, translated as the \\"white line,\\" is a fibrous structure that runs vertically down the center of the anterior abdominal wall. It is formed from the aponeuroses (fibrous sheets) of the three lateral abdominal muscles, which interlace in the midline. The linea alba serves as an attachment site for the Rectus Abdominis muscle. The Rectus Abdominis muscle is a long, flat muscle extending from the ribcage down to the pubic bone. It is often referred to as the \\"six-pack muscles\\" due to its segmented appearance. Besides its lateral borders, the Rectus Abdominis is also separated into sections by three or more tendinous intersections, which give it the six-pack appearance. Functionally, the Rectus Abdominis has several important roles. Its main functions include: 1. Flexion of the spine: This occurs when you bend forward or perform a crunch-like movement. The muscle contracts, pulling on the ribcage and the pelvis, causing the spine to flex. 2. Stabilizing the torso: The rectus abdominis aids in maintaining correct posture and stabilizing the torso during various movements and physical activities. 3. Assisting with forced expiration: During situations where forceful exhalation is required, such as coughing or heavy lifting, this muscle contracts to help push the air out of the lungs. 4. Assisting in childbirth and bowel movements: The muscle assists the process by providing additional force to push the baby out during childbirth or improve bowel movements when needed. In addition to the Rectus Abdominis, three other muscle groups contribute to the abdominal musculature. These are: 1. External Oblique muscles: They are the largest and most superficial of the three lateral abdominal muscles. They are responsible for trunk rotation and lateral flexion, among other functions. 2. Internal Oblique muscles: These are located just below the external oblique muscles and share similar functions, contributing to trunk rotation, lateral flexion, and compression of the abdomen. 3. Transverse Abdominis muscle: This muscle lies deep beneath both the external and internal oblique muscles. Its primary function is to compress the abdominal contents, stabilize the spine and maintain intra-abdominal pressure. In summary, the Rectus Abdominis muscle is the abdominal muscle that lies on either side of the linea alba. It has several important functions, including spinal flexion, torso stabilization, and assisting in forced expiration. Alongside the Rectus Abdominis, the external and internal oblique muscles, as well as the transverse abdominis muscle, complete the abdominal musculature."},{"question":"Title: Unmitigated rubbish Review: Yet another piece of excruciating nonsense from George Alexander, aka Rising Sun Productions, aka Y.

The farmer tried to put the milk in the jar but the OPT: 1). jar was too small. 2). milk was too small. Answer:","response":"The farmer tried to put the milk in the jar but the jar was too small, which made it impossible for him to store all the freshly milked liquid from his healthy cows that grazed diligently in the lush green pastures of his land. This predicament forced him to come up with an alternative solution to ensure that none of the precious milk would go to waste. After contemplating various options, such as utilizing multiple jars or finding a larger container, the farmer finally decided to repurpose an old yet sturdy wooden barrel he had in his barn. The farmer carefully cleaned and sanitized the wooden barrel, making sure there was no residue or contaminants left inside that could potentially spoil the milk. Once the barrel was spotless and dry, he proceeded to pour the milk in slowly, ensuring that not a single drop would spill on the ground. He knew that this milk was vital for the survival of his small farm and his livelihood, so he treated it with the utmost care and respect. After successfully transferring the milk into the barrel, the farmer sealed it tightly to preserve the freshness, quality, and taste of his product. He knew that this change in storage would also drastically increase the shelf life of the milk, allowing him to sell it to nearby markets and provide for his family. The decision to use a larger container not only solved his immediate problem but also opened up new opportunities and potential for growth.

A babysitter who was addicted to painkillers died in his sleep after taking a concoction of Valium, Tramadol pain relief and alcohol at a notorious drug house, an inquest heard. Harry Jones, 20, was found dead on the sofa of Sharon Nuttall’s home in Blackpool, Lancashire, after spending the night babysitting her two young children. An inquest heard the college student, who was an aspiring film producer, was given the Valium by drug dealer Nuttall on the evening of January 13 in last year, but secretly took the Tramadol painkillers after swiping them from her collection while she was out partying. He was found unconscious the following morning by friends and pronounced dead after attempts to resuscitate him failed. A coroner recorded a verdict of misadventure at the hearing in Blackpool yesterday, and said it was clear Mr Jones had voluntarily taken the alcohol and medication but hadn’t intended to die as a result. The inquest came just over a year after mother-of-four Nuttall was sentenced to 18 months in prison for supplying Class B and C drugs and permitting her house to be used for smoking and supplying drugs. The 41-year-old, whose children at the time were five, seven, 10 and 15, turned her family home into a ‘magnet’ for young people by using it as a drugs den to sell amphetamines, cannabis, prescription drugs and the former legal high ‘bubble’. Over a three-year period, she allowed up to 20 youngsters into her home at once to take drugs - often introducing them to new tablets and dangerous concoctions. Following yesterday’s inquest, Mr Jones’ mother, Lorraine, 48, condemned Nuttall for introducing youngsters in the area to drugs and making them so readily available. The bank worker, from Blackpool, said: ‘There are so many kids’ lives that she ruined from what she was doing. ‘She wasn’t charged directly with Harry’s death but if he had never met her he might not have started on the route he did. Mr Jones, a Grade A media student who attended Blackpool and The Fylde College, was an aspiring film producer and was in the process of applying to Leeds University at the time of his death in January last year. Tests revealed Mr Jones (pictured as a child) died as a result of a massive ingestion of Tramadol pain relief, which had been prescribed to Sharon Nuttall by doctors for back pain, plus Diazepam and alcohol. ‘Harry was a good boy but he came across these tablets at her house when he was about 17 and he changed. ‘She was in her 40s with small children and yet she was having 16 and 17-year-olds round her house doing “bubble”. You can’t get your head around how a mother would do something like that.’ Mr Jones, a Grade A media student who attended Blackpool and The Fylde College, was described by his family as ‘the life and soul of parties’. However, the inquest heard how the student, who was in the process of applying to study at Leeds University at the time of his death, had been battling an addiction to painkillers which even saw him tell doctors that he suffered from severe back pain in order to get repeated prescriptions for painkillers. Mrs Jones said: ‘From the end of October 2012 to the time of his death he appeared to be ok. ‘He wasn’t going out and had his head down at college and we had a really great Christmas where he was the life and soul as usual. ‘He was saving up to go on holiday. It was always one week at a time with Harry. He had had a really good couple of months.’ However, on the night of his death, he. went to Nuttall’s house with a friend to babysit her children and,. despite being armed with two bottles of wine, asked her for a Valium. tablet. Mr Jones was babysitting for mother-of-four Sharon Nuttall (pictured) on the night of his death and had taken Tramadol and Valium from her home before mixing the painkillers with alcohol. He was found dead on her sofa. Mother-of-four Nuttall (pictured outside Preston Crown Court in May last year) was sentenced to 18 months in prison for supplying Class B and C drugs and permitting her house to be used for smoking and supplying drugs. She gave both Mr Jones and his friend a Valium tablet each before leaving the property and later exchanging text messages with them, after they asked her for more tablets. The 17-year-old friend, who cannot be named for legal reasons, relayed the course of events in a statement read out at the inquest. It read: ‘Harry came upstairs at about 2.30am and I would describe him as pretty wasted. ‘He told me to get up so I did and went downstairs to watch TV. He was slurring his words and kept talking to himself. ‘He started to root through his pockets and pulled out eight Tramadol with two missing. My friend grabbed them and asked what he was doing with them. ‘He gave them to me and I hid them in the bathroom because I knew he had problems with prescription drugs in the past. At about 4am my friend got up and said he was leaving and I went to sleep. ‘As I left the room Harry was lying. down on his back on the sofa snoring and asleep. At 11am a friend let. himself in as the door was open and woke me up and said “Harry looks. dead”. ‘We both tried to wake him up, shook him and listened to his breathing and then we rang an ambulance.’ Tests revealed Mr Jones was less than twice the legal drink-drive limit at the time of his death and had taken a small amount of Valium. But the level of Tramadol in his system was 'within a range associated with fatalities' Mr Jones (pictured on a family holiday) was described by his family and friends as the 'life and soul of parties' Tests revealed Mr Jones died as a result of a massive ingestion of Tramadol pain relief, which had been prescribed to Nuttall by doctors for back pain, plus Diazepam and alcohol. In a statement Nuttall said Mr Jones was a ‘good friend’ who she had known since he was 14. She said that two months before his death she had gone to take Tramadol for her back pain but found they were missing. She confronted him and he admitted taking the medication but apologised. Speaking about the evening before his death, she said: ‘We all had a drink. At about 11.35pm I went to my boyfriend’s and left Harry and his friend watching TV. When I left he had a couple of glasses of wine and was fine. I told him he could stay over. Mother-of-four Sharon Nuttall, 41, was sentenced to 18 months in prison last May for supplying Class B and C drugs and permitting her house to be used for smoking and supplying drugs. At the time, the judge Mr Recorder Stephen Bedford at Preston Crown Court, said: ‘Your house became something of a magnet for young vulnerable people you seem to have been unable to keep away. ‘But such was your priority, was your social life over the welfare of young people in your house - particularly your children - that you left the house that night. ‘I’m looking at you being the adult here, you being the parent at home. Allowing them to behave in this way, not just on a one-off but over a period of time. ‘That must have had some corrupting effect upon them.’ A 17-year old boy who helped Nuttall also admitted to being concerned in the supply of Class B drugs last May and was sentenced to a 12-month youth rehabilitation and supervision order. ‘I did not think he had Tramadol when I left but he texted me several times in the early hours asking about it. ‘I was told in the morning he was deceased. I checked my medication and there was some Tramadol missing. I can’t say exactly how many but about 40 to 60. It’s hard to say the exact number.’ A post-mortem revealed that Mr Jones was less than twice the legal drink-drive limit at the time of his death and had taken just a small amount of Valium. But the level of Tramadol in his system was ‘within a range associated with fatalities’ and combined with the other factors meant he would have ‘slept into death’. Coroner Alan Wilson returned a verdict of misadventure and described his death as tragic’. He said: ‘He was the life and soul of parties - opinionated, outgoing, frustrating - but always caring and loved. ‘He was passionate about meteorology and an animal lover. He was working part time in a hotel on weekends and was saving or a holiday with friends. ‘His friends and family are devastated by tragic death and struggle to come to terms with it. 'Everyone who knew him remembers his big smile and he will be sorely missed by all whose lives he shared.’ After the hearing Mr Jones’ father, Darren, 48, paid tribute to his son and said he would’ve excelled in his dream job of being a film producer. The double glazing installer said: ‘At Christmas he had everyone in stitches. He would have been perfect in front of the camera but he was brilliant behind it. ‘He was amazing at everything he turned his hand to.’ Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","response":"Harry Jones, a 20-year-old college student and aspiring film producer, was found dead in Blackpool, Lancashire after ingesting a mixture of Tramadol painkillers, Valium, and alcohol.

Leftists dismiss the book as score-settling and name-calling. Does it follow that \\"Mr. Podhoretz could not find anything to compare Horowitz's conversion to. \\"?","response":"John Podhoretz's comparison of David Horowitz's conversion to conservatism with Whittaker Chambers' apostasy is an attempt to contextualize and evaluate the significance of Horowitz's ideological shift. Whittaker Chambers, a prominent former communist, famously documented his rejection of communism and embracement of conservatism in his book \\"Witness.\\" By comparing Horowitz's conversion to Chambers', Podhoretz is elevating Horowitz's political transformation to a similar level of importance and seriousness in the conservative ideological canon. However, leftists criticize Horowitz's book, \\"Radical Son,\\" as motivated primarily by personal grievances and score-settling, rather than genuine philosophical introspection and epiphany. They accuse Horowitz of using his book as a platform for name-calling and attacking those who he perceives as ideological enemies, rather than engaging in substantive political debate or offering a comprehensive explanation of his new conservative beliefs. In this context, one could argue that Mr. Podhoretz had difficulty finding a truly apt analogy for Horowitz's conversion, and thus opted for the comparison with Chambers' \\"Witness\\" to emphasize the importance and weight of Horowitz's ideological shift. The implication is that, despite the left's dismissal of the book as mere score-settling and name-calling, Podhoretz believes that Horowitz's transformation carries significant weight and should be examined seriously. It is important to note that the efficacy of Podhoretz's comparison ultimately depends on the reader's interpretation of \\"Radical Son\\" and their viewpoint on David Horowitz's conversion to conservatism. Those who regard Horowitz's change as genuine and significant may find the comparison with Chambers' \\"Witness\\" to be valid, while those who perceive his transformation as shallow or self-serving may dismiss the analogy as unfounded and misleading. In conclusion, John Podhoretz's comparison of David Horowitz's conversion to conservatism with Whittaker Chambers' apostasy in \\"Witness\\" is an attempt to underscore the significance and impact of Horowitz's ideological shift.

They can travel only through matter. They cannot travel through empty space. This was demonstrated in the 1600s by a scientist named Robert Boyle. Boyle placed a ticking clock in a sealed glass jar. The clock could be heard ticking through the air and glass of the jar. Then Boyle pumped the air out of the jar. The clock was still running, but the ticking could not be heard. Thats because the sound couldnt travel without air particles to transfer the sound energy. Is there any other place where sound cannot be heard? Here is a hint: is there any other place that does not have air molecules? Thats right, in space sound cannot be transferred. So can astronauts hear each other? Yes, they can, because they are in enclosed space stations or pressurized suits.In both cases, they are surrounded by air molecules.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The Norwegian Bratvaag expedition, studying the glaciers and seas of the Svalbard archipelago from the Norwegian sealing vessel Bratvaag of Ålesund, found the remains of the Andrée expedition on 5 August 1930. Kvitøya was usually inaccessible to the sealing or whaling ships of the time, as it is typically surrounded by a wide belt of thick polar ice and often hidden by thick ice fogs. However, summer in 1930 had been particularly warm, and the surrounding sea was practically free of ice. As Kvitøya was known to be a prime hunting ground for walrus and the fogs over the island on that day were comparatively thin, some of the crew of the Bratvaag took this rare opportunity to land on what they called the \\"inaccessible island\\".Two of the sealers in search of water, Olav Salen and Karl Tusvick, discovered Andrée's boat near a small stream, frozen under a mound of snow and full of equipment, including a boathook engraved with the words \\"Andrée's Polar Expedition, 1896\\". Presented with this hook, the Bratvaag's captain, Peder Eliassen, assigned the crew to search the site together with the expedition members. Among other finds, they uncovered a journal and two skeletons, identified as Andrée's and Strindberg's remains by monograms found on their clothing.The Bratvaag left the island to continue its scheduled hunting and observations, with the intent of coming back later to see if the ice had melted further and uncovered more artifacts. Further discoveries were made by the M/K Isbjørn of Tromsø, a sealing sloop chartered by news reporters to waylay the Bratvaag. Unsuccessful in this, the reporters and the Isbjørn crew made instead for Kvitøya, landing on the island on 5 September in fine weather and finding even less ice than the Bratvaag had. After photographing the area, they searched for and found Frænkel's body, and additional artifacts, including a tin box containing Strindberg's photographic film, his logbook, and maps. The crews of both ships turned over their finds to a scientific commission of the Swedish...","response":"Based on the context provided, the three explorers' bodies that were transported to Stockholm were those of Salomon August Andrée, Nils Strindberg, and Knut Frænkel.

Having read the above passage, choose the right answer to the following question (choices are smaller or larger? ): Compared to the distance between the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn, which are far away from the sun, is it more likely that the distance between the orbits of Mercury and Venus, which are closer to the sun than Jupiter and Saturn, are smaller or larger?? A:","response":"The distance between the orbits of Mercury and Venus is more likely to be smaller compared to the distance between the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn. This is because, as mentioned in the passage, the general trend is that the farther away from the Sun a planet is, the greater the distance between its orbit and the orbit of the next planet. In the case of the solar system, the distribution of planets follows the Titius-Bode law, which is a rough empirical observation suggesting that the distances between the planets and the Sun follow a geometric progression. Although there are some deviations and the law doesn't hold perfectly for all planets, it still provides some basic insight into the spacing of planetary orbits. Mercury and Venus, being the innermost planets, are respectively at an average distance of 57.9 million kilometers (0.387 astronomical units, or AU) and 108.2 million kilometers (0.723 AU) from the Sun. The distance between their orbits is approximately 50.3 million kilometers. On the other hand, Jupiter and Saturn are much farther away from the Sun, with an average distance of 778.3 million kilometers (5.204 AU) and 1.427 billion kilometers (9.538 AU), respectively. The distance between their orbits is approximately 648.7 million kilometers. Therefore, comparing these two sets of distances, it is evident that the distance between the orbits of Mercury and Venus is smaller than the distance between the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn, in accordance with the general trend stated in the passage."},{"question":"Would a linguist find the following sentence to be a valid English sentence grammatically? These are similar with the bottles.","response":"While the sentence \\"These are similar with the bottles\\" does convey a meaning and it is understandable, it doesn't adhere strictly to standard English grammar conventions. A linguist might therefore classify it as not entirely grammatically correct. In English, when comparing the similarity between two or more things, native speakers usually use \\"to\\", not \\"with\\" following \\"similar\\". The correct version of this sentence would be \\"These are similar to the bottles\\" which suggests that the items being referred to share common features with the bottles. The preposition \\"with\\" can be used with \\"similar\\" but mostly as part of the phrase \\"similarly with\\" which is used to introduce a comparison with another situation where the same or similar results are expected. So, \\"similar with\\" is somewhat non-standard in English language usage. Additionally, \\"These\\" is a deictic word, meaning it refers to something already mentioned or understood in the discourse, or something being indicated or pointed to. So, it would be important to ensure clarity of reference in the broader text where the sentence is located. In linguistics, validity of a sentence can be judged in various ways. As far as strict grammatical rules based on the syntax and semantics of Standard English are concerned, this sentence would be deemed incorrect by a linguist. However, in terms of pragmatics, which deals with language in use and the contexts in which it is used, a linguist could argue it does make sense, as its intended meaning can be inferred. Practical understanding could overrule strict grammar rules depending on context. This approach is often used in analysis of various non-standard dialects and global Englishes, where variations from Standard English grammar can be common and accepted. So, while from a prescriptive grammatical point of view, the sentence might be considered incorrect, from a descriptive or pragmatic point of view, the situation might not be so clear-cut. The approach of the linguist and their specific area of interest within linguistics – whether that’s syntax, semantics, pragmatics, sociolinguistics, etc. – would influence their judgement."},{"question":"What are the keywords in the following sentence: football player smiles during a press conference to announce his new contract at the stadium .","response":"1. football player: This is the main subject of the sentence and is essential to understanding the context of the event. 2. smiles: This action is the focus of the description and provides information about the football player's emotional state during the event. 3. press conference: This is the setting of the event and is necessary for understanding where the football player's action takes place. 4. new contract: This is the key reason behind the press conference and the football player's celebration. 5. stadium: This helps provide the location of the event, adding context to the press conference.

Making a nearly disastrous landing attempt in heavy fog against orders and disqualifying the squadron during a competitive shooting exercise by colliding with the target drogue does not endear him to his fellow pilots. He also asks out a woman he has met, Lorna, not knowing that she is the squadron commander Billy Gary's (Walter Pidgeon) wife. However, Drake is earnest and contrite. He mixes with the Hellcats at the Garys' large house, which the sociable couple have opened as an unofficial officers' club. His flying and his social errors are forgiven, and his fellow pilots accept him, nicknaming him \\"Pensacola\\".

This makes sense, as Trump already has an evening newscast that streams daily on Facebook Live.

The casting notice says that it’s looking to hire people for an “up-and-coming conservative media network currently in development,” although it doesn’t specify who is doing the developing. More specifically, the casting notice says that it wants on-air hosts and reporters who are “knowledgeable about conservative viewpoints, current events and the presidential election,” and who also look “upscale and intelligent” and are “outspoken and energetic.” The audition also specifies that the network’s content will be streamed over the web, which suggests it might not be a traditional cable news network. One issue for the Trump campaign this election cycle has been the low quality of its surrogates — after all, very few people think that Katrina Pierson or Corey Lewandowski are “knowledgeable about current events.” In other words, it sounds like the network is looking to cast people of a higher caliber than the ones who currently represent the Trump campaign on national TV. Auditions for the network are being held in New York on Nov. 7, the day before the presidential election. ||||| What is a summary?","response":"Donald Trump is speculated to be behind an emerging conservative media network which is currently recruiting staff, including hosts, reporters and articulate, right-leaning panelists. A leaked casting notice indicates the network will stream its initial programming over the internet, hinting towards a non-traditional format less reliant on cable TV. This aligns with Trump's existing foray into online media - evening newscasts streamed daily via Facebook Live. The auditions are to be held in a New York City studio. Although Trump denied plans to start a media company, his son-in-law has previously looked into launching a Trump television network. Select insiders also report conversations with former Fox News CEO, Roger Ailes, piquing speculation of a fallback plan should the presidency bid fail."},{"question":"Generate a context and a hypothesis.","response":"Context: Imagine you are at a park, and you see various animals like squirrels, birds, and bunnies playing around.

And I was wondering Why did Ash do this? Available options: (1). do some research. (2). talk to a doctor. (3). ensure she would live a long, cancer-free life.","response":"Based on the information provided and the available options, it seems Ash has acted upon her knowledge of carrying a gene that predisposes her to breast cancer. The decision to get a mastectomy can involve multiple factors. Here's a step-by-step rationale: 1. Genetic testing: First, Ash has done a genetic test which revealed that she carries a gene for breast cancer. BRCA1 and BRCA2 are the most common genes involved in hereditary breast and ovarian cancers. People with these gene mutations have a higher risk of developing these cancers. 2. Counselling: Ash must have been counseled by a genetic counselor or doctor who explained the risks associated with the presence of the gene mutation. This session probably included discussions about preventive measures and risk-reducing strategies. 3. Consideration: Ash must have considered all the implications, including her personal and family medical history, the likelihood of cancer occurrence, and the effects of a mastectomy. This is a personal decision, taking into account the emotional, mental, and physical impacts. 4. Decision: Ash decided for a preventive mastectomy. This is a surgery to remove one or both breasts in an attempt to prevent or reduce the risk of breast cancer in women at high risk of developing the disease. 5. Objective: Ash mainly did this to ensure she would live a long, cancer-free life. This preventive measure drastically reduces the risk of developing breast cancer in women with a very high risk. 6. Long-term perspective: Even though this is a drastic measure, Ash has taken a longer-term view of her health and well-being to reduce her risk of breast cancer which was potentially highly likely due to the gene mutation. In summary, Ash chose option (3). Her decision was based on test results, potential risk, and likely advice from healthcare professionals, with the aim of living a long, cancer-free life. It's important to remember that this choice can vary for individuals based on personal circumstances and preferences, and it's a very personal decision to make."},{"question":"Article: VATICAN CITY — With a puff of white smoke from the chimney of the Sistine Chapel and to the cheers of thousands of rain-soaked faithful, a gathering of Catholic cardinals picked a new pope from among their midst on Wednesday — choosing the cardinal from Argentina, the first South American to lead the church. The new pope, Jorge Mario Bergoglio (pronounced Ber-GOAL-io), will be called Francis, the 266th pontiff of the Roman Catholic Church. He is also the first non-European pope in more than 1,200 years and the first member of the Jesuit order to lead the church. In choosing Francis, 76, who had been the archbishop of Buenos Aires, the cardinals sent a powerful message that the future of the church lies in the global south, home to the bulk of the world’s Catholics. “I would like to thank you for your embrace,” the new pope, dressed in white, said from the white balcony on St. Peter’s Basilica as thousands cheered joyously below. “My brother cardinals have chosen one who is from far away, but here I am.” Speaking in Italian as he blessed the faithful, Francis asked the audience to “pray for me, and we’ll see each other soon.” “Good night, and have a good rest,” he concluded, in a grandfatherly, almost casual tone. “Habemus papam!” members of the crowd shouted in Latin, waving umbrellas and flags. “We have a pope!” Others cried, “Viva il Papa!” “It was like waiting for the birth of a baby, only better,” said a Roman man, Giuliano Uncini. A child sitting atop his father’s shoulders waved a crucifix. Francis is known as a humble man who spoke out for the poor and led an austere life in Buenos Aires. He was born to Italian immigrant parents and was raised in the Argentine capital. The new pope inherits a church wrestling with an array of challenges that intensified during his predecessor, Benedict XVI, including a shortage of priests, growing competition from evangelical churches in the Southern Hemisphere, a sexual abuse crisis that has undermined the church’s moral authority in the West and difficulties governing the Vatican itself. Benedict abruptly ended his troubled eight-year papacy last month, announcing he was no longer up to the rigors of the job. He became the first pontiff in 598 years to resign. The 115 cardinals who are younger than 80 and eligible to vote chose their new leader after two days of voting. Pope Francis spoke by telephone with Benedict on Wednesday evening, said a Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi. He called it “an act of great significance and pastorality” that Francis’ first act as pope was to offer a prayer for his predecessor. The Rev. Thomas Rosica of Canada, another Vatican spokesman, recalled meeting Cardinal Bergoglio a decade ago during preparations for World Youth Day in Canada, and said the cardinal had told him that he lived very simply, in an apartment Buenos Aires, and sold the archdiocese’s mansion. “He cooks for himself and took great pride in telling us that, and that he took the bus to work” rather than riding in a car, Father Rosica said. President Obama was among the first world leaders to congratulate Francis in a message that emphasized the pope’s humble roots and New World background. “As a champion of the poor and the most vulnerable among us, he carries forth the message of love and compassion that has inspired the world for more than 2,000 years — that in each other we see the face of God,” Mr. Obama said in a message released by the White House. “As the first pope from the Americas,” the president added, “his selection also speaks to the strength and vitality of a region that is increasingly shaping our world, and alongside millions of Hispanic Americans, those of us in the United States share the joy of this historic day.” A doctrinal conservative, Francis has opposed liberation theology, abortion, gay marriage and the ordination of women, standing with his predecessor in holding largely traditional views. Reporting was contributed by Daniel J. Wakin, Laurie Goodstein, Stefania Rousselle and Gaia Pianigiani from Vatican City, Alan Cowell from Paris, Larry Rohter from Portland, Ore., and Rick Gladstone from New York. ||||| Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio, who has become the Catholic church's 266th pope, is the choice of humility, a Jesuit intellectual who travels by bus and has a practical approach to poverty: when he was appointed a cardinal, Bergoglio persuaded hundreds of Argentinians not to fly to Rome to celebrate with him but instead to give the money they would have spent on plane tickets to the poor. Something of a surprise choice – he was quoted as a 30/1 outsider going into the conclave – the archbishop of Buenos Aires was one of the leading challengers to Joseph Ratzinger during the 2005 conclave that elected the latter as Benedict XVI. A champion of those who rejected liberation theology, he was considered a candidate that everyone in the higher echelons of the church respects. He becomes the church's first Latin American pope. Much is made of his humility: he gave up the grandiose setting of the cardinal's residence in the Argentine capital for the trappings of a small apartment, and rejected the notion of a chauffeur driven car for public transport. Bergoglio, who will take the name Francis as pope, was born in December 1936, one of five children of an Italian railway worker. He reportedly had a lung removed while a teenager, due to an infection. He taught literature and psychology in Argentina before being ordained in 1969. He was created a cardinal by John Paul II on 21 February 2001. Unlike other cardinals, he has been untarnished by the various scandals rocking the Catholic church, and is thought to want to make reform of the Curia a priority. He was a fierce opponent of Argentina's decision to legalise gay marriage in 2010, arguing children need to have the right to be raised and educated by a father and a mother. But he takes a slightly more pragmatic view on contraception, believing that it can be permissible to prevent the spread of disease. He is ecumenical, believing in interfaith dialogue. In 2009 Bergoglio made headlines when he criticised the government of Néstor Kirchner, husband of current Argentinian president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, claiming it was \\"immoral, illegitimate and unjust\\" to allow inequality in the country to grow. \\"Rather than preventing that, it seems they have opted for making inequalities even greater,\\" he said. \\"Human rights are not only violated by terrorism, repression or assassination, but also by unfair economic structures that creates huge inequalities,\\" he said at the time. • This article was amended on 14 March 2013. It wrongly described Bergoglio as a champion of liberation theology and referred to the government of Ernesto Kirchner when it should have read Néstor Kirchner. Both errors have been corrected. ||||| Pope Francis is the first ever from the Americas, an austere Jesuit intellectual who modernized Argentina's conservative Catholic church. Pope Francis waves to the crowd from the central balcony of St. Peter's Basilica at the Vatican, Wednesday, March 13, 2013. Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio who chose the name of Francis is the 266th pontiff... (Associated Press) Known until Wednesday as Jorge Bergoglio, the 76-year-old is known as a humble man who denied himself the luxuries that previous Buenos Aires cardinals enjoyed. He came close to becoming pope last time, reportedly gaining the second-highest vote total in several rounds of voting before he bowed out of the running in the conclave that elected Pope Benedict XVI. Groups of supporters waved Argentine flags in St. Peter's Square as Francis, wearing simple white robes, made his first public appearance as pope. \\"Ladies and Gentlemen, good evening,\\" he said before making a reference to his roots in Latin America, which accounts for about 40 percent of the world's Roman Catholics . Bergoglio often rode the bus to work, cooked his own meals and regularly visited the slums that ring Argentina's capital. He considers social outreach, rather than doctrinal battles, to be the essential business of the church. He accused fellow church leaders of hypocrisy and forgetting that Jesus Christ bathed lepers and ate with prostitutes. \\"Jesus teaches us another way: Go out. Go out and share your testimony, go out and interact with your brothers, go out and share, go out and ask. Become the Word in body as well as spirit,\\" Bergoglio told Argentina's priests last year. Bergoglio's legacy as cardinal includes his efforts to repair the reputation of a church that lost many followers by failing to openly challenge Argentina's murderous 1976-83 dictatorship. He also worked to recover the church's traditional political influence in society, but his outspoken criticism of President Cristina Kirchner couldn't stop her from imposing socially liberal measures that are anathema to the church, from gay marriage and adoption to free contraceptives for all. \\"In our ecclesiastical region there are priests who don't baptize the children of single mothers because they weren't conceived in the sanctity of marriage,\\" Bergoglio told his priests. \\"These are today's hypocrites. Those who clericalize the Church. Those who separate the people of God from salvation. And this poor girl who, rather than returning the child to sender, had the courage to carry it into the world, must wander from parish to parish so that it's baptized!\\" Bergoglio compared this concept of Catholicism, \\"this Church of \`come inside so we make decisions and announcements between ourselves and those who don't come in, don't belong,\\" to the Pharisees of Christ's time _ people who congratulate themselves while condemning all others. This sort of pastoral work, aimed at capturing more souls and building the flock, was an essential skill for any religious leader in the modern era, said Bergoglio's authorized biographer, Sergio Rubin. But Bergoglio himself felt most comfortable taking a very low profile, and his personal style was the antithesis of Vatican splendor. \\"It's a very curious thing: When bishops meet, he always wants to sit in the back rows. This sense of humility is very well seen in Rome,\\" Rubin said before the 2013 conclave to choose Benedict's successor. Bergoglio's influence seemed to stop at the presidential palace door after Nestor Kirchner and then his wife, Cristina Fernandez, took over the Argentina's government. His outspoken criticism couldn't prevent Argentina from becoming the Latin American country to legalize gay marriage, or stop Fernandez from promoting free contraception and artificial insemination. His church had no say when the Argentine Supreme Court expanded access to legal abortions in rape cases, and when Bergoglio argued that gay adoptions discriminate against children, Fernandez compared his tone to \\"medieval times and the Inquisition.\\" This kind of demonization is unfair, says Rubin, who obtained an extremely rare interview of Bergoglio for his biography, the \\"The Jesuit.\\" \\"Is Bergoglio a progressive _ a liberation theologist even? No. He's no third-world priest. Does he criticize the International Monetary Fund, and neoliberalism? Yes. Does he spend a great deal of time in the slums? Yes,\\" Rubin said. Bergoglio has stood out for his austerity. Even after he became Argentina's top church official in 2001, he never lived in the ornate church mansion where Pope John Paul II stayed when visiting the country, preferring a simple bed in a downtown building, heated by a small stove on frigid weekends. For years, he took public transportation around the city, and cooked his own meals. Bergoglio almost never granted media interviews, limiting himself to speeches from the pulpit, and was reluctant to contradict his critics, even when he knew their allegations against him were false, said Rubin. That attitude was burnished as human rights activists tried to force him to answer uncomfortable questions about what church officials knew and did about the dictatorship's abuses after the 1976 coup. Many Argentines remain angry over the church's acknowledged failure to openly confront a regime that was kidnapping and killing thousands of people as it sought to eliminate \\"subversive elements\\" in society. It's one reason why more than two-thirds of Argentines describe themselves as Catholic, but fewer than 10 percent regularly attend mass. Under Bergoglio's leadership, Argentina's bishops issued a collective apology in October 2012 for the church's failures to protect its flock. But the statement blamed the era's violence in roughly equal measure on both the junta and its enemies. \\"Bergoglio has been very critical of human rights violations during the dictatorship, but he has always also criticized the leftist guerrillas; he doesn't forget that side,\\" Rubin said. The bishops also said \\"we exhort those who have information about the location of stolen babies, or who know where bodies were secretly buried, that they realize they are morally obligated to inform the pertinent authorities.\\" That statement came far too late for some activists, who accused Bergoglio of being more concerned about the church's image than about aiding the many human rights investigations of the Kirchners' era. Bergoglio twice invoked his right under Argentine law to refuse to appear in open court, and when he eventually did testify in 2010, his answers were evasive, human rights attorney Myriam Bregman said. At least two cases directly involved Bergoglio. One examined the torture of two of his Jesuit priests _ Orlando Yorio and Francisco Jalics _ who were kidnapped in 1976 from the slums where they advocated liberation theology. Yorio accused Bergoglio of effectively handing them over to the death squads by declining to tell the regime that he endorsed their work. Jalics refused to discuss it after moving into seclusion in a German monastery. Both men were freed after Bergoglio took extraordinary, behind-the-scenes action to save them _ including persuading dictator Jorge Videla's family priest to call in sick so that he could say Mass in the junta leader's home, where he privately appealed for mercy. His intervention likely saved their lives, but Bergoglio never shared the details until Rubin interviewed him for the 2010 biography. Bergoglio _ who ran Argentina's Jesuit order during the dictatorship _ told Rubin that he regularly hid people on church property during the dictatorship, and once gave his identity papers to a man with similar features, enabling him to escape across the border. But all this was done in secret, at a time when church leaders publicly endorsed the junta and called on Catholics to restore their \\"love for country\\" despite the terror in the streets. Rubin said failing to challenge the dictators was simply pragmatic at a time when so many people were getting killed, and attributed Bergoglio's later reluctance to share his side of the story as a reflection of his humility. But Bregman said Bergoglio's own statements proved church officials knew from early on that the junta was torturing and killing its citizens, and yet publicly endorsed the dictators. \\"The dictatorship could not have operated this way without this key support,\\" she said. Bergoglio also was accused of turning his back on a family that lost five relatives to state terror, including a young woman who was 5-months' pregnant before she was kidnapped and killed in 1977. The De la Cuadra family appealed to the leader of the Jesuits in Rome, who urged Bergoglio to help them; Bergoglio then assigned a monsignor to the case. Months passed before the monsignor came back with a written note from a colonel: It revealed that the woman had given birth in captivity to a girl who was given to a family \\"too important\\" for the adoption to be reversed. Despite this written evidence in a case he was personally involved with, Bergoglio testified in 2010 that he didn't know about any stolen babies until well after the dictatorship was over. \\"Bergoglio has a very cowardly attitude when it comes to something so terrible as the theft of babies. He says he didn't know anything about it until 1985,\\" said the baby's aunt, Estela de la Cuadra, whose mother Alicia co-founded the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo in 1977 in hopes of identifying these babies. \\"He doesn't face this reality and it doesn't bother him. The question is how to save his name, save himself. But he can't keep these allegations from reaching the public. The people know how he is.\\" Initially trained as a chemist, Bergoglio taught literature, psychology, philosophy and theology before taking over as Buenos Aires archbishop in 1998. He became cardinal in 2001, when the economy was collapsing, and won respect for blaming unrestrained capitalism for impoverishing millions of Argentines. Later, there was little love lost between Bergoglio and Fernandez. Their relations became so frigid that the president stopped attending his annual \\"Te Deum\\" address, when church leaders traditionally tell political leaders what's wrong with society. During the dictatorship era, other church leaders only feebly mentioned a need to respect human rights. When Bergoglio spoke to the powerful, he was much more forceful. In his 2012 address, he said Argentina was being harmed by demagoguery, totalitarianism, corruption and efforts to secure unlimited power. The message resonated in a country whose president was ruling by decree, where political scandals rarely were punished and where top ministers openly lobbied for Fernandez to rule indefinitely. ___ Warren reported from Buenos Aires, Argentina. ||||| Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio has been chosen as Pope Francis, leader of the Holy See in Rome. That's all well and good, it's nice that heavily-Catholic South America is getting its due and I found it interesting that a Jesuit chose to name himself after a Franciscan.While many inside the Catholic church (and always those outside) will find plenty to criticize - he is against both abortion and euthanasia and preaches tolerance for homosexuality but does not endorse it - we have one of the most cosmopolitan Pope's ever. He's the son of immigrants and became a Cardinal in Argentina and now runs a multinational church, its own nation, situated inside Italy. He rode public transportation, lived in a small apartment heated by a small stove rather than the ornate quarters provided to Cardinals and he cooked his own meals. He does a lot for the poor and, importantly for the 21st century, he has a master's degree in chemistry.As I have noted before, we have had back-to-back Popes with solid support for science . It isn't going to satisfy every militant who thinks every form of biology should be embraced (yet don't complain at all that the Obama administration bans somatic cell nuclear transfer) but the Catholics have the oldest science institute in the world, Galileo was one of its first presidents, and this carries on a long tradition of advancement of science among Catholics.Pope Francis is a humble man and that's good, because 21st century science is humbling.

City. Let's scrutinize all options for a clear understanding: A. Field: While outdoor markets are common in many places, an enclosed market suggests a permanent structure typically seen in more urban settings. Fields are usually open spaces primarily used for agriculture or sports, and thus, are less likely to harbor enclosed markets. B. Village: Villages sometimes might have outdoor markets or small shops, but they are less likely to possess large enclosed markets. These are common in densely populated areas with a wide variety of goods and services to offer. C. Rural Area: A rural area often has less population density, and people living here are more likely to rely on farming and local produce selling. Due to the lack of substantial commercial demand and less densely populated areas, enclosed markets are less frequent here. D. City: Enclosed markets entail more significant structure, variety, and they are designed to cater to the diverse needs of a highly populated area. These characteristics align with the general features of a city. Subsequently, cities provide the infrastructure, population, and demand for a diverse range of products that make large, enclosed markets viable and lucrative. Enclosed markets in cities can offer everything from food to clothing, technology and other services. Therefore, we can say that a city is the place where a market is likely to be enclosed. E. Mexico: This is not an appropriate answer, as Mexico is an entire country and markets can vary vastly depending on whether they're in larger cities or smaller towns or villages. In conclusion, option D- City, seems to be the most logical place for an enclosed market concerning the characteristics and functions of an enclosed market."},{"question":"In this task, you are given triplets.

Article: Everyone knows how the story of Cinderella ends, but did you ever really think about how she spent her days before she met the prince? Her daily routine was not fascinating.She did everything from sweeping the floor to cooking the meals.If someone had asked Cinderella, \\"Are there any kinds of household work that you particularly hate?\\" she probably would have answered, \\"Why, none, of course.Housework is my duty!\\" In the real world, however, most people have definite dislikes for certain sorts of household work.Two of these tasks are ironing clothes and washing dishes. Ironing clothes is most hated because it is not a task that can be completed quickly or thoughtlessly. Each piece of clothing must be handled individually, so ironing a basket of laundry can take hours! After ironing a piece of clothing with great caution, which-requires smoothing out the fabric, and following the seams ,you need to place it on a hanger as soon as possible.If you do not follow these directions carefully, it might become wrinkled and you have to start over.Perhaps that is why ironing is not a favorite thing to do.It calls for extreme attention to detail from beginning to end. Another household job that many people dislike is washing dishes.Of course, some people claim that this work is no longer a problem because we have dishwashers now! However, no one would argue that dishes, silverware, and especially pots and pans washed in a dishwasher don't come out as clean as they do when washed by hand.For this reason, many of us continues to wash our dishes by hand, but we are not necessarily happy doing it.Cleaning dishes is a job that not only takes a lot of energy but also requires the patience to wash and dry them.In addition, unlike ironing clothes, washing dishes is a thing that usually must be done every day.I don't know how Cinderella felt about this particular task, but I believe that most people hate it as much as I do.

El Mariachi is recruited by CIA agent Sheldon Jeffrey Sands to kill General Emiliano Marquez, a corrupt Mexican Army officer who has been hired by Mexican drug lord Armando Barillo to assassinate the President of Mexico and overthrow the government. Many years before, El Mariachi and his wife Carolina confronted Marquez in a shootout and wounded the general; in retaliation, Marquez took the lives of Carolina and their daughter in an ambush. In addition to El Mariachi, Sands persuades former FBI agent Jorge Ramírez to come out of retirement and kill Barillo, who had murdered his partner Archuleta in the past. Furthermore, AFN operative Ajedrez is assigned by Sands to tail Barillo. While monitoring Barillo's activities, Ramírez meets Billy Chambers, an American fugitive who has been living under the protection of Barillo, but can no longer stomach the horrible tasks he's been forced to carry out for him.

The goal is to classify the review as \\"POS\\" if the overall sentiment of the review is positive or as \\"NEG\\" if the overall sentiment of the review is negative. Q: Makes Me Want to Go Build a New House . I review a lot of architecture books, and this one more than most makes me want to go out and build a new house. The subject of the book is small houses. It consists of pictures and the story of some fifty houses, all of which are less than 1,300 square feet. Many of them are much less than 1,300 feet, indeed down into the 300-400 square foot size. I live in a small house -- 900 square feet or so -- that's about a hundred years old. But compared to the layout, the beauty the simplicity of design, mine's a dump. I'm getting the urge to go visit a realtor friend. One thing about these houses is that many of them are on what would be considered hard to build on lots. And such lots tend to be cheap. There's a new architect in town that's fresh out of school and may have more originality than the older guys. Maybe if I give her this book, with a few houses marked. Hmmmmm! One thing I didn't like, most of the bed rooms are on the second floor. I was in a house once that had a fire. The amount of smoke generated in just a minute or two was incredible. I don't want a bed room upstairs, if necessary I want to be able to close the door to keep the smoke out and get out through a wondow or emergency door. Other than that, this is a great idea book. The pictures are beautiful. There's not as much detail as I would like, but adding detail would have to mean either fewer houses or bigger book, so I guess it's a nice balance A:","response":"Part #1: Classify the review as \\"POS\\" or \\"NEG\\" Usage: \\"POS\\" The given review is positive as the reviewer mostly praises the architecture book, its ideas and images. They express their desire to build a new house inspired by the book, and even though they mention a small negative aspect (regarding bedrooms being on the second floor), the overall sentiment is positive. Part #2: Determining the overall sentiment Usage: Positive sentiment. The reviewer states that the book \\"makes me want to go out and build a new house\\" and calls it \\"a great idea book.\\" These statements reflect a positive sentiment towards the book. Part #3: Identifying a negative aspect Usage: Bedrooms on the second floor. The reviewer specifically mentions they don't like that most of the bedrooms in the book's houses are on the second floor due to smoke concerns in case of a fire. This is a negative aspect, but it does not outweigh the overall positive sentiment."},{"question":"Information: - Catherine Rosalind Russell (June 4, 1907 November 28, 1976) was an American actress of stage and screen, known for her role as fast-talking newspaper reporter Hildy Johnson in the Howard Hawks screwball comedy \\"His Girl Friday\\" (1940), as well as for her portrayals of Mame Dennis in \\"Auntie Mame\\" (1958) and Rose in \\"Gypsy\\" (1962).

A key part of the reaction is ensuring that the sodium hydroxide is dissolved in water before adding the other materials. Justin adds the sodium hydroxide to reaction A, and sets the heat to high. Justin can't use high heat for his second reaction, though, because the electricity supply is too weak to have both burners on high. Because of this, Justin adds the sodium hydroxide to reaction B and sets the heat to low. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: In which reaction will the sodium hydroxide dissolve faster? Hint: When you add sugar to a cold drink, you may stir it to help the sugar dissolve. If you don’t stir, the sugar may eventually dissolve, but it will take much longer. Stirring is one of several factors that affect how fast a solute dissolves in a solvent. Temperature is another factor. A solid solute dissolves faster at a higher temperature. For example, sugar dissolves faster in hot tea than in ice tea. A third factor that affects the rate of dissolving is the surface area of the solute. For example, if you put granulated sugar in a glass of ice tea, it will dissolve more quickly than the same amount of sugar in a cube. That’s because granulated sugar has much more surface area than a cube of sugar. You can see videos of all three factors at these URLs Answer:","response":"In the given scenario, the sodium hydroxide will dissolve faster in reaction A compared to reaction B. The reason behind this is the temperature factor mentioned in the hint. A solid solute dissolves faster at a higher temperature. In reaction A, the heat is set to high, which means the sodium hydroxide will be exposed to a higher temperature. This will cause the sodium hydroxide to dissolve more quickly than in reaction B, where the heat is set to low, resulting in a lower temperature. This principle is similar to the example of sugar dissolving faster in hot tea compared to iced tea. Just like sugar, sodium hydroxide is a solid solute that dissolves faster when exposed to a higher temperature. In both reactions, the sodium hydroxide is being dissolved in water, which acts as the solvent. The other factors affecting the rate of dissolving - stirring and surface area – are not specified in the given information; hence, the primary factor determining the dissolving rate in this case is the temperature. Therefore, based on the information provided and the factors affecting the rate of dissolving, the sodium hydroxide will dissolve faster in reaction A, where the heat is set to high."},{"question":"Is make used to mean the same thing in the next two sentences? She may not make the grade. We made it!","response":"To determine the meaning of \\"make\\" in both sentences, let's investigate the context and analyze the usage of the word. Sentence 1: She may not make the grade. Here, \\"make\\" refers to achieving or attaining a particular level or grade. The sentence is about someone potentially not achieving a certain academic or performance standard. Step 1: Identify the context which is about achieving a level or grade. Step 2: Understand \\"make\\" as a verb that signifies reaching or attaining that level or grade. Sentence 2: We made it! In this sentence, \\"make\\" is used to express success or accomplishment of reaching a destination or completing a task.

Step 2: Understand \\"make\\" as a verb that signifies succeeding or achieving the set goal. In conclusion, while \\"make\\" in both sentences refers to a sense of achievement, the specific meaning is not exactly the same: - In the first sentence, \\"make\\" refers to achieving a particular level or standard, which is about meeting a specific requirement. - In the second sentence, \\"make\\" conveys the idea of success or completion, which is more general and focuses more on the process of accomplishing something.

The difference lies in the last part: 1st Sentence: \\"and sang snippets of her songs.\\" This part tells us that, in addition to chanting \\"Celia, Celia,\\" people were also singing bits from her songs. This implies that Celia is likely a singer or had songs associated with her. 2nd Sentence: No additional information.

Arabic spread into some parts of Western Iran (Khuzestan), and Turkic languages spread through much of Central Asia, displacing various Iranian languages such as Sogdian and Bactrian in parts of what is today Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. In Eastern Europe, mostly comprising the territory of modern-day Ukraine, southern European Russia, and parts of the Balkans, the core region of the native Scythians, Sarmatians, and Alans had been decisively been taken over as a result of absorption and assimilation (e.g. Slavicisation) by the various Proto-Slavic population of the region, by the 6th century AD. This resulted in the displacement and extinction of the once predominant Scythian languages of the region. Sogdian's close relative Yaghnobi barely survives in a small area of the Zarafshan valley east of Samarkand, and Saka as Ossetic in the Caucasus, which is the sole remnant of the once predominant Scythian languages in Eastern Europe proper and large parts of the North Caucasus.

A:","response":"The adaptation to new languages in different regions during the 500s resulted in the displacement and near extinction of several traditional Iranian languages. This occurred as Arabic spread into regions of western Iran, and Turkic languages permeated throughout Central Asia, displacing languages such as Sogdian and Bactrian in regions that are now parts of Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan. In Eastern Europe, the regions where Scythian languages predominated were overcome due to absorption and assimilation by Proto-Slavic populations. These events led to significant language shifts, reducing the areas where Iranian languages were spoken, and also resulted in the almost complete disappearance of the once prevalent Scythian languages."},{"question":"Choose the next sentence for this paragraph.

Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state. - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux. - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - The transition between the end of the Eocene and the beginning of the Oligocene is marked by large-scale extinction and floral and faunal turnover (although minor in comparison to the largest mass extinctions). Most of the affected organisms were marine or aquatic in nature. They included the last of the ancient cetaceans, the Archaeoceti. - Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), they are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix. - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - A mediterranean climate or dry summer climate is the climate typical of the lands in the Mediterranean Basin. The lands around the Mediterranean Sea form the largest area where this climate type is found, but it also is found in most of coastal California, in parts of Western and South Australia, in southwestern South Africa, sections of Central Asia, and in central Chile. - Megadontosuchus is a genus of tomistomine crocodylian from the middle Eocene of Italy . Fossils have been found from Monte Duello in the province of Verona . The genus is currently monotypic , with the type and only species being M. arduini . The species was originally named in 1880 , although it was assigned to the genus Crocodilius ( now spelled Crocodylus ) . The genus was first erected by paleontologist Charles C. Mook in 1955 along with the tomistomine genus Kentisuchus , which was also first classified as Crocodilius . No holotype for Megadontosuchus was designated in 1880 , and a lectotype was n't proposed until 2007 . Megadontosuchus differs from other tomistomines in that it has a more robust rostrum , very large teeth ( hence the generic name meaning big - toothed crocodile ) , and large supratemporal fenestrae on the skull table . - The Paleogene (or ; also spelled Palaeogene or Palæogene; informally Lower Tertiary) is a geologic period and system that spans 43 million years from the end of the Cretaceous Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Neogene Period Mya. It is the beginning of the Cenozoic Era of the present Phanerozoic Eon. The Paleogene is most notable for being the time during which mammals diversified from relatively small, simple forms into a large group of diverse animals in the wake of the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event that ended the preceding Cretaceous Period. - The Eocene Epoch, lasting from , is a major division of the geologic timescale and the second epoch of the Paleogene Period in the Cenozoic Era. The Eocene spans the time from the end of the Paleocene Epoch to the beginning of the Oligocene Epoch. The start of the Eocene is marked by a brief period in which the concentration of the carbon isotope C in the atmosphere was exceptionally low in comparison with the more common isotope C. The end is set at a major extinction event called the \\"Grande Coupure\\" (the \\"Great Break\\" in continuity) or the EoceneOligocene extinction event, which may be related to the impact of one or more large bolides in Siberia and in what is now Chesapeake Bay. As with other geologic periods, the strata that define the start and end of the epoch are well identified, though their exact dates are slightly uncertain. - Crocodylus is one of three genera from the subfamily Crocodylinae of the family Crocodylidae. - In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies. - Kentisuchus is an extinct genus of tomistomine crocodylian. It is considered one of the most basal members of the subfamily. Fossils have been found from England and France that date back to the early Eocene. The genus has also been recorded from Ukraine, but it unclear whether specimens from Ukraine are referable to \\"Kentisuchus\\". - The International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN) is the set of rules and recommendations dealing with the formal botanical names that are given to plants, fungi and a few other groups of organisms, all those \\"traditionally treated as algae, fungi, or plants\\". It was formerly called the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN); the name was changed at the International Botanical Congress in Melbourne in July 2011 as part of the \\"Melbourne Code\\" which replaces the \\"Vienna Code\\" of 2005. As with previous codes, it took effect as soon as it was ratified by the congress (on Saturday 23 July 2011), but the documentation of the code in its final form was not finished until some time after the congressional meeting. Preliminary wording of some of the articles with the most significant changes has been published in September 2011. - Ukraine (tr. ) is a sovereign state in Eastern Europe, bordered by Russia to the east and northeast, Belarus to the northwest, Poland and Slovakia to the west, Hungary, Romania, and Moldova to the southwest, and the Black Sea and Sea of Azov to the south and southeast, respectively. Ukraine is currently in territorial dispute with Russia over the Crimean Peninsula which Russia annexed in 2014 but which Ukraine and most of the international community recognise as Ukrainian. Including Crimea, Ukraine has an area of , making it the largest country entirely within Europe and the 46th largest country in the world. It has a population of about 44.5 million, making it the 32nd most populous country in the world. - Switzerland, officially the Swiss Confederation, is a federal republic in Europe. It consists of 26 cantons, and the city of Bern is the seat of the federal authorities. The country is situated in Western-Central Europe, and is bordered by Italy to the south, France to the west, Germany to the north, and Austria and Liechtenstein to the east. Switzerland is a landlocked country geographically divided between the Alps, the Swiss Plateau and the Jura, spanning an area of . While the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory, the Swiss population of approximately eight million people is concentrated mostly on the plateau, where the largest cities are to be found: among them are the two global cities and economic centres Zürich and Geneva. - Sexual reproduction is a form of reproduction where two morphologically distinct types of specialized reproductive cells called gametes fuse together, involving a female's large ovum (or egg) and a male's smaller sperm. Each gamete contains half the number of chromosomes of normal cells. They are created by a specialized type of cell division, which only occurs in eukaryotic cells, known as meiosis. The two gametes fuse during fertilization to produce DNA replication and the creation of a single-celled zygote which includes genetic material from both gametes. In a process called genetic recombination, genetic material (DNA) joins up so that homologous chromosome sequences are aligned with each other, and this is followed by exchange of genetic information. Two rounds of cell division then produce four daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes from each original parent cell, and the same number of chromosomes as both parents, though self-fertilization can occur. For instance, in human reproduction each human cell contains 46 chromosomes, 23 pairs, except gamete cells, which only contain 23 chromosomes, so the child will have 23 chromosomes from each parent genetically recombined into 23 pairs. Cell division initiates the development of a new individual organism in multicellular organisms, including animals and plants, for the vast majority of whom this is the primary method of reproduction. - Vatican City , officially Vatican City State or the State of Vatican City, is a walled enclave within the city of Rome. With an area of approximately 44 hectares (110 acres), and a population of 842, it is the smallest State in the world by both area and population, but formally it is not sovereign, sovereignty being held by the Holy See, the only entity of public international law that has diplomatic relations with almost every country in the world. - The Crocodylidae family of crocodylians includes the true crocodiles which are the members of the subfamily Crocodylinae and the \\"Tomistoma\\" genus. Currently, the family includes two subfamilies, Crocodylinae and Tomistominae, with the latter being a subject of controversy whether it is a crocodile or belongs to the family Gavialidae. Further genetic analysis has to be done to come to a final conclusion. - A holotype is a single physical example (or illustration) of an organism, known to have been used when the species (or lower-ranked taxon) was formally described. It is either the single such physical example (or illustration) or one of several such, but explicitly designated as the holotype. Under the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN), a holotype is one of several kinds of name-bearing types. In the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN) and ICZN the definitions of types are similar in intent but not identical in terminology or underlying concept.

The state's congressional delegation blasted the Trump administration and called on the president to view Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russia as a \\"threat\\" to national security. The spy ship is technically in international waters, but U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, shared the Fox News story on his Twitter page and wrote, “Russia is acting like it has a permission slip to expand influence, test limits of reach. Questions are obvious: does it, and if so, why?” A U.S. official said the Russian spy ship was “loitering” in the water, Fox News reports. Fox News states that the purpose of the Russian spy ship is to “intercept communication and collect data” on U.S. Navy sonar capability but adds that the ship has missiles, too.

Officials say they can’t recall a Russian spy ship advancing this far up the Eastern seaboard. Pentagon officials told Fox News they expect the ship to head back to the Caribbean eventually, but no timetable was given. \\"We are aware there is a ship,\\" Petty Officer Joshua Canup told Patch. Canup would only say that they were aware the ship is off the Atlantic coast. The Department of Defense released a statement to 47 ABC that echoed Canup's, saying the department was aware of the ship's presence and the vessel had not entered U.S. territorial waters. The department further stated that it \\"[respects] freedom of navigation exercised by all nations beyond the territorial sea of a coastal state consistent with international law.\\" Murphy later released an official statement Wednesday morning, stating a lack of surprise in regards to the spy ship incident. \\"While this is not wholly unprecedented, it’s part of a series of aggressive actions by Russia that threaten U.S. national security and the security of our allies,\\" Murphy said in a release. \\"Just yesterday, news broke that Russia violated an Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. Coupled with escalating fighting in eastern Ukraine and Russian jets buzzing a U.S. Navy destroyer in the Black Sea, Putin clearly thinks the Trump administration has given him a permission slip to flex his muscles.\\" Murphy further stated that President Trump and his administration must end their silence and immediately respond to what he and many consider threats to national security. Political leaders and officials from all over the state also responded directly to the situation, offering statements over social media and through their own personal channels. U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, also a Democrat from Connecticut, released his own statement to WNPR Wednesday afternoon via Twitter. The senator said the ship's presence \\"reflects a clear need to harden our defenses against electronic surveillance,\\" and that he is personally monitoring the situation by remaining in close contact with the Department of Defense and the U.S. Coast Guard. U.S. Rep. Joseph Courtney (CT-2), a Democrat and ranking member of the Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee, also released a statement Wednesday morning about the Russian spy ship. “A Russian spy ship patrolling 30 miles from the Groton SUBASE underscores that the threats posed by a resurgent Russia are real,” Courtney said in a release. “This unacceptable, aggressive action, combined with the buzzing of US Navy ships in the Red Sea yesterday are clearly testing the resolve of a new administration. While I have total confidence in our Navy’s vigilant, responsible readiness, the White House needs to move past their seeming infatuation with Putin and treat him like the serious threat to global peace and security that he has been for the last five years.” Congressman Jim Himes (CT-04) took time to remind citizens that the pressence of the ship does not present a direct threat to residents' physical safety. \\"In my opinion,\\" Himes said in a release, \\"Russia is making a show of strength and pushing established boundaries and norms to gauge the reaction of a new administration in disarray.” A Connecticut mayor and potential gubernatorial candidate, Dan Drew, of Middletown, tweeted directly to Trump Wednesday and wrote, \\"As a CT Mayor, I want to know if you'll protect our territory or bow in supplication to Putin.\\" U.S. Rep.

Trump, meanwhile, took to Twitter early Wednesday morning to denounce the recent reports, referring to the sources as \\"fake news.\\" This Russian connection non-sense is merely an attempt to cover-up the many mistakes made in Hillary Clinton's losing campaign. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 15, 2017 Read the full Fox News report here. Photo credit: GuyDeckerStudio ||||| A Russian spy ship is patrolling off the east coast of the United States, reports CBS News national security correspondent David Martin. The ship, known as an AGI (Auxiliary, General Intelligence), made a port call in Cuba and has been working its way up the east coast. Currently the ship is off the coast of Delaware, well in international waters. It is expected to continue north until it gets to the sub base at New London, Conn., then turn around and head south toward Cuba. The presence of foreign vessels and aircraft near U.S. territory is nothing new. In 2015, there was a flap about a Russian spy ship hanging out in a spot where the transatlantic cables are laid. The ship’s presence is one of various Russian provocations of late to test the Obama and now, the Trump administration, Martin reports. Just four days ago, an incident similar to last year’s buzzing by Russian jets of a U.S. Navy destroyer in the Baltic Sea happened again, this time in the Black Sea. First, a Russian patrol plane made a low pass close to the USS Porter, then two Russian jet fighters were followed a short time later by a third. U.S. officials called the fly-bys “unsafe and unprofessional.” ||||| A summary of this is?","response":"The news article reports about a Russian spy ship, Viktor Leonov, which was sailing about 30 miles south of the Navy submarine base in Groton, Connecticut. This discovery led to some tensions as it was unusual for a military ship to roam this far up on the Eastern seaboard alone. The report mentions that the spy ship is technically in international waters, hence hasn't violated any international laws. Its purpose is expected to be intercepting communication and collecting data on U.S. Navy sonar capabilities and has armed missiles. Several Connecticut officials and political leaders have expressed their concerns over the presence of the Russian ship. Senator Chris Murphy criticized the ship's activity, accusing Russia of acting as if it had permission to expand its influence and test the limits of its reach. In light of recent aggressive actions by Russia alongside this incident, he called on the Trump administration to take actions against what he considered threats to national security. A Pentagon official mentioned that they expect the ship to head back to the Caribbean eventually, but no specific schedule was provided. The Department of Defense stated that they were aware of the ship's presence and emphasized that every nation has the right to navigation freedom beyond the territorial sea of a country in accordance with international law. The department reassured that the ship hasn't entered U.S. territorial waters. Other Connecticut officials including Sen. Richard Blumenthal, Rep. Joseph Courtney, Rep. Jim Himes, potential gubernatorial candidate Mayor Dan Drew, and Rep. Rosa DeLauro also expressed their views on the issue. They concluded that the Russian ship's presence reflects a need to strengthen America's defenses against electronic surveillance and perceive this as Russia trying to test the resolve of the new administration. The report further linked this incident to the emerging revelations about the Trump administration's ties to Russia, including the dismissal of national security adviser Michael Flynn and speculated associational contacts with Russian intelligence officials prior to the election. Toward the end, the report discussed a similar incident in 2015, mentioning that it isn't uncommon to see foreign vessels and aircraft near U.S. territory. In summary, the Russian spy ship’s activities near a Navy submarine base in Connecticut have caused apprehension among state officials who are calling for increased defense against potential electronic surveillance and aggressive probing of Russia. However, because the ship is in international waters, it is technically abiding by international law. The incident is considered part of a series of Russian actions testing the resolve of the U.S., under the Obama and now Trump administrations."},{"question":"Port Melbourne is an inner suburb of Melbourne, Australia, 5 km south-west from Melbourne's Central Business District.

Being a global brand, why don't we see a WWE Shop specially directed towards Indian market? 2. Why don't Indians follow traffic rules? Step 1: Identifying the topics and contexts of each question Question 1 discusses the WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment) brand and its potential market specifically in India. The context is about the brand's presence and marketing strategy in the Indian market. Question 2 talks about the behavior of Indians with regards to following traffic rules, which is related to road safety and law enforcement.

In Los Angeles in November 2019, ex-police officer Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is detained by officer Gaff (Edward James Olmos) and brought to his former supervisor, Bryant (M. Emmet Walsh). Deckard, whose job as a \\"Blade Runner\\" was to track down bioengineered beings known as replicants and \\"retire\\" (a euphemism for killing) them, is informed that four have come to Earth illegally. As Tyrell Corporation Nexus-6 models, they have only a four-year lifespan and may have come to Earth to try to extend their lives.

Focus on chewing all of the food in your mouth to help form a bolus, which is a round mass of food that makes swallowing safer and easier. Some fruits, like watermelon, may only take 4-5 chews before it’s broken down enough to be easily digested. Avoid taking 1-2 bites and then swallowing your food or it won’t be properly digested, and you can experience gas, bloating, and intestinal discomfort. Count each of your bites as you chew tougher or crunchier foods such as cooked meat and vegetables like celery, radishes, or carrots to help break them down into more easily digestible pieces. Some foods may not need to be chewed as many times before they’re broken down enough to be swallowed easily, but aim for 30 chews. Take your time and count each of your chews to help slow yourself down and chew your food properly. Take your bites of food and chew them slowly, focusing on each chew so you can properly break the food down and mix it with digestive enzymes in your saliva. Avoid using quick, choppy bites, which won’t properly grind up your food. Eating more slowly also gives your stomach time to signal to your brain that you’re full, which will help you avoid overeating. Move harder or tougher foods such as nuts, seeds, and crunchy vegetables to the back of your mouth where your molars are so they can be properly chewed and broken up to make swallowing and digesting them easier. Avoid swallowing hard or tough pieces of food whole to reduce digestive issues. Your molars are designed to help you chew up tougher foods, so use them! As you’re chewing your food and breaking it down, use your tongue to move the pieces around your mouth so all of the food is evenly and properly chewed. Feel for pieces of food in your mouth with your tongue and move unchewed bits over to your teeth so it can be properly chewed. Be careful not to bite your tongue! Continue chewing your food until it’s liquid and there aren’t any pieces that are still crunchy or tough. When the food is evenly chewed and broken down, you can swallow it and take another bite. Some foods will require more chewing than others, so make sure your food is smooth and liquid before you swallow. Summary:","response":"1.

The central square in Covent Garden is simply called \\"Covent Garden\\", often marketed as \\"Covent Garden Piazza\\" to distinguish it from the eponymous surrounding area. Designed and laid out in 1630, it was the first modern square in London—originally a flat, open space or piazza with low railings. From about 1635 onwards there were many private residents of note, including the nobility, living in the Great Piazza. A casual market started on the south side, and by 1830 the present market hall had been built. The space is popular with street performers, who audition with the site's owners for an allocated slot. The square was originally laid out when the 4th Earl of Bedford, Francis Russell, commissioned Inigo Jones to design and build a church and three terraces of fine houses around the site of a former walled garden belonging to Westminster Abbey. Jones's design was informed by his knowledge of modern town planning in Europe, particularly Piazza d'Arme, in Leghorn, Tuscany, Piazza San Marco in Venice, Piazza Santissima Annunziata in Florence, and the Place des Vosges in Paris. The centrepiece of the project was the large square, the concept of which was new to London, and this had a significant influence on modern town planning as the metropolis grew, acting as the prototype for the design of new estates, such as the Ladbroke Estate and the Grosvenor Estate. Isaac de Caus, the French Huguenot architect, designed the individual houses under Jones's overall design.The church of St Paul's was the first building, and was begun in July 1631 on the western side of the square. The last house was completed in 1637. Seventeen of the houses had arcaded portico walks organised in groups of four and six either side of James Street on the north side, and three and four either side of Russell Street. These arcades, rather than the square itself, took the name Piazza; the group from James Street to Russell Street became known as the \\"Great Piazza\\" and that to the south of Russell Street as the \\"Little Piazza\\".

The bloodstream's primary function is to transport nutrients, including glucose, to different parts of the body. 3. \\"The pancreas\\" - As the level of sugar in the bloodstream increases, the pancreas senses this change and responds by producing insulin. The pancreas is an important organ that plays a crucial role in regulating blood sugar levels. 4. \\"Insulin lower sugar levels\\" - Insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas, helps lower blood sugar levels by signaling fat, muscle, and liver cells to take in glucose from the blood. This final step allows our body to maintain a stable blood sugar level, which is essential for proper functioning and overall health."},{"question":"When Francis Benali arrives at St Mary's on Saturday, he'll be emotional. The former Southampton hardman may even shed a tear, perhaps not something you would expect from a man of his reputation. But consider this. How would you feel after running close to 1,000 miles in three weeks? Pretty emotional, probably. Test: Benali (left) is running the 1000 miles between every Premier League ground in just 21 days. Power: The former Southampton full-back poses by the pitch after reaching Leicester's King Power stadium. Well, when Benali reaches the final stop of his tour of all 20 Barclays Premier League grounds ahead of Southampton's clash against West Ham this weekend, that's exactly what he would have achieved. Twenty-one days of agony, ice-baths and sleep deprivation - all in aid of Cancer Research UK. 'I've always been interested in extreme challenges such as this and the idea to do something like this has been floating around in my head for about three years now,' Benali told Sportsmail. 'And then came the moment where I just thought: \\"It's now or never\\". I always wanted a challenge to be based around football given I used to be professional, so this sounded like a perfect idea - though halfway through, I'm not so sure now! Emotional: Although the physical pain is tough, it's the mental test that Benali is finding hardest. 'The idea of seeing how far you can push yourself has always intrigued me.' Benali, now 45, knows a thing or two about putting his body through the mill. Over 300 league appearances for the Saints between 1988 and 2004 speaks for itself. But the former Saints full-back is quick to point out that his years as a Premier League footballer pales in comparison to his current challenge of running, on average, 50 miles a day. Helping out: Benali battles with Alan Shearer but his former teammate is helping him along the way. 'Obviously the pain threshold is the biggest difficulty you face,' said Benali. 'It's a different type of fitness to playing football professionally, this is more about the mind when you can barely put one foot in front of the other. 'Nothing can prepare you for that. The extent of my training was going on a 40 miler, but I had two days off after that. 'So you know you can run the distance, it' just having the mindset to tell yourself you have to do it everyday. That's the hardest thing. 'Some days you get through it, some days you can hardly put one foot in front of each other. Stretching the limits: Running an average of 50 miles a day, some days Benali runs longer than he sleeps. 'Some days I finish running, take an ice bath, eat and fall straight into bed and have to do it all over again. Some days I'm running longer in a day than I'm sleeping at night. 'Some days I just can't eat anything, I have no appetite. Obviously my support team are keen for me to stay sufficiently refuelled for the next day, but some days I just can't physically eat anything. 'That is perhaps the hardest thing. The running, yes, it's painful but you get through it. 'But it's the mental and emotional battle that is the hardest to deal with. All the days are blurring into one at the moment. 'The other day I just burst into tears when I finished for the day after seeing my family. You don't expect that to happen. Mental strength: 'It's a different type of fitness to playing football professionally,' says Benali. 'You can prepare physically, but it's the emotional side you can't prepare for. But that was part of the intrigue for me, how far you can push yourself, what your limits are.' Thankfully, Benali has been helped along the way during his gruelling personal battle across England's footballing landscape. He's managed to rope former team-mates Alan Shearer, Matt Le Tissier and James Beattie into helping him along on certain legs, while current top-flight stars Dean Hammond and Danny Ings have also lent their support. Southampton's promising start to the season will have also helped Benali's mood along the way. Many had tipped the south-coast club as relegation contenders following the departure of manager Mauricio Pochettino to Tottenham, as well as the likes of Luke Shaw, Adam Lallana, Rickie Lambert, Calum Chambers and Dejan Lovren. But under the guidance of new manager Ronald Koeman, Southampton have lost just one from their opening three game - a narrow defeat at Liverpool. Exhausted: By the time he arrives at St Mary's on Saturday Benali will have been to all 20 grounds. Hardman: The fullback had a reputation as a tough guy but he admits to breaking down during this journey. Staying positive: Benali believes that Koeman's men can have a good season despite a tough summer. 'People had Saints tagged as relegation candidates, but I was always pretty confident, I suppose I'm always a confident and positive person,' added Benali. 'People were questioning why were selling so many players, in many ways we were victims of our own success. But Koeman needed time to get his players in and he looks to have signed some real real quality there. 'So I was never one who feared the worst.' You'll need all that positive thinking this week, Francis. Former Southampton footballer Francis Benali is running 1000 miles in 21 days to every Premier League club, covering between 45 and 50 miles a day for Cancer Research UK. .

He blames his younger sister, Beth, when his foster mother admonishes him. His foster mother Grace Kelvin disciplines him and he yells at Beth, taking her doll and throwing it in the pool. When Beth reaches to get it, Mikey causes her to fall into the pool and drown. Mikey is secretly taping everything. He goes upstairs and overhears his mother telling a friend on the phone that adopting Mikey was a bad idea. The phone dies and Mikey walks in. Startled, his mother yells at him to get out. Mikey picks up her blow dryer and turns it on, and begins to taunt her. He throws it and she is instantly electrocuted. Mikey goes downstairs and pours a bunch of marbles onto the floor.

In a Cook County Circuit Court complaint, John Cantone said that at 9 p.m. on Oct. 12, 2012, Rachel Shaper entered his Advocate Christ Medical Center room and 'initiated unsolicited sexual relations, including intercourse,' with Cantone while he lay in 'compromised health.' Cantone was in the care of the registered nurse in the cardiac intensive care unit of the hospital, located in West Chicago, awaiting a heart transplant at the time of the alleged abuse, according to The Smoking Gun. Scroll down for video. John Cantone, 60, (right) accused Rachel Shaper, 33, (left) of forcing sex on him while he lay in compromised health at the Advocate Christ Medical Center in West Chicago. Cantone said that Shaper had a 'propensity to initiate unauthorized physical contact' with patients in her care. Cantone was reportedly medicated with 'various drugs and was under electronic monitoring' at the time. The complaint states that as a result of Shaper's battery, Cantone 'suffered injury and damages of a personal and pecuniary nature.' Cantone claimed in the complaint that ACMD officials knew that Shaper had a tendency to engage in unauthorized activities with patients in her care but failed to supervise or terminate her employment. Cantone's wife, Laura, is co-plaintiff in the lawsuit.

Emulation of the original medieval style can be seen in his renovation of the grotesque animals and in the coats of arms incorporated into his new designs. Burges later designed the Council Chamber, added in 1867, and in 1881 began work on Connaught Hall in Dover, a town meeting and concert hall. The new building contained meeting rooms and mayoral and official offices. Although Burges designed the project, most of it was completed after his death by his partners, Pullan and Chapple. The listed status of the Maison Dieu was reclassified as Grade I in 2017 and Dover District Council, the building's owner, is seeking grant funding to enable a restoration, focussing on Burges's work.In 1859–60, Burges took over the restoration of Waltham Abbey from Poynter, working with Poynter's son Edward Poynter and with furniture makers Harland and Fisher. He commissioned Edward Burne-Jones of James Powell & Sons to make three stained-glass windows for the east end, representing the Tree of Jesse. The Abbey is a demonstration of Burges's skills as a restorer, with \\"a profound sensitivity towards medieval architecture.\\" Mordaunt Crook wrote of Burges's interior that, \\"it meets the Middle Ages as an equal.\\" In 1861–2, Burges was commissioned by Charles Edward Lefroy, secretary to the Speaker of the House of Commons, to build All Saints Church, Fleet, as a memorial to Lefroy's wife. She was the daughter of James Walker, who established the marine engineering company of Walker and Burges with Burges's father Alfred, and this family connection brought Burges the commission. Pevsner says of Fleet that \\"it has no shape, nor character nor notable buildings, except one,\\" that one being All Saints.

Moore made a few last-minute headlines by riding to his voting site on his horse, Sassy, notes the Hill. Polls remain tight, with Moore hanging on to a slight edge of about 2 points in the Real Clear Politics average of polls. Still, as FiveThirtyEight notes, this race has been difficult to poll for various reasons, and the difference right now falls within the statistical margin of error. It's doubtful the race will be called early, especially if turnout is relatively heavy, as expected, notes Al.com. Politico highlights some keys to the race: If Jones hopes to win, he'll need to get heavy turnout from black voters, while Moore can counter that with heavy turnout among rural conservatives. One big X factor, however: whether write-in votes will hurt Moore. CNN, meanwhile, observes that the key for both candidates might be performing well in Mobile. The city is home to \\"scores of more affluent, moderate, business-type Republicans—that is, those most likely to abandon Moore and vote for Jones, write in someone else or stay home altogether.\\" Expand this summary.","response":"Roy Moore and Doug Jones are two people who want to be chosen to help make important decisions for the state of Alabama.

The decision between the two men is really close, so no one knows for sure who will be chosen just yet. Doug Jones needs a lot of people called black voters to vote for him if he wants to win. Roy Moore wants a lot of people who live in the country to vote for him. There are also people who can write a different name on their voting paper instead of choosing Roy Moore or Doug Jones.

Hello little friend! Today, we're going to talk about a cool football player named Tom Brady and how many yards he threw during his amazing career. Just like when you play catch with your friends, sometimes you throw the ball really far, right? Well, Tom Brady throws footballs very far too - and he's really good at it! Tom Brady has played football for a very long time - over 20 years! He started as a professional player in the year 2000. That's a lot of time to throw footballs! We're going to talk about how many yards he threw in his entire career up until now (2021), but you should know that these numbers might change if he keeps playing. As of now, Tom Brady has thrown the football for 79,204 yards! Wow, that's a lot of yards, isn't it? It looks like a huge number, and it is! To help you understand how far that really is, let me explain what a yard is. A yard is a unit of measurement used to measure distance or length. Now, picture a ruler. A ruler can measure inches and centimeters, right? Well, think of one yard like a giant ruler - it's about 3 feet long, or about the same size as your leg from your hip to your toes. So if Tom Brady threw the football for 79,204 yards, it would be like he was throwing the ball for a distance that is 237,612 feet long, or even 71,576 little kids like you standing in a row, head to toe! Because Tom Brady has played for such a long time, it's hard to know exactly how many yards he threw at any point during a specific game or season. The number we're using here - 79,204 yards - is the grand total of all yards he has ever thrown in all the games he has ever played. Isn't that amazing? Tom Brady's hard work and dedication have helped him throw the football so far and for so long. He's definitely a talented and skilled football player! I hope this helps you understand how many yards Tom Brady has thrown during his football career. Remember, he is still playing, so he may throw even more yards in the future.

I hate you.\\" to Czech?","response":"\\"Mmm. I hate you.\\" can be translated to Czech as \\"Mmm. Nesnáším tě.\\" Let me provide you with more information about the translation: 1. \\"Mmm.\\" remains the same in Czech, as it is an onomatopoeic expression and is used similarly in many languages to express various emotions depending on the context. In this case, it could be used to express discontent or disapproval. 2. \\"I hate you\\" is translated to \\"Nesnáším tě\\" in Czech. Here's a breakdown of the translation: - \\"I hate\\" is translated to \\"Nesnáším.\\" This word in Czech is a combination of the negative \\"ne-\\" and the verb \\"snášet\\" (to bear, to stand, to put up with). The ending \\"-ím\\" is from the 1st person singular present tense, which translates to \\"I\\" in English. - \\"you\\" is translated to \\"tě\\" in Czech. This is an informal way to say \\"you\\" and is appropriate for conversations between friends or family members. In a more formal situation, \\"vás\\" would be used. So, \\"Mmm. Nesnáším tě.\\" captures the meaning of the English phrase while maintaining the nuance and emotion conveyed in the original sentence."},{"question":"Boulton was widely involved in civic activities in Birmingham. His friend Dr John Ash had long sought to build a hospital in the town. A great fan of the music of Handel, Boulton conceived of the idea to hold a music festival in Birmingham to raise funds for the hospital. The festival took place in September 1768, the first of a series stretching well into the twentieth century. The hospital opened in 1779. Boulton also helped build the General Dispensary, where outpatient treatment could be obtained. A firm supporter of the Dispensary, he served as treasurer, and wrote, \\"If the funds of the institution are not sufficient for its support, I will make up the deficiency.\\" The Dispensary soon outgrew its original quarters, and a new building in Temple Row was opened in 1808, shortly before Boulton's death. Boulton helped found the New Street Theatre in 1774, and later wrote that having a theatre encouraged well-to-do visitors to come to Birmingham, and to spend more money than they would have otherwise. Boulton attempted to have the theatre recognised as a patent theatre with a Royal Patent, entitled to present serious drama; he failed in 1779 but succeeded in 1807. He also supported Birmingham's Oratorio Choral Society, and collaborated with button maker and amateur musical promoter Joseph Moore to put on a series of private concerts in 1799. He maintained a pew at St Paul's Church, Birmingham, a centre of musical excellence. When performances of the Messiah were organised at Westminster Abbey in 1784 in the (incorrect) belief it was the centennial of Handel's birth and the (correct) belief that it was the 25th anniversary of his death, Boulton attended and wrote, \\"I scarcely know which was grandest, the sounds or the scene. Both was transcendibly fine that it is not in my power of words to describe. In the grand Halleluja my soul almost ascended from my body.\\" Concerned about the level of crime in Birmingham, Boulton complained, \\"The streets are infested from Noon Day to midnight with prostitutes.\\" In an era prior to the establishment of the police, Boulton served on a committee to organise volunteers to patrol the streets at night and reduce crime. He supported the local militia, providing money for weapons. In 1794 he was elected High Sheriff of Staffordshire, his county of residence. Besides seeking to improve local life, Boulton took an interest in world affairs. Initially sympathetic to the cause of the rebellious American colonists, Boulton changed his view once he realised that an independent America might be a threat to British trade, and in 1775 organised a petition urging the government to take a hard line with the Americans--though when the revolution proved successful, he resumed trade with the former colonies. He was more sympathetic to the cause of the French Revolution, believing it justified, though he expressed his horror at the bloody excesses of the Revolutionary government. When war with France broke out, he paid for weapons for a company of volunteers, sworn to resist any French invasion.

The Black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) is a rodent species found in North America. They are known for their complex social structures and communication systems. 2. Rodents are mammals and typically do not possess any adaptations for flying like birds do, such as feathers, lightweight bones, and specialized musculoskeletal systems. 3. The Black-tailed prairie dog's main adaptations include burrowing and living in underground colonies, which suggests they are better adapted to a terrestrial lifestyle rather than aerial one.

He suffers from a rare disease known as mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome, and parents Chris Gard and Connie Yates wanted to take him to the US for experimental treatment. His UK doctors, however, say it's hopeless, and parents' rights are not absolute in the UK in such cases, explains CNN. A number of courts ruled against them, with their last hope being the ECHR. But the seven justices declined to overrule the British courts. \\"The decision is final,\\" said the ruling.

Medical experts in Britain said the treatment had no chance of saving the infant, but his parents made the case on their website that it was worth a try. \\"He literally has nothing to lose but potentially a healthier, happier life to gain,\\" they wrote.

Options: - market place - internet - yellow pages - phone book - armed forces Let's think step by step:","response":"To find a company, you have several options available, each with its pros and cons. Here is a step-by-step analysis of each option: 1. Market Place: A market place is a location where multiple businesses come together to sell products and services. Although this can be a good option to explore and discover businesses, it is not an efficient way to find a specific company due to geographical limitations and the transient nature of some markets. 2. Internet: The internet is a powerful and expansive tool to find any company globally. You can use search engines like Google, Bing, or Yahoo, or visit the company's official website or social media profiles directly. This is likely the most efficient and comprehensive option for finding a company as it provides the most up-to-date information and is accessible from anywhere. 3. Yellow Pages: The Yellow Pages is a directory containing business listings sorted by industry and location. It used to be predominantly available in print but has since transitioned mostly to online platforms. Using the Yellow Pages to find a company can be effective, particularly when looking for local businesses in a specific city or region. However, it may not be as up-to-date as an internet search. 4. Phone Book: A phone book primarily lists the contact information of individuals and businesses within a specific geographical region. While it can be used to find a company, it may be less efficient than other options due to its limited scope and the fact that it may not be as regularly updated as digital resources. 5. Armed Forces: This option is not relevant for finding a company, as the armed forces are a government institution focused on national defense and military operations. They do not have any involvement in providing information about private companies. In conclusion, the best option for finding a company would be the internet, as it offers the most comprehensive, updated, and accessible information. Yellow Pages and Phone Book would be suitable alternatives for local searches, while the Market Place option might be helpful if you were exploring businesses within a specific area. Armed Forces, on the other hand, are not relevant for this purpose."},{"question":"Can we conclude from \\"A few people with a girl standing up in the center wearing a green dress.\\" that \\"A girl in a dress is not alone.\\"?

Usage: yOuaiZASEaoO - The given string is \\"yOuaiZASEaoO\\". This part is clear because the task mentioned \\"you will be given a string of characters\\" and the provided input is \\"yOuaiZASEaoO\\", which is a string of characters. Part #2: Remove all vowels from the given string. Usage: YZSE - After removing all vowels (i,e,a,u,o), the remaining string is \\"YZSE\\". This part of the definition instructs us to remove vowels, which are i, e, a, u, and o. Since the given input, \\"yOuaiZASEaoO\\", contains several of these vowels, we can see how removing them results in the new string \\"YZSE\\". Part #3: Exclude 'y' or 'Y' as a vowel. Usage: yYZSE - Since 'y' or 'Y' is not considered a vowel, the final output should be \\"yYZSE\\".

The woman sat motionlessly as the water poured into her Volkswagen Golf off the Dorset coast today. Witnesses described how she wound down both front windows of her car before speeding down a ferry slipway and into the water at around midday. The silver car was swept 100 yards out to sea by the fast tide the unnamed woman refused to move despite cries from the quayside to get out as it went down. Scroll down for video. Rescue: This is the moment a woman had to be rescued after apparently driving deliberately into the sea off Sandbanks. Submerged: The VW sank yards from the home of Premier League football manager Harry Redknapp on the Sandbanks peninsula. Rescue: The woman is led away to safety by RNLI and emergency workers after she was freed from the sinking car. Drama: The woman's car had to be dragged from the water shortly after she herself was pulled from the car. Lucky to be alive: The unnamed woman was rescued by fishermen who jumped into the sea and dragged her out. But the crew of a passing fishing boat then dived into the water and pulled the woman free just moments before her vehicle sank. The soaked casualty was lifted on board next to the Sandbanks to Studland chain ferry - which sits yards from the home of Premier League football manager Harry Redknapp. After being pulled to safety her rescuers went back to the sinking vehicle to retrieve the woman's handbag. Witness Steve Chater-Lea, 45, said the woman drove past a queue of cars waiting for the ferry before heading down the slope at speed. He said: 'She drove past the ferry queue and accelerated down the ramp. It was definitely deliberate, you could tell from the way she revved the engine and the force with which she hit she the water. 'Both her windows were down and you could see her just sat there oblivious to people shouting out to her to get out. She made no movement or attempt to leave the car. 'There were 20 or 30 people stood on the quay about 15 feet away shouting for her to get out. 'There was a strong outgoing tide and the car went about 100 yards towards the sea, getting lower and lower in the water. 'A fishing boat came alongside the car but she still wouldn't get out and one of the crew dived in and pulled her out of the passenger side. 'She was alive and taken to the jetty for the Brownsea Island ferry and into an ambulance.' Shock: Witnesses described how the motorists sped down this ferry ramp and crashed into the water. Fear: This picture was taken shortly after the car went into the sea and quickly it was swept 100 yards out. Witnesses: People on the busy ferry crossing the estuary also captured the moment the boat began to sink. Brave: Workers on a passing fishing vessel saw the woman and dived in to save her from the deep water. This barge with a lifting crane on arrived on the scene about an hour later and hoisted the sunken vehicle out of the water. Damage: The car's bumper and windscreen were both smashed in the impact with the water. Holidaymaker Bob Smallman said: 'I saw the car in the water and we were all screaming for her to get out but she was just holding on to the steering wheel. 'A fishing boat went round to get her out but she didn't want to go, she looked frightened. They were dragging her in the water for a bit. 'They managed to get her out before the car went completely underwater. 'An inflatable boat that took her to safety then went back to the car and rescued her handbag before it sunk. She must have told them about her bag and been adamant they needed to get it.' Witness Ash Naik said 'I was on the phone talking to my friend ad just said 'I have to go'. 'I saw her flying down the ferry jetty really fast. She jumped the queue of traffic and just shot off the end. She was going so fast one of her wipers came off. 'The car windows were open and the car started to sink when it hit the water but she just sat there and didn't move. 'Someone threw a life-ring in the water but she didn't try to get it. One guy jumped in but she was clung onto the door. They pulled her into the boat.' The woman was taken to hospital where she was treated for shock and the effects of hyperthermia. The woman was taken to hospital where she was treated for shock and the effects of hyperthermia. Busy: Numerous families with children on school half-term and other tourists were on the quayside and surrounding area when the woman drove in. Solent coastguard said they were called in and the woman and the car were both recovered safely. The roof of the submerged car could be seen a few inches beneath the surface of the water. A barge with a lifting crane on arrived on the scene about an hour later and hoisted the sunken vehicle out of the water. Numerous families with children on school half-term were on the quayside and witnessed the incident at 11.58am today. A spokesman for Solent coastguard said: 'A lady driving a Volkswagen car managed to go into the water off the slipway. 'She has been recovered safely. The car was located 30 metres offshore and collected by a local fishing vessel. A spokesman for the Bournemouth-Swanage Motor Road and Ferry Company, which operates the chain ferry, confirmed the ferry had left the Sandbanks slipway and was halfway across the entrance to Poole Harbour at the time.

The equation we have is: 718 = -18 * o + 502 First, we need to get the -18 * o by itself, so we'll move the 502 to the other side of the equal sign by subtracting it from both sides. Then it will look like this: 718 - 502 = -18 * o Now, if we do the subtraction: 216 = -18 * o Next, we need to figure out what number \\"o\\" is by canceling the -18. To do this, we'll divide both sides of the equation by -18: 216 / -18 = (-18 * o) / -18 After dividing, we get: -12 = o So there you have it!

A good Samaritan braved the freezing waters of Lake Michigan risking his own safety to rescue a confused dog wandering on ice floats. Spotting Pifas, a three-year-old stranded golden retriever mix half-a-mile out on the lake, Dave Kehnast, 37, didn't think twice about donning his wetsuit and jumping aboard his kayak to rescue the stricken dog on Friday. As the Chicago Fire Department went through safety procedures, Kehnast cut through the ice with his raft and herded the dog back to shore through the perishing waters of the lake off the Loyola Park section of Chicago. Scroll Down for Video. Pifas is filmed by news cameras adrift on ice floats in the freezing waters of Lake Michigan. Dave Kehnast tried to get the dog to listen to his commands - but Pifas was scared and confused. Rescued: Pifas the dog was reunited with his owner at a Chicago Animal Care and Control center on Friday evening - he will be allowed home on Sunday. News cameras captured the heartwarming rescue at 4.30 p.m. on Friday - which included hand-in-mouth moments as Pifas the dog fell into the water on occasion, clearly struggling with exhaustion. 'I was up on the fire escape there on the seventh floor up there and I saw him way out there and so I grabbed the kayak over here and I know that the lake is only a couple of feet deep all the way out to where the ice shelf ends so I knew I'd be fine,; Kehnast explained to Fox News. More... 100 people rescued after being stranded on Dallas Zoo monorail for an hour. 'It is like with a child': Meet the Colombian woman raising an orphaned monkey by keeping it nuzzled next to her 24 hours a day. 'And so I grabbed the kayak and went out there.' Lost by owner Nerijus Steponavicius over a week before while out on a walk, Pifas was hungry and confused when Kehnast made his rescue. Watched by a news camera onboard a helicopter - Dave Kehnast and Pifas made their way to the sure together. Chicago Fire Department officers also attempted to encourage Pifas the dog to make his way to shore. 'I just kept encouraging him, ‘here boy, here boy, here boy' said Kehnast. 'I got really close to him and he wanted to bite me so I just stayed on me and at that point I could get into the water and just hustled him along. 'I wanted to just grab him because it was shallow enough where I could stand, and I just wanted to get my hands on him but he wanted to bite me, it looked like. He didn't want anyone touching him.' In fact, once the dog reached safe ground after the hour-long ordeal, he took off running. He took off from there, escaping authorities as he ran around nearby apartment complexes. Eventually crews caught up with the exhausted dog and ushered it into the back of a white utility van - from where it was taken to an animal shelter. Hero (left) Dave Kehnast saved Pifas the dog from the freezing waters of Lake Michigan. Owner Nerijus Steponavicius had lost his dog over a week before the dramatic rescue on Friday. 'We responded and found the dog quite a distance offshore, maybe close to half a mile off shore, running around on the icebergs out there and falling through to the open water,' said Chicago Fire Department Deputy District Chief Ron Dorneker to NBC News. 'We used a helicopter to try and move the dog a little closer to shoreline, we brought a boat in.' Dog and owner are due to reunited on Sunday after Steponavicius heard from family that his dog had starred on the afternoon news. As the rescue attempt was caught on live television, Steponavicius, of Wicker Park, said his cell phone was ringing non-stop, from calls from people who recognized the dog. Rushing to the Department of Animal Care and Control, Steponavicius was told he couldn't be reunited with Pifas because he was not neutered, an operation carried out yesterday. Once he was back on shore - Pifas was still so confused that he made off and went running around - and had to be caught be emergency workers. However, Pifas was pleased to see his owner. 'He’s really shy, so when he saw me he started jumping around in the cage,' said Steponavicius with a huge smile. 'The biggest lesson, once again: keep those dogs on leashes along the lakefront in the wintertime,' said Chicago Fire Department Deputy District Chief Ron Dorneker. 'This is what can happen when they get out there on that ice and they fall through and they get a distance off-shore.' For hero Kehnast, he said he simply could not have just watched the dog flounder on the ice. 'I wanted the dog to live just like any other person out here watching him,' said Kehnast.

One day, Greg decided to start reading about natural selection. His friend Frank decided to read more about populations that displayed natural selection more sparingly. They both learned lots of new interesting facts. But I can use this background: New species develop naturally through the process of natural selection . Due to natural selection, organisms with traits that better enable them to adapt to their environment will tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers. Natural selection causes beneficial heritable traits to become more common in a population and unfavorable heritable traits to become less common. For example, a giraffe’s neck is beneficial because it allows the giraffe to reach leaves high in trees. Natural selection caused this beneficial trait to become more common than short necks. What is an answer for this question: Which friend studied less about the natural development of species? Answer:","response":"Based on the given information, it seems that Frank studied less about the natural development of species compared to Greg. While both friends focused on aspects of natural sciences, their topics of study were quite different in terms of how they related to the development of new species. Greg chose to read about natural selection, which is directly linked to the development of new species. Natural selection is the process by which organisms with traits that are better suited to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce. Over time, this results in the beneficial traits becoming more common in the population. Ultimately, this process drives the natural development of species as organisms adapt to changing environments and evolve. On the other hand, Frank decided to read more about populations that displayed natural selection more sparingly. This topic, while still within the realm of natural sciences, does not directly address the natural development of new species in the same way that natural selection does. In focusing on populations with less prevalent instances of natural selection, Frank's studies may have involved factors that slow down or suppress the process, rather than the key driving forces that lead to the development of new species. Given their respective areas of study, it can be concluded that Frank studied less about the natural development of species compared to Greg."},{"question":"Identify the most salient words in this sentence: friend is whispering a secret to the other","response":"1.

To provide more detail: 1. Blood enters the kidney through the renal artery, which branches off from the aorta. 2. In the kidney, nephrons – which are the functional units of the kidney – filter the blood. The filtering process involves glomerulus (a network of capillaries) and Bowman's capsule, where the filtration of water, waste products, and essential nutrients happens. 3. Next, the filtrate flows through the renal tubules (proximal convoluted tubule, loop of Henle, and distal convoluted tubule). During this process, necessary molecules and ions (such as glucose, amino acids, sodium, and water) are reabsorbed back into the bloodstream, while waste products and excess substances remain in the tubule. 4. The waste that is filtered out mixes with water and forms urine. This urine is collected in the renal pelvis, a funnel-shaped structure that helps in the transportation of urine. 5. The final step is the transportation of urine to the bladder via the ureters. The urine is temporarily stored in the bladder until it is expelled from the body through the urethra during the process of urination. So, the final step is the transportation of urine out of the kidney to the bladder and its eventual excretion from the body."},{"question":"Sentence: Ahmet Ertegun is originally from Washington, D.C., in the United States, where African Americans are an ethnic group.

At the peak of the Cretaceous transgression, one-third of Earth's present land area was submerged. The Cretaceous is justly famous for its chalk; indeed, more chalk formed in the Cretaceous than in any other period in the Phanerozoic. Mid-ocean ridge activity—or rather, the circulation of seawater through the enlarged ridges—enriched the oceans in calcium; this made the oceans more saturated, as well as increased the bioavailability of the element for calcareous nanoplankton.

Daily Mail Reporter. PUBLISHED:. 07:22 EST, 29 August 2012. |. UPDATED:. 07:22 EST, 29 August 2012. People living in Scotland and Northern Ireland can expect to spend a smaller proportion of their lives in good health than their English and Welsh neighbours, new figures suggest. The amount of life spent in good general health is increasing in England and Wales but falling in Scotland and Northern Ireland, according to data from the Office of National Statistics (ONS). Could diet be to blame? Scottish youngsters can expect to enjoy fewer healthy years compared to the English and Welsh (file picture) And health authorities in Scotland and Northern Ireland should expect increasing demands on services, researchers concluded. Boys born in England between 2008 and 2010, who are expected to live to the age of 78, are estimated to spend 64 years in good health. Those born in Scotland, who are expected to live for almost 76 years, have a 'health life expectancy' of just under 60 years, data shows. Similarly, girls born in Wales between 2008 and 2012 can expect to live 63 of their estimated 81.7 years of life in good health. The number of years spent in good health for girls born in Northern Ireland is 61.9. The authors said: 'These findings indicate that Scotland and Northern Ireland may face proportionally greater future demands on health services than England and Wales due to the well established link between self-rated health and subsequent mortality and health service use.' While life expectancy continues to increase across the UK, researchers wanted to assess whether the additional years were spent in good or bad health. Across the UK as a whole, people can expect to spend more than 80 per cent of their lives in good or very good general health. For boys born between 2008 and 2010, they could expect to live 63.5 years in good health - 81% of the life expectancy of 78.1. The average time for girls to live in good health was 65.7 years - 80 per cent of the female life expectancy of 82.1.

Diana is invited to watch the final edit in the TV studio and there their relationship starts. After liaisons in bleak hotel rooms they leave their spouses (and, in Robert's case, children) and move into an apartment. As a couple, they become part of the fashionable London media/arts set. Initially, Diana is jealous when Robert sees his wife while visiting his children, but she quickly loses this attachment when she mixes with the predatory males of the media, arts and advertising scene, particularly Miles Brand, a powerful advertising executive for the \\"Glass Corporation\\" who gets her a part in a trashy thriller after she has sex with him.

Her journey to work that day from her new flat in the Barbican complex in the City of London ended in tragedy on the Circle line near Aldgate. Miss Stevenson had dreamed of becoming a lawyer ever since she did some work with a local firm of solicitors at the age of 14 and harboured a long-term ambition to work for the UN. That determination was driven by a strong sense of human injustice which burned brightly within her, according to her boss Colin Reynolds, of central London law firm Reynolds Dawson. \\"Her entire career history was a testament to her dedication to representing those ensnared in the criminal justice system, but unable to defend themselves,\\" he said. \\"Fiona was a hard-working, conscientious and supremely able criminal lawyer. The firm will forever be the poorer for her loss. \\"Within a small practice her bubbly personality, care and compassion for colleagues, as well as clients, were cherished qualities, which will be sorely missed.\\" In a statement to the inquest her family said: \\"She had a wonderful zest for life. As far as she was concerned, life was not a dress rehearsal, and she was determined to live it to the full.\\" They had last heard from her on the evening of 6 July. He family said she was \\"happy and contented, full of optimism for the future\\" and was looking forward to coming home a couple of days later at the weekend. Then, on the following day, when there was no response from her mobile, the family received the tragic news from her employer that she was missing. Bruce Lait, a professional dancer, who was on the train when the bomb exploded, told the inquest how he became aware of the injured Miss Stevenson lying across his lap as the dust settled. Mr Lait said he held her hand felt her squeeze his as she slipped away. 'Superb company' Miss Stevenson was born in Cheshire on 22 June 1976. In 1986, she moved with her parents, Ivan and Emer, and younger sister Andrea, to Little Baddow, Essex, and attended New Hall School in Chelmsford and King Edward VI Grammar School in Chelmsford. Her schoolfriend Oliver Nash recalled her \\"infectious laugh whenever she caught the bus to secondary school\\" and said she \\"was polite and superb company\\". Miss Stevenson went on to Sussex University where she studied law and then took a gap year working for several organisations including the Medical Defence Union and in Paris. She joined the north London firm of Galbraith Branley in 1999 as a trainee solicitor and after qualification in 2001 worked mainly on criminal cases. She also represented clients at Mental Health Tribunals and early in her career was said to have felt great pride in preparing a judicial review and successful appeal at the Court of Appeal. Miss Stevenson joined Reynolds Dawson in 2003. There, she worked as a duty solicitor in court and police stations, and become involved in the firm's main area of expertise - representing clients in fraud and extradition cases and undertook regulatory work. Unpaid sabbatical Spurred on by her desire to apply these skills in a different way, Miss Stevenson took a four-month unpaid sabbatical to Belize in 2005. As a volunteer for Challenges World Wide, she worked with the government to develop a staff training manual for child care proceedings there. This opportunity meant she could also indulge her passion for diving, and she completed two qualifications and a dive in the Blue Hole while in Belize. She also competed in the 180-mile long, Ruta Maya four-day kayak race and on arriving back in UK in May 2005, announced that her next project was to climb Mount Kilimanjaro. Miss Stevenson returned \\"refreshed and energised\\" from her sabbatical. She was interested in gaining higher court rights and also expressed a desire to do a masters in Human Rights. In her spare time, she liked music and dance, played the piano and enjoyed golf. In a statement issued through police in 2005, Miss Stevenson's family said: \\"Fiona's tragic loss is immeasurable to her family, friends and colleagues. She is so greatly missed and irreplaceable and words cannot express the continued loss. \\"She has been described as articulate, strong-willed, vibrant, energetic, caring, generous and, as her friends and sister always said, she never held a grudge.\\" Summarize the main points of that article.","response":"This article is about a lady named Fiona Stevenson who was 29 years old and worked as a lawyer in London.

They love to play fetch, but their mouths are so small that normal sized balls (like a tennis ball) just don't work well. These balls are great -- they're soft and very small, but my terrier was able to chew right through one in less than an hour. I removed the squeaker so they wouldn't swallow it, and they still enjoy playing with the ball, but I'd definitely keep an eye on your chewer while playing with this ball.Also, just a word of advice, I wouldn't let any dog over 20 pounds play with these. They are so small that bigger dogs could easily swallow them whole. Answer: A:","response":"The tone of this product review can be described as mixed, as it contains both positive and negative aspects of the product. On the positive side, the reviewer highlights some of the benefits of the product for their small dogs. They mention that the balls are great for small mouths, as they're soft and small, making them easy for their 15-pound dogs to handle. The product seems to have successfully fulfilled the purpose of a fetch toy for smaller dogs, and their pets seem to be enjoying the product. However, there are also a few negative points presented in the review. The main drawback is the product's durability, as the reviewer states their terrier was able to chew through one of the balls in less than an hour. This issue not only raises concerns about the value of the product but also potential safety risks related to the squeaker inside. Additionally, the reviewer warns that the balls may not be suitable for larger dogs, highlighting that any dog weighing over 20 pounds could potentially swallow the toy due to its small size. In conclusion, there seems to be a balance of both positive and negative aspects in this review, characterizing the tone as mixed. The product appears to be great for small dogs with small mouths but may not be suitable for strong chewers or larger dogs due to its lack of durability and potential safety hazards."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: 1.

Translation is not simply about converting words from one language to another; it is an intricate process that requires a deep understanding of both the source and target languages, as well as cultural nuances, context, and the purpose of the text. Various factors come into play when striving to achieve a high-quality translation that not only conveys the original meaning but also reads naturally in the target language. Some of the key factors to consider are: 1. Accuracy: A precise translation should be faithful to the original text, maintaining the original meaning and intent without adding, omitting, or altering any information. It must accurately convey the message of the source text, including technical details, facts, and figures. 2. Language proficiency: A professional translator must have fluency in both the source and target languages, having an excellent command of grammar, syntax, and style. A strong vocabulary in both languages is also crucial to select appropriate words, phrases, and idioms that best capture the essence of the original text. 3. Cultural competence: Translations must account for cultural differences between languages and societies. A good translator needs to understand the nuances of each culture and how they might impact the message, ensuring that the translation doesn't inadvertently cause offense or misrepresent the original text's meaning. 4. Context: The context in which the text is placed is crucial for accurate translation. Understanding the subject matter, target audience, and purpose helps the translator make informed decisions about localization, tone, and style, ensuring that the translation is fit for its intended use. 5. Consistency: High-quality translations maintain a consistent style, tone, terminology, and formatting throughout the text. This includes the consistent use of technical terms, abbreviations, units of measure, and other industry or context-specific language. 6. Idiomatic expressions: A skillful translator will be able to recognize idiomatic expressions, proverbs, and colloquialisms in the source language and find equivalent phrases or expressions in the target language to convey the intended meaning effectively. 7. Formatting and layout: Translated texts should maintain the original formatting and layout as much as possible to make it visually similar to the original document. An attention to detail in formatting, such as fonts, headings, bullet points, and tables, helps to ensure a professional and polished final product. 8. Proofreading and editing: It is crucial for translators to proofread and edit their work to catch any errors or inconsistencies in the translation. Ideally, the translation should also be reviewed by a second language professional to ensure the highest quality and accuracy. 9. Specialization: Translators with expertise in specific fields, like medical, legal, or technical translations, are more likely to produce high-quality translations in those areas. Subject matter knowledge allows the translator to understand complex concepts and technical terms, resulting in a more accurate translation. 10. Use of translation tools: Computer-assisted translation (CAT) tools, terminology databases, and translation memory systems can greatly facilitate the translation process and enhance consistency and productivity. However, relying solely on machine translation without human input can lead to errors and unnatural-sounding translations. By considering these factors and employing skilled translators, it is possible to achieve high-quality translations that effectively convey the original message while maintaining the cultural and linguistic nuances of the target language."},{"question":"In this task, you are given a post in English from online platforms.

Practice blowing balloons. Try playing wind instruments like woodwind or brass instruments.\\" Article:","response":"Title: Strengthen Your Breathing Techniques with These Exercises and Hobbies Introduction Breathing, as fundamental to our daily lives as it is, can often be overlooked in terms of its importance to our well-being. Mastering proper breathing techniques can not only improve our respiratory health, but it can also help enhance other aspects of our lives. In this article, we will explore the benefits of tensing stomach muscles, practicing balloon blowing, and engaging in the art of wind instruments such as woodwind and brass. 1. Tensing Your Stomach Muscles One may wonder how tensing stomach muscles can impact one's breathing. It turns out that exercising these muscles helps improve the diaphragm's efficiency, which is critical in controlling inhalation and exhalation. Step-by-step procedure: - Begin by finding a comfortable seated or standing position. - Inhale deeply through your nose and fill your lungs with air. - Slowly exhale through your mouth while gradually tensing your stomach muscles. - Hold the tension for a few seconds, then gradually release it as you resume normal breathing. - Repeat this exercise for a few minutes daily. As you practice this technique, you will likely find that your increased control over your diaphragm leads to a greater respiratory capacity. 2. Practicing Balloon Blowing Blowing balloons is a fun and effective way to strengthen your lungs and diaphragm. By repeatedly inflating and deflating balloons, you will build up the muscles needed for proper breathing. Step-by-step procedure: - Begin with an uninflated balloon, ensuring it has no leaks. - Hold the neck of the balloon between your lips and take a deep breath. - Gradually exhale into the balloon, inflating it. - Deflate the balloon by releasing the air slowly. - Repeat this process several times. By practicing balloon blowing daily, you can foster better breath control and ultimately improve your lung capacity. 3. Playing Wind Instruments Whether you're a professional musician or someone seeking a new hobby, learning to play a wind instrument can enrich your life in more ways than one. Woodwind and brass instruments such as saxophones, flutes, trumpets, or trombones require precision breath control to produce harmonious melodies. Tips for maximizing your wind instrument practice: - Choose an appropriate wind instrument based on your interests and commitment level. - Consult with an experienced instructor or watch tutorials to help guide your practice. - Consistently practice, making steady progress in mastering the techniques and breath control needed to play your chosen instrument. By engaging in the regular practice of playing a wind instrument, you will not only develop an appreciation for music but will also significantly improve your breathing techniques. Conclusion Tensing your stomach muscles, practicing balloon blowing, and playing wind instruments are all creative and practical ways to enhance your breathing techniques. Not only will these activities help improve your respiratory health, but you'll also reap additional benefits such as increased lung capacity and a more enjoyable relationship with wind instruments. So why not give one, or all, of these methods a try and experience the difference that proper breath control can make in your life?"},{"question":"Here is an email: Hi, Jan.

It can cause a car to overheat. To reduce friction, oil is added to the engine. Oil coats the surfaces of moving parts. This coating of oil makes them slippery. When things are slippery there is less friction. Have you ever seen a sign that says, slippery when wet? This too has to do with friction. Water, like oil, can reduce friction.

Article: If you live in a big city, there are many thing to drive you crazy on your daily route, and it's not just overcrowded subway trains. Vicky Zhao is a mainlander working in Hong Kong. For her, one thing she can't put up with is people standing on the wrong side of the escalator in subway stations. \\"Escalators help us move faster and save time. It isn't a place to rest,\\" the 24-year-old says. \\"I often see tourists block the way with their suitcases or chatting on the escalators during rush hours. _ annoys me to no end.\\" Admitting she is not the patient type, Zhao says things are much better in Hong Kong than in cities on the mainland where \\"stand right, walk left\\" signs are often ignored. The logic behind the \\"stand right, walk left\\" escalator etiquette seems obvious. Even though you may want to catch your breath while you're transported up or down, you should still consider others and leave enough space for people in a hurry, so that they can run and catch the train. Many cities' escalators, including London's and Beijing's, use the \\"stand right, walk left\\" system to speed up the flow of people. (Australia is an exception and you should stand on the left side instead.) But some cities discourage people from moving on escalators out of safety reasons. In Hong Kong's subway stations there are regular announcements asking people to \\"stand still\\" on escalators. Even so, most people in thisfast-paced cityobserve the \\"stand right, walk left\\" etiquette. But the people who stand on escalators defend themselves by telling the walkers not to be so impatient.

Even when the escalator is packed and there's nowhere to move, I see these same people complaining about not being able to pass.\\" Whatever the escalator etiquette is in the place you live or visit, do what most people are doing and always be mindful of others: leave enough space between each other, don't stay at the end of the escalator, and if someone is blocking...

El gato con botas (\\"Puss in Boots\\", in English) is a 1961 Eastmancolor live-action Mexican fantasy film. Based on Charles Perrault's \\"Puss in Boots\\", it was scripted, produced and directed by Roberto Rodriguez, and, starring Santanon in the title role, the film was made by Pelicula Rodriguez S.A. at the Churubusco-Azteca film studio. OPTIONS: I. Yes. II. It's impossible to say. III. No.","response":"I. Yes. To determine if the sentence \\"El gato con botas was very popular in Mexico\\" is true based on the text, I will follow these steps: 1. Identify the subject and information mentioned in the text: The subject is \\"El gato con botas\\" or \\"Puss in Boots\\". The text provides information about the Mexican film adaptation, its year of production, director, and film studio. 2. Find any information that might indicate the popularity of the film: The text does not explicitly mention the popularity of the film. 3. Analyze the information provided: Since the film was a Mexican adaptation of the story and produced in a Mexican film studio, it is likely that the film was intended for a Mexican audience. 4. Conclusion: Based on the available information, it can be reasonably inferred that \\"El gato con botas\\" may have been popular in Mexico at the time of its release. However, the text does not provide specific evidence to support its popularity. Considering the steps, the correct choice would be II.

Both sentences are presented in the form of conditional statements (i.e., \\"If you want..., then you should have...\\"). 2. Sentence B: \\"If you want to set a cup on a table then you should have a table.\\" This statement is logical since a table would be necessary to set a cup on it. 3.

In the first statement, we have several pieces of information: 1. The woman is wearing a yellow hospital gown – This indicates that the scene is likely taking place in a healthcare setting, most probably in a hospital. The yellow hospital gown might signal that the woman is either a patient or a staff member within the facility. 2. The child is sleeping – This detail tells us about the state of the child as they are being held by the woman. It suggests that the child is at ease and comfortable enough to be asleep, which might also imply a sense of security and trust in the woman holding them. 3. The child has a cast on their right arm – This is an important piece of information, as it implies that the child has suffered some type of injury, likely a broken bone or fracture to their right arm that required medical attention. The presence of the cast also reinforces the suggestion that this scene is taking place in a hospital or another healthcare facility. 4. The woman is holding the child – This is the primary action that links both statements together, as it describes the physical connection between the woman and the child. In the second statement, \\"A child is in the arms of a woman,\\" we have a simplified version of the situation. This statement focuses on the main action of a woman holding a child and leaves out the additional details, such as the yellow hospital gown, the sleeping state of the child, and the cast on the child's right arm. However, the main idea of a child being held by a woman is still clearly expressed. In conclusion, the two statements describe the same situation, with the first statement providing more context and specific details about the scene. The second statement confirms the primary action of a woman holding a child, which can be inferred from the initial statement."},{"question":"How similar are these two sentences, on a scale from 0-5 (0 is \\"not similar\\" and 5 is \\"very similar\\")?

However, the two sentences emphasize different aspects of the incident: - Sentence 1 focuses on the tragic human loss, stating \\"All 224 dead\\", which implies the total number of casualties in the crash. This sentence reflects the gravity of the situation from a human-interest standpoint. - Sentence 2 highlights the detection of a \\"heat flash\\" at the time of the crash, providing information on a possible piece of evidence. This sentence leans more towards discussing the technical aspect of the crash. Considering these factors, I would rate the similarity between these two sentences as a 3.5.

Options: - get laid - acknowledgment - accomplish goals - marry - talk about themselves Let's think carefully first. Step-by-step reasoning process:","response":"When a person is complimentary and making trivial physical contact, they may be trying to: 1) Get laid: It could be a subtle way to express their interest in a physical or sexual context. Compliments serve as a way to break the ice and build rapport, while physical contact might be a means of establishing a connection. 2) Acknowledgment: Compliments can be a way to acknowledge and appreciate someone's presence, appearance, or efforts. Light physical contact, such as a gentle pat on the back, may be a casual way to convey appreciation or recognition. 3) Accomplish goals: Complimentary behavior and trivial physical contact might be a strategic approach to win someone's favor or cooperation in achieving a goal. It could express support, encouragement, or appreciation, making the person more likely to be receptive to their proposals or ideas. 4) Marry: In some cases, being complimentary and making trivial physical contact might be a way of trying to create a bond and eventually form a romantic or marital relationship. However, this would typically involve getting to know the person on a deeper level and building trust over time. 5) Talk about themselves: Some individuals use compliments and physical contact as an indirect way to talk about themselves or steer the conversation toward them. They may use compliments as an opening to discuss similar experiences, preferences, or even their accomplishments. In conclusion, it is essential to consider the context and specific behaviors when trying to determine the intent behind the compliments and physical contact. While each of these options is plausible in different situations, analyzing the individual's body language, tone, and the nature of the compliments can help decipher their underlying purpose."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person whose music career began in Memphis in 1954, recording at Sun Records? Elvis Aaron Presley (January 8, 1935 – August 16, 1977) was an American singer and actor. Regarded as one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century, he is often referred to as the \\"King of Rock and Roll\\" or simply \\"the King\\". Presley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, and relocated to Memphis, Tennessee, with his family when he was 13 years old. His music career began there in 1954, recording at Sun Records with producer Sam Phillips, who wanted to bring the sound of African-American music to a wider audience. Accompanied by guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, Presley was a pioneer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. In 1955, drummer D. J. Fontana joined to complete the lineup of Presley's classic quartet and RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who would manage him for more than two decades. Presley's first RCA single, \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\", was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States. With a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records, he became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of rock and roll. His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations, made him enormously popular—and controversial. In November 1956, Presley made his film debut in Love Me Tender. Drafted into military service in 1958, Presley relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work. He held few concerts however, and guided by Parker, proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided. In 1968, following a seven-year break from live performances, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed television comeback special Elvis, which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string...

In the context of the narrative events, the answer is \\"three years after the events of Digimon Adventure 02,\\" meaning that the story of the new series is set three years later than the events of the previous one. Regarding real-world release dates, let's take a brief look at the history of the first few Digimon series: 1. Digimon Adventure - aired from March 7, 1999, to March 26, 2000. 2. Digimon Adventure 02 - aired from April 2, 2000, to March 25, 2001. 3. Digimon Tamers - aired from April 1, 2001, to March 31, 2002.

Persia: This is a geographical location and not relevant to the question. Persia is an ancient region of southwestern Asia, which is now part of modern-day Iran. It does not answer where to place a rug in your home. So, this option can be eliminated. 2. Desk: A desk is a piece of furniture commonly used for work or study, typically found in home offices, bedrooms, or study rooms. Placing a rug near a desk may not necessarily be near the front door and may not serve the purpose of catching dirt or providing a welcoming atmosphere. This option can be eliminated as well. 3. Table: A table is another piece of furniture that can be found in various rooms like the dining room, living room, or kitchen. Depending on the layout of your home, placing a rug near a table may not always be close to the front door, so this option is less suitable for the question at hand. 4. Living room: The living room is a communal space in a home, often used for relaxation and socializing. Depending on the floor plan, a living room might be near the front door, but it might also be further away. Placing a rug near the front door in the living room could work, but there's a more optimal option. 5. Hall: A hall is a generic term for an entryway or corridor within a house.

For example, our main protagonist could be a former architect, Jack (age 42), who is now working as a maintenance worker for the city's sewer department. Other group members could be Sarah (age 30), an investigative journalist; Austin (age 27), a talented parkour athlete; and Rosa (age 55), a retired firefighter with a strong knowledge of Manhattan's underground infrastructure. Step 2: Establish the plot The movie would revolve around a secret facility located beneath the streets of Manhattan. While conducting routine maintenance, Jack stumbles upon a mysterious room full of advanced technology, heavily guarded by individuals in military uniforms. He quickly realizes that this is not part of the regular sewer infrastructure. Step 3: Create the motivation Unbeknownst to the group members, they have been surveilled and are now being hunted by the same organization that operates the secret facility. They must escape through the sewers of Manhattan to avoid capture and expose the truth behind the facility while evading the dangerous forces pursuing them. Step 4: Build tension and obstacles As the group navigates the sewers, they encounter a variety of challenges, such as navigating the labyrinth of tunnels, overcoming physical obstacles (e.g., collapsing tunnels, deadly traps), and facing off against the pursuing organization. Through teamwork, clever thinking, and utilizing their unique skills, the group gradually progresses towards their goal. Step 5: Add character growth and backstory Throughout the journey, each character will have moments of vulnerability, where they reveal more about their past, motivations, and fears. These moments help build empathy and foster the audience's connection with the characters. Additionally, the characters will undergo growth as their experiences and relationships with one another reshape them. Step 6: Introduce twists and surprises To keep the audience engaged, introduce plot twists along the way. For example, it may be revealed that someone within the group is a double agent or that the facility is connected to a larger, more sinister global conspiracy. Step 7: Climax and resolution As the group inches closer to their escape, the stakes become higher. In a thrilling climax, they confront the organization's leader, bringing the truth to light. Through their determination and perseverance, they manage to escape the sewers of Manhattan and expose the secret facility, saving countless lives and gaining redemption for their own past struggles. Step 8: End the movie on a hopeful note In the end, the group members emerge victorious but changed by their harrowing experiences. They resolve to keep fighting against injustice and using their newfound friendships to support each other in the face of future challenges.

Knut's restricted diet, intended to curtail the natural weight gain necessary to survive harsh winters, made headlines outside of Germany. His daily meals were reduced in number from four to three, and treats, such as croissants, which were favored by the young polar bear, were restricted. After he hurt his foot while slipping on a wet rock in his enclosure a month later in September, there was an outpouring of concern and support from fans worldwide.In November 2007 and weighing over 90 kg (198 lb), Knut was deemed too dangerous for close handling and his interaction with human handlers was further diminished. The celebration of the cub's first birthday, which was attended by hundreds of children, was broadcast live on German television. The national mint also issued 25,000 special commemorative silver coins to mark his birthday. Knut's role at the Berlin Zoo was to have included his becoming an \\"attractive stud\\" for other zoos in order to help preserve his species.

Article: The speed of light is often called a\\"constant \\". New experiments show that may not be true, even within a vacuum. Sometimes, light slows a bit. The new research is\\"very impressive work\\", Robert Boyd toldScienceNews.An optical physicist at the University of Rochester in New York, he did not work on the study. He speaks of the new finding:\\"It's the sort of thing that's so obvious; you wonder why you didn't think of it first.\\" Light travels as particles and as waves. Photons are the name given to those particles that represent the smallest possible amount of light. At their fastest, photons travel nearly 300 million meters (almost 1 billion feet) in a single second. That's fast enough to get to the moon and back in about 2.6 seconds. Scientists had long known, though, that they could slow light photons down by shining them through a material such as glass or water. Still, light moving through a vacuum has usually been assumed to move at a peak speed. That would seem to make sense. After all, a vacuum is a space with nothing in it to slow light down. In a new study, however, scientists show that even racing through a vacuum, light can slow. So the speed of light is more of a universal speed limit than an rule for how fast photons travel, the new data suggest. Miles Padgett led the new study. As an optical physicist, he works at the University of Glasgow in Scotland. He and his colleagues showed that the key to slowing light is to change the shape of a light wave. Padgett described how they did this in a paper published online January 22 inScience. His team raced a pair of photons. One traveled unchanged through a cable made from optical fibers. The other passed through a pair of devices that acted like lenses. A lens changes light: It can focus a spread-out beam of light on a point, for instance. The second photon passed through one device that changed the shape of its waveand another that changed it back to its original form. The first photon won the race. The second photon came in a tiny bit later, several... Question: The passage mainly tells .

Question: What type of apples do people prefer? Options: A. good to eat B. crisp C. grocery store D. good for E. farm Answer:","response":"Selecting the appropriate choice from the given options requires understanding that the question pertains to the preference of people regarding the quality of apples. The question does not refer to a specific type of apple like Granny Smith or Fuji, but rather seeks to gauge the general preferences of apple consumers. This question can be tricky as it doesn't specify whether it is referring to the taste, texture or where they buy. However, we can make an educated choice based on common sense. Option A. 'Good to eat' is a somewhat vague term that doesn't truly characterize what people might prefer with regards to apples. What does 'good to eat' mean? The term can be subjective since what might be good for someone might not be for another person. Option B. 'Crisp'. Now, this option refers to a very common attribute that people generally look for in apples. A crisp apple is generally not too ripe or too raw and offers a good bite and taste. Therefore, a significant percentage of people prefer their apples to be crisp. Option C. 'Grocery store'. This option seems a bit out of context in answering the principal question. It seems to refer to a place where people might buy apples, but it doesn't categorize the type of apple people prefer. Option D. 'Good for'. This lacks the remainder of the sentence, and without knowing what the apples are 'good for' (baking, eating fresh, sauce, etc.), it's hard to determine its relevance to the question. Option E. 'Farm' could refer to farm-fresh apples, but without more context, it is hard to determine if it's the type of apples people typically prefer. Some might interpret farm apples as being fresh and organic, but it doesn't really specify anything about the apple's qualities. Based on these analyses, the most logical answer seems to be Option B. 'Crisp'. Although tastes vary greatly amongst different people, a larger number of consumers generally prefer their apples to be crisp because it offers a satisfying crunch and a burst of flavor in every bite. Crisp apples are often associated with being fresh, juicy, and more enjoyable to eat either plain or in recipes, such as salads or desserts. It is, however, important to note that 'crisp' could be just one of many criteria that people use to select their preferred type of apple. Other considerations might include sweetness, tartness, juiciness, and versatility for cooking. But, given the constraints of the options provided, 'crisp' arguably constitutes the most acceptable answer in this regard."},{"question":"No jo, přetížení působí.

Imagine you have lots of smarties (they represent the \\"p\\" in our problem). The problem is asking us to find how many smarties (p) you have by comparing two different groups: 1. On the left side of the \\"=\\" sign, you have: - 352 smarties in one bag, take away 4407 smarties in another bag, and then add 68387 smarties. 2. On the right side of the \\"=\\" sign, you have: - 451 smarties in a bag, and you need to take away 120865 smarties. Now, let's find the number of smarties (p): Step 1: Collect the smarties (p) together: (352 - 4407 + 451) * p = 68387 - 120865 Step 2: Calculate new numbers: -3604 * p = -52378 Step 3: To find p (the number of smarties), we divide the new number for p by -3604: p = -52378 / -3604 Step 4: Calculate p (number of smarties): p = 14.53 (approximately) So you have about 14.53 smarties (p) in this math problem.

No The sentence: \\"It has held the record for the highest temperature in the UK for June at 35.6 °C (96.1 °F) since 1976.\\" presents two pieces of information: it mentions the record-setting temperature for the UK in June and indicates that this record has been held since 1976. From this sentence, we can see that 35.6 degrees Celsius is translated into 96.1 degrees Fahrenheit, which indeed aligns with the conversion. However, the sentence does not explicitly answer the question \\"What does the record-setting 35.6 degrees Celsius convert to in degrees Fahrenheit?\\" The sentence does not identify or explain the conversion process, nor does it specifically state that 35.6 degrees Celsius equates to 96.1 degrees Fahrenheit - this information is inferred by the reader.

Context: In spite of the fact that people brag about being able to multi-task, the reality is that the human mind can only focus on one thing at a time. When you pay attention to one thing the mind automatically blocks out all other stimuli. Multi-tasking is simply jumping from focal point to focal point; but, you are still only focusing on one thing at a time. The payoff from trying to multi-task is not worth the toll it takes on the individual making the effort. David Meyer, PhD, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan states the following: Doing several tasks simultaneously may seem like the height of efficiency – and it would be, if a person had more than one brain. In the real world, multitasking actually wastes time and reduces work quality. Many studies have shown that multitasking slows down the mind and makes it less effective. Dividing and distracting the mind causes rapid mental course changes, the inability to effectively focus, and creates stress – which increases with every additional task that is added to the mix. Imagine a dog who is trying to chase three different balls thrown in different directions. He runs two steps in one direction, three steps in another, and one step in the third. He ends up running in circles. The mind is the same. The more time you spend changing mental direction the less time you have to actually focus on a single task. The more directions or mental tasks you add, the less effective you become. But . . . that is not the whole story. Another facet of multi-tasking is worrying about events, projects, or situations that have nothing to do with where your focus should be at the moment. Worrying about what has happened, or may happen changes nothing. All it does is drain your mental and emotional resources, making you less effective at the task at hand. Let your subconscious handle it. The subconscious mind is one of the most powerful tools that we possess. It is unnecessary to make an effort to keep everything at the “top-of-mind” because everything that happens... Question: How long can someone multitask for before becoming stressed out?

Snowden, who has a cameo in the film (though we won’t spoil when or how) was projected onto the film screen during a Q&A with the director and stars, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Shailene Woodley. Audience members asked him to weigh in on the current election. “We have become something of a legalistic society where people parse, is it lawful or is it unlawful? When someone’s defense for their activities is this was legal, ‘I didn’t break any laws,’ that’s a very weak defense. The legality of a thing is entirely distinct from the morality of it,” Snowden said. “If we become afraid to point that out and challenge people who are running for leadership roles on here, we’ve lost something uniquely American that’s been a rudder on our ship.” Snowden, who is currently in exile in Russia, also received questions about a scene in the film (also in the trailer) in which he sneaks information past government security using a Rubik’s Cube. He said that that wasn’t really how he did it, but he did come up with that trick for the movie. He wouldn’t reveal the actual way he accomplished that feat in real life: “This the part where we remember the FBI would get a copy of the Google Hangout.” Stone joked that the time spent filming Snowden (who said, “I’m not an actor”) was arduous and compared it to his sessions filming Donald Trump for what became outtakes of Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps. “The difference between Donald and Ed, and I love the man in a weird way, is that [Donald Trump] jumped up after every take and said, ‘Wasn’t that great?'” Stone said. The director had said at a panel earlier that day that Snowden had been hesitant to come onboard the film, and it took three covert meetings abroad for Stone to convince Snowden. At the Q&A, Snowden confirmed he didn’t relish the idea of a fictional version of himself onscreen. “I don’t think anyone looks forward to having a movie made about themselves, particularly someone who is a privacy advocate,” said Snowden. But he said he came around once he saw the value of “avatars” telling his story in a narrative, digestible form for a bigger audience. He even admitted that Joseph Gordon-Levitt’s impression was spot-on. “Some of my family members have said ‘he sounds just like you.'” Finally, an audience member asked what Snowden’s quality of life is like today. “I can confirm that I am not living in a box,” he said. “I actually live a surprisingly free life.” He went on to say that he was happy in the sense that he does work that he is proud of every day now working with freedom of information organizations and the ACLU.
