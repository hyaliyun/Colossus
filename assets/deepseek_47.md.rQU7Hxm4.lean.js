U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in a statement that the millions of dollars involved could make it the largest fraudulent debt-collection scheme ever prosecuted. The collectors, he said, took “ruthless advantage of the desperate situation in which the victims found themselves” by threatening them with arrest and coercing some into paying more than they owed. Court papers describe orchestrated lies. Victims were told, for example, that they had committed a felony by failing to pay debts, that their driver’s licenses would be suspended and they would be referred to an “attorney network.” One collector told the mother of a debtor undergoing dialysis that he was a “legal investigator’’ with a law firm, not a collection agency, and that he was calling about check fraud, according to court papers. In a third example, a collector told victims that they had committed fraud and that he was “in contact with the magistrate. …” “They are en route right now,” he reportedly continued. “Within 46 minutes, they will be there to serve you.” Prosecutors say that company owners Travell Thomas, 37, of Orchard Park, and Maurice Sessum, 39, of Buffalo, instructed employees to “juice” balances to trick people into thinking they owed greater sums than they might have believed. The prosecutors said Thomas spent some of his resulting fortune to gamble and pay for sports tickets, his wedding reception, jewelry and cosmetic surgery for his wife. While court papers and prosecutors do not name the debt-collection company, Thomas and Sessum were named as the principals of an assortment of debt-collection companies that the Federal Trade Commission and State Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman sought to shut down in February because of allegedly abusive practices. In that case, Thomas and Sessum are named as principal managers and officers of 4 Star Resolution LLC, Profile Management Inc. and International Recovery Service LLC, among others. Attorney Michael A. Benson, of Springville, represents Thomas and is one of the lawyers representing 4 Star. He said he does not yet know whether he also will represent Thomas on the criminal charges. But he said Thomas was en route to Benson’s office Tuesday morning and would have surrendered to the authorities had they not arrested him at his home. Thomas and the other defendants all pleaded not guilty in U.S. District Court in Buffalo. Benson said the FTC and now the U.S. Attorney’s Office set the fraudulently obtained figure at 31 million, but they ignore the fact that legitimate debts were being collected and that the company’s principals had payroll and other business expenses to pay from the proceeds, which were collected over seven or eight years. “They make it look in the indictment that they unsealed today that these gentlemen took the money and ran,” Benson said. “That is completely not true.” He went on to say that it will be difficult and expensive for the defendants to face charges in New York City and that he expected their lawyers to attempt to move the case to Buffalo. Asked why the criminal matter was begun in New York City and not Buffalo, a spokeswoman for Bharara said the FTC referred the case to the U.S. Attorney’s office for the Southern District. The charges are wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. The prosecutors announced that four company employees have pleaded guilty to the conspiracy charge, a crime punishable by up to 20 years in prison. The four are: Mark Lavin, 45, of Buffalo; John Salatino, 34, of Amherst; Jessica Mann, 30, of Dunkirk; and Jennifer Sherk, 27, of Buffalo. Others facing the charges are: Anthony Brzezowski, 49, of Buffalo, the company’s director of operations; company managers Jimmy Stokes, 38, of Buffalo; Heather Gasta, 41, of Buffalo; and Tacoby Thomas, 37, of Orchard Park; and debt collectors Anthony Caba, 25, of Buffalo; Columbus Simmons, 46, of Buffalo; Charles Starks, 32, of Buffalo; William Clark, 30, of Buffalo; and Michael Calandra, 31, of Angola. email: citydesk@buffnews.com ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Available choices: *yes; *it is not possible to tell; *no;","response":"It is not possible to tell if LA is closing their Children's Museum solely because new facilities are opening that will be better. While the information provided suggests that Downtown LA's Children's Museum is closed pending the construction of two new sites, it does not provide a comprehensive explanation for the closure. There could be several reasons why the original Children's Museum in Downtown LA is closed, and the opening of new facilities might just be one part of the story. The closure could be due to financial constraints, maintenance issues, or a strategic decision by the city to revamp its approach to children's educational and cultural resources. The opening of two new sites, one in the San Fernando Valley and one in Little Tokyo, could indicate that the City of Los Angeles has recognized the need for additional venues for children's learning and engagement. The new facilities may be better equipped to address changing demographics, harness new technologies, and provide improved accessibility to diverse communities across the region. The intent could be to upgrade the city's offerings for children by creating enhanced, modern, and dynamic spaces to foster learning and creativity. There is no doubt that the opening of these new facilities will provide better resources for the city's younger generation. However, without additional details and context regarding the closure of the Downtown LA Children's Museum, concluding that it is solely due to the opening of new facilities would be an incomplete analysis. It is important to consider all factors that could have influenced the decision to close the museum and plan for the new sites."},{"question":"Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative?

In May, Judge Jean-Paul Braun found taxi driver Carlo Figaro guilty of sexually assaulting a 17-year-old passenger in 2015. During the trial, Braun commented on the victim's appearance, saying she was \\"a bit overweight, but she has a pretty face.\\" When asked about Braun's comments Wednesday morning, Justice Minister Stéphanie Vallée told reporters they were \\"unacceptable\\" and that she would be filing a complaint with Quebec's magistrates council. A spokesperson for that body, which hears complaints against judges, said for now it will not be commenting on Braun's remarks. A spokesperson for the Quebec court also declined to comment, referring questions back to the magistrates council. According to the victim's version of events, outlined in the judgment, on the night of the assault, Figaro stopped the car not far from her house and licked her face. She pushed him away and tried to get out, but in the meantime he touched her breasts and genitals over her clothing and unbuttoned her shirt. Figaro denied that any sexual contact occurred, but said the victim rubbed the back of his head while she was in the car. Figaro, now 49, has yet to be sentenced. His next court date is in November. The defence has appealed his conviction. 'Not the same consent' Audio recordings of the court proceedings show that Braun also went back and forth with Crown prosecutor Amélie Rivard, suggesting there are degrees of consent and questioning exactly which actions required Figaro to get the victim's consent. The judge said it is not the same to consent to kiss someone and to \\"mettre … la main au panier,\\" a French expression that usually refers to touching someone's rear end. Rivard replied that she hadn't come across that distinction in the jurisprudence. Braun also highlighted the girl's strict religious upbringing and suggested she enjoyed getting the attention from a man who \\"looks good\\" and that she had even flirted with him. Rivard said the girl was simply being polite and that even if she were flirting, it didn't mean that constituted consent. Braun also commented in his written decision on the appearance of the 49-year-old taxi driver. \\"He looks good and doesn't seem his age,\\" the judge stated. \\"We can see from his testimony … that he has nice manners and that he likes to wear cologne: with Versace when he goes out, and with other less-expensive colognes during the week.\\" Figaro denied ever noticing the 17-year-old in the past, even though he stopped at the coffee shop where she worked regularly. The judge, in his ruling, stated that he finds that hard to believe, \\"taking into consideration the [victim's] figure, which is quite voluptuous; the court specifies that she is a pretty young girl.\\" Despite his line of questioning regarding the girl's role in the assault, Braun found Figaro guilty. In his decision, Braun said that while the victim perhaps didn't make it clear that she didn't want to be kissed, through her body language and words, she did make it clear that she didn't consent to what happened after that. 'Completely unacceptable' CALACS West Island, a support group for survivors of sexual assault, said the comments were disturbing. \\"He gave messages that were reprehensible … giving her the message that even though she was sexually assaulted, maybe in some way, she was flattered by these comments,\\" Caroline Deslauriers, a counsellor with CALACS, told CBC News. \\"These comments are completely unacceptable. They're unacceptable from anybody, but especially coming from a judge.\\" ||||| Quebec’s justice minister will file a complaint against a judge who said a 17-year-old victim of sexual assault had a pretty face and was maybe a “bit flattered” at the interest shown in her. Le Journal de Montreal reported Wednesday that Quebec court Judge Jean-Paul Braun made the comments earlier this year during the sexual assault trial of taxi driver Carlo Figaro, who was eventually found guilty of attacking her in his cab. “We can say she is a little overweight, but she has a pretty face, huh?” Braun said at one point. He went on to say she was possibly even “a little flattered” because “maybe it’s the first time he’s interested in her.” Braun said the victim was perhaps a bit naive, although she didn’t expect to be groped during the taxi ride. Article Continued Below The trial heard that Figaro licked the girl’s face and grabbed her before she was able to get out of the vehicle. Braun noted that trying to kiss someone could be seen as an acceptable gesture. In Quebec City on Wednesday, Justice Minister Stephanie Vallee called the judge’s remarks unacceptable and said she intends to file a complaint. Braun convicted Figaro, 49, last May of sexual assault and the cabbie will return to court in November for a sentencing hearing. He is appealing the verdict. Quebec court Chief Judge Lucie Rondeau said in a statement the court would not comment on Braun’s case. “Indeed, following the complaint announced by the justice minister, it is up to the Conseil de la magistrature du Quebec (judicial council) to decide whether an ethical fault has been committed,” Rondeau wrote. But that didn’t stop provincial politicians of all stripes weighing in Wednesday, roundly criticizing the judge’s comments as unacceptable. Helene David, the minister responsible for the status of women, called on judges to address the issue. “Do they need more training? Do they need more sensibility? I don’t know — this is their problem,” David told a news conference. “But they have to solve that kind of problem and change the mentality and attitude.” Parti Quebecois Leader Jean-Francois Lisee called Braun’s comments troubling. “This is very serious,” he said, adding the judge should recuse himself from further cases. “We turn to our judges for wisdom and (upholding) the law, and we have had neither.” Quebec solidaire member Manon Masse said in a statement the judge’s comments demonstrate that “rape culture is implanted in different spheres of Quebec society and, once again, this is another example of a person in a position of authority making inappropriate remarks toward women.” She called on the judicial council to settle the matter quickly. The council must first evaluate whether a complaint will be accepted and, if so, an investigative committee would examine the facts before determing whether there would be any eventual sanction. A spokeswoman for the council declined comment Wednesday. At the federal level, a bill proposed by ex-Conservative interim leader Rona Ambrose that would mean changes to sex assault law training for federally appointed judges is before the Senate. In response to complaints about judges’ comments in other jurisdictions, Ontario also made sexual assault training a requirement for provincial judges in May.

The judge also reportedly mused the victim might have been flattered by the attention from the taxi driver because \\"it was perhaps the first time that he was interested in her\\". It is not the first time Mr Braun has come under scrutiny. He was criticised in 2013 for saying the case of a telecom technician who verbally harassed a 19-year-old and grabbed her breasts was not \\"the crime of the century\\". On Twitter, the head of the Quebec Bar Association, Paul-Matthieu Grondin, called Judge Braun's remarks \\"deplorable\\" and said they do not have a place in today's justice system. Quebec's magistrate's council, which handles ethics complaints about provincially appointed judges, said it does not comment on complaints it receives. The council reviews complaints before determining whether to launch an investigation. If necessary an inquiry committee decides on possible sanctions.

Options: - yes - no Chain of thought and solution for this question is:","response":"Yes, people can have water buffalo as pets. Chain of thought and solution: 1. Investigating the claim: Water buffaloes are primarily kept for agricultural purposes, such as plowing fields and providing milk. However, some individuals may choose to keep them as pets. 2. Considering the factors: Though, it is essential to consider that water buffaloes are large animals, requiring significant space and specialized care. They are also not legal pets in all countries or regions. 3. Concluding: Despite the challenges of owning a water buffalo as a pet, it is technically possible for people to do so. However, potential owners must consider factors such as space, care, and legality before deciding to keep a water buffalo as a pet."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: What are the worst examples of false advertising you've seen? Did you fall prey to their claims? Rather that vouch for myself - my story is trite, and not particularly interesting - I'll relay the tale one of my nurses shared with me when I was laid up in the hospital for a few weeks. Call her R. R was from an Eastern European country. We chit-chatted a lot, while she was taking my blood pressure readings and stuff. Lots of fun stories! But she relayed to me one of her first U.S. memories: She wanted to lose weight. She was impressed by some things the U.S. had to offer - \\"you have actual nutritional information on everything!\\" - and thus figured everything she encountered was on the level. And she found a \\"miracle cure\\" company who was along those lines! \\"These are AWESOME miracle shoe inserts! Wear them, and the pounds will melt away!\\" She saved her pennies and dimes; she sprung for the inserts. She received them... and they were shoe inserts; that much was true. But then there was their documentation: \\"using these insoles, combined with a 1200 calorie-per-day diet....\\" Like a 1200-calorie diet won't likely involve weight-loss, no matter what else you did, shoe inserts aside. The inserts did nothing, obviously. It was a sham. At which point she knew she was snookered, but really had no recourse. She wasn't explicit about it, but I got the feeling that it was a leading factor towards her chosen profession. \\"I might not have been the most sage medical person ever, but I'm gonna rectify that, and if ever I hear someone falling for that sort of gambit again, I'll be there to nip those sentiments in the bud with my own anecdotes.\\" Which is awesome. I still feel for her. I wish I had contact information, so I could touch base, and express those thoughts personally. But that's the most personally resonant version of false advertising affecting someone that I've seen. When she received the awesome miracle inserts: Pick the correct answer from the following options: A. She found documentation suggesting a 1200 calorie a day diet. B. No documentation was enclosed. C. She found instructions on an exercise program. D. not enough information A:","response":"She found documentation suggesting a 1200 calorie a day diet. In the story of R, the Eastern European nurse, she was looking for a way to lose weight and found a company claiming their shoe inserts were a \\"miracle cure.\\" After purchasing and receiving the inserts, she discovered that the documentation included stated that the shoe inserts would work in combination with a 1200 calorie per day diet. The false advertising in this case was that the company made it seem like the shoe inserts alone would help her lose weight, but in reality, it was mainly the 1200 calorie diet that would contribute to any potential weight loss. This realization made her aware that she had been misled by the company's advertisement, and it seems to have played a role in her decision to pursue a career in the medical field. In this example, one of the worst consequences of false advertising is the exploitation of people's vulnerabilities and desires for self-improvement. Rather than providing a genuinely helpful product or solution, the company took advantage of R's genuine need for support in her weight loss journey, and this undoubtedly had a negative impact on her trust in other products and services in the market. False advertising can lead to disappointment, wasted time and resources, and even potentially harmful consequences. In the case of R, the incident may have served as a catalyst for her pursuit of knowledge and education in the healthcare field, possibly to make sure she and others wouldn't fall prey to deceptive advertising tactics in the future."},{"question":"The digestive system is the body system that digests food. It digest food in two ways, mechanically and chemically. Both help in the process of turning food into nutrients. The digestive system also eliminates solid food waste. The major organs of the digestive system include the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and small and large in- testines. These organs all work together to help you gain energy from the food you eat. Digestion starts in the mouth. When food is swallowed, it travels through the esophagus to the stomach. In the stomach, digestion continues and a small amount of absorption of nutrients takes place. Most chemical digestion and nearly all absorption of nutrients take place in the small intestine. This organ consists of three parts: duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. The large intestine is the last stop in the digestive system. This is where water is absorbed. The food not digested is released as waste.

You can download the latest drivers from the Nvidia or AMD site, depending on which manufacturer you have. Having the latest drivers will ensure that your card is running as stably as possible. Newer drivers often increase overclocking performance as well. To overclock, you will need a few different programs, all of which are available for free. These programs will give you performance benchmarks, allow you to adjust your card timing and voltage, and monitor temperature performance. Download a benchmark program - There are several available, but one of the quickest and most intuitive is Heaven. It is available for free from Unigine, the developers. Another popular program is 3DMark. Download an overclocking program. While both Nvidia and AMD have overclocking utilities of their own, MSI Afterburner is one of the most popular and widely-used programs. Despite it's name, it will work with virtually every graphics card from both Nvidia and AMD. Download a monitoring program. Although benchmark and overclocking programs will report temperatures and speeds, sometimes it's good to have another monitor to make sure that all of your settings take. GPU-Z is a lightweight program that will monitor the temperature, clock speed, memory speed, and every other aspect of your graphics card. Going into your overclocking process without being informed can cost you a lot of time and cause you a lot of headaches later on. You want to find the clock speeds that other users who have your exact same card are getting. You also need to find what is generally considered to be your card's highest safe voltage. Do not immediately apply these numbers to your card. Since every card is different, there's no telling what could happen if you enter the wrong numbers. Instead, use them as a guide during the overclocking process to judge how effective your numbers are. Try forums such as Overclock.net to find other overclockers who have the same card that you do. Overclocking a laptop's GPU is not recommended. Laptops have a much harder time dissipating heat, and overclocking can quickly lead to dangerous temperatures.","response":"Before overclocking your video card, ensure you have the latest drivers from either Nvidia or AMD to maintain stability and improve performance.

Aung San Suu Kyi, opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, is unrivaled in the affection of her compatriots. Those who might have doubted this simple fact got their comeuppance in November, when the people of Myanmar had their first chance in a quarter-century to put their political preferences on display in a national election. Ms. Suu Kyi’s party, the National League for Democracy, or NLD, won more than 80% of the contested parliamentary seats. It was thrilling to see Myanmar’s citizens cock a snook at the generals who have ruled this country with unforgiving harshness since 1962, but the extent of her people’s adoration also raises some worrying questions about “the Lady” or “Mother,” as Ms. Suu Kyi is often known. How will she wield her newfound power? There is a sharp divergence in the histories of dissident leaders who rode popular acclaim to positions of real political power. One of the options is embodied by the late South African leader Nelson Mandela, another Nobel Prize-winner who, like Ms. Suu Kyi, spent years in detention, only to emerge as the overwhelming victor of a long-overdue democratic vote. Mandela resisted the temptation to tyrannize the former tyrants and stuck firmly to the principles of compromise, tolerance and respect for minorities. The alternate course is represented by Robert Mugabe, the Zimbabwean freedom fighter, lionized by his admirers, who assumed power only to succumb to the temptations of demagoguery and authoritarianism. Ms. Suu Kyi’s version of the story is unlikely to be straightforward. The outcome of the November election leaves aspects of Myanmar’s transition to democracy less clear than Ms. Suu Kyi’s landslide victory would suggest. The military still retains considerable political power. A quarter of the parliament is reserved for appointees from the armed forces. The current constitution guarantees the generals full control over the police and internal security and shields the defense budget from public scrutiny. And senior officers control vast swaths of the economy. What they don’t have is a shred of legitimacy, all of it thoroughly squandered after decades of brutal rule. So while the generals may still have the guns and the money, hearts and minds in Myanmar belong entirely to Auntie Suu. This adulation has solid roots. The NLD leader is the daughter of Gen. Aung San, who headed the national-liberation movement that finally persuaded the British to relinquish their colonial control of the country in 1947. She found herself thrust into the role of opposition leader during a student-led uprising against the then-reigning junta in 1988. When the newly formed NLD won a national election two years later, the military packed the entire opposition leadership off to jail, in many cases for decades; the Lady herself spent 15 years under house arrest. Throughout the years of persecution and self-sacrifice, she heroically persisted in proclaiming the virtues of nonviolent resistance and the superior morality of “freedom from fear.” Her words showed a strong affinity to the thinking of figures like Mahatma Gandhi and Václav Havel, not to mention a strong spiritual strain drawn from her intense Buddhist faith. Add an almost superhuman courage (demonstrated on several occasions when she calmly defied gun-wielding soldiers), and you can understand why many of her adorers view her as quasi-divine. Since the current reform period started four years ago, however, she has played down her past human-rights activism in favor of a new role as a practical politician. And despite the constraints so carefully engineered by the military, she has made it dramatically clear that she intends to set about expanding her power as quickly as she can. The constitution, engineered by the military seven years ago, bans her from becoming the head of state. She has responded by stressing that she won’t allow herself to be confined by the current political ground rules. At a news conference shortly before the election, Ms. Suu Kyi announced her intended role. “I will be above the president,” she told the journalists. “I will run the government, and we will have a president who will work with the policies of the NLD.” To her critics, that statement fits an ominous pattern. Despite its status as the future ruling party of a country of 51 million people, the NLD remains a one-woman operation. Its senior leadership consists of elderly nonentities, and the rank-and-file are mostly earnest dissidents of noble intentions and minimal professional experience. Ms. Suu Kyi has been conspicuously reluctant to cultivate potential successors. Earlier this year, NLD leaders urged her to consider inviting some of the country’s other leading dissidents to join the party’s election ticket. She declined. Internal party debate, by all accounts, is virtually nonexistent. Meanwhile, she has alienated many of her former supporters in the West with her ambivalent stance on the fate of the beleaguered Rohingya minority, impoverished Muslims who have suffered harsh discrimination by a government keen to pander to the prejudices of Myanmar’s Buddhist majority. But the authorities aren’t the only ones, it seems. The NLD declined to include a single Muslim candidate in its election list. As a result, even though Muslims make up around 10% of the population, not one will be sitting in parliament. The political parties representing the country’s myriad ethnic minorities were also crushed by the Lady’s landslide, meaning that they, too, face greatly reduced representation in the legislature—a situation that bodes poorly for efforts to end the world’s longest-running civil war. Still, we shouldn’t put the cart before the horse: The main barrier to democratization in Myanmar remains the military and its allies. But it is deeply ironic that the generals now represent the only constraint on Ms. Suu Kyi’s burgeoning personal power. The “pro-democracy camp” has no one with the political or moral stature to question the Lady’s decisions. Perhaps this should come as little surprise. After all, the notion of checks and balances remains unknown in a country that has little experience of democratic traditions or robust civilian institutions. “I do worry about her becoming a dictator,” one journalist in Myanmar told me. “But even so, I’d much rather have her as a dictator than the military.” For now, it would seem that the only person now in a position to hold the Lady to account is the Lady herself. —Mr. Caryl is a senior fellow at the Legatum Institute in London and a contributing editor at Foreign Policy magazine.

Rooms are decorated with memorabilia and gifts, the original furniture and books, as well as honours and medals that Churchill received. Lady Churchill's long-time secretary, Grace Hamblin, was appointed the first administrator of the house. Earlier in her career, Miss Hamblin had undertaken the destruction of the portrait of Churchill painted by Graham Sutherland. The picture, a gift from both Houses of Parliament on Churchill's 80th birthday in 1954, was loathed by both Churchill and Lady Churchill and had been stored in the cellars at Chartwell before being burnt in secret.The opening of the house required the construction of facilities for visitors and a restaurant was designed by Philip Jebb, and built to the north of the house, along with a shop and ticket office. Alterations have also been made to the gardens, for ease of access and of maintenance. In 1987, the Great Storm caused considerable damage, with some twenty-three trees being blown down in the gardens. Greater loss occurred in the woodlands surrounding the house, which lost over 70% of its trees.Chartwell has become among the National Trust's most popular properties; in 2016 some 232,000 visitors came to the house. In that year, the fiftieth anniversary of the house's opening, the Trust launched the Churchill's Chartwell Appeal, to raise £7.1M for the purchase of hundreds of personal items held at Chartwell on loan from the Churchill family. The items available to the Trust include Churchill's Nobel Prize in Literature awarded to him in 1953. The citation for the award reads, \\"for his mastery of historical and biographical description as well as for brilliant oratory in defending exalted human values\\". The medal is displayed in the museum room on the first floor of Chartwell, at the opposite end of the house to the study, the room where, in... answer the following question: What is the full name of the person earlier in whose career had undertaken the destruction of the portrait of Churchill?

Article: Our voice gives away a lot of information about ourselves. It can tell us our gender and age. And now, scientists say that it can also tell us our height. Scientists at Washington University, Indiana University and University of California found that listeners could accurately tell the height of speakers, just by their voices. And the key to this mystery is a sound known as the subglottal resonance . It _ with height and helps us build a mental picture of a person. \\"The best way to think about subglottal resonances is to imagine blowing into a glass bottle with water. The less water in the bottle, the lower sound,\\" said John Morton, a scientist at Washington University. And it's the same for humans. The frequency of the subglottal resonance depends on the height. The taller we are, the deeper the resonance frequency is. In order to find out whether people could identify the resonance, scientists did experiments. A number of same-sex pairs of different heights were told to read the same sentence aloud. It was played back to listeners who had to choose which one of the pairs was taller. Then, other listeners had to rank the speakers from the shortest to the tallest. The listeners were able to identify the tall people 62.17% of time, much higher than a lucky guess. Why not try the experiment yourself? Find out if your tall friends have deeper voices.

I'm not even sure if I was officially asked, I just wound up heading back to New Jersey when school was out. I think my parents thought it was a good enough deal. They were already having some problems and without Nonna there anymore to take care of me I think my cousin's house on the coast seemed like as good a spot as any to stick me for the summer. It certainly wasn't because of any great love between me and my cousin. We weren't really very good friends at that point. I think she saw me as sort of foisted off on her and getting in the way of her summers. Which was a fair enough judgment. But she could have been nicer. It's pretty amazing that she wound up as my Maid of Honor. Time does strange things. Your lovable jack-ass of a father would mention something about magic in here.

He's honestly so good at what he does that I can almost allow him to claim it's magic except that it'd be nice if he took credit for some of the things he's done with his life.

Gary's wife could sleep in the bed or on the couch, but chose the Pick from: -- couch because Gary was snoring. -- bed because Gary was snoring.","response":"Gary's wife could sleep in the bed or on the couch, but chose the couch because Gary was snoring. It was one of those nights where the soft hum of the air conditioner and the faint glow of the streetlight outside their bedroom window simply couldn't soothe her to sleep. Gary, looking so peaceful, snuggled up in their cozy, comfortable bed, had a snoring problem that had lately been reaching unprecedented volumes. Despite a deep love that Jennifer had for her husband, she found herself unable to fall asleep, her eyes wide open as she stared at the ceiling, listening to the ceaseless chorus of Gary's snoring. It seemed as if she had tried everything to help him with this situation – from nasal strips to white noise machines – but nothing had made a lasting impact. It was on nights like these that she felt like her only choice was to seek solace on the couch. As Jennifer gently rolled out of their bed, grasping carefully for her pillow and an extra blanket in the dark, she tiptoed out of the bedroom in an effort not to disturb Gary's peaceful slumber. The wooden floors felt cool under her bare feet, and she could hear the rhythmic ticking of the large wall clock down the hall, a reminder that the night hours were slowly ticking away. Arriving in the living room, Jennifer was confronted with the cold, uninviting couch. The living room's dim lighting cast eerie shadows over the various knick-knacks they had collected together over the years, giving the room an almost haunted appearance. Suppressing a brief shiver, Jennifer shrugged off any fear and began to rearrange the cushions and throw blankets, turning the couch into a temporary haven for the night. Although not nearly as comfortable as their bed, the couch was a quiet respite in comparison, and Jennifer could feel herself gradually starting to unwind. As the minutes turned into hours, she found her thoughts wandering – from happy memories of their honeymoon in Greece to concerns about her upcoming project at work. Slowly, the soothing sound of silence began to lull her into a much-needed sleep, her weariness gradually overtaking any lingering discomfort from her unconventional choice of resting place. Meanwhile, in their bedroom, Gary's peaceful face suddenly creased into a slight frown, his subconscious mind aware that something was missing. The comforting warmth and familiar scent of his wife was gone, and though his conscious mind could not quite grasp it, he felt an undeniable void on the otherwise crowded bed. As dawn began to creep through the cracks in the curtains, washing the living room with a soft, almost ethereal light, Jennifer awoke with a start. The stiffness in her back and neck told her that while her night on the couch had been a temporary solution, it was not one that could become a habit. As Gary roused himself from sleep, rubbing the sleep from his eyes and instinctively reaching for his wife, he found her side of the bed cold and empty. Realizing the cause of her absence, a quiet determination settled in his heart. Together they decided to seek help – from sleep specialists, to couples therapy, to exploring alternative remedies – to regain not only a good night's rest but also the emotional closeness that comes with sharing a peaceful slumber. With a renewed commitment to overcoming their nighttime hurdle, Gary and Jennifer embarked on a journey to rebuild their shared sanctuary, rediscovering the support and love they had for one another beneath the once deafening sound of Gary's snoring."},{"question":"Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context?

Step 1: Evaluate the options Option 1 focuses on the costume being more expensive, which can imply better quality or design. Option 2 focuses on the suit being more expensive, but it doesn't make sense to choose this option since the statement clearly says that the costume was better than the suit. Step 2: Justification of the chosen option Option 1 relates better to the original statement, as it provides a possible reason for the costume being of a better quality or more suitable to the situation than the suit. It also strengthens the narrative by providing a detail about the costume. Continuation of the story: The costume that my sister wore was better than my suit because the costume was more expensive. She had spent a considerable amount of time researching and assembling the perfect outfit for our upcoming masquerade ball. While I couldn't deny how great she looked, I was also slightly envious that I hadn't invested the same time and effort into my own ensemble. As we arrived at the ball, we were greeted by a crowd of elegantly dressed guests, each with their own beautifully-crafted masks and elaborate gowns. As we mingled, I couldn't help but notice how much attention my sister was receiving. Her costume, a stunning combination of satin, lace, and exotic feathers, was a true masterpiece and outshined everyone else in the room. The night went on, and I was still grappling with my own feelings of insecurity. I tried my best to participate in lively discussions and join my friends on the dance floor, but I couldn't shake the feeling that I was underdressed in comparison to my sister. As my self-consciousness grew, my sister approached me with a concerned expression. Sensing my discomfort, she took the time to reassure and encourage me, reminding me that it wasn't just the price of her costume that made her stand out. She emphasized how important it was to be confident and genuine, even if your suit isn't as expensive as someone else's costume. Soon, I started feeling better and genuinely enjoying the evening. At the end of the ball, as we walked home together, I realized that the true lesson of the night wasn't about how much one spends on their clothes.

Movie title: The Hard Corps Context: Phillip Sauvage (Jean-Claude Van Damme) is an American soldier suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder caused by his time in Iraq and Afghanistan. Sauvage snaps out of his stupor just long enough to join Clarence Bowden (Julian D. Christopher), his former commanding officer, to work as a bodyguard for former World Heavyweight boxing champion and now successful businessman Wayne Barclay (Raz Adoti). It appears that the release of notorious rap mogul Terrell Singletery (Viv Leacock) from prison has caused Barclay's worried sister Tamara (Vivica A. Fox) to take pro-active action by hiring Bowden and Sauvage, as Singletery has made threats in the past about doing away with the one man responsible for his incarceration Barclay himself. The first night of bodyguard work does not go well for Sauvage and Bowden, as Bowden gets killed during an assassination attempt on Barclay by a Hummer full of Uzi-carrying gangbangers sent by Singletery. It is up to Sauvage to continue the fight, which means bringing in a reinforcement in his friend Casey Bledsoe (Mark Griffin), and training some new recruits not of his choosing. Intending to give back to the streets that taught him toughness, Barclay insists that Sauvage compose his team of bodyguards by hiring people from Barclay's gym.

Repot the violet as soon as possible to avoid long-term damage. If the exposed stem part is shorter than 1 1⁄2 in (3.8 cm), you do not have to cut the stem to repot the plant. Also check the soil. If it is soggy even though the pot drains properly or the plant’s roots haven’t formed into a ball, your violet needs to be repotted in a pot the next size down. Use a pair of gardening scissors to prune the violet. Take off all flowers and flower buds, since they divert nutrients your plant needs to survive repotting. Also snip off any dead, dried, or discolored leaves you find. Cut as close to the stem as possible. Go back over the stem, dragging the blade from top to bottom. Smooth it out by scraping off any brown spots you notice. Be gentle and use a minimal amount of pressure. You don’t want to cut into the stem. Get a good potting soil or mix your own using components from a gardening center. Pack soil into the pot until it is about 1 in (2.5 cm) below the pot’s rim. Poke a small hole in the center of the soil with your finger. You can mix your own soil using components. Try mixing potting soil, vermiculite, and perlite in equal parts. Protect your violet by removing an elongated neck. Cut the stem horizontally with a sharp knife or shears. Make the cut at soil level, which should be about 1 1⁄2 in (3.8 cm) below the lower leaves. Check the exposed stem for signs of rot. If it appears brown on the inside, continue trimming the stem until all the rot is removed. Center the stem in the pot and place it in the soil. About 2 in (5.1 cm) of stem needs to be covered by dirt, so deepen the hole as needed. The leaves should be right above the pot’s rim. Pack the soil around it to hold the violet in place. If the neck is short, you don’t need to cut the stem. Instead, widen the hole in the pot and plant the roots in it like you normally would. Add small amounts of lukewarm water until the soil feels a little moist. Avoid letting it get soggy. Water should not run out the pot’s bottom. Although this part sounds strange, you need a zippered plastic bag like the kind you can get at a grocery store. It has to be large enough to contain the plant and the pot. Seal the bag to provide the kind of humid environment African violets thrive in. If you can’t get a zippered plastic bag large enough, use a grocery bag or something similar. Seal the bag with a wire tie. Choose a room with a steady temperature and a lot of sunlight. The ideal room stays between 75 °F (24 °C) and 80 °F (27 °C). Set your violet in a safe, bright spot away from direct sunlight. After about 3 days, check on the plant again. The soil may still be moist and you won’t need to do anything. If it is dry, add enough water to lightly dampen the soil again. Seal the bag once you are finished. Open the bag and test the violet by lightly tugging on the stem. If it feels stuck in place, the new roots have begun growing. Leave the bag open for a few days before taking the violet out. Go back to your normal water and fertilization routine to grow a healthy, long-lasting violet.","response":"This article provides a detailed guide on repotting African violets, addressing issues like exposed stem sections, soggy soil, pruning, preparing potting soil, and creating a humid environment with a zippered plastic bag for the plant to thrive in."},{"question":"Lawyer David Gibbs pleaded with the appeals court to order Schiavo's feeding tube reinserted to give her parents a chance to make a complete argument before a federal court that her rights are being violated.

Take 20 minutes or so on your end, and you can drastically improve the picture quality. If you just bought a TV, or just haven't found the time to mess around with your set, here are tips for doing it right. If you really want to nail it, we suggest a setup Blu-ray. They’re cheap, and the Disney WOW disc is especially helpful and easy to follow. (A step-up from that would be the 30 ISF HDTV Calibration Wizard.) Straight out of the boxAll HDTVs generally have a start-up screen that lets the user to choose between a home mode and a store demo mode. This is extremely important. The store mode is designed to produce the brightest image — at the expense of black level, contrast ratio and energy efficiency. To obtain the best picture select the home mode. You will still be able to make fine-tuning adjustments to maximize image quality. The screen will also ask you to choose your language, and will ask about using over-the-air antenna or cable/satellite. If you don’t use an antenna, make sure you select cable/satellite. You don’t want the TV to go into the tuner mode, because you won't see an image. Special instructions for smart TVsIf your new HDTV has Internet connectivity for streaming movies and other content, the next step should be connecting to the Internet. All smart TVs have an Ethernet connection if you want to wire the TV directly. Many also have Wi-Fi for wireless set-up. Follow the on-screen instructions or the owner’s manual for the proper steps. Once completed, you should make sure you have the latest version of the TV's software, by performing a firmware update as per your TV's instructions. The update may add new features, Internet services and even apps, and will assure you have the latest and best version of your new HDTV. Don't skip this: Nearly every TV we test has newer firmware waiting for it when we connect it to the Internet. Picture modesNearly all TVs have picture modes that adjust multiple settings to create a certain look to the image. The best idea is to start with the most accurate setting, then adjust as you see fit. With nearly all TVs, this mode is called “Movie,” “Cinema,” or something similar. If these aren’t options, “Standard” is likely closest. If you’ve already been watching your TV for more than a few minutes, switching to one of these modes is going to be a shock. It will seem red (warm) and soft. It isn’t, which I’ll explain as we go. ContrastThis control adjusts the bright parts of the image: Clouds, white shirts, snow, etc. The idea is to set this control high enough that the image “pops,” but not so high as to mask detail, like cloud textures or shirt wrinkles. All TVs have a maximum contrast setting, above which you’re not making the image any brighter, you’re just making near-white objects totally white. If you’re using a setup disc, the contrast pattern will have a ramp of progressively whiter bars. The idea is to be able see most of these (but not those labeled “above white”). If you’re not using a setup disc, find a TV show (ideally a live sporting event) that takes place outside. Skiing works great for this, though baseball does as well (fly balls, any shot of the sky). The idea is to be able to set the control so that you can still see detail in bright white objects. There should almost never be bright white blobs on the screen. If there are, turn the contrast control down until those blobs get their detail back. There is no average number to use as a guideline for setting contrast, but it’s almost never 100 percent, or anything close. Start somewhere around 80 percent and go from there. BrightnessThis is the opposite of the contrast control. Despite its name, brightness control adjusts the dark parts of the image: Shadows, black hair, black leather jackets. The idea here is to set it low enough that the picture has lots of contrast (as in, the difference in the light and dark parts of the image), but not so far that there’s just huge swaths of blackness on screen during any night scene. If you’re using a setup disc, the brightness pattern will have a ramp of progressively darker black bars. The idea is to be able see most of these (but not those labeled “below black” or similar). If you’re setting this by eye, any night or darkly lit scene will do. Set the control fairly low, down past the point where you lose detail. Now gradually increase it until you see detail in the darkness. If the picture looks gray or washed out, you’ve brought your brightness too far up. Color and tintGenerally speaking, you shouldn’t have to adjust these at all. These are holdovers from the old tube (CRT) TV days. With component and HDMI connections, the TV shouldn’t need adjustment to color or tint. But so you know, color is color saturation. Set too high, people will look sunburned, and everything will seem cartoony. Tint adjusts the green/red in the image (Martian/lobster). Without specific color filters (that usually come with setup discs), you can’t adjust either of these settings these correctly. Skip. SharpnessThis is a highly misleading control. Generally speaking, sharpness control adds enhancement to the image to make it appear sharp. Ironically, by doing so, it’s actually masking true fine detail in the image. This setting should be set as low as possible. Some TVs actually soften the image if you set it too low (bizarre, to be sure), so watch out for that. Look for dark lines on a bright background, like the edges of buildings for instance. Lower this setting so there isn’t any ghost line next to the dark edge. This ghost line is called “edge enhancement,” and goes a long way in making the image look artificial. Once you get used to the naturalness of the image without edge enhancement, you’ll never go back. Color temperatureThis one is going to be tough. Not because it requires any labor on your part, it’s just going to do something to the image that at first is going to seem bad. Color temperature is how bluish or reddish the image looks. Picture a typical scene of people walking down a street. Set the color temp too cool, and it will look like they’re walking down the street in winter, with that season’s normal bluish tones. Set the color temp too warm, and it will be a reddish warm day instead. With most TVs, the ideal setting is “warm” or “low.” In some cases, this is too warm, and “normal” is closer. If you’re changing the settings for the first time, and the TV was set in the “cool” color temp mode, everything will look wrong, and even “normal” will appear to your eye as too warm. Give your eyes time to adjust. Watch on “normal” for a few hours, and then “cool” will seem incredibly blue. BacklightThis is an LCD-specific control — plasma TVs don’t have backlights. Think of the backlight setting as a volume control for the image. Turn it up, and the entire picture (bright whites and dark blacks alike) get brighter. Turn it down, and everything gets darker. If you leave this turned all the way up, not only are you wasting energy, but at night your TV can be hard to watch. Modern LCDs are extremely bright, and watching such a small bright object in a dark room can create severe eye fatigue. For critical viewing, or watching at night, the idea is to get the best black levels, while still creating a watchable image. Once you set contrast and brightness correctly, turn the backlight control all the way down. This will likely be too dark for most viewing. Turn it up to the point where it looks the best. Often, at night, this could be as low as 20 percent, depending on the TV. During the day, you can set this as high as you want. Interestingly, no setup disc offers instructions on how to set this control. Read more on this in our buyer-beware article on TV backlights. For more on what your HDTV’s controls do, read our Guide to HDTV Settings. You can catch up with Geoff Morrison on Twitter at @TechWriterGeoff. His novel, \\"Undersea,\\" is now in paperback. Summary:","response":"Setting up a new HDTV requires about 20 minutes of your time to drastically improve picture quality. First, choose the home mode when starting up, connect your smart TV to the internet, check for firmware updates, and select the most accurate picture mode. Then, adjust the contrast control to ensure the image pops while maintaining detail, set brightness low enough to provide contrast without losing detail, and set sharpness as low as possible without softening. Next, adjust the color temperature for natural tones and optimize the backlight depending on whether you mostly watch TV during the day or at night."},{"question":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: This is a song, and millions of Americans will hear it on New Year's Eve.

McDonough case, however, the United States Supreme Court approved the use of Section 1983 as a vehicle for challenging a state's method of execution as cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment.

Therefore, the Supreme Court held in the Hill case that a prisoner can use Section 1983 rather than habeas corpus to bring the lawsuit. Yet, as Clarence Hill's own case shows, lower federal courts have often refused to hear suits challenging methods of execution on the ground that the prisoner brought the claim too late and only for the purposes of delay.

Joan sometimes lavishes Christina with attention and luxuries such as an extravagant birthday party, but also enforces a very stern code of denial and discipline. When Christina is showered with gifts, Joan allows her to choose only one she likes best that she can keep, then donates the rest to charity. As Christina rebels against her mother, confrontations ensue. Joan overtakes Christina in a swimming-pool race and laughs at the child. Joan becomes enraged when Christina reacts with anger and locks her in the pool house. Later, Joan discovers Christina wearing her makeup and imitating her. Even though Christina openly denies it and despite her protests, Joan - thinking that Christina is making fun of her, always rummaging through her drawers, trying to find a way to make people look at her, and always looking at herself in the mirror - hysterically cuts off chunks of Christina's hair to humiliate her.

A few years ago, Vegas was one of my “bucket list” places – one of those iconic cities that one should visit at least once in their life. For me, once was enough. This is now my 4th (I think?) trip to Vegas, and while the city has a lot to offer, it’s just not my cup of tea. For one thing, I’m not a gambler, like at all. I don’t have anything against it, I just don’t enjoy it. It either feels pointless or stressful to me. The city itself makes me a little sad – in some cases, it reeks of desperation. Last time I was there, my cab driver entertained me with stories of how she was working 3 jobs to save up enough to join some mega-massive bingo game. She won a small jackpot a few years back and that allowed her to work only one job for a few months. She was hoping to win again so she could cut back to 1 or 2 jobs. I wondered how many people do similar things – gambling their money away, in big or small chunks, in the hopes of that big score and in the process, putting themselves in a not-great financial situation. I suppose as long it makes them happy, then it’s all OK, but I can’t help but think someone like my cab driver might be happier overall if she only worked 1 job instead of 3, instead of working extra jobs to save up money to gamble her way to financial freedom. But that’s for her to decide, not me. The juxtaposition of extreme and in-your-face wealth and the homeless people on the Strip also makes me sad. It’s difficult to see people begging for food and sleeping on the street while all around you, millions of dollars are poured into creating a massive playground with every type of indulgence possible. But I’m the first to say that I’ve enjoyed staying in some of the nicer hotel properties there and eating several excellent meals at some of the finer restaurants in the area, so I’m not exactly helping to solve the problem.

Pogoing aside, Vicious had been involved in a notorious incident during that memorable second night of the 100 Club Punk Special. Arrested for hurling a glass at The Damned that shattered and blinded a girl in one eye, he had served time in a remand centre—and contributed to the 100 Club banning all punk bands. At a previous 100 Club gig, he had assaulted Nick Kent with a bicycle chain. Indeed, McLaren's NME telegram said that Vicious's \\"best credential was he gave Nick Kent what he deserved many months ago at the Hundred Club\\". According to a later description by McLaren, \\"When Sid joined he couldn't play guitar but his craziness fit into the structure of the band. He was the knight in shining armour with a giant fist.\\" \\"Everyone agreed he had the look,\\" Lydon later recalled, but musical skill was another matter. \\"The first rehearsals...in March of 1977 with Sid were hellish.... Sid really tried hard and rehearsed a lot\\". Marco Pirroni, who had performed with Vicious in Siouxsie and the Banshees, has said, \\"After that, it was nothing to do with music anymore. It would just be for the sensationalism and scandal of it all. Then it became the Malcolm McLaren story\\".Membership in the Sex Pistols had a progressively destructive effect on Vicious. As Lydon later observed, \\"Up to that time, Sid was absolutely childlike. Everything was fun and giggly. Suddenly he was a big pop star. Pop star status meant press, a good chance to be spotted in all the right places, adoration. That's what it all meant to Sid.\\" Westwood had already been feeding him material, like a tome on Charles Manson, likely to encourage his worst instincts. Early in 1977, he met Nancy Spungen, an emotionally disturbed drug addict and sometime prostitute from New York. Spungen is commonly thought to be responsible for introducing Vicious to heroin, and the emotional codependency between the couple alienated Vicious from the other members of the band.

I had started hanging out with the great and the good of the dot com world: attending launch parties for new sites, going to parties to celebrate them staying in business for a whole year, eating their lunches, drinking their booze and learning their secrets while they tried to convince me to write about them in my column. Many of these online entrepreneurs had become my friends and I'd managed to find myself a new girlfriend - Maggie, a Welsh journalist who was a restaurant reviewer for a food and drink website. This was a brilliant blag: it meant we could eat at some of London's best restaurants and never pay a penny. Life was wonderful: The Friday Thing and the Guardian column meant that my plan to use the Internet to become hugely famous and successful was firmly on track, I'd made lots of new friends, and, on top of all that, I was getting laid and eating gourmet food for free. Even Sam Lewis was jealous, and he was rich. Meanwhile, the people I was writing about were not having such an easy time of it. 2003 was a really strange time to be covering the 'new media' industry - mainly because no one was really sure for how long there would be an industry left to cover. The dot com boom of 1999 seemed like a millennium ago: a period in history as crazy as the tulip craze or the South Sea Bubble look to us now. The first signs of trouble for the industry had come in 2000. As the century turned, so had the market and - to use the parlance of analysts - the boom had turned out to be a bubble.

A:","response":"The time change in London takes place twice a year to mark the beginning and end of Daylight Saving Time (DST), also known as British Summer Time (BST) in the United Kingdom. This system was introduced to make the best use of daylight during the longer days of the summer months and to conserve energy. In the UK, clocks are changed forward by one hour at the beginning of British Summer Time and moved back one hour when returning to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). This time adjustment happens in accordance with a predetermined schedule. The exact schedule for changing the time in London is as follows: 1. Moving forward to British Summer Time (BST): Clocks are set one hour ahead on the last Sunday of March at 1:00 am Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). As a result, it becomes 2:00 am BST, which marks the commencement of British Summer Time. This transition is commonly known as \\"springing forward.\\" 2. Moving back to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT): Clocks are set one hour back on the last Sunday of October at 2:00 am British Summer Time (BST). Following the adjustment, it becomes 1:00 am GMT, signifying the return to standard time. This change is referred to as \\"falling back.\\" These time changes are automatic for most modern devices, such as smartphones, tablets, and computers with built-in calendar and time functions. However, for some other devices, such as wall clocks, wristwatches, and older electronics, manual adjustments might be necessary. To sum up, changing the time in London occurs twice a year: transitioning from GMT to BST on the last Sunday of March, and moving back from BST to GMT on the last Sunday of October. Adhering to this schedule allows for the utilization of daylight during summer months, and helps London and the rest of the United Kingdom conserve energy and better align waking hours with periods of sunlight."},{"question":"Question: Build a movie plot around this: What did Jerry, Bill, Mary, and Denise want to write their book about?

Based on the given premise, the man is wearing a vest and tie and is holding a flaming stick in a crowded area. The hypothesis states that a man holds fire in a crowd, which is a simplified description of the events in the premise. Let's break down the premise and the hypothesis: Premise: 1. A man is wearing a vest and a tie: This detail describes the man's appearance but does not directly relate to the hypothesis we are trying to prove. 2. The man is holding a flaming stick: This detail indicates that the man is in possession of fire on a stick. 3. The area is crowded: This detail shows that the event is happening within a group of people, making it relevant to the hypothesis. Hypothesis: 1. A man holds fire: The hypothesis focuses on the fact that a man is holding fire, which corresponds to the detail of the man holding a flaming stick in the premise. 2. In a crowd: The hypothesis emphasizes the location of the event, which is also mentioned in the premise as a crowded area. The two main elements of the hypothesis, the man holding fire and the presence of a crowd, are both present in the premise. The man's attire does not affect the truthfulness of the hypothesis; it is merely an extraneous detail. Therefore, if the premise is true, then the hypothesis \\"A man holds fire in a crowd\\" is also true."},{"question":"After leaving the Navy, Attenborough took a position editing children's science textbooks for a publishing company. He soon became disillusioned with the work and in 1950 applied for a job as a radio talk producer with the BBC. Although he was rejected for this job, his CV later attracted the interest of Mary Adams, head of the Talks (factual broadcasting) department of the BBC's fledgling television service. Attenborough, like most Britons at that time, did not own a television, and he had seen only one programme in his life. However, he accepted Adams' offer of a three-month training course, and in 1952 he joined the BBC full-time. Initially discouraged from appearing on camera because Adams thought his teeth were too big, he became a producer for the Talks department, which handled all non-fiction broadcasts. His early projects included the quiz show Animal, Vegetable, Mineral? and Song Hunter, a series about folk music presented by Alan Lomax. Attenborough's association with natural history programmes began when he produced and presented the three-part series Animal Patterns. The studio-bound programme featured animals from London Zoo, with the naturalist Julian Huxley discussing their use of camouflage, aposematism and courtship displays. Through this programme, Attenborough met Jack Lester, the curator of the zoo's reptile house, and they decided to make a series about an animal-collecting expedition. The result was Zoo Quest, first broadcast in 1954, where Attenborough became the presenter at short notice due to Lester being taken ill. In 1957, the BBC Natural History Unit was formally established in Bristol. Attenborough was asked to join it, but declined, not wishing to move from London where he and his young family were settled. Instead, he formed his own department, the Travel and Exploration Unit, which allowed him to continue to front Zoo Quest as well as produce other documentaries, notably the Travellers' Tales and Adventure series. In the early 1960s, Attenborough resigned from the permanent staff of the BBC to study for a postgraduate degree in social anthropology at the London School of Economics, interweaving his study with further filming. However, he accepted an invitation to return to the BBC as controller of BBC Two before he could finish the degree.

Looking at the allowed digits, we see that 5 is the only odd number. Thus, one or more of the digits in the area code must be 5. We can have the following combinations: 1. Two 5's and one even number (2 or 4): Since there are 2 options for the remaining even digit spot, 2 possibilities arise: - 5 5 2 - 5 5 4 These codes can have their digits ordered in different ways, so we must consider every permutation. - 5 5 2: 3 permutations (5 5 2, 5 2 5, and 2 5 5) - 5 5 4: 3 permutations (5 5 4, 5 4 5, and 4 5 5) 2.

While viscosity and surface tension increase as the strength of intermolecular forces increase, vapor pressure decreases . This is because the stronger the intermolecular forces are, the harder it is for liquid molecules to escape into the gas phase. Vapor pressure a measure of how much of a substance is in the gas phase when that substance is at equilibrium; that is, the number of molecules in the gas and liquid phases are not changing. The more molecules that are able to escape into the gas phase, the higher the vapor pressure. Vapor pressure is also proportional to temperature. As temperature increases, vapor pressure also increases. As a part of his engineering job Keith is measuring the vapor pressure of two locomotives, engine A and engine B. Engine A has a high vapor pressure, but engine B has a low vapor pressure. He noticed that to increase the speed of the engines he needed to increase the vapor pressure. Would engine A have higher or lower temperature than engine B? The answer to this question is:","response":"Engine A would have a higher temperature than engine B.

We arrived to catch Simona with a wooden crate in her hands, already half full of blush pink flower heads, small and as fragrant as honey. It wasn’t just roses that were bursting out of their bushes with colour and fragrance. In fact, every time I go to Canto del Maggio, I notice how lush the property is with fruit, flowers and plants, and every season there are bounties to be collected. The first time I was there I noticed the myrtle bushes and heirloom fruit trees — little tiny, red pears and apples. The garden was full of summer produce and I stole green-skinned figs harbouring raspberry-red flesh off the trees. The next time I went, we picked ripe olives off the trees around the pool and took them down to the local frantoio, olive oil mill, to press the bright green oil out of them. I also came home with buckets of corbezzoli, or Irish strawberries, to make jam. This spring, I noticed the hedge rows of flowering wild strawberries and this last visit we picked the berries off them for an afternoon snack. With the help of my daughter (who was slightly more interested in playing with Simona’s new puppy), we filled a crateful of roses and picked the petals delicately off and into bowls. We were using the rose petal jam recipe and the technique I learned between two wonderful sources — Pellegrino Artusi’s 1891 cookbook (this pastry recipe below is also inspired by it) and the Armenian monks on Venice’s Isola di San Lazzaro Island where I worked for two autumns. The secret, other than having beautiful, small and fragrant roses to begin with, is in massaging the petals with a bit of the sugar and the lemon juice until almost a pulp to release the essential oils.

In a study by Tombesi et al., they found plants who had previously been exposed to drought were able to come up with a sort of strategy to minimize water loss and decrease water use. They found that plants who were exposed to drought conditions actually changed they way the regulated their stomates and what they called \\"hydraulic safety margin\\" so as to decrease the venerability of the plant. By changing the regulation of stomata and subsequently the transpiration, plants were able to function better in situations where the availability of water decreased. What is an answer for this question: Which region had more plants with an ability to come up with a sort of strategy to decrease water use? Answer:","response":"To determine the answer to the question, let's go through the information provided step by step: 1.

A squirrel's home is called a drey. Patch's drey was very comfortable. He lived high up an old oak tree, in a hollowed-out stump of a big branch that had long ago been cut off by humans. The entrance was only just big enough for Patch to squeeze in and out, but the drey itself was spacious, for a squirrel. Patch had lined his drey with dry leaves, grasses and bits of newspaper. It was warm and dry, and on that cold morning he would have liked nothing better than to stay home all day and sleep. But he was so hungry. Hunger filled him like water fills a glass. The cherry and maple trees had not yet started to bud; flowers had not yet begun to grow; the juicy grubs and bugs of spring had not yet emerged; and it had been two days since Patch had found a nut. Imagine how hungry you would feel if you went two whole days without eating, and you may have some idea how Patch felt that morning. Patch poked his head out of the drey into the cold air and shivered as he looked around. Clumps of white, crumbly ice still clung to the ground. Gusts of cold wind shook and rustled the trees' bare branches. The pale and distant sun seemed drained of heat. Patch took a moment to satisfy himself that there were no dangers nearby, no hawk circling above or unleashed dog below. Then he emerged from his drey and began to look for acorns. But what marvels, what miracles, what mysteries are hidden inside those simple words!

In one account, Tweedy recalled: Around this time, I would say something into a microphone onstage, and afterward [Farrar would] pull me aside and say, \\"Don't you ever fucking talk into that microphone again.\\" He would misconstrue me talking into the microphone as more evidence of my out-of-control, rampant ego, more evidence of me feeling like I didn't have to be so fucking afraid anymore. Tweedy felt the new members gave him a new opportunity to contribute to the band, but Farrar felt disdain for Tweedy's new carefree attitude. Years later, Farrar would claim that he had been tempted to quit the band after seeing Tweedy stroking the hair of Farrar's girlfriend, an act which he believed to have been a proposition. In January 1994, Farrar called manager Tony Margherita to inform him of his decision to leave the band. Farrar told Margherita that he was no longer having fun, and didn't want to work with Tweedy anymore. Soon after the breakup, Farrar explained his departure: \\"It just seemed like it reached a point where Jeff and I really weren't compatible.

Translate to English","response":"The Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Rodrigo de Rato, praised the country's \\"impressive\\" transition to independence and the improving economy. The statement made by IMF's Managing Director, Rodrigo de Rato, highlights the remarkable progress made by the country ever since it gained independence. This notable progress is observable in various aspects of governance, politics, and the overall economic growth of the nation. The admiring remarks by such a high-ranking official serve as a morale booster and a testament to the efforts put in by the country's leaders and citizens alike. Gaining independence is a crucial turning point in a country's history, and it brings along a host of challenges to overcome. Transitioning to a self-sustaining and autonomous state involves building robust and sustainable economic policies, strong governance structures, and a well-functioning social welfare system. Furthermore, national security, energy independence, and investments in infrastructure also play a significant role in the success of a newfound independent nation. The fact that a global financial institution such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) lauds the country's achievements can validate its policies and growth trajectory. It signals that the country has successfully managed to overcome the challenges brought about by independence and is moving in the right direction, keeping in line with globally recognized economic benchmarks. The IMF, as a leading financial organization, plays a vital role in global economic affairs by promoting international monetary cooperation, maintaining global financial stability, fostering sustainable economic growth, and facilitating international trade. Their acknowledgment and endorsement of a nation's progress, therefore, carry significant weight and can boost the image of the country internationally, making it an attractive destination for investments and strategic partnerships. By acknowledging the country's \\"impressive\\" transition to independence and the improvement in its economy, the IMF's Managing Director, Rodrigo de Rato, essentially commends the government, policymakers, and businesses for their collective efforts.

The actor had spent the last four months in the Dallas hospital, where his condition continued to decline. Lester was best known for playing heavyset offensive lineman in the film Varsity Blues alongside actors James Van Der Beek, Paul Walker, Scott Caan and Jon Voight. In addition to being the film's resident party animal (\\"Puke and rally!\\"), Lester's character is also remembered for his struggle with repetitive concussions, a fairly prescient subplot given what would happen in the NFL in the decade that followed.

The actor better known as Billy Bob, the morbidly obese offensive lineman in the 1999 hit movie Varsity Blues, is wandering the floor of the Dallas Fort Worth Auto Show promoting a movie that might never get made. But he’s got his shtick down pat. His aw-shucks smile appears whenever a stranger inevitably gushes, “You look great!” The self-deprecating jokes come easy. And he keeps the business cards that feature before-and-after photos at the ready. “I love fans. They don’t blow up my phone,” says Lester, who once tipped the scales at 508 pounds. “They’re respectable, or they don’t believe it’s me.” Lester, who weighs in at 198 pounds today, is here to pitch Racing Legacy, a faith-based NASCAR drama he wrote. To raise awareness, and hopefully some funding for the project, he has wrapped his 2001 Chrysler 300M in elaborate vinyl decals transforming his everyday car into a rolling billboard for the movie. “It’s totally ridiculous,” he says, gazing at the vehicle. Foot traffic inside the Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center is slow this afternoon, but Lester, an opportunistic salesman, pounces when he spots a woman photographing his car. “Have you seen Varsity Blues?” he asks her. She looks perplexed. “I’m Billy Bob!” Lester blurts, grinning and pointing to the windshield where his royal blue no. 69 jersey from the movie hangs. “Oh my God,” she says, feigning an openmouthed knee-buckle. “You’ve changed.” “A lot has changed,” he says. Lester is nearly unrecognizable in his new body. Maybe it’s the plastic surgery, but he looks young for 43 years old. Lester had six inches of skin removed from each side of his face after losing the weight. He’s undergone 17 surgeries in all to remove excess skin. He wears a black button-down short-sleeve shirt and heavily distressed Royal jeans with unsightly white stitching on the seams; Red Wing boots add an extra inch or two to his 5-foot-10 frame. Aside from a few specks of gray, he has a privileged head of hair — full on top, tight on the sides, and spiked in front. He reeks of Burberry cologne. “You got Paul on there,” she says, noticing Paul Walker’s face decaled on the rear driver’s-side door. “I’m dedicating the movie to Paul,” Lester says of his late Varsity Blues costar. “Are you doing car wraps now?” “No,” Lester says, sounding crestfallen. “I’m doing a movie.” Once she departs, he sits on the front grill of a Jeep to rest his feet. It’s a little past two in the afternoon. Only eight more hours of hustling. He sips his soda, then sighs. “I need to become famous for something else.” ♦♦♦ What happens to a man who loses more than half of himself? Ron Lester has searched for the answer since December 2000, when he underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery with a duodenal switch. Since he realized in the third grade that his massive girth could draw laughs, Lester knew his fate was as the funny fat guy. When he moved to Hollywood — a town where funny fat guys can become millionaires — he was an overnight success. There was one problem, though: His moneymaker was slowly killing him. With a family history of heart problems, the 500-pound Lester wasn’t long for this world. Surgery saved his life. It also ended his career. A shrinking man with loose skin greeted casting directors expecting the funny fat guy, and Lester struggled to score roles post-op. Now living in Dallas nearly 15 years after his glory days, he is left to ponder whether choosing life was the right decision. “Am I alive? Yes. Am I happy? No. Did I throw away my career to be skinny? Yes,” he says. “I wouldn’t do [the surgery] again. I would much rather have died happy, rich, and kept my status and gone out on top.” ♦♦♦ Lester was raised in a trailer park in Kennesaw, Georgia, a city that became infamous when it introduced a law requiring its citizens to own guns. His father was an independent truck driver. Lester’s mother, his best friend, painted and sculpted. As a kid, Lester was fascinated with baseball and explosives — one of his favorite pastimes was assembling a model toy car and then blowing it up with an M-80. He struggled at North Cobb High School and was held back three times. He didn’t graduate until he was 21. But before that, he found his calling in film class. “Ron knew it all,” says Cliff Biggers, a teacher at North Cobb. “I thought it would be much more likely he would go into film production. I did not know he had an interest in acting.” But Lester was a natural in front of the camera, and booking jobs came easy. He was discovered on the set of a Formula 409 commercial in Georgia, where he was plucked from a sea of extras and elevated to a principal character. From there, he traveled the standard route for a young actor and comedian: sets at local dives, stand-in work, a feature in a country music video, and finally a move to Los Angeles in 1995. A friend from Georgia invited Lester to stay in the massive downtown loft she lived in with her boyfriend Christopher McQuarrie, the soon-to-be Oscar-winning screenwriter of The Usual Suspects. “When he first came out, as a housewarming present, he brought me a mason jar full of moonshine that had been distilled on a radiator of a Ford F-150 somewhere in Georgia,” McQuarrie remembers. Lester’s Southern-boy demeanor worked to his advantage. “He was such a character and completely alien to anything else anyone was doing in Los Angeles,” McQuarrie says. “We had a pretty good idea he was going to take off. His determination, his personality — you just had a feeling when you met him that things were going to be all right.” In the few weeks Lester lived with McQuarrie, he booked stand-up gigs at the Ice House, Laugh Factory, and Melrose Improv. A spot with the heralded improvisational sketch comedy troupe the Groundlings soon followed. Movies were the logical next step, and he nailed his first audition, landing the role of head fry cook Spatch in the Kenan & Kel tween comedy Good Burger. Released in July 1997, the film took in 23 million against a 9 million budget. More important, Lester impressed the film’s young director, Brian Robbins, who kept him in mind while casting his next movie, Varsity Blues. “Ron really is a sensitive, sweet guy. Billy Bob as a character was such a sensitive soul. He was Billy Bob,” Robbins says. “There was no second choice.” Set in the fictional town of West Canaan, Texas — where football, a voice-over tells us, is a way of life — Varsity Blues was envisioned as Porky’s meets Friday Night Lights. The plot merged clichés from the sports and teen genres: After star quarterback Lance Harbor (Paul Walker) hurts his knee, can backup Jonathon Moxon — a.k.a. Mox (James Van Der Beek at the height of Dawson’s Creek hysteria) — stand up to his immoral coach (Jon Voight), stay true to himself, win the big game, and get the girl (Amy Smart)? (Yes, yes, yes, and of course.) When audiences first saw Lester in Varsity Blues, he was driving a pickup truck, dipping a folded pancake into a jar of peanut butter, and chasing it with a swig of maple syrup. Other than Lester’s distaste for peanut butter, Billy Bob wasn’t much of a stretch. Lester owned a pickup truck in high school and got hammered at wild house parties, but at heart he was a sensitive mush — just like the character. Convincingly portraying a football player was a greater challenge. “Ron’s weight was a major concern,” says Mark Robert Ellis, the film’s football coordinator. “I usually double all these guys because I can’t let the actors take the big, big hit. I knew I couldn’t find a football player in Texas [Lester’s size]. I found a big kid and then built a fat suit for him to double Ron.” Filming in the oppressive Austin heat wasn’t easy. During the three weeks of two-a-days, Ellis protected Lester by making sure he took enough plays off, drank plenty of Gatorade, and always had an ice towel nearby. Still, Lester tore a patellar tendon, jeopardizing the film’s climactic scene. “The biggest problem was, when it was time for him to get that close-up right before the hook-and-ladder play,” Ellis remembers. “Getting him into that three-point stance was the hardest thing to do. He could make the catch on the hook and ladder. He had good hands, was a good athlete; he just had all that weight.” The dramatic interplay was more in Lester’s wheelhouse, particularly the scene where Billy Bob contemplates suicide. Wracked with guilt over disappointing his coach (and, in retrospect, possibly suffering from post-concussion syndrome), Billy Bob sits on the back of his pickup with his football trophies, a bottle of tequila, and a Mossberg 12-gauge pump shotgun when he’s confronted by Mox. “Championship trophy. Steelers. We were 9. Remember this shit? Playing Pee Wee?” “Yeah,” Mox says. “It was fun.” “No, it wasn’t. I remember being yelled at.” Billy Bob throws the trophy. “Too fat, Billy Bob!” Bang! “Too slow and dumb!” He pulls the pump handle. Bang! “It was great,” Robbins, the director, says. “I remember that night shooting that scene, and you don’t do that once, you do it over and over again from different angles. And he was just able to deliver that performance over and over again, and those were real tears and real emotion coming out of him.” Lester drew on pain from his personal life, thinking of his late father and his sister Linda, who died at 35. He also pulled from his own struggles with suicide. Inconsolable after Linda passed, he had put a loaded gun to his head and pulled the trigger. Nothing happened. “God,” he says, is the only explanation. “I actually have the bullet, still. It’s not a dud; it’s live. It just didn’t go off,” Lester says. “I was kind of dreading [that scene] because I knew where I’d go. But I’m an actor and I’m making a commitment to the character. To do that, you have to go 100 percent and just hope you pull yourself out of it.” ♦♦♦ Varsity Blues is probably remembered best for three things: Ali Larter in the whipped cream bikini, “I don’t want your life!” — and Billy Bob. Lester agrees, for the most part. “I don’t mean this in an ego way, but I have never met anyone who has seen the movie who hasn’t said to me, ‘You stole that movie,’” he says. “In fact, there was a point where Paramount was getting complaints from Van Der Beek’s people that I was stealing the movie from him.” As far as Van Der Beek’s signature line, Lester isn’t impressed. “The accent, the way it’s delivered, it bones me, it bends me over and bones me bad.” Paramount thought Varsity Blues was a potential sleeper when it was released on January 15, 1999. The movie debuted at no. 1, earning more than 52 million domestic in its run. And with its successes, Lester quickly joined an enclave of Young Hollywood, with a penthouse apartment in Koreatown. Nights at Jerry’s Deli with Topher Grace, Ashton Kutcher, and Wilmer Valderrama followed, along with 1,600 sushi dinners with Melissa Joan Hart and friends at Yamashiro. His career kept rolling, too, with a recurring part on Freaks and Geeks and a starring role as Michael “Sugar Daddy” Bernardino in the WB ensemble Popular. Lester banked 35,000 an episode — but money alone couldn’t make him happy. He says the set of Popular was as cliquey as the high school depicted on the show and that there were times — like when he wasn’t invited to a nightclub outing with the cast — that made him feel like the uncool fat kid all over again. One night he vented to Kutcher and Valderrama. “Ashton goes like this: ‘It’s a job. If you walk away friends, it’s a plus,’” Lester says. “There is not one moment where that thought process would’ve been introduced on the set of Varsity Blues. It was a family, and it was kind of like a drug. Every project, every TV show, every movie I’ve done, I keep hoping to relive the camaraderie we had on Varsity Blues.” ♦♦♦ But there were moments of tough love even on the set of Varsity Blues. At one point, Paul Walker and Eliel Swinton, the former Stanford strong safety who played running back Wendell Brown in the movie, told Lester he needed to lose weight. “It was like, ‘Dude, I hate to be that guy, but you’re not healthy, bro,’” remembers Swinton, Lester’s roommate during filming and still a friend today. “We went to Sam’s Warehouse and I just remember him buying an extreme amount of junk food.’” To this day, Ron Lester has a complicated relationship with food. “Can I get some mayonnaise?” he asks a waiter. Lester sits in the W XYZ Bar of the Aloft hotel in downtown Dallas, drinking a gin martini. An Angus burger and fries rest on his plate. “I’m a dipper, bro,” he says later, dunking a fry into the watery mayo. “You want a fry and dip?” Lester eats all his fries, but only a small bite of the burger. He takes the leftovers home in a doggie bag. With only one quarter of his stomach remaining, he can’t handle much more than that. If he overindulges, the food settles in his esophagus. His limit, he says, is a Wendy’s Jr. Bacon Cheeseburger. “When I’m done eating that — no fries, no soda — I feel uncomfortable.” Still, he frequents fast-food joints. The next day at the car show, I see him digging into a bag of McDonald’s fries. Earlier in the day, he picked up Jack in the Box. “Sometimes it’s just to have the taste,” he says. Certain eating habits are strict. He avoids milk shakes and cereal and can’t drink certain kinds of alcohol, like beer. He definitely can’t handle a Billy Bob shot. Lester says nervousness caused him to overeat when he was a kid. A typical after-school snack was a half loaf of bread and a half gallon of milk. He hid cookies in the bathroom. Food was a coping mechanism — he ate when he was sad, happy, or bored. When he was living in Los Angeles, Lester mapped every drive-thru within a 12-mile radius of his house. He knew which restaurants were open until 10 p.m. and which were 24/7 joints. And there were epic binges, of course. Once, he sat alone in his room at the Plaza hotel devouring three steaks, a plate of creamed spinach, two loaded potatoes, dessert, and three bottles of wine. By the second season of Popular, the weight had slowed Lester down. His breathing became heavy and labored. He’d lost 40 pounds that summer at a 20,000 “fat camp” at Duke University, but gained it all back, plus an extra 20, upon returning to L.A. He tried every diet. “Jenny Craig is a liar,” Lester says today. “Weight Watchers is just nothing but a whole bunch of women complaining, then measuring food, and then coming back and complaining the next week. Horrible food, by the way. I remember when fen-phen came out, I tried it. That was a good one. Then of course you had the chips made with that oil [Olestra]; it gave you a leaky ass. That’s fun.” His breaking point came while shooting a scene for Popular parodying Madonna’s video for “Music.” The plan was for Lester to play the Ali G role of chauffeur, but he couldn’t fit behind the steering wheel. For nearly an hour, the crew tried everything, even ripping out the front seat and replacing it with an apple box, to no avail. Lester left the set in tears. The next day he saw a segment on Entertainment Tonight about Carnie Wilson’s August 1999 gastric bypass surgery. He was determined to change himself. Within a week of making the decision, Lester says, he was in New York consulting with surgeons. The next day, December 21, 2000, he was on the operating table, but there were complications, his heart couldn’t handle the trauma, and he flatlined. He never saw “a light” while he was under. He thought he was trapped in purgatory. Over the next month and a half, Lester lost 100 pounds. To celebrate, he decided to play one last funny fat guy. As Reggie Ray, a fat, dumb football player — essentially, a Billy Bob sendup — in the spoof Not Another Teen Movie, Lester saw his chance to retire the act. It would be his last role in a major studio motion picture. ♦♦♦ While not subjected to the cruel weight-shaming and body-type expectations faced by their female counterparts, there’s limited room for overweight actors in Hollywood. Casting directors always need an oafish henchman or a massive offensive lineman or a pratfalling buddy. But those roles are rare, and rarely leads. Upon losing the weight, Lester entered a wider pool: He was just another good-looking and talented guy competing against thousands of actors for the same “normal-size” roles. “It was definitely a big transition,” says his former agent Karen R. Forman. “I think he didn’t realize how hard it was going to be.” At first, Lester thought his talent would translate regardless of his size. After all, he was the same actor, remarkable body transformation notwithstanding. But as the awkward auditions piled up, Lester realized his career had gone into free fall. At one point, he joked about showing up for auditions in a fat suit. “It’s an emotional roller coaster, because you’re not just learning how to be a new person,” Lester says. “You’re in an industry where it’s about [your] image.” Lester’s size had been his identity, his currency — and in Hollywood, that is everything. “Hollywood is a very fickle and strange place,” Brian Robbins says. “I remember joking with him: ‘Don’t get skinny. You’ll lose your weight and your career.’ I didn’t really mean it.” Lester chased women to fill the void. A virgin until 30, he was already making up for lost time. In addition to indiscriminate flings, there were a few serious relationships, including a woman with a giant butterfly tattoo he married after dating for only one month and a girlfriend from the Flagstaff, Arizona who dumped him after seeing his chest. “I can’t be in this relationship because all I see is your skin,” she told him. Distraught, he considered suicide again after the breakup. “That turned into a disaster, and after four weeks it fell apart,” says Lester’s friend Damien Lewis. “He’s so quick to jump into something. He feels like if he locks her up and gets married, there won’t ever be that sense of abandonment he’s felt so many times.” Lester was dealt a more devastating blow in early 2006, when his mother was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. Putting his career on hold, he left Los Angeles immediately and for the next year he spent countless nights in her Georgia hospital, spending precious time with his best friend. His mother died in March 2007. Lester stayed in Georgia afterward. “I threw away my career to save my life, and if I hadn’t done that, I wouldn’t have been around long enough to be there for my mom,” he says. “To me, that’s the payoff. Yeah, it sucks. I’ll totally call myself a has-been. I don’t care. Let’s just be realistic: I filled a niche. I was the funny fat guy.” Memories of a recent audition keep him raging. “I walk in, they have my head shot as of now, and they actually made the comment, ‘Oh, you’ve lost a lot of weight.’ Motherfucker, where have you been? I’m VH1’s top celebrity slim-down! I beat Jared [Fogle]! What, did you think I was going to walk in and be 500 pounds again? I’m not Carnie Wilson. What the fuck!” ♦♦♦ Lester arrived in Dallas last February — true to form, for a girl. After meeting her on the dating website Plenty of Fish, he left Georgia and proposed to her within a month. The couple split in December, and he now lives in a studio in uptown Dallas. But Lester thinks of it as a business move, as well; he sees Dallas as the perfect place to get Racing Legacy off the ground. Inspiration for the project hit Lester after seeing a friend’s 13-year-old cousin race Legends cars — 5/8th-scale replicas of cars from the 1930s that can hit 100 mph — at the Dixie Speedway in Georgia. He started writing the screenplay in September 2010. At the time, he was contemplating suicide again. “When I was writing this movie, I had a .45 on my desk. That first draft saved my life,” he says. “I was at such a low point in my life again, but I was distracted by what I was writing. Then when I wrote it, I forgot about [suicide].” Racing Legacy is the story of a teenage Legends racer who loses his dad and goes to live with his uncle, a disgraced former NASCAR driver. Lester hopes to play Uncle Roger, a hard man — neither funny nor fat. He has high hopes for the cast: He wants Tim McGraw for the dad (“We’ve talked to his management and agent in Nashville,” Lester says); Robert Duvall for the grandfather (“I got a producer who worked with him on Get Low — apparently, he likes the idea”); and Stephen Baldwin as the heavy (“I think it would be fun to work with him”). Then there’s the price tag. At a projected 25 million, Racing Legacy doesn’t fit into Hollywood’s 200 million tent-pole-or-bust ideology. Even Ron Howard struggled getting the Formula One period piece Rush to the starting line. “Twenty-five is realistic,” Lester says. “I have explosions, car wrecks, I’m going to need stunt drivers. I have to rent racetracks, there’s insurance, and then there are the names I want to use. Those names alone are half my budget.” He’s filmed an effective sizzle reel. But at the moment, there is no funding or director attached. “This movie may never get made,” he says. “I’m not saying I’m counting everything on Racing Legacy being made. It’s not about getting my career back. I don’t care about being famous. I don’t even care about going back to Hollywood, man. C’mon, man, I turn 44 this year, let’s be realistic.” What’s worse, Lester’s early career earnings are gone. “I lost every penny,” he says. “I’ve invested pretty much everything into getting this movie made. My [former] business manager was stealing from me, so I took all my money and put it in mom’s name. When she was dying of ovarian cancer, I wasn’t thinking of bills and didn’t realize that her name was on the account. Then on the night she died, I lost everything. When a person dies, they close the bank account because the money in there goes to paying taxes and hospital bills first, and then the family gets what’s left and that’s part of the inheritance. I lost a little over 300,000 in one night, and my mom.” ♦♦♦ Lester is positioning Racing Legacy as a “faith-based” film, a choice informed by his own religious awakening. Born to a Jewish mother and Catholic father, he avoided organized religion for most of his life. But upon moving to Dallas, he began attending Elevate Light, a nondenominational megachurch in nearby Frisco. Then last September, he wound up in Duck Dynasty patriarch Phil Robertson’s Sunday school class. “Next thing you know, I’m getting baptized,” Lester says. “They take me in the back, do their whole confession thing, prayer, they put you in these scrubs, and you’re walking out to this pool in front of the congregation. It’s like waist-deep, enough to dunk you in. Here’s Jase, wearing his camouflage waders up to his chest as if he was out hunting. He says his thing he always says, and the next thing you know he’s dunking me in the water. The water was so freaking hot.” Marketing Racing Legacy as “faith-based” seems a shrewd business move here in the Bible Belt. At the auto show, he meets a woman who works in a church group that doubles as a production company. Lester leaps into pitch mode, playing the sizzle reel for her and her husband while breezing through the plot. “Single mom?” the woman in cowboy boots asks about the main character’s upbringing. “Yeah, single mom,” Lester confirms. He shows off his car. “You won’t miss me driving around Dallas,” he jokes for the 50th time today. Then they exchange information. Lester is upbeat afterward. “You don’t know who knows who,” he says, beaming. It’s the happiest he’s looked all day. At this point, Ron Lester’s reclamation project comes into focus. It’s not his career he’s trying to save. It’s his life. Racing Legacy may not get the financing it needs or attract the cast Lester wants. But it offers something that’s been missing. He promises the suicide attempts are behind him. He started therapy earlier this year. And he loves teaching — two acting classes full of eager, paying students. There’s still a chance, however small, that he becomes famous for more than just Billy Bob. He’s still auditioning, still hunting for gigs. Though recently, he made one major change to his process: He took Varsity Blues off his résumé. ||||| What is a summary?","response":"Actor Ron Lester, best known for his role as Billy Bob in the 1999 high school football movie \\"Varsity Blues,\\" passed away on June 17, 2016, at the age of 45 due to liver and kidney failure.

The equation is 17*m + 2539 + 2289 = -m - 53*m. On the left side, we can combine the constants 2539 and 2289. On the right side, we can combine the m terms -m and -53*m. 17*m + (2539 + 2289) = (-1 - 53)*m 17*m + 4828 = -54*m Step 2: Move the m terms to one side of the equation and the constants to the other side. To do this, we'll add 54*m to both sides of the equation to move all m terms to the left side. Then, we'll subtract 4828 from both sides to move the constant to the right side. 17*m + 54*m = -4828 (17 + 54)*m = -4828 71*m = -4828 Step 3: Solve for m.

Liam started reading about apex predators, while Fox read about grazers and large herbivores. Which cousin learned more about predators with no natural predators? Hint: An apex predator, also known as an alpha predator or top predator, is a predator at the top of a food chain, with no natural predators.Apex predators are usually defined in terms of trophic dynamics, meaning that they occupy the highest trophic levels. Food chains are often far shorter on land, usually limited to being secondary consumers – for example, wolves prey mostly upon large herbivores (primary consumers), which eat plants (primary producers). The apex predator concept is applied in wildlife management, conservation and ecotourism. Answer:","response":"Based on the description and hint provided, Liam, who focused on reading about apex predators, would have learned more about predators with no natural predators.

Women teachers are always saying that boys are \\"silly\\" in class. They refuse to \\"sit nicely like girls\\" and are more likely to be addicted to \\"schoolboy tricks\\".Women teachers may also keep low expectations of boys' academic achievement and encourage girls to work harder by letting them think they are cleverer than boys. The study suggests that under-performance among boys in most national exams could be linked to lower expectations of their women teachers. The researchers did their research mainly on women teachers, since nearly 90 percent of primary school teachers are female. According to the research, women teachers said they often found boys' play in the classroom or in the playground, such as playing with toy guns. The researcher also found that boys were often punished and urged to follow a more feminine style of play instead of being taught how to play responsibly with their favorite toys by their women teachers. Bonny Hartley, the study's lead author, said, \\"By seven or eight years old, children of both boys and girls believe that boys are less focused, less able, and less successful than girls -- and think that adults admit this idea. There are signs that these expectations have the potential to become self-fulfilling in influencing children's achievement. Boys are really held back by their women teachers.\\" A:","response":"Based on the given article, which of the following statements best describes the findings of the study conducted on women teachers and their impact on boy students? A. Women teachers encourage boys to be more focused and disciplined, leading to higher academic achievements among male students. B. Women teachers blame boys for engaging in typically male behavior, resulting in low expectations, academic underperformance, and the reinforcement of gender stereotypes. C. Women teachers focus on building balanced relationships with both male and female students, thereby creating a fair learning environment. D. Women teachers are more likely to support boys in developing their unique skills and abilities, without comparing them to female students."},{"question":"Q:Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: The Brookville BL20CG is a diesel-electric locomotive built by which organization, it uses three Cummins QSK-19 engines, Cummins, Inc. is an American Fortune 500 corporation that designs, manufactures, and distributes engines, filtration, and power generation products?

Pelecanos is more interested in working families struggling to get by, the racial tensions in its ethnic neighborhoods and the low-lifes on the edges. His crime-writing peers call Pelecanos the \\"undisputed poet\\" of Washington's gritty side. The best-selling and award-winning author is out this week with his 17th and latest novel, \\"The Cut.\\" It's the first in a new series featuring Iraq war veteran and private investigator Spero Lucas. When he's not working for a Washington defense attorney, Lucas recovers stolen property for a 40% cut. Now, a high-profile crime boss hires Lucas to find out who's been stealing from him, and it could turn out to be Lucas' biggest payday or an untimely end. While Pelecanos made his bones in the noir tradition, there's a definite \\"Western\\" feel to \\"The Cut.\\" The new novel takes place in a morally gray and often violent world. It's peppered with pitch-perfect dialogue and captures the sights, sounds and taste of Washington in rich detail. In short, Pelecanos reads like the real deal.

In this task, you are given a abstract of article and corresponding title of an article. Your task is to generate label \\"yes\\" if title is right for article, otherwise generate \\"no\\". Abstract: PURPOSE Minimal (< 10 mm thick) pleural effusion (PE) may represent an early phase of malignant PE, but its clinical relevance has rarely been studied. Therefore, we examined the proportion of minimal PE in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and its impact on survival. We also considered possible accumulation mechanisms in our data set. PATIENTS AND METHODS On the basis of PE status from chest computed tomography scans at diagnosis, 2,061 patients were classified into three groups: no PE, minimal PE, and malignant PE. Twenty-one variables associated with four factors-patient, stage migration, tumor, and treatment-were investigated for correlation with survival. RESULTS Minimal PE presented in 272 patients (13.2%). Of 2,061 patients, the proportion of each stage was the following: 5.2% stage I, 10.9% stage II, 13.2% stage IIIA, 23.8% stage IIIB, and 13.9% stage IV. Minimal PE correlated significantly with shorter survival time than did no PE (median survival time, 7.7 v 17.7 months; log-rank P < .001), even after full adjustment with all variables (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.21 to 1.62). Prognostic impact of minimal PE was higher in early versus advanced stages (Pinteraction = .001). In 237 patients (87.8%) with minimal PE, pleural invasion or attachment as a direct mechanism was observed, and it was an independent factor predicting worse survival (P = .03). CONCLUSION Minimal PE is a commonly encountered clinical concern in staging NSCLCs. Its presence is an important prognostic factor of worse survival, especially in early-stage disease..

Question: suppose more environmental regulations on pollution happens, how will it affect LESS damage by acid rain. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","response":"B: less If more environmental regulations on pollution are implemented and enforced, it is likely that there will be LESS damage caused by acid rain. These regulations would typically focus on reducing the emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), which are the primary precursors of acid rain. When these emissions are reduced, there will be a decrease in the formation of acid rain. Consequently, this will lead to several positive impacts on the environment, including: 1. Less acidic water: With a reduced amount of acid rain, the acidity levels in water bodies such as lakes, rivers, and streams will decrease. This will create a healthier environment for aquatic life, including fish and other organisms that are sensitive to changes in water pH levels. 2. Healthier soils: Reduced acid rain will result in less soil acidification, allowing trees and other vegetation to grow better. Acidic soils can harm plants by dissolving essential nutrients and causing nutrient imbalances. When soils are less acidic, trees will be able to absorb the necessary nutrients from the soil, leading to improved growth and overall ecosystem health. 3. Less damage to leaves and vegetation: Acid rain can cause damage to the leaves and needles of trees and other plants, hindering their ability to photosynthesize. When there is less acid rain, this damage will be minimized, allowing plants to remain healthy and productive. 4. Reduced damage to infrastructure: Acid rain can also cause the corrosion and deterioration of buildings, structures, and monuments, leading to costly repairs and maintenance. With decreased acid rain, there will be less need for repairs and preservation efforts, thus saving money and preserving historical architecture. Overall, the implementation of more environmental regulations on pollution will likely decrease the amount of damage caused by acid rain, leading to numerous benefits for both the environment and society."},{"question":"I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? Clean between keyboard keys. Pick from: A). Stick post it note between keys.; B). Stick tissue paper between keys.;","response":"When it comes to cleaning between keyboard keys, there are multiple methods that can be used to achieve this goal. Here, we will be discussing the two options you have provided, and additionally, a few other methods for an even more thorough cleaning routine. A) Stick a post-it note between keys. Using a post-it note to clean between keyboard keys can be an effective method for removing dust, crumbs, and other debris. To accomplish this goal, follow these steps: 1. First, power off the device and unplug it from any power source. 2. Peel a post-it note from the pad and fold it in half, lengthwise, so that the sticky side is exposed. 3. Gently insert the folded edge of the post-it note between the keys. You may need to angle the post-it note to effectively reach between the keys. 4. Slowly slide the post-it note back and forth between the keys, allowing the sticky side to pick up debris. 5. Repeat these steps for all rows of keys on the keyboard, using a fresh post-it note when needed. 6. Once all the rows have been cleaned, you may want to use a can of compressed air to remove any remaining debris. B) Stick tissue paper between keys. Using tissue paper to clean between keyboard keys can also be a useful method, especially for light cleaning, as it can help remove any dust or dirt. To use this method, follow these steps: 1. Turn off the device and disconnect it from any power sources. 2. Take a piece of tissue paper and fold it into a thin strip, then twist it to make it more slender and rigid. 3. Gently insert the twisted tissue paper strip between the keyboard keys, taking care not to apply too much pressure or force down on the keys. 4. Move the tissue paper strip back and forth, and up and down, to pick up any debris lodged between the keys. 5. Use a fresh tissue paper strip if needed, and repeat steps 3-4 for all rows of keys. 6. After cleaning between all the keys, you may use a can of compressed air to eliminate any remaining dust or debris from the keyboard. Besides these two methods, there are a few more techniques to increase the efficacy of your keyboard cleaning. A few additional methods include: 1. Using a can of compressed air: This helps dislodge any stubborn debris from between the keys and is highly effective. 2. Using a small brush or an old toothbrush: This can help remove larger debris or dust from the surface of the keyboard and in-between keys. 3. For more thorough cleaning, consider removing the keys, but make sure to consult your device's user manual and follow all recommended procedures to avoid damaging it. By combining the methods above, you will be well-equipped to effectively clean between keyboard keys and maintain the functionality and longevity of your device."},{"question":"Question: - Sunlight strikes the chlorophyll molecules in the plant - Is trapped - Plant also takes in water and carbon dioxide from the environment - The plant forms glucose What might be the last step of the process?

For others, he offers simplistic conspiracies to explain their world. Bin Laden also relies heavily on the Egyptian writer Sayyid Qutb. A member of the Muslim Brotherhood executed in 1966 on charges of attempting to overthrow the government, Qutb mixed Islamic scholarship with a very superficial acquaintance with Western history and thought. Sent by the Egyptian government to study in the United States in the late 1940s, Qutb returned with an enormous loathing of Western society and history. He dismissed Western achievements as entirely material, arguing that Western society possesses \\"nothing that will satisfy its own conscience and justify its existence.\\" Three basic themes emerge from Qutb's writings. First, he claimed that the world was beset with barbarism, licentiousness, and unbelief (a condition he called jahiliyya, the religious term for the period of ignorance prior to the revelations given to the Prophet Mohammed). Qutb argued that humans can choose only between Islam and jahiliyya. Second, he warned that more people, including Muslims, were attracted to jahiliyya and its material comforts than to his view of Islam; jahiliyya could therefore triumph over Islam. Third, no middle ground exists in what Qutb conceived as a struggle between God and Satan. All Muslims-as he defined them-therefore must take up arms in this fight. Any Muslim who rejects his ideas is just one more nonbeliever worthy of destruction. Bin Laden shares Qutb's stark view, permitting him and his followers to rationalize even unprovoked mass murder as righteous defense of an embattled faith. Many Americans have wondered, \\"Why do 'they' hate us?\\" Some also ask, \\"What can we do to stop these attacks?\\" Bin Laden and al Qaeda have given answers to both these questions.

The atmosphere at this gem of a restaurant is simply divine - it features a cozy, welcoming interior with stylish yet comfortable seating and tasteful decorations. The soothing playlist in the background was the perfect accompaniment to our dining experience, and the gentle, warm lighting heightened the restaurant's charm. The staff are the epitome of hospitality. From the warm greetings upon our arrival to the attentive table service, every interaction with the team at Tasty Treats Cafe made us feel like valued guests. Our server, James, was particularly outstanding. He provided excellent menu recommendations, had a great sense of humor, and always seemed to be there just when we needed him without being overbearing. Now for the main reason anyone visits a restaurant - the food! I must say, Tasty Treats Cafe exceeded my expectations in every way. We started with the baked brie appetizer, which arrived piping hot and perfectly gooey, accompanied by a delightful assortment of toasted baguette slices, fresh fruit, and a tangy homemade preserves. Each bite provided an explosion of flavor, expertly blending the rich, creamy brie with the sweet and savory accompaniments. For the main course, I chose the seared Atlantic salmon, which was undoubtedly one of the best salmon dishes I've ever had. The fish was cooked to perfection - tender, moist, and flaky - and the accompanying lemon-caper sauce added an irresistible zestiness that elevated this dish to new heights. My dining partner opted for the slow-cooked beef short ribs, which fell off the bone and melted in our mouths. The rich red wine reduction and buttery whipped potatoes were the perfect complement to the succulent meat. And we can't forget dessert! We shared the decadent triple chocolate mousse cake, which was everything a chocolate lover could dream of. The presentation was exquisite, and each layer of the cake delivered a sensational chocolate experience that had us savoring every last bite. The extensive wine list and expertly crafted cocktails further enhanced our meal. It was evident that every aspect of the dining experience at Tasty Treats Cafe had been carefully considered to create a meal that would linger in our memories for a long time. In conclusion, my experience at Tasty Treats Cafe was nothing short of exceptional. From the delightful ambiance, the attentive and friendly staff, to the phenomenal food, this restaurant has earned itself a glowing review and a repeat customer.

He has been reassigned from combat duties in Korea by General Webster, the father of his fiancée, Eileen. Airman Joe Kelly, who is Ace's enlisted crew chief, is about to wed a Japanese woman, Katsumi, in spite of the disapproval of the United States military establishment, which will not recognize the inter-racial marriage. The Air Force, including Ace, is against the marriage. Ace and Joe have an argument during which Ace uses a racial slur to describe Katsumi. Ace eventually apologizes, then agrees to be Joe's best man at the wedding. Ace falls in love with a Japanese entertainer, Hana-ogi, who is a performer for a Takarazuka-like theater company, whom he meets through Katsumi. Eileen realizes that Ace's attentions are no longer focused on her and begins a friendship with a famous Kabuki performer, Nakamura.

Joe suffers further prejudice at the hands of a particularly nasty colonel, pulling extra duty and all the less attractive assignments. When he and many others who are married to Japanese are targeted for transfer back to the States, Joe realizes that he will not be able to take Katsumi, who is now pregnant. Ace goes to General Webster and pleads Joe's case, asking that he be allowed to remain in Japan. When the General refuses on the grounds that he cannot allow an exception, Ace tells him that he will be in the same situation, since he intends to marry Hana-Ogi.

The city is situated at an elevation of 1,395 meters (4,577 feet) above sea level, giving it a high-altitude climate with warm summers and cool, dry winters. Bloemfontein was established in 1846 by Major Henry Douglas Warden, a British army officer, as a military outpost. The name \\"Bloemfontein\\" derives from the Dutch and Afrikaans words for \\"fountain of flowers\\" or \\"blooming fountain,\\" which may also contribute to its popular nickname \\"the city of roses.\\" The indigenous Sotho people initially called it Mangaung, meaning \\"place of cheetahs,\\" and today, Bloemfontein is part of the Mangaung Metropolitan Municipality. Regarding its position in Africa, Bloemfontein is located in the continent's southern region. South Africa is one of the continent's most developed nations, and Bloemfontein plays a significant role as one of its key cities. The city is approximately midpoint between South Africa's Cape Town and Johannesburg and is well-connected through road, rail, and air routes, ensuring easy access and transportation across the country. In addition to its rich history and judicial importance, Bloemfontein is renowned for its cultural, educational, and sports institutions. It is home to the University of the Free State, the Central University of Technology, the National Museum, and the National Afrikaans Literary Museum, among others.

Therefore, it is logical to say that all programmers work with computers. - Sentence B: \\"All students play with computers.\\" This sentence does *not* make sense because it overgeneralizes and assumes that every single student plays with computers. While it is true that many students use computers for various purposes, including studying, communication, and entertainment, it is incorrect to say that all students play with computers. Some students may not have access to computers, while others may prefer activities that don't involve technology. Based on this analysis, Sentence B does *not* make sense as it makes an overgeneralization about students."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Process: - An organism dies - Water seeps into the remains - Minerals dissolved in the water form crystals - Crystalized minerals cause the remains to harden - The minerals form a fossil. Question: suppose less water in the environment happens, how will it affect LESS fossils forming. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","response":"A decrease in available water in the environment could indeed lead to fewer fossils being formed. The process of fossil formation, known as fossilization, is dependent on several factors, including the presence of water. A lack of water can influence multiple aspects of this process, which we will explore to understand the overall impact on fossil formation. 1. Less Water Seepage into Remains: With a reduced water content in the environment, there will be less water seeping into the remains of an organism. Water plays a crucial role in transporting dissolved minerals into the remains, which is a critical component of the fossilization process. As a result, less water in the environment would lead to fewer opportunities for minerals to be introduced and deposited into the remains. This would, in turn, lead to fewer opportunities for the formation of crystals that eventually turn remains into fossils. 2. Limited Crystal Formation: As mentioned earlier, the fossilization process relies on minerals dissolved in water to be carried into the remains. These minerals eventually crystallize, leading to the hardening of the remains and the formation of a fossil. A lack of water will greatly reduce the availability of dissolved minerals and could prevent the necessary crystal formations from occurring. This disruption in the crystallization process would significantly hinder the fossilization process and result in fewer fossils being formed. 3. Effect on Decomposition: Another issue could arise because of the lack of water in the environment, which is how it might impact the rate of decomposition. Water is an essential component for many decomposers (bacteria, fungi, etc.) and facilitates the breakdown of organic matter. A water-scarce environment might slow down or halt decomposition, increasing the chances that remains are preserved well enough to undergo fossilization. While this might seem like it would support fossil formation, the other factors discussed previously (e.g., the limited availability of dissolved minerals) would still limit the number of fossils created. In summary, if less water is present in the environment, it is likely that fewer fossils would form due to limited water seepage into remains, reduced mineral availability, and decreased crystal formation opportunities. While a reduction in decomposition rates due to water scarcity might provide better preservation of remains, this factor alone would not be enough to counterbalance the other limitations. Therefore, having less water in the environment would have a negative impact on the second aspect of the fossilization process and would generally lead to the formation of fewer fossils overall."},{"question":"For April 2000: Your mind is so active, inventive, and unlimited this month that you're capable of almost anything!

Which 2006 British-American mockumentary comedy film was Bad Grandpa a reminiscent? Answer:","response":"The 2006 British-American mockumentary comedy film that \\"Bad Grandpa\\" is reminiscent of is \\"Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan.\\" Directed by Larry Charles and starring Sacha Baron Cohen as the titular character, Borat Sagdiyev, the film employs a similar format to \\"Bad Grandpa\\" where the lead character ventures on a cross-country journey in the United States, interacting with real-life, unsuspecting individuals along the way. \\"Borat\\" presents a satirical take on American culture through the eyes of a fictitious Kazakhstani journalist who travels to the United States to document the American way of life. As a result, Sacha Baron Cohen, as Borat, often engages in outrageous and provocative behavior designed to elicit genuine reactions from the people he encounters. Released to much controversy and acclaim, \\"Borat\\" demonstrated how comedy could serve as a tool for exposing cultural biases, prejudices, and ignorance. Similarly, the 2013 American hidden camera comedy film \\"Bad Grandpa,\\" directed by Jeff Tremaine and featuring Johnny Knoxville as the main character, Irving Zisman, exhibits a parallel approach to filmmaking as seen in \\"Borat.\\" In \\"Bad Grandpa,\\" Irving, a trash-talking, irresponsible, and vulgar 86-year-old man, goes on a road trip across America with his 8-year-old grandson, Billy, played by Jackson Nicoll. Much like \\"Borat,\\" the journey is filled with shocking, crude, and hilarious encounters with unsuspecting people, as well as carefully planned stunts and pranks. This method of filmmaking is designed to capture real reactions from ordinary citizens, creating humor from their unscripted interactions with the main characters. In both \\"Borat\\" and \\"Bad Grandpa,\\" the hidden camera and mockumentary storytelling techniques, coupled with the outrageous and absurd antics of the characters, serve as a commentary on the nature of social norms and contemporary cultural values. By utilizing these styles, the filmmakers push boundaries and challenge prevailing notions of what is acceptable in humor and entertainment. As a result, \\"Bad Grandpa\\" can be seen as a direct descendent of the path forged by \\"Borat,\\" continuing in the same comedic vein to provide laughter and social commentary to its audience."},{"question":"I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

Rather than antagonism, the two women are shown to have a somewhat close relationship, primarily based on their apparent mutual hatred of Michel, who is physically and emotionally abusive to both.Unable to stand his mistreatment any longer, Nicole devises a plan. Though hesitant at first, Christina ultimately consents to help Nicole. Using a threatened divorce to lure Michel to Nicole's apartment building in a remote village several hundred kilometers away, Christina sedates him. The two women then drown him in a bathtub and dump his body in the school's neglected swimming pool. When his corpse floats to the surface, they think it will appear to have been an accident. Almost everything goes according to their plans until the body fails to surface, and Michel's corpse is nowhere to be found when the pool is drained.Nicole sees in the paper that the police found the corpse. Christina goes to the morgue and learns it is not Michel's body. There she meets Alfred Fichet (Vanel), a retired private detective. He gets involved in the case, much to Nicole's chagrin.When Christina and Alfred come back, a boy is punished for breaking a window; the boy says Michel punished him. After hearing this Christina becomes very sick. She is unable to be photographed for the school photo; however, it seems that Michel is in it, in the back next to a window. Nicole becomes worried and leaves the school. Christina, overcome by fear, tells Alfred everything. He does not believe her, but he investigates the pool. Christina hears some noises and wanders the school. She concludes that someone is in the school and she runs back to her room. She finds Michel's corpse in the bathtub. Michel rises from the tub, and Christina has a heart attack... My question: Who's corpse in the bathtub The answer to this question is:","response":"Michel's corpse is in the bathtub."},{"question":"Here is a news article: The United Nations observer mission in Syria will expire this weekend and will not be extended, France's Ambassador to the UN, Gerard Araud, told reporters Thursday. The news comes as the Syrian government pounded the country's largest city Thursday, using aerial forces to shell neighborhoods and intensifying the siege that has become a focal point of the country's civil war. CNN inside Syria: Nobody imagined it would turn into this Meanwhile, in neighboring Lebanon, another person was kidnapped in an incident believed to be linked to the violence in Syria. At least 158 new deaths were reported across Syria on Thursday, according to the opposition Local Coordination Committees in Syria. The deaths include 50 in Aleppo. They also include 60 unidentified bodies found in Qatana, a Damascas suburb, the LCC said. The bodies, found in a landfill, \\"seem to have been executed in a massacre by the regime's army,\\" the group said. At least eight people were killed and more than 50 wounded when shells struck near an Aleppo bakery where people had lined up to buy bread, said Ahmad al-Zaeem, a commander in the rebel Free Syrian Army. At least 150 people have been wounded in the latest violence in Aleppo, he said. ||||| The Security Council will let the U.N. military observer mission's mandate in Syria expire Sunday and will back a new civilian office there to support U.N. and Arab League efforts to end the country's 18-month conflict. France's U.N. Ambassador Gerard Araud, the current Security Council president, said Thursday that members agreed to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's proposal for a liaison office. Araud said the council agreed that conditions set for possibly extending the mission of the unarmed observers past Sunday were not met. He says there was no halt to the Syrian government's use of heavy weapons and no significant reduction in violence. Russia invited U.N. ambassadors from key world powers that met in Geneva in June and agreed on guidelines for a political transition in Syria to meet in New York on Friday and call on all sides to end the violence. \\"More than 18,000 people have been killed during the last 18 months,\\" Ban told reporters in East Timor on Wednesday. \\"The Syrian people have suffered too much too long.\\" In a letter to the council last Friday, Ban said, \\"it is imperative for the United Nations to have a presence in Syria\\" aside from its humanitarian operation in order to support U.N. and Arab League efforts \\"in mediating and facilitating a peaceful resolution to the crisis.\\" The Security Council initially authorized the 300-strong observer mission to deploy to Syria for 90 days to monitor implementation of a six-point peace plan brokered by U.N.-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan. The plan was to start with a cease-fire and withdrawal of the government's heavy weapons and culminate with Syrian-led political talks. Assad's government and opposition forces agreed to the plan, but it was never implemented. Because of the worsening bloodshed and insecurity, the observers have been mainly confined to their hotels since June 15, and their numbers have been cut by about two-thirds. The U.N. said Wednesday that 110 observers remain in Syria, mainly in Damascus. A bomb exploded Wednesday outside their hotel, wounding three people, but no observers were hurt. Frustrated at the escalating conflict and the failure of world powers on the Security Council to unite to stop the chaos, Annan announced last month that he was resigning effective Aug. 31. Russia and China have vetoed three Western-backed Security Council resolutions that would have stepped up pressure especially against the Syrian government by threatening sanctions if the fighting didn't stop. ||||| A powerful Shiite Muslim clan in Lebanon on Thursday claimed to have abducted more Syrian nationals and vowed further kidnappings in retaliation for the seizure of a family member by rebels in Syria this week, as Syria's civil war threatened to break open violent rivalries in its neighbor Lebanon.

Masked Lebanese believed to be from... (Associated Press) The wave of kidnappings raises the dire scenario that the battle for control over Syria will ignite tensions in Lebanon, a country with its own history of civil war, an explosive sectarian mix and deep divisions between pro- and anti-Syrian factions _ many of them armed. Already, the abductions have brought gunmen from both the Shiite and Sunni communities into the streets. On Wednesday, Shiite supporters of the al-Mikdad clan went on a rampage in a Beirut neighborhood, vandalizing dozens of Syrian-run stores, and then blocked the road to the airport, setting tires on fire and wandering the road with guns. Travelers were forced to walk from their cars to the airport, and at least one flight was cancelled. The road was only reopened early Thursday morning. The tensions emerged Thursday in the eastern Bekaa Valley, near the Syrian border. Masked men believed to be from the Bekaa town of Majdal Anjar _ a Sunni stronghold _ burned tires and set up roadblocks on the main highway leading to the Masnaa border crossing between Lebanon and Syria. They stopped cars going either way and checked passengers' IDs before deciding whether to let them pass, apparently looking for Shiites or Mikdad supporters. In the nearby town of Chtoura, four gunmen abducted Syrian businessman Hossam Khasroum, pulling him from his car as he was driving and taking him to an unknown location, security officials said. Khasroum, the offficials said, is known to be a support of Assad's regime. In a separate incident, gunmen attacked a car driven by pro-Syrian Lebanese politician, Joseph Abu-Fadel, breaking his car windows with stones as he was driving to Syria. He and three others were lightly injured. On Wednesday, armed members of the al-Mikdad clan said they had kidnapped more than 20 Syrian nationals and a Turk in Lebanon in retaliation for the abduction of their relative, Hassane Salim al-Mikdad, who was captured in Syria this week. Rebels who kidnapped al-Mikdad claimed he was a member of the Shiite militant group Hezbollah, a staunch supporter of President Bashar Assad's regime. Hezbollah and his family deny this. Maher al-Mikdad, a family spokesman, warned on Thursday that \\"if anything happens to Hassane, we will kill the Turkish hostage we have and many others. But we will start with the Turks.\\" Speaking to The Associated Press, he said the clan has snatched more Syrians and warned that it would go on with further kidnappings until their clansman is released. He could not give an exact number but said the clan was now holding more than 20 captives. Lebanon's government appeared largely unable or unwilling to stop the kidnapping spree and escalating violence. Hezbollah and its allies hold a majority in the Cabinet, which has adopted a policy of \\"disassociation\\" from the events in Syria, trying to remain neutral. Hezbollah critics say it is assisting Assad in moving the conflict to Lebanon to divert attention from the deadly civil war raging in Syria. The al-Mikdad family is a powerful Shiite Muslim clan that originally comes from the eastern Bekaa Valley, an area where state control is limited and revenge killings are common. Like most tribes in this area, they have their own militia, and security officials say many of its members are outlaws wanted on arrest warrants. The family reach also extends to the capital. A south Beirut neighborhood with strong al-Mikdad ties, Rweis, is often avoided by outsiders who fear any possible offense that could put them at odds with the clan. The al-Mikdad's power often put them at odds with Hezbollah, the main power broker in the area, although many observers believe the appearance of armed groups Wednesday claiming to be members of the \\"military wing\\" of al-Mikdad family could not have happened without at least tacit Hezbollah support. The wave of hostage-taking prompted Gulf countries to call on all their citizens in Lebanon to leave immediately. Sunni regional powerhouses Saudi Arabia and Qatar, who back the Syrian rebels, were the first, followed by the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Kuwait. Lebanon is a popular summer destination for Gulf residents trying to escape the searing heat. Al-Mikdad backed off an earlier threat to abduct Gulf nationals. He said Thursday that only Syrians and Turks would be targeted. \\"Our problem is with the Syrians who have abducted our son and Syrian opponents of the region,\\" he said. \\"And why Turkey? Because Turkey is an operation theater for the Free Syrian Army,\\" he added. Turkey shelters thousands of Syrian refugees along with the leadership and members of the Free Syrian Army rebel group. The conflict in Syria has a sharply sectarian tone. The rebels are predominantly Sunni, whereas President Bashar Assad and his inner circle come mainly from the Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shiism. Similarly, Lebanon has had long rivalries between its own Sunni and Shiite communities. Throughout Syria's conflict, Lebanese Sunnis have largely been sympathetic to the Syrian rebellion, while Hezbollah _ the main Shiite political power _ has backed Assad. ||||| Launch Gallery Expand A residential area in Azaz, hit by at least two bombs from a Syrian fighter jet on August 15, 2012. © 2012 Rachel Beth Anderson for Human Rights Watch (Azaz) – A Syrian government fighter jet bombed a residential neighborhood, killing more than 40 civilians and wounding at least 100 others in the town of Azaz, including many women and children, Human Rights Watch said today after visiting the town. In the attack on August 15, 2012, at least two bombs destroyed an entire block of houses in the al-Hara al-Kablie neighborhood of Azaz, in Syria’s northern Aleppo province. Human Rights Watch investigated the site of the bombing two hours after the attack and interviewed witnesses, victims, medical personnel, and relatives of those killed. “This horrific attack killed and wounded scores of civilians and destroyed a whole residential block,” said Anna Neistat, acting emergencies director at Human Rights Watch. “Yet again, Syrian government forces attacked with callous disregard for civilian life.” Azaz residents told Human Rights Watch that, at around 3 p.m., they saw a fighter jet drop at least two bombs on the residential area. Within seconds, dozens of houses in an area of approximately 70-by-70 meters – more than half a football field – were flattened. Houses on the surrounding streets were significantly damaged, with collapsed walls and ceilings. On the streets around the bombed area, windows were broken and some walls had collapsed. Two opposition Free Syrian Army facilities in the vicinity of the attack might have been targets of the Syrian aircraft, Human Rights Watch said. One was the headquarters of the local Free Syrian Army brigade, in the former building of the Baath party, two streets away from the block that was hit. The other was a detention facility where the Free Syrian Army held “security detainees” – government military personnel and members of pro-government shabeeha militia. Neither of these facilities was damaged in the attack. Rescuers used two bulldozers to retrieve the dead and wounded from the ruins. By 7 p.m., medical personnel at the scene said they had recovered 25 bodies, and were looking for more in the rubble. A man helping to bury the bodies said that by midnight 33 people had been buried in Azaz. The exact number of victims is difficult to verify. Most of the wounded were transported to hospitals across the nearby Turkish border. A hospital volunteer in the Turkish town of Kilis, about 20 kilometers north of Azaz, told Human Rights Watch that 61 wounded people from Azaz had been brought to the hospital, and another 13 people had died either on the way to Kilis or shortly after arrival, among them seven men, two women and four children. At least another 16 severely wounded people were brought to a hospital in the Turkish town of Gaziantep, about 80 kilometers from Azaz, a doctor in that hospital told Human Rights Watch. One Azaz resident, “Ahmed,” told Human Rights Watch that the bombing had killed at least 12 members of his family in their home. He believed that four other family members were still under the ruins. He said: I was about 100 meters away from the house when I saw the airplane and heard the sound of the bombing and destruction. My three brothers lived here. I buried 12 of my family members today, including my father, my mother, and my sister – my brother’s wife as well. Walid, my brother, was cut into pieces. We didn’t recognize him at first. We buried my brothers’ children also. The youngest was 40 days old. “Ali” was weeping on the ruins of his house. He told Human Rights Watch: I was on the roof, making tomato soup, when I suddenly heard the plane. I heard several loud bangs, and was thrown to the floor. When I got up, I saw my wife who was injured – hit in the chest by shrapnel or debris. She was taken to the hospital – I still do not know what happened to her. “Ayman” told Human Rights Watch: My brother, sister and my father’s wife were killed today. What was Bashar al-Assad looking for in this area? …There were no weapons here. I live far away from my family, but when I heard the sounds of the explosion I came here and saw all this destruction. I was here when they removed the bodies of my family from under the rubble. Two of my killed relatives were 9 and 6 years old. International humanitarian law, or the laws of war, applies to all Syrian government and armed opposition forces in Syria. The laws of war prohibit direct attacks on civilians. Homes, apartments, and other civilian structures are also to be protected from attack, unless they are being used for military purposes. Where there is doubt about whether a target is military or civilian, it must be presumed to be civilian. The laws of war also prohibit attacks that strike military targets and civilians indiscriminately, such as those that are not directedat a specific military target.Attacks are also prohibited that may be expected to cause incidental civilian loss that would be disproportionate to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated from the attack. Military commanders must choose the means of attack that can be directed at military targets and will minimize incidental harm to civilians. If the weapons used are so inaccurate that they cannot be directed at military targets without imposing a substantial risk of civilian harm, then they should not be deployed. Weapons, such as aerial bombs with a large blast radius may be considered indiscriminate when used in populated areas. The laws of war do not prohibit fighting in urban areas, although the presence of many civilians places greater obligations on all warring parties to take steps to minimize harm to civilians. All forces need to take constant care during military operations to spare the civilian population, and take all feasible precautions to avoid loss of civilian life and property. These precautions include doing everything feasible to verify that the objects of attack are military targets and not civilians or civilian objects, and giving \\"effective advance warning\\" of attacks when circumstances permit. All forces must also avoid deploying near densely populated areas, and strive to remove civilians from the vicinity of their forces. At the same time, attacking forces are not relieved from their obligation to take into account the risk to civilians simply because they consider the defending forces responsible for locating military targets within populated areas. Governments have an obligation to investigate allegations of serious laws-of-war violations by their military forces. Those committed with criminal intent – deliberately or recklessly – are war crimes. Governments are obligated to identify and prosecute the individuals responsible for war crimes according to international fair-trial standards. Human Rights Watch called on United Nations Security Council members to impose an arms embargo on the Syrian government and targeted sanctions on government officials responsible for abuses, and refer the Syrian conflict to the International Criminal Court. “Syrian forces in northern Aleppo are using heavy artillery and aerial bombing in populated areas that kill and maim civilians every day,” Neistat said. “All Security Council members should show that protection of civilians means more than empty words.” ||||| A summary of this is?","response":"The United Nations observer mission in Syria is set to expire and will not be extended, according to France's Ambassador to the UN, Gerard Araud.

On the positive side, the app does a fairly good job of emulating PSP games, providing a nostalgic experience for fans of the console. The interface is user-friendly, allowing gamers to navigate quickly with minimal fuss. Plus, the app's compatibility with various games is impressive, which means users have a diverse library to choose from. However, there are a couple of drawbacks that I encountered while using the app. Firstly, I noticed the sound and graphics quality was not always up to par, compromising the overall gaming experience. Some games were even quite laggy, making it challenging to play them smoothly. Additionally, while the app is free, the presence of ads can be quite intrusive and distracting while engaging in gameplay. I understand the need for ad revenue, but I feel there could be a better balance to ensure the ads are not too disruptive. In conclusion, the org.ppsspp.ppsspp app is a satisfactory choice for PSP emulation, but it falls short in some aspects, such as sound and graphic quality, and the intrusive ads. With some improvements, I believe this app has the potential to become a top-notch emulator. For now, it earns a solid 3 stars in my book."},{"question":"Given those answer options, answer the question: Title: Poor remix of popular sound tracks Review: I was definitely disappointed with their renditions of popular theme songs.

Cut tree stump in half using bandsaw.; Answer:","response":"The best way to cut a tree stump in half largely depends on various factors such as the stump's size, its accessible location, and available tools and expertise. Based on the options provided, we can analyze both the chainsaw and bandsaw methods to determine the best approach. (a) Cut tree stump in half using a chainsaw Using a chainsaw is generally the most popular choice when it comes to cutting a tree stump in half. Chainsaws are powerful, expertly designed for wood cutting, and widely accessible. They are capable of cutting through thick and tough tree stumps with relative ease and speed. Advantages: 1. Faster cutting time. 2. Can handle larger and thicker tree stumps. 3. Provides a more even cut due to the straightness of the chainsaw blade. 4. Ideal for outdoor projects or situations in which the stump cannot be easily moved. 5. Can be rented or purchased at a reasonable cost. Disadvantages: 1. Safety concerns – a chainsaw can be dangerous if not handled properly. 2. Requires regular maintenance in terms of chain sharpening and servicing. 3. Potential obstacles, such as rocks or dirt, can damage the chain or cause kickback. 4. Can be loud and emit exhaust fumes, impacting the environment and neighbors. (b) Cut tree stump in half using a bandsaw Bandsaws are powerful, versatile saws that consist of a continuous metal band with sharp teeth running along its edge. They are commonly used for woodworking, metalworking, and lumbering. A bandsaw can also cut a tree stump in half, although it is less common than using a chainsaw. Advantages: 1. Provides a smoother and more precise cut due to the cleaner edge provided by the bandsaw blade. 2. Safety – reduced risk of kickback compared to a chainsaw. 3. Quieter operation and fewer emissions than a chainsaw. 4. Ideal for smaller tree stumps or stumps that can be moved indoors. Disadvantages: 1. Bandsaws are primarily designed for indoor use and may not be practical for outdoor projects. 2. Can only handle smaller tree stumps due to the limited size of the saw's throat. 3. Relocation of the stump is required, which can be difficult depending on its size. 4. Bandsaws can be expensive and may not be as readily available for rental or purchase as a chainsaw. Conclusion: After considering the factors and comparing the advantages and disadvantages of both options, using a chainsaw appears to be the best method for cutting a tree stump in half. Chainsaws offer quicker cutting times, can handle larger stumps, and are more suitable for outdoor use. They are also more easily accessible for rental or purchase compared to bandsaws. However, safety should be the foremost priority, and it is crucial to wear proper protective gear and follow safety guidelines while using a chainsaw. If a bandsaw is more accessible and the stump can be relocated indoors or is relatively small, the bandsaw may be the preferred method for a cleaner, more precise cut, and quieter operation. Ultimately, the choice may come down to personal preference, tool availability, and project requirements."},{"question":"What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Say your name, and if it’s an unusual name you might add spelling or a rhyme that the person can use to help remember your name. If appropriate, add a detail about the reason you’re at the party. For example, “I’m Pam’s daughter,” if the people at the party are friends of your mother, or “I’m an anthropology major,” if this is a college department party. You can follow up by asking the other person to say his own name, but most of the time people respond by introducing themselves without being asked. People always like to hear nice things said about themselves. To have a great conversation with someone you’ve just met, say something nice about something the person is wearing. At most parties, other guests will have taken care with their appearance and will appreciate the attention. You can also use a compliment to start a conversation by pairing it with a question. For example, you might say, “That’s a really cool scarf. Where did you get it?” Avoid compliments about the person’s appearance, as this might make her uncomfortable. If you don’t know anyone at the party, it’s okay to say so. This is easily done as you introduce yourself. For example, “Hi, I’m Mike. I hope you don’t mind, but I don’t know anyone here and you seemed nice.” If the person is an extrovert, they may be happy to chat with you and introduce you to others in the group. Chances are, others may be in a similar situation. If you’re both newcomers to the group, you can laugh and talk about the challenges of being in this situation. There are certain topics that are likely to be met with awkward silence. If you don’t already know the political orientation of the party-goers, for example, never bring up the topic of politics or you might find yourself unintentionally offending others. Don’t bring up overly personal details, whether of money, sex, illness or intimacy. Save these topics for people you know well. Making judgmental comments isn’t likely to be appreciated. For example, “You’d think she would know better than to wear that color with her complexion,” may not be appreciated. Never ask a woman if she’s pregnant. If she’s gained weight, she may feel embarrassed. Make brief eye contact with other people. A slight smile will help others know that you’re open to conversation. When someone speaks to you, look at them attentively at least 70% of the time. Angle the front of your body towards the person who’s talking, which will help the person know you’re listening. You don’t want to maintain eye contact for too long, as this might seem aggressive or overly flirtatious. Instead, limit the eye contact for 4-5 seconds, before looking away, then looking again. If you don’t know anyone at the party, no one will have heard you tell your favorite funny anecdotes. Think about sharing a funny thing that happened to you. This will make you seem more relatable and friendly. Be careful not to tell a story that may offend others. After all, humor is sometimes different across different groups of people. If you have a good story, it can fill in a conversational lull. Or you can connect your story to someone else’s statement, saying, “That reminds me of something that happened to me one time…” Making small talk is a way of sharing general information with another person as a means to learn what you might have in common. For example, asking about favorite movies is often a good way to find mutual interests. Something as simple as asking about the recent blockbuster can lead into multiple conversational paths. Making small talk might lead to deeper conversations, or it might not. Small talk is often less about the information shared than the good feelings that it provides. You’ll want to stick to non-intimate, non-controversial topics to keep your conversation on a light note. One of the things you’ll have in common with everyone else at the party is that you’re both there. Perhaps you all had to battle traffic to get to the party. Use this as a means to get to know other people, whether through questions, comments, or observations. Be unfailingly complimentary in your comments. This would be the wrong time to complain about the lack of your favorite drink, or how you’ve always hated evening gatherings. You could ask other people how they know the hostess, or if this is their first time among the group also. When you're nervous about not knowing anyone at a party, it might be difficult to concentrate on the conversations that come up. It will help your focus to repeat parts of what another person has said to assure them you've heard what was said. Use nonverbal cues, such as nodding, eye contact, and leaning towards the person, to let the other guest know that you're actively listening to what she has to say. Try to avoid talking over the other person while she’s talking, even if she’s talking about a topic you’re interested in. Ask plenty of open-ended questions about topics the other guest has brought up in order to keep the conversation going. Be sensitive to the emotions that the conversation is bringing up in the person. Generally, party conversations tend to be fun and light. If you find your conversation getting too intense or emotional, it's okay to back off a little. Look for subtle signals in body language to help you gauge whether you should change the topic or find someone new to talk with. Be observant--these are signs you should be able to notice in almost everyone you meet. For example, if someone is making eye contact with you and nodding, they're interested in the conversation. Keep talking to them and doing what you're doing! If they're facing partially away from you or glancing around the room, they're not very engaged.

The power of positive thinking is not just a myth. In fact, positive thoughts are key to dieting properly. Thinking positive thoughts can increase your motivation and energy levels. Negative thoughts, on the other hand, can lead to behaviors such as emotional eating and skipping a workout. Avoid negativity. Try to not get angry at yourself if you slip up and reach for pizza instead of a healthier option. Instead, get back on track the next day. Some days it can be hard to feel comfortable in your own skin. It doesn't help when you're surrounded by images in the media of exceedingly thin celebrities; however, a positive body image is very important to your overall health and wellness. It will increase your confidence and make you more likely to make healthy choices. Focus on the good things. If you really like your arms, tell yourself that when you look in the mirror. Make it a habit to compliment yourself at least once a day. Tape a positive affirmation or quote to the mirror. Seeing encouragement each day will help you gain a more positive body image over time. . Stop beating yourself up. Research shows that if you are kinder to yourself you will be more successful in your fitness goals. When you have a negative thought, try to acknowledge it and then let it go. There's really no point in berating yourself for skipping the gym. It's much more effective to forgive yourself and move on. Tell someone (or everyone) that you're dieting. Making a public declaration can increase your chances of success by holding you accountable to others. It can also engender the support you need from family members and friends who can cheer you on to your goal. Join a support group. This could be formal group such as Weight Watchers or simply a group you organize yourself. Post an ad on Craigslist looking for weight-loss partners or organize or join a Meetup group dedicated to healthier eating. Post inspirational sayings on your fridge. Having mood-boosting words-of-wisdom close at hand can help you handle a difficult diet day. Do things that make you feel good. Get a pedicure, have your hair done, buy a new perfume. Little things that make you feel special and pampered can offset the feeling of deprivation that can sometimes creep in when you're dieting.

Tell her you love her, give her meaningful compliments, spend time with her, plan romantic dates, and always let her know how lucky you are. Don’t ever take her for granted or she may feel like she can’t trust you because you’re losing interest. You don’t have to smother her with hugs and kisses all the time, especially if that’s not your thing. However, you have to find a way to let her know you care every time you’re together. Getting her a meaningful gift just because, instead of because it’s Valentine’s Day or her birthday, can really show her that she matters to you. It’s the thought that counts, not the price tag. Write her love letters to surprise her when she’s having a bad day. If you do this when she least expects it, she’ll be charmed. If you really want to continue a serious relationship with this girl and to make her trust you, then you have to be able to compromise with her. Let her see that you don’t always need to get your way and that you want her to be happy, too. Even if you’re working on winning back her trust, you don’t have to completely give in to her every single time, or she’ll think you don’t have a backbone. Instead, work on having productive conversations that weigh the pros and cons of a decision, and on finding a way that can make both of you happy. She’ll see that she can trust you if it looks like you really take her thoughts and feelings into account instead of just always wanting to get your way. Sometimes, you should just give in and let her see the movie she wants to see or go to the restaurant she’s been craving; this is okay as long as sometimes, she gives in to you as well. You may think that, if you want the girl to trust you, that you have to be Mr. Perfect all the time, and that you can’t possibly ever disappoint her. While you should be loyal and reliable, you shouldn’t put too much pressure on yourself to be absolutely perfect. Make an effort to be the best person you can be, and she’ll feel like she can really trust you because of it. That said, this is no excuse for cheating. Cheating is never acceptable. If you show up late to a date, just apologize and show her how sorry you are. As long as you don’t make a habit of it, she’ll appreciate the fact that you’re willing to admit you made a mistake. You should also be okay with saying, “I don’t know”. You don’t always have to act like you know exactly what to do if you want her to trust you. In fact, she may be even more eager to trust you if she knows you’re honest about your feelings. Another thing you can do to make her trust you is to be open about your feelings. Let her see that you want to confide in her, to be frank with her, and that you’re willing to tear down those walls for her. While you don’t have to reveal every single secret you have to her, you should work on being open and honest when you’re talking to her, whether you’re telling her what you did this past weekend or you’re talking about your concerns about your college major. If you’re open on a regular basis, she’ll see that she’s able to trust you in the long term. If something is troubling you, you should be comfortable enough to open up to her about it, even if it’s a little bit embarrassing or you worry it’ll make her think less of you. If you never tell her about your problems, then she’ll feel like she should never open up to you, either. If you’re having a bad day, you can be honest with her about it, explaining what’s going on. You don’t want her to think you have to hide everything from her. If you hide things from her, then she’ll hide things from you, too. To maintain a meaningful relationship with a girl who trusts you, you have to be open and willing to communicate with her. You can’t brush her off every time she wants to have a talk, and you have to make her feel comfortable with bringing up issues to you. When she talks to you, make sure you’re open to having a conversation and that you really stop and listen. If you have something to say to her, don’t put it off or be passive aggressive instead of hashing it out. Communication is key in any healthy relationship. If you want the girl to trust you in the long run, then you have to make her feel like you’re open to talking about your relationship and sharing your feelings with her. If she feels scared about sharing her feelings with you because she thinks you’ll be angry or dismissive, then she won’t be able to really trust you. If you want to make your relationship with the girl work and really want her to trust you, then you have to be able to make time for her and to show her that she’s a priority. If you spend too much time with your buddies or don’t answer your phone for hours, then she’s likely to not trust you because she won’t know what you’re doing when you’re not around. Make an effort to be there for her, to have a regular hangout routine, and to let her know what you’re doing when you’re not together. Putting in a time commitment is essential to making her trust you. If you know you won’t have your phone on for a few hours, because you’ll be in a long meeting or watching a movie, you can text her before to say hi and let her know what’s up. Of course, you don’t have to be accountable for every minute of your life and that can get exhausting, but letting her generally know how you spend your time can really help her trust you. Making time for her shows that she’s central to your life. This is crucial for making her trust and believe in you.","response":"This article emphasizes the importance of building trust in a meaningful relationship with a girl through open communication, showing care and affection, valuing her thoughts and feelings, being open about one's own emotions, admitting mistakes, being reliable without aiming for perfection, spending time together, and making her a priority in one's life."},{"question":"В этом номере есть диван-кровать для 1 взрослого или 2 детей в возрасте до 12 лет (за соответствующую дополнительную плату).

Believe it or not, it was a real happening. We were on tour a few summers ago, driving through Chicago, when right outside of the city, we got pulled over. A middle-aged policeman came up to the car and was really being troublesome at first. Lecturing us, he said, \\"You were speeding. Where are you going in such a hurry?\\" Our guitarist, Tim, told him that we were on our way to Wisconsin to play a show. His way towards us totally changed. He asked, \\"Oh, so you boys are in a band?\\" We told him that we were. He then asked all the usual band questions about the type of music we played, and how long we had been at it. Suddenly, he stopped and said, \\"Tim, you want to get out of this ticket, don't you?\\" Tim said, \\"Yes.\\" So the officer asked him to step out of the car. The rest of us, inside the car, didn't know what to think as we watched the policeman talk to Tim. Next thing we knew, the policeman was putting Tim in the back of the police car he had parked in front of us. With that, he threw the car into reverse , stopping a few feet behind our car. Now we suddenly felt frightened. We didn't know if we were all going to prison, or if the policeman was going to sell Tim on the black market or something. All of a sudden, the policeman's voice came over his loudspeaker. He said, \\"Ladies and gentlemen, for the first time ever, we have Tim here singing on Route 90.\\" The policeman had told Tim that the only way he was getting out of the ticket was if he sang part of one of our songs over the loudspeaker in the police car.

But now, the party appears to be facing a crisis from within as a leading UKIP candidate warns of \\"all-out civil war\\" looming in the Scottish branch of the party. In this article, we will delve into the underlying issues causing this internal strife, as well as look at the potential consequences and fallout. Tensions Rise UKIP has been grappling with internal conflicts and disagreements for some time now. Yet, the recent remarks by a top candidate have brought these issues to the surface in a manner that could further threaten the already fragile state of the party. The said candidate, whose name has been withheld, claims that ideological rifts and factionalism within the Scottish branch are reaching a boiling point. Sources within the party concur that an escalating power struggle has destabilized the party's leadership and undermined its unity. They attribute this strife to deep-rooted disagreements on party policies, campaign strategies, and, crucially, the handling of Brexit and Scottish independence. Tensions have been exacerbated by personal rivalries among key party members, further complicating efforts to resolve the conflict. Ideological Rifts The competing factions within the party are divided along ideological lines, with hardline Eurosceptics clashing with more moderate voices in UKIP Scotland. One of the key points of contention is their stance on Scottish independence. The party has historically been opposed to the idea, viewing it as antithetical to the goal of national unity within the UK. However, some in the Scottish section advocate for a more pro-independence stance, reflecting a shift in popular opinion among the Scottish population. The rift between these two positions has led to competing visions for the overall direction of the party, with neither side willing to cede ground. The Brexit Factor Brexit has further complicated the party’s internal dynamics, with opinions on how the UK government has handled the process causing divisions. Some party members feel that UKIP should focus more on holding the Conservative government accountable for its handling of Brexit, while others argue that the party should continue to concentrate on its core issues, like immigration and anti-globalization. The leadership's response to Brexit has also been a source of contention. Critics have accused the party's leaders of failing to effectively capitalize on popular dissatisfaction with the UK's withdrawal process, causing UKIP to lose ground to other, more successful pro-Brexit parties, like the Brexit Party. Potential Consequences This \\"all-out civil war\\" could have dire consequences for UKIP, particularly in Scotland. It could lead to a waning of public support, weakening the party's electoral prospects in future elections. Fragmentation within the party might also fuel the rise of other nationalist parties and further weaken the Eurosceptic cause in the UK. As UKIP Scotland grapples with this internal discord, the party may become more susceptible to external challenges, such as the rise of other nationalist and Eurosceptic parties seeking to fill the vacuum. This could ultimately contribute to a more fragmented political landscape in Scotland, making it more difficult for any single party to advance its agenda effectively. Conclusion The warning of an \\"all-out civil war\\" within UKIP Scotland could spell disaster for the party if it allows the internal divisions to fester. To stay afloat and navigate through these turbulent times, UKIP leadership must focus their energies on bridging the ideological rifts and resolving the power struggles affecting the party. Only by putting aside personal differences and working towards a common goal can UKIP hope to restore its unity and become a formidable force in the Scottish political scene once again."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Information: - The Napier Lion was a 12-cylinder 'broad arrow' W12 configuration aircraft engine built by D. Napier & Son from 1917 until the 1930s. A number of advanced features made it the most powerful engine of its day and kept it in production long after other contemporary designs had been superseded. It is particularly well known for its use on a number of racing designs, in aircraft, boats and cars. - A piston is a component of reciprocating engines, reciprocating pumps, gas compressors and pneumatic cylinders, among other similar mechanisms. It is the moving component that is contained by a cylinder and is made gas-tight by piston rings. In an engine, its purpose is to transfer force from expanding gas in the cylinder to the crankshaft via a piston rod and/or connecting rod. In a pump, the function is reversed and force is transferred from the crankshaft to the piston for the purpose of compressing or ejecting the fluid in the cylinder. In some engines, the piston also acts as a valve by covering and uncovering ports in the cylinder wall. The petrol enters inside the cylinder and the piston moves upwards and the spark plug produces spark and the petrol is set on fire and it produces an energy that pushes the piston downwards. - Wolfsburg is the fifth largest city in the German state of Lower Saxony. Located on the River Aller northeast of Braunschweig (\\"Brunswick\\"), it lies about east of Hanover and west of Berlin. - The Fortune Global 500, also known as Global 500, is an annual ranking of the top 500 corporations worldwide as measured by revenue. The list is compiled and published annually by \\"Fortune\\" magazine. - Volkswagen Group, or Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft, shortly VW AG, is a German multinational automotive manufacturing company headquartered in Wolfsburg, Lower Saxony, Germany. It designs, manufactures and distributes passenger and commercial vehicles, motorcycles, engines, and turbomachinery and offers related services including financing, leasing and fleet management. In 2016, it was the largest automaker in the world with sales 10.3 million units. It has maintained the largest market share in Europe for over two decades. It ranked seventh in the 2016 Fortune Global 500 list of the world's largest companies. - An aircraft engine is the component of the propulsion system for an aircraft that generates mechanical power. Aircraft engines are almost always either lightweight piston engines or gas turbines, except for small multicopter UAVs which are almost always electric aircraft. - A commercial vehicle is any type of motor vehicle used for transporting goods or paid passengers. The European Union defines a \\"commercial motor vehicle\\" as any motorised road vehicle, that by its type of construction and equipment is designed for, and capable of transporting, whether for payment or not: (1) more than nine persons, including the driver; (2) goods and \\"standard fuel tanks\\". This means the tanks permanently fixed by the manufacturer to all motor vehicles of the same type as the vehicle in question and whose permanent fitting lets fuel be used directly, both for propulsion and, where appropriate, to power a refrigeration system. Gas tanks fitted to motor vehicles for the direct use of diesel as a fuel are considered standard fuel tanks. - Reciprocating motion, also called reciprocation, is a repetitive up-and-down or back-and-forth linear motion. It is found in a wide range of mechanisms, including reciprocating engines and pumps. The two opposite motions that comprise a single reciprocation cycle are called strokes. - A W12 engine is a twelve cylinder piston internal combustion engine in a W configuration . W12 engines have been manufactured in two distinct configurations . The original W12 configuration used three banks of four cylinders coupled to a common crankshaft , with 60 ° angles between the banks . These were used in several aircraft engine designs from the 1920s , notably the Napier Lion and various French engines . The more recent configuration , used in the Volkswagen Group W12 , uses four rows of three cylinders merged into two ' cylinder banks ' ( two narrow - angle VR6 engine blocks ) , coupled to a common crankshaft . - Volkswagen's VR6 engines, and the later VR5 variants, are a family of internal combustion engines, characterised by a narrow-angle (10.5° or 15°) V engine configuration. Developed by the manufacturer in the late 1980s, evolutions of these engines are still produced by them. - In a reciprocating engine, the crankpins, also known as crank journals are the journals of the big end bearings, at the ends of the connecting rods opposite to the pistons. - Aktiengesellschaft (abbreviated AG ) is a German word for a corporation limited by share ownership (i.e. is owned by its shareholders) and may be traded on a stock market. The term is used in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, South Tyrol and for companies incorporated in the German-speaking region of Belgium. It is also used in Luxembourg, though the French-language equivalent, \\"Société Anonyme\\", is more common. - Volkswagen (- ; shortened to VW) is a German automaker founded on 4 January 1937 by the German Labour Front, headquartered in Wolfsburg, Germany. It is the flagship marque of the Volkswagen Group and is the largest automaker worldwide currently. - In a reciprocating piston engine, the connecting rod or conrod connects the piston to the crank or crankshaft. Together with the crank, they form a simple mechanism that converts reciprocating motion into rotating motion. - Lower Saxony is a German state (\\"Bundesland\\") situated in northwestern Germany and is second in area, with , and fourth in population (8 million) among the sixteen \\"Länder\\" of Germany. In rural areas Northern Low Saxon, a dialect of Low German, and Saterland Frisian, a variety of Frisian, are still spoken, but the number of speakers is declining. - A crankshaftrelated to \\"crank\\"is a mechanical part able to perform a conversion between reciprocating motion and rotational motion. In a reciprocating engine, it translates reciprocating motion of the piston into rotational motion; whereas in a reciprocating compressor, it converts the rotational motion into reciprocating motion. In order to do the conversion between two motions, the crankshaft has \\"crank throws\\" or \\"crankpins\\", additional bearing surfaces whose axis is offset from that of the crank, to which the \\"big ends\\" of the connecting rods from each cylinder attach. - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf. - A reciprocating engine, also often known as a piston engine, is a heat engine (usually, although there are also pneumatic and hydraulic reciprocating engines) that uses one or more reciprocating pistons to convert pressure into a rotating motion. This article describes the common features of all types. The main types are: the internal combustion engine, used extensively in motor vehicles; the steam engine, the mainstay of the Industrial Revolution; and the niche application Stirling engine. Internal Combustion engines are further classified in two ways: either a spark-ignition (SI) engine, where the spark plug initiates the combustion; or a compression-ignition (CI) engine, where the air within the cylinder is compressed, thus heating it, so that the heated air ignites fuel that is injected then or earlier.

Step 1: Treat the two brothers and the person sitting between them as a single unit. We now have 8 units (7 individuals + 1 unit of brothers) that need to be seated around the round table. Step 2: Calculate the circular permutation for 8 units. The formula for circular permutation is (n-1)!. In this case, n = 8, so the circular permutation is (8-1)! = 7!. Step 3: Consider the 2 brothers who can switch places in their unit. Since there are 2 brothers, we have 2! ways they can be arranged. Step 4: Multiply the results of steps 2 and 3 to get the total number of ways these persons can be seated around the round table so that exactly 1 person sits between the brothers: 7! * 2! Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 7!*2!"},{"question":"Article: Ceiling fans are very effective because they move the air around the room and create a draft. They also pull air up when circulating it, and since hot air rises, this will help to cool the room down faster. If the ceiling fan isn’t already on in the room, turn it on immediately. If your ceiling fan has settings of low, medium and high, put the fan on the highest setting. Check the ceiling fan blades to see if they’re rotating counterclockwise (if viewing them from below) – if they aren’t, adjust the settings. Setting the blades to rotate counterclockwise and turning the fan on a higher speed will substantially increase airflow. Table fans, box fans, oscillating fans and mounted fans will all help to contribute to air circulation in the room and create a wind-chill effect. A medium-sized oscillating fan placed on a desktop is very efficient at moving around stagnant hot air quickly. Keep multiple fans set up in the room during the summer so you can turn them on as soon as you walk in. Turn on your bathroom ventilation fan, too. The ventilation fan can help suck hot air out of the room, just as it does when you take a steamy shower. Create a makeshift air conditioner by filling up a shallow pan, tray or mixing bowl with ice and positioning it in front of one of the fans. This will get cold, slightly misty air circulating the room very quickly. You could also use icepacks or, if you’re all out of ice, you can effectively improvise with something similarly cold, like a bag of frozen vegetables. Position the bowl at a slight angle, tilted up, if the fan doesn’t seem to be blowing across the ice effectively. The fan will pull hot air out of the room and transfer it outside. It will also bring in cooler air. Put the fan in the window that gets the most shade – this will provide the coolest intake air. Close any other windows nearby tightly. Open a few windows on the other side of your house. This will create a house-wide draft and cool things down quickly. What is a summary?","response":"Here is a summary of the article: Ceiling and other types of fans are effective in cooling down rooms as they circulate air and create drafts. Set the ceiling fan to rotate counterclockwise and at the highest speed to optimize its cooling effect. Use multiple fans like table fans, box fans, and mounted fans to improve air circulation and create a wind-chill effect. Turn on bathroom ventilation fans to remove hot air from the room.

Northern region where the animals are exposed to a lot of abiotic stress, and the southern region, where the animals experience almost no abiotic stress. Which region had more endangered species? Hint: Biodiversity is determined by many things, and one of them is abiotic stress. If an environment is highly stressful, biodiversity tends to be low. If abiotic stress does not have a strong presence in an area, the biodiversity will be much higher.This idea leads into the understanding of how abiotic stress and endangered species are related. It has been observed through a variety of environments that as the level of abiotic stress increases, the number of species decreases. This means that species are more likely to become population threatened, endangered, and even extinct, when and where abiotic stress is especially harsh. Answer:","response":"Based on the provided information and hint, it can be inferred that the Northern region of Italy, where animals are exposed to a lot of abiotic stress, would have more endangered species. This is because higher levels of abiotic stress lead to lower biodiversity and increased likelihood of species becoming threatened, endangered, or extinct."},{"question":"Alps: The altitude and size of the range affects the climate in Europe; in the mountains precipitation levels vary greatly and climatic conditions consist of distinct zones.

And I was wondering How would Alex feel afterwards?","response":"Alex's feelings after sticking out his tongue at Riley and witnessing Riley's unhappiness would be complex and multi-layered. There are several factors that could contribute to how Alex would perceive the situation and thus, how he would feel about it. 1. Empathy: If Alex is an empathetic individual, he would feel bad for causing distress to Riley with his actions. He may internalize the negativity that stemmed from his behavior and could feel guilt or regret for causing discomfort to Riley. 2. A desire for social harmony: In case Alex values social harmony and maintaining a positive atmosphere, he would feel uncomfortable and unhappy with the outcome of his actions. He may feel responsible for disrupting the peace and consequently, strive to make amends with Riley. 3. Awareness of social norms: Sticking out one's tongue at someone is considered rude behavior in most cultures. If Alex is aware of these social norms, he may feel embarrassed about his misconduct. He could opt to apologize to Riley and strive to prevent future missteps. 4. Personal growth and learning: Depending on Alex's personality, he may take this incident as an opportunity for growth. By reflecting on his actions and their consequences, he could learn about appropriate ways of expressing oneself and the importance of respecting others' feelings. 5. Self-preservation: On the other hand, if Alex is more focused on defending himself rather than understanding Riley's emotions, he might feel wronged or unfairly judged. In this case, he may be less inclined to apologize or reconcile the situation. 6. Influence of peer pressure: If Alex's action was a result of peer pressure or in an effort to fit in with a particular group, he might feel conflicted. While he may regret his actions and feel empathetic towards Riley, the need for social acceptance could potentially sway his behavior in the future. To summarize, Alex's feelings after the incident would likely be a mix of guilt, regret, embarrassment, and a potential desire to make amends. The exact emotions and their intensity would depend on Alex's individual traits, values, and social context. It's essential for individuals like Alex to develop emotional intelligence and empathy towards others to maintain positive relationships and practice healthy communication."},{"question":"Yunan liderleri 8 Aralık Salı günü, AB dışişleri bakanlarının Makedonya'nın üyelik müzakerelerini bağlatma tarihine ilişkin kararı erteleme kararınından duyduğu memnuniyeti dile getirdi.

When the family is large, one of the cars is sold and they will buy a van . A small car can hold four persons and a large car can hold six persons but it is very crowded . A van hold seven persons easily, so a family with three children could ask their grandparents to go on a holiday travel. They could all travel together. Mr Hagen and his wife had a third child last year. This made them sell a second car and bought a van. The sixth and seventh seat are used to put other things, for a family of five must carry many suitcases when they travel. When they arrive at their grandparents' home, the suitcases are brought into the home and the two seats can then carry the grandparents. Americans call vans motor homes. A motor home is always used for holidays. When a family are traveling to the mountains or to the seaside, they can live in their motor home for a few days or weeks. All the members of a big family can enjoy a happier life when they are traveling together. That is why motor homes have become very popular. In America there are many parks for motor homes. Motor homes have become popular because _ A) they can take people to another city when people are free B) they can let families have a happier life when they go out for their holidays C) some people think motor homes are cheap D) big families can put more things in motor homes Answer:","response":"Motor homes have become popular primarily because they allow families to have a happier life when they go out for their holidays (Option B). This is due to a variety of reasons which contribute to the overall appeal of motor homes for American families. Firstly, motor homes provide ample space for both passengers and belongings. As mentioned in the given scenario, a van or motor home can comfortably accommodate up to seven people, making it convenient for bigger families. This also allows extended family members, such as grandparents, to join in on the holiday travels, fostering stronger familial bonds. In addition to comfortably seating the family, motor homes also have plenty of storage space for all the necessary items a family might need for a vacation. This means that families can carry their suitcases, camping gear, sporting equipment, and other vacation essentials without feeling cramped. Furthermore, once they arrive at their destination, luggage can be brought into the home or campsite, making room for additional travelers like grandparents. Motor homes also give families the flexibility and freedom to explore different destinations at their own pace. With various parks for motor homes available across America, families can choose where they want to go and how long they want to stay without worrying about hotel bookings or strict itineraries. This allows for a more relaxed and enjoyable vacation experience tailored to the family's preferences. Another reason for the popularity of motor homes is the cost-saving aspect compared to traditional vacations. While the initial investment in a motor home may be significant, the overall cost of traveling becomes considerably cheaper in the long run. Families can save money on accommodations, and they also have the option to prepare meals in the motor home kitchen, reducing the need to dine out for every meal. Lastly, motor homes present an opportunity for families to spend quality time together and create lasting memories. Traveling and living in close quarters encourages more interaction, conversation, and bonding between family members. This shared experience—even including the process of driving, navigating, and setting up camp—helps to create a sense of togetherness and unity, making the vacation all the more enjoyable and memorable. In summary, motor homes have become popular in America because they offer families the chance to have a happier, more cost-effective, and flexible vacation experience, comfortably accommodating large families and their belongings while promoting bonding and togetherness."},{"question":"Who wrote the Tarzan books????","response":"To find out who wrote the Tarzan books, I will search for information about the Tarzan book series and its author.

Reality Check verdict: The UK could continue to trade with the single market following an EU exit, but we do not know on what terms that trade would take place because that would be subject to years of negotiations. What do we mean by access? And if Britain leaves the European Union, what sort of relationship would it have with the single market? In the early 1990s the common market grew into the single market we know today. At its heart is a free trade area, which is a market where there are no tariffs or taxes on trade between countries. While its members can trade freely with each other, they also impose common tariffs on imports from non-EU countries. Being a member of the single market means a country gets the benefit of any trade deal struck between the EU and other countries - the flip side is that member states cannot set their own tariffs. But the EU's single market is much more than a straightforward free trade area, because it also includes the free movement of goods, people and capital. Crucial to the single market is a common framework of regulations that mean companies in countries such as the UK, France, Italy or Poland have to abide by common standards - whether they trade across the EU or not. That is to stop one business or country having an unfair advantage. Most countries in the single market also have a single currency - the euro - but the UK has not adopted it. Any countries that are not subject to trade sanctions can trade with members of the single market, as Boris Johnson said. But there is a big difference between being able to trade with the single market and being a member of it. For instance, the United States sells into the single market but there are no common safety standards for goods such as fridges or cars and tariffs and quotas may be imposed on its products. The 28 members of the European Union are full members of the European Economic Area - the single market. But there are other members of the club too. The four members of the European Free Trade Association also participate in the single market - but to different degrees. Take Norway for instance. Norway has full access to the single market but is not in the EU. It pays a contribution to the EU Budget to gain that access and has to sign up to all the rules of the club - including its common regulations and standards. People from across the EU are free to live and work in Norway too, but the country is exempt from EU rules on agriculture, fisheries, justice and home affairs. The downside for Norway is that it has no say over how the rules of the Single Market are created. Another example is Switzerland. It has a free trade agreement with the EU and a number of bilateral agreements, which give it access to the Single Market for most of its industries. However, it does not have full access to the single market for its banking sector. In the past week, Leave campaigners have confirmed that they would not want to remain part of the single market by signing deals similar to Norway or Switzerland. They say that because of the strength of the UK economy and the need for EU countries to continue trading freely with the UK, Britain would be in a very strong position to get a deal that exempted the UK from free movement and single market regulations while allowing free access to the single market. Because the UK already complies with single market regulations, a UK-EU free trade deal on goods may be fairly straightforward. But the UK's service sector is about 80% of our economy and the City of London dominates financial services in the EU. In the negotiations that would follow a British exit from the EU everything would depend on the deal the remaining EU members wanted to cut. And the Remain campaign insists the EU would demand the UK accepts free movement and common regulations in any deal that provides single market access. We do not know what the outcome of such negotiations would be - it is one of the biggest question marks hanging over this referendum.

McDonald's placed this billboard near Starbucks' corporate headquarters in Seattle, Washington. Residents in Seattle, Washington, the birthplace of Starbucks, can now see approximately 140 McDonald's billboards emblazoned with \\"large is the new grande\\" or \\"four bucks is dumb.\\" In a statement released Thursday, McDonald's called it \\"a light-hearted, fun approach to our brand,\\" aimed at promoting the company's McCafe coffee products. However, Starbucks is not finding the ad campaign funny. \\"Comparative campaigns are all well and good but only when they're credible and authentic. If the claim is not supportable or the tone is off, you risk losing credibility,\\" Deb Trevino, director of global communications for Starbucks, told CNN. A 12-ounce cup of coffee at Starbucks in Seattle costs just 1.40, only a penny more than the average price for a same size cup at McDonald's. Credibility is something that Starbucks claims it is not short on. A portion of coffee sales currently goes towards health care for Starbucks' baristas, while another goes towards helping AIDS victims in Africa, according to the company. \\"We will not enter into a tit-for-tat,\\" Trevino said. \\"Our customers are interested in more than just the coffee, they come for the experience.\\" For now, McDonald's said it does not plan to take its \\"four bucks is dumb\\" campaign nationwide.

The NSA later confirmed the existence of the surveillance scheme as well as a separate phone records programme which it said had helped it thwart terrorist plots in the US and more than 20 other countries. US spy chief James Clapper has also stated that the NSA's communications-collection efforts were designed to help acquire information about \\"non-US persons located outside the United States\\" and the agency could not \\"intentionally target any US citizen, any other US person, or anyone located within the United States\\". However, privacy activists and some politicians have raised concerns that the agency's actions still went beyond what was intended under powers granted by the Patriot Act following the 11 September 2001 terror attacks. Following the revelations, several of the tech firms involved said they had asked the US government to allow them to disclose information which would help them address concern about the scale of information that had been handed over. On Friday, Facebook and Microsoft announced they had been given permission to reveal the number of data requests from US officials in aggregate, and Apple has now followed with its own statement. \\"We first heard of the government's 'Prism' program when news organisations asked us about it on June 6,\\" it said. \\"We do not provide any government agency with direct access to our servers, and any government agency requesting customer content must get a court order.\\" The firm added that between 1 December 2012 and 31 May 2013 it received between 4,000 and 5,000 requests from US law enforcement for customer data, involving between 9,000 and 10,000 accounts or devices. It did not say with how many it had complied. It said the \\"common form of request\\" came from police who were investigating crimes such as robberies, trying to find missing children and patients with Alzheimer's disease, or hoping to prevent suicides. It noted that it would not have been able to decode encrypted conversations which took place over its iMessage or Facetime chat software on behalf of the authorities, nor did it store \\"identifiable\\" data related to Apple Map searches or requests made to its voice-controlled Siri service. \\"Regardless of the circumstances, our legal team conducts an evaluation of each request and, only if appropriate, we retrieve and deliver the narrowest possible set of information to the authorities,\\" it added. Apple's disclosure covers a different period from that disclosed by Facebook and Microsoft, which both published data for the last six months of 2012. Microsoft said it received between 6,000 and 7,000 requests from US government agencies affecting between 31,000 and 32,000 customer accounts. Facebook said it received between 9,000 and 10,000 requests covering between 18,000 and 19,000 accounts. Google has said that over the course of 2012 it received between zero and 999 National Security Letters - foreign intelligence-related requests from the FBI involving US citizens which are distinct from the agency's investigations into other criminal, civil or administrative matters. However, these do not include other types of national security requests including those involving Fisa. Google said that on 11 June it wrote to the Department of Justice and FBI asking to be allowed to provide a break-out number for all types of national security requests and details about their scope.

While \\"potkulauta\\" specifically refers to a scooter, the word itself can be broken down into two parts for a better understanding of its meaning: 1. \\"Potku\\": This part of the word refers to the action of \\"kicking.\\" When riding a scooter, the rider usually propels themselves forward by pushing off the ground with one foot to create a kicking motion. 2. \\"Lauta\\": This portion of the word signifies \\"board\\" or \\"plank.\\" This is a reference to the flat surface on which the rider stands while operating the scooter. Together, they create the term \\"potkulauta.\\" It is important to keep in mind that, like many other languages, Finnish has numerous dialects and regional variations that might result in slight differences in pronunciation or usage. However, potkulauta is the standard and accepted term for a scooter in Finnish. The language is known for its agglutinative structure, meaning that words are often formed by attaching multiple morphemes (smaller units of meaning) together.

Giovanni Battista Barbirolli was born in Southampton Row, Holborn, London, the second child and eldest son of an Italian father and a French mother. He was a British national from birth, and as Southampton Row is within the sound of Bow Bells, Barbirolli always regarded himself as a Cockney. His father, Lorenzo Barbirolli (1864–1929), was a Venetian violinist who had settled in London with his wife, Louise Marie, née Ribeyrol (1870–1962). Lorenzo and his father had played in the orchestra at La Scala, Milan, where they had taken part in the première of Otello in 1887. In London they played in West End theatre orchestras, principally that of the Empire, Leicester Square. The young Barbirolli began to play the violin when he was four, but soon changed to the cello. He later said that this was at the instigation of his grandfather who, exasperated at the child's habit of wandering around while practising the violin, bought him a small cello to stop him from \\"getting in everybody's way\\". His education at St. Clement Danes Grammar School overlapped, from 1910, with a scholarship at Trinity College of Music. As a Trinity student, he made his concert debut in a cello concerto in the Queen's Hall in 1911. The following year he won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music, which he attended from 1912 to 1916, studying harmony, counterpoint and theory under Dr. J. B. McEwen and the cello with Herbert Walenn. In 1914 he was joint winner of the academy's Charles Rube Prize for ensemble playing, and in 1916 The Musical Times singled him out as \\"that excellent young 'cello player, Mr Giovanni Barbirolli.\\" The principal of the Academy, Sir Alexander Mackenzie, had forbidden students to play the chamber music of Ravel, which he regarded as \\"a pernicious influence\\". Barbirolli was keenly interested in modern music, and he and three colleagues secretly rehearsed Ravel's String Quartet in the privacy of a men's lavatory in the Academy.From 1916 to 1918 Barbirolli was a freelance cellist in London. He recalled, \\"My first... Answer:","response":"The last name of the person whose father settled in London with his wife is Barbirolli.

A newspaper billboard circa 1916 celebrates the fate of two Zeppelins during WWI. More billboards from WWI. Until the middle of 1916, Britain could find no defence against Zeppelin bombers - they flew too high. But in mid-1916 the balance shifted, when a member of the Brock firework family invented explosive tracer bullets. This is the moment the 804ft-long Hindenburg exploded over the Lakehurst Naval Air Station in Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937. During World War I, the Zeppelin had been. responsible for the first Blitz over England. And in 1937, the threat of. World War II was impending. The Zeppelin was a wholly German. product. Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin, born in 1838, had been inspired. to develop his airship by the sight of tethered balloons being used as. observation posts during the American Civil War. After countless setbacks, he developed. his first successful airship in 1900 - three years before Wilbur and. Orville Wright achieved the world's first powered flight. It was a tremendous feat which made. the count a national icon. The German Kaiser hailed him as the greatest. German of the 20th century. Over the next few years he improved on its. design. The individual hydrogen gas cells. inside the airship's canvas envelope were better proofed against. igniting the hydrogen with static electricity. Aluminium alloy produced the strength. of steel at one-third of the weight, and more powerful engines gave the. airships an ever-increasing range. And so Zeppelins became the first aerial passenger transport... later adapted for war. A bronze medallion created by Tiffany. & Co to commemorate an expedition to the North Pole in 1926 in an. airship will also be sold and is expected to reach £700. It reads: ‘For the greatest discovery trip ever made and apparently for the greatest nonstop flight ever made.’ Mr Kirch, from Jersey, is believed to own the world’s biggest personal collection of airship memorabilia which he has collected over 40 years. Property tycoon Mr Kirch has only given one interview about his collection and has declined to give any more information. It is believed he originally intended to make a museum to show the public his collection, which started in 1968, before deciding to sell it at auction. Mr Kirch is well known for donating much of his fortune to charity - gifting all residents over the age of 70 in Jersey £100 gift vouchers every year for the last five years. He has said previously all the money from the sale will be donated to charity. Head auctioneer Glenn Butler said: ‘Mr Kirch is a very wealthy man so he would ask people all over to keep an eye out for military memorabilia which is how he has this amazing collection. ‘We specialise in wartime collections so although the sale was offered to Christie's and Bonhams, we were able to negotiate a good deal because of our knowledge and contacts. ‘In the last auction, we had people bidding online from New Zealand, Australia, Germany - all over the world really. ‘It has been fascinating cataloguing the collection, I have learned so much about zeppelins. ‘We are very lucky to have it, although we have had to hire extra storage space.’ Post World War One, the Zeppelin was used by the upper-classes for travel with a ticket in 1936 costing 3,000 - equivalent to £32,000 today. The Zeppelin was created by a German, Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin born in 1838. He has seen tethered balloons being used as an observation post during the American Civil War.

Zeppelins attack Britain in WWI. By CHRISTOPHER HUDSON. By 1912, the airship was considered one of Germany's deadliest weapons. The. British government was at a loss as to how to combat them. Shells. attached to grappling hooks were envisaged, and aerial minefields of. mines dangling from balloons on a cable, of which Winston Churchill. remarked: 'Since Damocles there has been no such experiment.' It. was actually a biplane, dropping a bomb on Tommy Terson's cabbage patch. in Dover, on Christmas Eve 1914, which represented the first attack on. mainland Britain for centuries. But Zeppelins were not far behind. Once. the kaiser had agreed to bombing raids on most of London except his. cousin's royal palaces, the count's airships were over here with a. vengeance, almost silently dropping death from the skies. The. commander of the German Navy Zeppelin Fleet believed that Britain. 'could be overcome by means of airships through increasingly extensive. destruction of cities, factory complexes, dockyards...' and a large. number of his superiors believed him. Many. Zeppelins carried incendiary bombs in the hope that they could start a. general conflagration. This largely failed, because half of them failed. to ignite and most of those that did could be easily doused. But. one raid on the East End gutted several blocks of business premises,. killing 22 people and causing half a million pounds worth of property. damage. A Zeppelin in flames over London during WWI. Some of the photos in Mr Kirch's collection show commercial and military. (right) types of airship that highlight the size of the industry that. came to an end before WWII. Until the middle of 1916, Britain. could find no defence against Zeppelin bombers - they flew too high, and. any Royal Flying Corps planes which did chase them were shot down by. the airships' banks of machine guns. But. in mid-1916 the balance shifted, when a member of the Brock firework. family invented explosive tracer bullets. The Germans fought back by. inventing Zeppelins which could fly at 20,000ft. These. super-craft encountered many problems, though - if they weren't. destroyed by jet-stream winds, their crews were too frozen and. de-oxygenated to man the controls. By. the end of 1916, any hopes of using Zeppelins to turn London into a sea. of flame had dwindled. Not until the very end of World War I did the. Germans begin building vast new Zeppelins, capable of carrying a 4,000kg. bomb-load. By this time,. America had entered the war - and the plan was to drop their deadly. load over New York, thus paralysing the will of the Americans. Thankfully, after thinking about the. sure-to-be awful consequences for 24 hours, the German Chief of Naval. Operations responded with the one word: Nein! The. Zeppelin did not lose favour with their creators after World War I. In. 1919 one accomplished the first transatlantic crossing by flying from. Edinburgh to New York against prevailing winds in 108 hours. Returning. six days later, in 75 hours, it achieved the first double crossing, and. paved the way for international airship travel. The. huge Graf Zeppelin, called after its inventor, was built in 1928.

This collection had nearly 600 items, such as pictures, silverware, and newspaper billboards from the First World War. The items were sold at Wallis and Wallis auctioneers in Lewes, East Sussex in four separate auctions, and the entire collection was expected to be worth about £1 million. Some other interesting items in the collection were passenger lists, a burned ticket receipt from the Hindenburg, bottles of beer, and cocktail shakers shaped like airships from onboard."},{"question":"Question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: Which swimming birds eat fish? Context: Birds that employ many strategies to obtain food or feed on a variety of food items are called generalists, while others that concentrate time and effort on specific food items or have a single strategy to obtain food are considered specialists. Birds' feeding strategies vary by species. Many birds glean for insects, invertebrates, fruit, or seeds. Some hunt insects by suddenly attacking from a branch. Those species that seek pest insects are considered beneficial 'biological control agents' and their presence encouraged in biological pest control programs. Nectar feeders such as hummingbirds, sunbirds, lories, and lorikeets amongst others have specially adapted brushy tongues and in many cases bills designed to fit co-adapted flowers. Kiwis and shorebirds with long bills probe for invertebrates; shorebirds' varied bill lengths and feeding methods result in the separation of ecological niches. Loons, diving ducks, penguins and auks pursue their prey underwater, using their wings or feet for propulsion, while aerial predators such as sulids, kingfishers and terns plunge dive after their prey. Flamingos, three species of prion, and some ducks are filter feeders. Geese and dabbling ducks are primarily grazers. Answer:","response":"Loons, diving ducks, penguins, and auks are swimming birds that eat fish."},{"question":"Premise: We have reclaimed as revolutionary heroes George Orwell and Lionel Trilling. Hypothesis: George Orwell and Lionel Trilling are not to us revolutionary heroes. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","response":"Okay kiddo, let's think about it like this. The premise, or the first idea, is saying that people see George Orwell and Lionel Trilling as big-time heroes who changed things. The hypothesis, or the second idea, is saying that they are NOT seen as heroes who changed things by some people. Now, the question is whether the second idea (hypothesis) comes from the first idea (premise). The answer is no because the first idea says they are heroes, and the second idea says they are not heroes. So the hypothesis is not connected or coming from the premise."},{"question":"I lay here on this bed like a sacrificial offering to the Woman on the Moon .

But before my dreams get too intricate , loneliness and the promise of morning swoop down and snatch her from me like a highway robber . When I am adequately wound up with need , she comes to the foot of my bed and plays me like a tuned up mandolin . Based on the preceding passage, choose your answer for question what is the reason morning swoops down and snatches her ? Select from the following. (a). I die in my sleep; (b). The woman spends all day with me .; (c). I wake up and the dream ends .; (d). None of the above choices .; The answer is:","response":"(c). I wake up and the dream ends . Justification: The provided passage uses metaphorical language to depict a dream or fantasy the narrator has about the \\"Woman on the Moon.\\" The break of dawn or the arrival of morning is typically associated with the end of dreams because that's the time people generally wake up. Hence, the statement \\"morning swoops down and snatches her\\" suggests that the dream or fantasy ends when the narrator wakes with the morning. Thus, option (c) \\"I wake up and the dream ends\\" is the most accurate."},{"question":"After testifying in the Till case , Reed moved to Chicago and changed his name to Willie Louis in Willie Reed .

They are both telling us that Reed, after the Till case, moved to Chicago and changed his name to Willie Louis. Answer (a) is wrong because it says that the sentences are not paraphrases of each other, which isn't true.

So, imagine you go to a restaurant where they have yummy Indian dishes like curry and naan.

So, it's not very expensive and you can have a nice meal there without your piggy bank getting empty. Next, the \\"customer rating low\\" part means that some people who went to this place didn't like it very much. Just like how we sometimes don't like a toy or a snack.

Lastly, \\"near Rainbow Vegetarian Café\\" means that this Strada place is close to another eating place called the Rainbow Vegetarian Café.

The various schools vary on how many of these six are valid paths of knowledge. For example, the Cārvāka nāstika philosophy holds that only one (perception) is an epistemically reliable means of knowledge, the Samkhya school holds three are (perception, inference and testimony), while the Mīmāṃsā and Advaita schools hold all six are epistemically useful and reliable means to knowledge. Which pramanas is understanding of experts?","response":"The pramana that corresponds to the understanding of experts is called śabda (word, testimony of past or present reliable experts). Śabda pramana refers to the knowledge derived from the words or testimonies of credible experts, scholars, or authoritative texts. Within the context of Hindu philosophy, these sources of knowledge include the Vedas, Upanishads, and statements made by trusted, knowledgeable individuals. śabda pramana is valued by several schools of Hindu philosophy, such as Mīmāṃsā and Advaita, that regard all six pramanas as epistemically useful and reliable means of knowledge. The Mīmāṃsā school, in particular, places a significant emphasis on the importance of śabda pramana, as it relies heavily on the authority of the Vedas for its understanding of dharma (righteous duty). The Advaita school also values śabda pramana, especially when it comes to scriptural knowledge, which it believes is essential for attaining the ultimate truth or Brahman. However, it's important to note that not all Hindu schools of thought universally accept śabda pramana as a valid means of knowledge. For example, the Cārvāka nāstika philosophy maintains that only perception (pratyakṣa) is an epistemically reliable means of knowledge. Other schools like Samkhya may acknowledge the importance of śabda pramana but place more emphasis on other pramanas, such as perception and inference (anumāṇa). In summary, the pramana associated with the understanding of experts is śabda pramana, which relies on the testimony of past or present reliable experts. The acceptance and importance of śabda pramana as a valid means of knowledge vary across different schools of Hindu philosophy, with some schools like Mīmāṃsā and Advaita holding it to be a valuable and reliable source of knowledge, while others may place lesser emphasis on it or even reject it outright."},{"question":"Generate a short summary this sentence: in a historic primary election , islanders voted sunday to determine which gubernatorial candidate from puerto rico 's pro-statehood party will represent them in elections next year .

It suggests that there are many aspects of human behavior that remain unknown or puzzling, and this enigmatic quality evokes a sense of wonder. Curiosity is represented by the word \\"glimpse,\\" which denotes a momentary or partial view, encouraging the reader to explore these mysteries further. The audience may feel a natural inclination to dig deeper into the topic since understanding the human behavior is a fundamental aspect of our nature, both as individuals and as a collective society. This curiosity-driven sentiment might spark conversations and initiate research and discussion about the complexities and subtleties of human behavior. Fascination comes from recognizing the intricate and perplexing nature of human behavior. The word \\"mysteries\\" conveys a sense of excitement and allure, prompting readers to think about the hidden meanings and convoluted patterns that are ingrained in everyday actions and interactions. The fascination is also related to the sheer variety and unpredictability of human behavior, which makes it a challenge to fully comprehend. As most human behavior is a product of multifaceted factors, like biology, environment, culture, and individual experiences, this recognition feeds into the overall sentiment. Intrigue is another emotion associated with this sentence, as it conjures up a sense of confounding riddles waiting to be unraveled. The intrigue lies in the often paradoxical nature of human behavior and how individuals might act or respond under certain conditions. People may wish to understand the drivers behind others' behavior, thereby cultivating empathy and forming stronger connections, which adds to the intrigue. Finally, the sentiment is grounded in a sense of humility, as the sentence acknowledges that human behavior is not entirely understood or easily explained. This humbleness expresses a disposition that leans towards continuous learning and exploration, emphasizing that even with extensive research and observation, there may always be new mysteries to uncover, and that there is value in the open-minded pursuit of understanding the complex nature of human behavior. In summary, the sentiment of the provided sentence could be perceived as a blend of curiosity, fascination, intrigue, and humility, inviting readers to delve into the enigmatic world of human behavior and acknowledge its ever-evolving complexities."},{"question":"Write a summary based on this article: From 'American Gigolo' through 'Pretty Woman,' the actor was at the top of studio A-lists, but speaking up passionately in defense of Tibet has taken him down the indie road that has led to two new films and the best reviews of his career. When Richard Gere walked the red carpet at the Academy Awards in 1993, there was no way he could have known that the night would have repercussions for his career more than 20 years later. Invited to present the award for best art direction, he skipped the scripted patter to protest China's occupation of Tibet and its \\"horrendous, horrendous human rights situation.\\" The late Gil Cates, the show's producer, was furious, calling the political speeches at that year's awards show —Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins also went off script to speak on behalf of Haitian refugees — \\"distasteful and dishonest\\" and vowing to ban all three from future Oscars broadcasts. Undaunted, Gere, a long-standing friend of Tibet's exiled leader, the Dalai Lama, didn't stop speaking out. In 2008, he called for a boycott of the Beijing Olympics, and he continues to support the cause through his two foundations, the Washington-based International Campaign for Tibet and The Gere Foundation in New York. Not surprisingly, he has been banned for life from China. But now that Hollywood is cozying up ever closer to the authoritarian superpower, and studios are careful not to offend the government that oversees what has become the world's second-biggest box-office market, the star also is paying a price. \\"There are definitely movies that I can't be in because the Chinese will say, 'Not with him,' \\" he acknowledges matter-of-factly. \\"I recently had an episode where someone said they could not finance a film with me because it would upset the Chinese.\\" Despite the fact that Gere, now 67, was once one of the most sought-after leading men of his generation, he hasn't made a full-fledged studio movie in nearly a decade — not since 2008's Warner Bros./Village Roadshow romance Nights in Rodanthe. The film industry might pride itself on promoting free speech (this year's awards season offered a number of anti-Trump speeches that far eclipsed Gere's '93 criticism of the Chinese), but China remains Hollywood's third rail. At a time when there's no shortage of actors in their 60s — including Tom Hanks, Denzel Washington, Liam Neeson, Sylvester Stallone and even Mel Gibson — being courted for studio films, Gere must stick to indie fare. He currently has two small features coming out within the span of three weeks: He plays the titular antihero in Sony Pictures Classics' Norman (which opened April 14) and a congressman bracing for scandal in The Orchard's The Dinner (May 5). But with Gere earning some of the best reviews of his career in recent years, particularly with Norman (The New York Times gushed that he \\"has never been better,\\" while Rolling Stone says he \\"tones down his star charisma and hits a new career peak as a Jewish fixer on the ropes\\"), it's clear that the actor's exclusion is to Hollywood's detriment. Wearing a blue linen open-collared shirt, simple black pants and a Tibetan prayer bead bracelet on his left wrist, Gere settles into a plush chair at the Mark Restaurant in New York. He typically orders green tea. But feeling the need for extra caffeine on this blustery late-March afternoon, he opts for Earl Grey. Interviews are, for him, a necessary annoyance of the job (\\"I will be intimate up to a certain point. I know what that is at this point that I'm comfortable with,\\" he says). He still exhibits much of the same confidence and mystique on display during his breakout star turn in 1980's American Gigolo. Splitting his time between a Gramercy Park apartment and a home in Bedford, N.Y., he delights in the season, saying, \\"This is the best part of New York. Spring. It warms up. Flowers open up. [Women] wear little skirts, and it gets really fun. New York in the spring is complete madness.\\" But as the conversation turns to his career, he tells a chilling story about being ousted from an independently financed, non-studio film that never even aimed for a Chinese release. \\"There was something I was going to do with a Chinese director, and two weeks before we were going to shoot, he called saying, 'Sorry, I can't do it,'\\" confides Gere. \\"We had a secret phone call on a protected line. If I had worked with this director, he, his family would never have been allowed to leave the country ever again, and he would never work.\\" By comparison, that old Academy ban seemed trivial. \\"I didn't have to put on a tuxedo again. I was fine with that,\\" he shrugs. But Sarandon, who has starred opposite Gere in Arbitrage and Shall We Dance and was once his neighbor in New York, says there is a double standard at play. \\"It doesn't matter if you're outspoken about Trump, because Hollywood hates Trump,\\" she says. \\"But it was brave of Richard to say what he said. He was drawing attention to the things that everyone has agreed not to pay attention to. That's the sin.\\" The full implications didn't become clear until a few years later when Gere starred in Jon Avnet's 1997 thriller Red Corner as an American businessman in China wrongfully accused of murder. \\"Everyone was happy with the film,\\" Gere relates. \\"I get calls from the heads of the studio. Went on Oprah. Then, out of nowhere, I get calls saying, 'We don't want you doing press.' MGM wanted to make an overall deal with the Chinese. China told them, 'If you release this film, we're not buying it.' And so, they dumped it.\\" But so what if he's not being given parts in studio blockbusters? \\"I'm not interested in playing the wizened Jedi in your tentpole,\\" he says. \\"I was successful enough in the last three decades that I can afford to do these [smaller films] now.\\" Indeed, Gere is plenty rich enough to eschew Hollywood. In its coverage of the protracted divorce proceedings between Gere and his second wife, actress Carey Lowell, with whom he shares a teenage son, the New York Post estimated his worth at 250 million. These days, Gere, reported to be dating 34-year-old Spanish socialite and activist Alejandra Silva, has found his niche working on such indie films as Nicholas Jarecki's 2012 financial thriller Arbitrage, the most successful day-and-date VOD release ever. He also has found a regular collaborator in writer-director Oren Moverman, who produced Norman and wrote and directed The Dinner. \\"I just fell in love with the way he thinks and feels, the way he relates to the world,\\" says Moverman. \\"We've hit a stride.\\" Norman, in which Gere plays a New York political hustler caught in the middle of an Israeli bribery scandal involving the prime minister, was almost entirely financed with Israeli money, including government funds (Moverman and Norman director Joseph Cedar are both Israeli). The financing is noteworthy considering the actor has been critical of Israel's government while doing humanitarian work in the Middle East. Though it won't endanger his career, Gere holds strong views on the Israeli settlements. \\"Clearly it's illegal by international law. And most likely even by Israeli law,\\" he says. \\"Now if you actually say that out loud in Israel, you're a traitor.\\" But Gere isn't one to filter himself, even if that means he's working outside of the mainstream glare. Nevertheless, his indie success is an unexpected twist of fate for the actor, whose career skyrocketed after Gigolo, with a two-decade run at the top of studios' wish lists and memorable turns in An Officer and a Gentleman, Pretty Woman, Primal Fear and Runaway Bride. Onscreen, he may have been a smoldering sex symbol, but offscreen, he set that aside, searching for something deeper. Diane Lane, who starred with him in three films, from The Cotton Club to Rodanthe, recalls \\"sitting and meditating with him when I was a really young woman, and it was very sweet. It peeled away all the layers of race, gender, age, socioeconomic whatever. He's a very straightforward soul.\\" When prodded about some of his more iconic roles, Gere doesn't linger on past films (\\"Honey, I've been asked these questions since I started doing interviews\\"). On Pretty Woman, he offers: \\"Gary Marshall was a Svengali. The cast was just right. Julia [Roberts] was magic. it just happened. It was one of those alchemical things that cannot be repeated or manufactured.\\" As for why movies are far less sexy than they used to be, he chalks it up to the '80s being a more permissive era. \\"I was doing things in Gigolo and even Officer and a Gentlemen, and it was pretty sexy,\\" he says. \\"I suppose all of us were highly influenced by European film. It was much freer. And we felt like, we're out there in the wilds in Hollywood.\\" Gere, who has never been nominated for an Oscar — not even for 2002's Chicago, for which he nabbed a Golden Globe — does admit that that one particular snub did bother him. \\"We were in a hotel in Paris,\\" he remembers. \\"Everyone had a radio on for the nominations. You could hear the whoas. Like this one got nominated. 'Whoa!' The next one. 'Yay!' Then silence. There certainly was a moment there of 'Oh.'\\" Perhaps Norman will offer the actor a shot at redemption. Sony Pictures Classics plans to run an awards-season campaign for Gere, who only recently became an Academy member. In the meantime, he may be persona non grata at the Hollywood majors thanks to China, but he's philosophical about it: \\"The studios are interested in the possibility of making huge profits. But I'm still making the same films that I was making when I started. Small, interesting, character‑driven and narrative‑driven stories. It hasn't impacted my life at all.\\" A version of this story first appeared in the April 13 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.

But Sarandon, who has starred opposite Gere in Arbitrage and Shall We Dance and was once his neighbor in New York, says there is a double standard at play. \\"It doesn't matter if you're outspoken about Trump, because Hollywood hates Trump,\\" she says. \\"But it was brave of Richard to say what he said. He was drawing attention to the things that everyone has agreed not to pay attention to. That's the sin.\\" The full implications didn't become clear until a few years later when Gere starred in Jon Avnet's 1997 thriller Red Corner as an American businessman in China wrongfully accused of murder. \\"Everyone was happy with the film,\\" Gere relates. \\"I get calls from the heads of the studio. Went on Oprah. Then, out of nowhere, I get calls saying, 'We don't want you doing press.' MGM wanted to make an overall deal with the Chinese. China told them, 'If you release this film, we're not buying it.' And so, they dumped it.\\" But so what if he's not being given parts in studio blockbusters? \\"I'm not interested in playing the wizened Jedi in your tentpole,\\" he says. \\"I was successful enough in the last three decades that I can afford to do these [smaller films] now.\\" Indeed, Gere is plenty rich enough to eschew Hollywood. In its coverage of the protracted divorce proceedings between Gere and his second wife, actress Carey Lowell, with whom he shares a teenage son, the New York Post estimated his worth at 250 million. These days, Gere, reported to be dating 34-year-old Spanish socialite and activist Alejandra Silva, has found his niche working on such indie films as Nicholas Jarecki's 2012 financial thriller Arbitrage, the most successful day-and-date VOD release ever. He also has found a regular collaborator in writer-director Oren Moverman, who produced Norman and wrote and directed The Dinner. \\"I just fell in love with the way he thinks and feels, the way he relates to the world,\\" says Moverman. \\"We've hit a stride.\\" Norman, in which Gere plays a New York political hustler caught in the middle of an Israeli bribery scandal involving the prime minister, was almost entirely financed with Israeli money, including government funds (Moverman and Norman director Joseph Cedar are both Israeli). The financing is noteworthy considering the actor has been critical of Israel's government while doing humanitarian work in the Middle East. Though it won't endanger his career, Gere holds strong views on the Israeli settlements. \\"Clearly it's illegal by international law. And most likely even by Israeli law,\\" he says. \\"Now if you actually say that out loud in Israel, you're a traitor.\\" But Gere isn't one to filter himself, even if that means he's working outside of the mainstream glare. Nevertheless, his indie success is an unexpected twist of fate for the actor, whose career skyrocketed after Gigolo, with a two-decade run at the top of studios' wish lists and memorable turns in An Officer and a Gentleman, Pretty Woman, Primal Fear and Runaway Bride. Onscreen, he may have been a smoldering sex symbol, but offscreen, he set that aside, searching for something deeper. Diane Lane, who starred with him in three films, from The Cotton Club to Rodanthe, recalls \\"sitting and meditating with him when I was a really young woman, and it was very sweet. It peeled away all the layers of race, gender, age, socioeconomic whatever. He's a very straightforward soul.\\" When prodded about some of his more iconic roles, Gere doesn't linger on past films (\\"Honey, I've been asked these questions since I started doing interviews\\"). On Pretty Woman, he offers: \\"Gary Marshall was a Svengali. The cast was just right. Julia [Roberts] was magic. it just happened. It was one of those alchemical things that cannot be repeated or manufactured.\\" As for why movies are far less sexy than they used to be, he chalks it up to the '80s being a more permissive era. \\"I was doing things in Gigolo and even Officer and a Gentlemen, and it was pretty sexy,\\" he says. \\"I suppose all of us were highly influenced by European film. It was much freer. And we felt like, we're out there in the wilds in Hollywood.\\" Gere, who has never been nominated for an Oscar — not even for 2002's Chicago, for which he nabbed a Golden Globe — does admit that that one particular snub did bother him. \\"We were in a hotel in Paris,\\" he remembers. \\"Everyone had a radio on for the nominations. You could hear the whoas. Like this one got nominated. 'Whoa!' The next one. 'Yay!' Then silence. There certainly was a moment there of 'Oh.'\\" Perhaps Norman will offer the actor a shot at redemption. Sony Pictures Classics plans to run an awards-season campaign for Gere, who only recently became an Academy member. In the meantime, he may be persona non grata at the Hollywood majors thanks to China, but he's philosophical about it: \\"The studios are interested in the possibility of making huge profits. But I'm still making the same films that I was making when I started. Small, interesting, character‑driven and narrative‑driven stories. It hasn't impacted my life at all.\\" A version of this story first appeared in the April 13 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.

But then something happened: Gere gradually stopped starring in mainstream studio movies. Although this plight is routine for actresses, Gere maintains that mainstream Hollywood’s motive to dump him had nothing to do with age—and everything to do with another factor entirely. That factor: China, the country that finances much of Hollywood these days. Not so coincidentally, it’s also the country that Gere—a practicing Tibetan Buddhist and longtime friend of the religion’s exiled leader, the Dalai Lama—infamously disparaged during the 1993 Oscars when he went off-script while presenting the art-direction category. “There are definitely movies that I can’t be in because the Chinese will say, ‘Not with him,’” Gere tells The Hollywood Reporter in a new interview. “I recently had an episode where someone said they could not finance a film with me because it would upset the Chinese.” In the years since drawing Oscar audience attention to China’s “horrendous, horrendous human rights situation,” Gere has remained dogged in his cause—calling a boycott of the 2008 Olympics, pressuring China to make Tibet independent, and speaking out against the country in myriad interviews. While the actor has managed to maintain a tidy career acting in independent films—proof arriving this April and May with Norman and The Dinner—Gere reveals that even smaller-budget productions have balked at bringing him on board. “There was something I was going do with a Chinese director, and two weeks before we were going to shoot, he called saying, ‘Sorry, I can’t do it,’” explains Gere. “We had a secret phone call on a protected line. If I had worked with this director, he, his family would never have been allowed to leave the country ever again, and he would never work.” But don’t get it twisted—Gere isn’t regretting the fact that he isn’t scoring parts in franchise films and blow-’em-up blockbusters. For starters: ever since the career tidal shift, Gere hasn’t had to “put on a tuxedo again” for any contractually obligated red-carpet appearance, which the actor is just “fine” with. Secondly, Gere says, in a delicious Hollywood burn: “I’m not interested in playing the wizened Jedi in your tentpole.” Finally and most important, though, Gere has something that Hollywood doesn’t these days: money and, in conjunction, freedom. “I was successful enough in the last three decades that I can afford to do these [smaller films] now,” the Pretty Woman actor says, essentially telling China and its financed Hollywood pictures, “The feeling is mutual.” Do you have what it takes? Test your knowledge of the Seven Kingdoms with Vanity Fair ’s Game of Unknowns. Make your predictions ||||| By my count it has been almost a decade since Richard Gere last toplined a conventional major studio film — 2008’s Nicholas Sparks romantic drama Nights In Rodanthe from Warner Bros. His last huge hit was 2002’s Oscar-winning musical Chicago, which brought him a Golden Globe but failed to put him in the Best Actor Oscar race, something that has unfairly eluded him his entire career. But the star of such hits as Pretty Woman, An Officer And A Gentleman, Primal Fear, American Gigolo, Unfaithful, Internal Affairs and many others hasn’t gone away — he’s just shifted Geres. Harkening to early interesting career choices like his breakthrough Looking For Mr. Goodbar 40 years ago, or Terrence Malick’s seminal Days Of Heaven, the actor has gone all indie on us, for now at least, and the result has been some of the best work of his career. On Friday his latest, Norman, opened in Los Angeles and New York from Sony Pictures Classics, and on May 5 he will be seen in another provocative independent that premiered at the Berlin Film Festival (and hits Tribeca next week) titled The Dinner, in which two couples (Laura Linney, Rebecca Hall and Steve Coogan co-star) try to sort out a tragic situation involving their college-age kids over the course of a very intense night out. The Orchard The latter is written and directed by Oren Moverman, who also has a producing credit on Norman, and directed and wrote Time Out Of Mind, an art house film that drew some top reviews for Gere in a startling turn as a homeless man adrift on the streets of New York City. The pair also had a connection on Todd Haynes’ wildly inventive 2007 film I’m Not There, in which Gere played Billy, one of six incarnations of Bob Dylan in the offbeat movie Moverman and Haynes co-scripted. Gere’s also done top-drawer recent work in little-seen movies like 2009’s wonderful Lasse Hallstrom-directed Hachi: A Dog’s Tale, which shamefully barely was released in theaters before hitting DVD almost directly, and The Benefactor, which premiered two years ago at the Tribeca Film Festival. For my money a movie that signaled his current indie renaissance was when he played a hedge fund magnate in 2012’s Arbitrage, which was one of the early success stories of films debuting simultaneously in theaters and on-demand. But now with Norman, the 67-year-old star is pulling some of the best reviews ever for a role he says is so out of left field for him even he would not have cast himself in it. As Norman Oppenheimer, a small-time Jewish operator who networks and makes connections in New York City, Gere transforms himself physically and personality-wise, completely inhabiting a guy most of us would probably turn away from when approached, but one who is fully dimensional in unforgettable ways. I think it ranks right up there with anything he has ever done, and he deservedly won praise for it when it first premiered at the Telluride and Toronto film festivals in September. Sony Pictures Classics The first English-language film from multi-Oscar nominated director Joseph Cedar (Footnote, Beaufort) whose previous films have emanated out of Israel, it was originally called Norman: The Moderate Rise And Tragic Fall Of A New York Fixer and offers Gere a plum character turn that he runs with. It is award-worthy work, but it took about a year before he was fully comfortable going in front of the cameras with it. Gere is pleased with the results and the initial reaction (it earned an impressive screen average of around 20,000 in its first weekend), but when he first read it he wasn’t sure. “I thought the script was great,” he told me recently when he appeared with Cedar at my Cinema Series in Sherman Oaks. “And I read it and I remember saying, ‘Why me?’ If I was directing and producing it I would not hire me. So we worked through that.” He said it was great they had the luxury of time, of letting things settle in an unhurried way where what he calls “a deeper sense of poetry” could come out. “I guess it just took us both to places that it wouldn’t have happened if we had just rushed it,” he said of Cedar and himself. “You always think that the last one is the best one you’ve ever done, and it’s certainly one of the movies that I’m most proud of I think that I’ve made, and I will always be grateful for Joseph inviting me on this trip.” For Cedar, there was no question Gere was the right guy to play this ambitious Jewish mensch, and he doesn’t understand why Gere didn’t see himself immediately in the role. “I don’t know what he’s talking about. I’ve been dreaming about this character and Richard Gere portraying him my entire life. To have Richard Gere bring him to life — I still see the Pretty Woman poster in this image. It’s me carrying the bags and hoping someone will come and save me, and then that’s what Richard Gere did with Norman, ” he said, invoking an unexpected comparison. Gere thinks the character is fairly universal. “If we’re not Normans ourselves, I think we all have a little bit of Norman in us. We want to belong, we want to be essential to something, and I had to find that in myself in order to play this guy,” he said. “I don’t care what business we’re in or what things we would like, there’s always a Norman on the edges trying to get in. You don’t know who he is, you don’t know his story, you don’t really want to know his story. You want to keep him in your life but you want to teach him business. I thought it was incredibly poignant to take a character like that.” Gere had to transform into the shoes of Norman Oppenheimer because he is quite the opposite in most ways. He is not into social media, doesn’t know much about phones (a staple for Norman, earbuds and all). He says a lot of creating the character was just not in his own experience. “But we knew that this was a guy who was carrying his world with him. He’s a turtle, he’s got a shell, he’s got his stuff that he carries with him every place he goes. The only place he removes his shell is the synagogue, and that’s home for him,” Gere said. “The physicality just sort of happened. I didn’t have to really make conscious choices that way. It was just something that happened naturally. The character did take me over at a certain point, and completely to the point where I didn’t have to think about it at all — it was there every time I showed up for work. I’ve done a lot of movies and a lot of stories. I think this was clearly one of the most unique characters I’ve been able to have the honor to try to figure out and bring to life a very complex thing.” IFC Films Gere points out that the movies he’s been making in recent years are really much like the kind he once did in the studio system, but not much recently. “The truth is no studio would have done Time Out Of Mind. There’s no way. That’s a completely un-commercial movie which did fine, but it took me 12 years to figure out what to do in that film. (Studios) just don’t want them any more, so now they’re independent.” He added: “Days Of Heaven or Looking For Mr. Goodbar or any of those films would be considered indie films today, but they were done at the studios. It was part of the wide range of films that every studio was proud to make. Now we just find another way of doing it. “I love that we made enough money doing those (studio) films that I can afford to make these kind of films now,” says the very independent Richard Gere. ||||| Summary:","response":"Actor Richard Gere has acknowledged that his outspoken criticism of China's occupation of Tibet has cost him work in the major Hollywood studios.

White Brazilians descended from the original Portuguese settlers. From the 1870s onwards this ethnic group also included other European immigrants: mainly Italians, Spaniards and Germans. Although whites could be found throughout the country, they were the majority group in the southern region and in São Paulo province. Whites also comprised a significant proportion (40%) of the population in the northeastern provinces of Ceará, Paraíba and Rio Grande do Norte. Black Brazilians of Sub-Saharan African ancestry inhabited the same areas as mulattoes. The majority of the population of Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, Espírito Santo, Bahia, Sergipe, Alagoas and Pernambuco provinces (the last four having the smallest percentages of whites in the whole country—less than 30% in each) were black or brown. The Indians, the indigenous peoples of Brazil, were found mainly in Piauí, Maranhão, Pará and Amazonas.Because of the existence of distinct racial and cultural communities, 19th century Brazil developed as a multi-ethnic nation.

Another poem in the anthology, which Stravinsky did not set but is likely to have read, is \\"Yarila\\" which, Morton observes, contains many of the basic elements from which The Rite of Spring developed, including pagan rites, sage elders, and the propitiatory sacrifice of a young maiden: \\"The likeness is too close to be coincidental\\". Stravinsky himself gave contradictory accounts of the genesis of The Rite. In a 1920 article he stressed that the musical ideas had come first, that the pagan setting had been suggested by the music rather than the other way round. However, in his 1936 autobiography he described the origin of the work thus: \\"One day [in 1910], when I was finishing the last pages of L'Oiseau de Feu in St Petersburg, I had a fleeting vision ... I saw in my imagination a solemn pagan rite: sage elders, seated in a circle, watching a young girl dance herself to death. They were sacrificing her to propitiate the god of Spring. Such was the theme of the Sacre du Printemps\\".By May 1910 Stravinsky was discussing his idea with Nicholas Roerich, the foremost Russian expert on folk art and ancient rituals. Roerich had a reputation as an artist and mystic, and had provided the stage designs for Diaghilev's 1909 production of the Polovtsian Dances. The pair quickly agreed on a working title, \\"The Great Sacrifice\\" (Russian: Velikaia zhertva); Diaghilev gave his blessing to the work, although the collaboration was put on hold for a year while Stravinsky was occupied with his second major commission for Diaghilev, the ballet Petrushka.In July 1911 Stravinsky visited Talashkino, near Smolensk, where Roerich was staying with the Princess Maria Tenisheva, a noted patron of the arts and a sponsor of Diaghilev's magazine World of Art.

Give praise when happy and avoid blaming when things go wrong in your life. Many times people struggle to find a way of pleasing God. Try to be sinless for God to love you. Think of Jesus as a magnet and think of yourself as iron and sin as salt. When sin is on man, just like salt on iron, man become rusty. Remember that magnet does not attract rusty iron. So be attractive, sinless like a new iron. That will please our heavenly Father always. \\"If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness\\" (1 John 1:9-10). Let go of your old life, even though it may be difficult. God will make it easy for you if you keep on trying to be perfect and pleasing to Him. Remember, it's not by our power, but by His grace that you are forgiven and sanctified, so trust in Him even when it is hard to stay sinless.

We can see that there are two terms with the variable h in the equation. Let's combine these terms by adding them together. (-188*h) + (200*h) = 200*h - 188*h = 12*h So now, our equation becomes: 12*h + 84 = 0 Step 2: Isolate the variable h. Now, we want to isolate h on one side of the equation. To do this, we'll first move the constant term (+84) to the other side of the equation by subtracting it from both sides. 12*h + 84 - 84 = 0 - 84 12*h = -84 Step 3: Solve for h. To completely isolate h, we now need to divide both sides of the equation by 12, which is the coefficient of h. (12*h) / 12 = (-84) / 12 h = -7 So, the solution to the equation -188*h + 200*h + 84 = 0 is h = -7."},{"question":"Given the question: Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it?

Article:","response":"Title: U.S. Anti-Espionage Laws Keep Chinese Travelers Off Virgin Galactic's Space Flights Hey kids! Guess what? Today we are going to learn about something exciting happening in the world of space travel. Virgin Galactic is a company that is planning to send people into space for fun! They are selling tickets for these amazing trips, but not everyone can join the journey. Let's find out why! First, let's learn about a special rule that the U.S. government made called the \\"anti-espionage law.\\" This rule says that people from China are not allowed to go on the Virgin space flights. Why? Well, this rule is supposed to help keep our country safe by making sure people don't share secrets with countries that might not be friends with us right now, and China is one of those countries. Because of this rule, when some Chinese people offered to buy tickets for the space flights, which cost 260,000 each, they were told they couldn't go. That's a lot of money to pay just to be turned down, right? But do you know that some people are allowed to have more than one passport? Yep! And those people who have both a Chinese passport and another one from a different country might be allowed to go on the space flights. That's because having a passport from another country can sometimes help people get around rules like the anti-espionage law. Even though these space flights sound super cool, some people think they are way too short and way too expensive. That's because the trip only lasts a few minutes and, as we already learned, costs a lot of money. But for some, it might be a dream come true to travel to outer space, even for just a short time. And that's the story, kids! We learned that some really fun space trips are being planned by a company called Virgin Galactic, but because of U.S. anti-espionage laws, people from China are not allowed to go. We also learned that if someone has more than one passport, they might be able to bypass this rule. We'll have to wait and see who gets to go on these exciting space adventures!"},{"question":"Semi-additive is the most common process: The unpatterned board has a thin layer of copper already on it.

Objects that move in uniform circular motion all have an acceleration toward the center of the circle and therefore, they must also suffer a force toward the center of the circle. That force is the centripetal force. For orbiting satellites, such as the moon orbiting the earth or the earth orbiting the sun, the centripetal force is produced by gravity. When an Olympic hammer thrower whirls a massive ball on a chain, the centripetal force is created by the athlete and transmitted by the chain. Adam wants to show his little brother a trick. He gets a bucket of water and says to him \\"I bet i can turn this bucket upside down and no water will fall out\\". His brother doesn't believe him of course. So Adam takes the bucket by the handle and quickly starts spinning it in a circle. Will the centripetal force on the bucket increase or decrease as Adam spins it faster? Answer:","response":"As Adam spins the bucket faster, the centripetal force on the bucket will increase. Here's why: Centripetal force (F_c) is the force that keeps an object moving in a circular path. It always acts towards the center of the circle. The formula for centripetal force is: F_c = (m × v^2) / r where F_c is the centripetal force, m is the mass of the object (in this case, the bucket with water), v is the linear velocity of the object (how fast the bucket is moving along the circular path), and r is the radius of the circular path. As Adam spins the bucket faster, the linear velocity (v) of the bucket increases. Since the centripetal force is directly proportional to the square of the velocity (v^2), when the velocity increases, the centripetal force also increases. This increased centripetal force acts towards the center of the circular path, effectively counteracting gravity and preventing the water from falling out of the bucket when it's upside down."},{"question":"Given a list of steps and an additional step, determine where the step fits into the original list of steps.

Bold farm used lots of fertilizers over the years, while Shallow farm used organic methods combined with methods from permaculture. Which farm contributes less to the consumption of oxygen in the water? Hint: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. Answer:","response":"Based on the given information, Shallow farm, which used organic methods combined with permaculture methods, contributes less to the consumption of oxygen in the water.

I think you're wrong...\\" But it isn't very polite to disagree so strongly, so the other person might say \\"I'm not sure.\\" It's a nicer way to say that you don't agree with someone. People also don't say exactly what they are thinking when they finish talking with other people. For example, may talks over the phone finish when one person says \\"I've to go now.\\" Often, the person who wants to hang up gives an excuse \\"Someone's at the door.\\" \\"Something is burning on the stove.\\" The excuses might be real, or not. _ The excuse is more polite, and it doesn't hurt the other person. Whether they are greeting each other, talking about an idea, or finishing a talk, people don't say exactly that they are thinking. It's an important way that people try to be nice to each other, and it's part of the rule of the game of language. Question: When a person disagree with someone, it is polite to say \\" _ \\".

The war culminated in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and other large aerial bomb attacks by the United States Army Air Forces, accompanied by the Soviet invasion of Manchuria on 8 August 1945, resulting in the Japanese announcement of intent to surrender on 15 August 1945. The formal and official surrender of Japan took place aboard the battleship USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay on 2 September 1945. Following its defeat, Japan's Shinto Emperor stepped down as the divine leader through the Shinto Directive, because the Allied Powers believed this was the major political cause of Japan's military aggression and deconstruction process soon took place to install a new liberal-democratic constitution to the Japanese public as the current Constitution of Japan. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What was the process called whereby the leader of Japan stepped down?","response":"The process whereby the leader of Japan, Emperor Hirohito, stepped down from his divine status after World War II does not have a specific name or term. However, this significant event is closely related to the Shinto Directive and Japan's post-war transformation under the Allied Occupation. After Japan's defeat, the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers (SCAP), General Douglas MacArthur, along with other Allied leaders, sought to dismantle the Japanese political and military systems that had led to the war. In their view, the Imperial institution and the idea of the Emperor's divine status were significant contributors to Japan's aggression. The Shinto Directive was issued on December 15, 1945, by the Allied Occupation authorities. It aimed to separate the Shinto religion from state affairs and removed its status as a state religion. As a result, the Shinto religion lost much of its influence and financial support from the government. On January 1, 1946, Emperor Hirohito issued the Ningen-sengen, or the Humanity Declaration, announcing that he was not an incarnation of a god (arahitogami) and renouncing his divine status. According to the declaration, the Emperor was a mortal human being (ningen) just like the rest of the population. This move aimed to redefine his role in the Japanese government and promote a more democratic system. It is important to note that while the Emperor renounced his divine status, he did not abdicate his position as the Emperor. He continued to serve as a symbolic figurehead and a unifying force for the Japanese people during the post-war rebuilding process and beyond. In summary, while there is not a specific term for the process of Japan's Emperor stepping down from his divine status, this event is closely associated with the Shinto Directive and the Ningen-sengen, which paved the way for a new era in Japan's political, social, and cultural landscape."},{"question":"This question has options.

Since the shops are closed for 3 days, we need to calculate the potential revenue lost for these 3 days.

She was at her sister's home that evening when her friend, the infant's godmother, called in a panic to say that Brandon had fallen off a day bed and was barely breathing. The babysitter called 911 three times, Alex said. She said phone records indicate the first call at 5:55 p.m. lasted 51 seconds. Her friend hung up and performed CPR then called again at 5:57 p.m. and stayed on hold for 9 minutes, Alex said. The sitter hung up to perform CPR again on the barely breathing boy. She then called a third time at 6:11 p.m. and stayed on the line for 31 minutes. Her friend, who is distraught over Brandon's death, did not have a car to drive the boy to the hospital.

Six-month-old Brandon died Saturday night. Alex says her babysitter couldn’t get through to 911 when she repeatedly tried to call for help. \\"I lost my 6-month-old because 911 did not respond,” the Dallas mother says. “There’s no excuse that you can give me to take that pain away.” The babysitter’s calls to 911 came during a time of crisis Saturday night. That night, 442 callers were put on hold for an average of 38 minutes. The City says a glitch involving a T-Mobile issue started intermittently in November, but has gotten much worse over the last month. Whenever a T-Mobile customer calls 911, it creates ghost calls that the system records as 911 hang ups. It creates a bottleneck in the system as 911 operators respond to those “ghost” 911 hang ups. Callers end up getting put on hold as operators try to catch up. “I need to know why my son of six months is gone,” Alex said. “That’s what I want to know. It should have been fixed by now. This is ridiculous.” City Manager T.C. Broadnax spoke by phone to T-Mobile’s CEO John Legere after WFAA contacted the city about Brandon’s death. Legere agreed to send his top engineers to Dallas Wednesday morning. He committed to have them stay until the problem is fixed. “This is an unacceptable situation and the citizens of Dallas deserve better,” said Broadnax. “With Mr. Legere’s commitment today, I’m hopeful T-Mobile can continue to work with the City of Dallas to finally resolve this situation so that we have a reliable 911 system that can properly serve the emergency needs of our citizens.” T-Mobile’s problems have previously extended beyond Dallas. In 2015, T-Mobile reached a 17.5 million settlement over two massive nationwide outages that occurred the year before. It affected all of T-Mobile’s nearly 50 million customers. That meant T-Mobile customers dialing 911 during those outages would not have reached first responders. On Saturday, Alex left six-month-old Brandon with her best friend, who frequently babysat for her. Bridget had gone to attend the funeral of her nephew, 19-year-old Drekeiston Alex. He was killed March 2, police say, by a couple who referred to themselves as “Bonnie and “Clyde” as he tried to walk away from them. They bragged about shooting people in a Facebook Live video. That evening, she was at her sister’s home when the babysitter called. She was frantic. She told her that Brandon had fallen off a day bed. He was barely breathing, and she could not get him to wake up. The sitter had tried CPR. “She said, 'I've called 911 three times,'” Alex says. “'They keep leaving me on hold, and they won't respond.'” Alex provided WFAA with screenshots of the babysitter’s calls to 911. The babysitter made the first call at 5:55 p.m. It lasted 55 seconds. She made the second call at 5:57 p.m. It lasted eight minutes and 40 seconds. She called for a third time at 6:11 pm. She stayed on the line for 31 minutes and 35 seconds. City officials said in that call, dispatchers did try to return each of the calls, but could not connect to the caller. At this point, the statement said that they could not connect the child’s death to the T-Mobile “ghost call issue.” Bridget says she rushed home to her apartment on Midway Road near Frankford Road. She walked into her apartment. The babysitter was holding Brandon, who did not appear to be breathing by that point. “I jumped in the car with him, and I just kept kissing his lips,” Bridget said. “He was still warm. I just kept saying, 'Brandon, please wake up. Please wake up.’” Bridget drove Brandon to Methodist Hospital for surgery. They transferred Brandon to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Plano, where he was pronounced dead at 7:48 p.m. Saturday. “The doctor came and he was like, ‘We tried, and he just never woke up,’” she said. Bridget will bury Brandon Monday in her hometown of Greenville. The family started a GoFundMe to raise money for funeral expenses. “He couldn't even walk, he can't even talk, but he's gone, and I'll never get to see his smile, to feel his touch, to smell him again,” she said. Police sources told WFAA that Brandon had no obvious injuries. The cause of his death is pending once an autopsy is completed. Still, Bridget has a hard time understanding why her friend didn’t run outside and ask someone to drive her to the hospital. She can only believe that she was too distraught to know what to do. She wonders, “Why didn’t you run? Why didn’t you scream? I would have been beating on people’s doors.” Brandon was her youngest. She has three other children. The oldest is 22. She is heartbroken at the prospect of her life without the smiling infant. He was already trying to walk and feed himself. “He laughed all the time,” she said. “He liked everybody. He didn’t meet strangers.” “I just hope this doesn’t happen to another family,” she said, tears flowing down her face. “This hurts so bad. I don’t think anyone should have to bury their child.” The City of Dallas responded to the incident with the following statement: Saturday evening, the Dallas 911 Call Center experienced a spike in calls due to the ongoing T-Mobile ghost call issue. A six-month old child died at some time that evening. The Dallas Police Department says an individual who we now believe was the child’s caregiver, called 911 multiple times but hung up before speaking to a call taker. Call takers returned each call, but were unable to reach the individual. The child was taken to two area hospitals. DPD is investigating the death and no additional information can be released, as this case is under investigation. There is no evidence at this time connecting the child’s death to the T-Mobile ghost call issue. We can only confirm that the caller was using a T-Mobile device and tried reaching 911 Saturday evening, during the spike in calls. Since November 2016, T-Mobile has been working with multiple city departments to try several solutions unsuccessfully. This afternoon, Dallas City Manager T.C. Broadnax spoke directly with T-Mobile CEO John Legere. Legere committed to sending his top engineers to Dallas tomorrow morning. Legere stressed that they will stay on the ground until the issue is resolved. During that time, DPD will also continue to provide increased staffing in the 911 call center. “This is an unacceptable situation and the citizens of Dallas deserve better,” said Broadnax. “With Mr. Legere’s commitment today, I’m hopeful T-Mobile can continue to work with the City of Dallas to finally resolve this situation so that we have a reliable 911 system that can properly serve the emergency needs of our citizens.” The following is a statement from Mayor Mike Rawlings: \\"It is outrageous that T-Mobile still has not resolved the ghost call issue that is putting Dallasites in danger by clogging our 911 system. I’m in full agreement with our city manager that our citizens deserve better. This issue not only puts paying T-Mobile customers at risk, but it jeopardizes the safety of people throughout our city. It’s encouraging that T-Mobile will finally be sending top engineers to Dallas tomorrow morning. I can only assume that they will work around the clock until they figure out how to fix this issue.\\" © 2017 WFAA-TV ||||| Follow CBSDFW.COM: Facebook | Twitter DALLAS (CBSDFW.COM) – Officials with the City of Dallas say T-Mobile crews arrived there well before the lunch hour today and are busy working to fix a major system issue that has left 911 operators overwhelmed with “ghost calls.” CBS 11 News spoke with Mayor Mike Rawlings about his frustration and the danger the situation poses for residents. The Mayor said anyone could run into trouble if there’s a surge in calls, but the odds are worse for some cell phone customers. “If you’ve got a T-Mobile phone service be very, very careful because you may not be able to get into 911,” he said. Problems at the Dallas 911 center may have contributed to the death of a 6-month-old baby. The Dallas Police Department is investigating after the boy’s caretaker dialed 911 on Saturday evening, but was unable to get through. The city confirmed that ghost calls from T-Mobile phones were overwhelming emergency lines at the time. Bridget Alex said that the urgency in finding a solution comes too late for her son. “He was only 6 months,” she said. “It wasn’t his time.” Alex was at her nephew’s funeral when young Brandon’s babysitter called to say that he had fallen and would not wake up. “I said, ‘Why couldn’t you call 911?’ She said, ‘I am calling 911. They are not answering their phones.'” The City of Dallas reported that T-Mobile phones were spontaneously dialing 911, a problem that has been reoccurring since November, tying up the call center for up to hours at a time. At one point on Saturday, the city reported that 422 calls were on hold. The city’s goal is to answer all 911 calls within 10 seconds. But on Saturday night, callers were on hold for an average of 30 to 40 minutes. Alex said that her babysitter made three calls to 911, but never got through. “The last time she called, they had her on hold for 31 minutes,” the mother said. “I just want y’all to tell me, why didn’t you respond to my son? That’s all I want to know,” Alex continued. The grieving mother said that she drove home, picked up her son and raced him to the hospital herself. They arrived just after 7:00 p.m. — just over an hour after the babysitter’s first 911 call. By then, Alex said, her son had stopped breathing. Within the hour, a doctor pronounced him dead. Alex blames her son’s death on the City of Dallas and T-Mobile for failing to fix the problem. Now, she said, it is too late to fix anything. “At the end of the day, I’m still going to be here hurt, because he’s not going to be here,” Alex said. “I’m not going to get to see him or smell him or touch him or kiss him ever again.” The city said that it brought in 10 extra call takers Saturday after 911 started seeing a surge in calls, but nobody has been able to determine the cause of the problem or predict when it will occur. Mayor Rawlings called the issue outrageous. “I want the problem solved immediately and if it takes longer I want to know why.” ||||| A summary of this is?","response":"A recent incident in Dallas, Texas, demonstrates one of the many dangers of malfunctioning emergency hotline systems. Six-month-old Brandon died after his babysitter failed to get through to the 911 emergency hotline.

The system has been plagued by a \\"ghost call\\" glitch, caused by Dallas-based T-Mobile customers, which began intermittently in November 2016 but has worsened since then. Whenever a T-Mobile customer dials 911, ghost calls are created and logged as 911 hang-ups, adding strain on the call center as operators respond to these phantom calls, resulting in extended hold times for genuine callers.

The premise states that something may look good on paper, but putting it into reality may be difficult. This suggests that there can be a disconnect between a plan or idea in theory and its actual execution in real life. Step 2: Analyze the hypothesis statement. The hypothesis claims that something is perfect because it looks good on paper and is easy to implement. Step 3: Compare the premise and hypothesis. The premise highlights that there can be challenges when moving from a theoretical plan to real-world execution. The hypothesis states that if something looks good on paper and is easy to implement, then it is perfect. Step 4: Evaluate the truth of the hypothesis based on the premise. Based on the premise, the hypothesis may not necessarily be true. While the hypothesis argues that if something looks good on paper and is easy to implement, it is perfect, the premise suggests that there may still be challenges or unforeseen issues when trying to put the theory into practice. Therefore, considering the premise, the hypothesis is not guaranteed to be true, as perfection would require not only a good theoretical plan and ease of implementation but also the ability to effectively translate the plan into reality without encountering significant difficulties or unintended consequences."},{"question":"Read the text and determine if the sentence is true (see options at the end): Many science fiction works have been set in the 21st century (years 2001 to 2100).

Water flowing over a steeper slope moves faster and causes more erosion. How water transports particles depends on their size. When water slows down, it starts depositing sediment. This process starts with the largest particles first. Runoff erodes the land after a heavy rain. It picks up sediment. Runoff carries most of the sediment to bodies of water. Mountain streams erode narrow, V-shaped valleys and waterfalls. Erosion and deposition by slow-flowing rivers create broad floodplains and meanders. Deposition by streams and rivers may form alluvial fans and deltas. Floodwaters may deposit natural levees. Erosion and deposition by groundwater can form caves and sinkholes. Stalactites and stalagmites are mineral deposits. They build up in caves as water continues to drip. According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What kind of deposits build up in caves as water continues to drip?\\" is \\"Sediment\\"?","response":"Imagine you're in a big room with water dripping from the ceiling.

Question: suppose more war occurs happens, how will it affect less men available. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","response":"The situation described refers to a process during which a man and woman mate, leading to the development of an embryo (C) that grows into a fetus inside the woman's womb. The fetus is then born, growing and developing through infancy, childhood, and puberty, eventually reaching sexual maturity and adulthood. If the adult chooses to procreate, the cycle is continued. Now, we must consider the hypothetical scenario where more war occurs, resulting in fewer men being available. In this context, let's examine how this perturbation could influence the second effect mentioned (which refers to embryo development and growth into a fetus) and analyze whether it might have more, less, or no effect on this particular stage. Increased war could potentially have several effects on the availability of men for mating and, consequently, the development of embryos: 1. More effect: An increase in war leads to a significant reduction in the number of men available for the mating process. As a result, the number of embryos (C) produced, and consequent fetus development decreases proportionally. This outcome also implies that there could be less genetic diversity in the population, which might have long-term effects on the overall health and adaptability of the community. 2. Less effect: It is also possible that the reduction in available men would not directly correlate with a decline in embryo development and fetus growth. In this case, the impacted community might adapt to the situation by adopting changes in cultural norms, family structures, and expectations. For example, the community might start favoring polyandry where a woman has multiple male mates simultaneously, which could still maintain a consistent rate of fetus development despite the reduced number of men. 3. No effect: In some situations, the decrease in men could mean that the remaining men form committed relationships and participate in rearing the offspring of other (potentially deceased) men, ensuring the nurturing and development of the growing fetus. Accordingly, this would not significantly affect the rate of fetus growth or the health of the community at large, as the remaining individuals step up to fill critical roles in the society. In conclusion, the effect of increased war and the subsequent reduction in the number of available men on embryo development and fetus growth could potentially range from more to no effect, depending on the affected community's social and cultural adaptations to the situation. The resultant impact is influenced by the community's resilience and how it restructures relationships and expectations to continue the cycle of life despite the challenges resulting from war."},{"question":"Denny asked: Premise: \\"A man wearing glasses with his hands clasped as if in prayer.\\" Hypothesis: \\"A man is in church.\\" Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?

According to data obtained by the BBC, the reach of the project has been significantly lower than its goals, having reached less than 30% of its intended audience. This raises questions about the project's implementation, marketing strategies, and the allocation of funds. Background: The digital health project, launched last year, was designed as a comprehensive online platform to provide quick access to reliable health information, expert advice, and tools that could improve the well-being and self-care of people in the UK. The project set out to reach millions of users and sought to help them make informed decisions about their health by providing critical information on various health conditions, treatment options, and prevention techniques. Findings: Despite the £10m investment, it has been revealed that the online health project has only managed to reach around 30% of its target audience. This disappointing result indicates a need to re-evaluate the project's strategies and potentially make adjustments to the way resources are utilised. Possible Causes: Several factors may have contributed to the project's low reach: 1. Insufficient marketing: The project may have suffered from poor visibility, as adequate marketing efforts may not have been put in place to educate the public about the platform and its goals. Inadequate marketing can reduce the chances of reaching a wider audience. 2. Inaccessible content: The project's content may not have been user-friendly, or it may have contained too much medical jargon, discouraging users from engaging with the platform. Accessible content design is essential to ensure the message reaches both medical professionals and laypeople. 3. Competition from established platforms: The online health project may have struggled to penetrate a crowded market with existing, well-established information sources. Without offering a clear and compelling differentiator, the project may have failed to attract users away from familiar platforms. Recommendations: Going forward, the following steps could potentially improve the reach of the project: 1. Review and enhance marketing strategies: Implementing a stronger marketing campaign can improve the project's visibility and awareness in its target population. This may include partnerships with health organizations, collaborations with public figures, and focusing on targeted marketing techniques. 2. Make content more accessible: Ensuring that the platform's content is approachable and easy to understand can help attract a wider audience. Utilising infographics, videos, and simplified language are some ways to make information more appealing. 3. Establish a unique selling proposition (USP): To compete more effectively with existing platforms, the project should focus on providing features or services that are distinct and offer an advantage over the competition. Identifying the needs and gaps in the current market can offer valuable insight for creating a USP. Conclusion: While the £10m online health project has not reached its intended audience as expected, there is still potential for improvement. By evaluating current strategies and making necessary adjustments, the project can heighten its appeal and accessibility to ultimately fulfil its intended purpose of providing vital health information and support to millions of individuals in the UK."},{"question":"Given news headlines and an edited word.

Before the war he was a farmer, but now he makes his living helping Syrian refugees cross, illegally, into Turkey. As the Syrian conflict enters its seventh year it is a journey that is becoming increasingly difficult and dangerous. \\"The border guards are playing with people's souls as they run through the fields trying to hide between the rocks,\\" Abdo says. \\"Many lives have been lost on these roads.\\" Since Turkey tightened border security in 2016 it is much harder to find places where it is possible to slip across. Like Abdo, many of the Syrians involved in people smuggling are residents of villages close to the border area. \\"[They] know the roads and the fields by heart,\\" he says. \\"They can take people along the roads that are difficult for the border guards to reach.\\" Abdo works the area in the north-western part of the border, sending people into Turkey's Hatay province via the Syrian villages of Salqin and Haram. Haram is the cheapest route because it is the most direct, but it is also the most exposed, with people crossing open fields, he tells the BBC. Salqin costs more money because it offers more cover. But it is an arduous journey that can take up to three hours and involves climbing hills, wading through rivers and trudging across mud-logged fields. But both routes often end in a barrage of gunfire as refugees dodge border patrols and make the final dash into Turkey. Those who manage to get across still need to walk for miles to safety in remote villages. Despite the risk there are still many desperate people willing to take their chances. Abdo says that he sees dozens of people every night trying to cross the border. Further east is another escape route into Turkey's Gaziantep province via the Syrian border town of Jarablus. Ziad, 28, is a former engineer from Aleppo, who fled to Turkey in 2012. He was smuggled out across the fields beyond Jarablus and then became a smuggler himself helping many relatives and friends to make the same journey. Since early 2016, things have changed here too and now the only way out is via official border crossings. There are two ways to smuggle people through official crossings, Ziad explains. One is for the smugglers to register refugees as their employees. Officially the refugees are there to help load and unload goods before the return journey to Syria. Unofficially, as soon as they reach Turkey they slip away and are picked up by cars that take them on to safety away from the border area. Getting temporary permission to work in this way usually costs around 1,800. The other option - for the same amount of money - is to be smuggled across the border in the back of an ambulance ferrying Syrians for medical treatment in Turkey. \\"It's impossible to get people out any other way,\\" Ziad says. Things have become so difficult that Ziad and many others like him have given up people smuggling altogether and now smuggle cigarettes and mobile phones instead. As a registered cross-border trader, Ziad now travels between the two countries taking advantage of the higher prices on the Turkish side. \\"You can go into Syria with a truck of vegetables and food, and come out with 25 blocks of cigarettes,\\" he says. Cigarettes cost twice as much in Turkey as in Syria, so he can sell a block for double what he pays for it, sharing 1.5 per block with the local truck drivers who carry the goods across. Back in Idlib province, Abdo is waiting for his next customers. Sometimes it takes people as many as six attempts to finally reach Turkey, he says. And not everyone makes it. But as the war drags on, it is clear that however hard it might be to get to safety, many Syrians are not going to give up whatever the cost of trying. A summary of the above article is?","response":"This story is about a man named Abdo, who used to be a farmer in Syria. Now, he helps people from Syria go to Turkey secretly because it is not safe for them in Syria anymore. The journey to Turkey is very difficult and dangerous, but many people are willing to try, even if it takes many tries. Some other people used to help with this too, like a man named Ziad, but now they do other jobs, like bringing things to sell between the two countries."},{"question":"Dialogue: Kate: Hi dear Karen: Hi sweetheart, all good?

Answer the above question based on the context below: Laika is memorialised in the form of a statue and plaque at Star City, Russia, the Russian Cosmonaut training facility. Created in 1997, Laika is positioned behind the cosmonauts with her ears erect. The Monument to the Conquerors of Space, constructed in 1964, also includes Laika. On 11 April 2008 at the military research facility where staff had been responsible for readying Laika for the flight, officials unveiled a monument of her poised on top of a space rocket. Stamps and envelopes picturing Laika were produced, as well as branded cigarettes and matches.Future space missions carrying dogs would be designed to be recovered. Four other dogs died in Soviet space missions: Bars and Lisichka were killed when their R-7 rocket exploded shortly after launch on 28 July 1960; Pchyolka and Mushka died when Korabl-Sputnik 3 was purposely destroyed with an explosive charge to prevent foreign powers from inspecting the capsule after a wayward atmospheric reentry trajectory on 1 December 1960.Although never shown, Laika is prominently mentioned in the 1985 film My Life as a Dog, in which the main character (a young Swedish boy in the late 1950s) identifies strongly with the dog. Laika, a 2007 graphic novel by Nick Abadzis giving a fictionalized account of Laika's life, won the Eisner Award for Best Publication for Teens.

Robert Merkel, a former U.S. attorney handling drug indictments in Florida, doesn't think for a minute that Castro's much publicized trials of high officials engaged in the drug trade mean he has broken off with the Medellin drug cartel. \\"If the cartel succeeds in blackmailing the Colombian authorities into negotiations, the cartel will be in control and Fidel can exploit his past relationships with them,\\" he told the Journal's David Asman recently. The struggle against the drug lords in Colombia will be a near thing. This week, the government arrested Jose Abello Silva, said to be the fourth-ranking cartel leader. He will probably be extradited to the U.S. for trial under an extradition treaty President Virgilia Barco has revived. Later, another high-ranking trafficker, Leonidas Vargas, was arrested and 1,000 pounds of dynamite seized. Mr. Barco has refused U.S. troops or advisers but has accepted U.S. military aid. President Bush has agreed to meet within 90 days with Mr. Barco, President Alan Garcia of Peru and President Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia to discuss the drug problem.

Growing up, she cut everyone in our family’s hair; she dyed mine whenever I wanted, and whatever crazy color I wanted, too. Until I was a senior in high school, I had never been to a salon. I don’t even remember why I went this time. Mom was going to have her hair done, and I had tagged along. She asked if I wanted a cut too and I said why not? So while Mom was getting her hair done I looked through the books and picked out a cute pageboy style that I liked. Finally it was my turn and after talking with the stylist and showing her what I wanted, she led me to the shampoo station. Now, as everybody who has ever been to a salon knows, you sit back in the chair with your neck in the indentation and they wash your hair. But I had never been to a salon. When mom washed my hair after dyeing it, I always leaned over the sink. So … I started to climb into the chair and lean over the sink here, too. My mom was mortified and the stylist couldn’t figure out what in the heck I was doing. Mom calls out, “No, Jennifer … you sit in the chair.” I look over my shoulder at her and then realize what I’ve done. Red-faced, I stand up and then turn around to sit and lean back in the chair. I honestly wanted to die right there. I’m pretty sure the stylist thought I was developmentally delayed or something because she talked to me for the rest of the time like one would talk to a three-year-old. Mom tried to explain that I’d never been to a salon before, but I think that just made the situation worse. Thankfully I’ve been to many salons now and understand how everything works, but I’ve never returned to THAT one.

During the Enlightenment, some societies created or retained links to universities. However, contemporary sources distinguished universities from scientific societies by claiming that the university's utility was in the transmission of knowledge, while societies functioned to create knowledge. As the role of universities in institutionalized science began to diminish, learned societies became the cornerstone of organized science. Official scientific societies were chartered by the state in order to provide technical expertise. Most societies were granted permission to oversee their own publications, control the election of new members, and the administration of the society. After 1700, a tremendous number of official academies and societies were founded in Europe, and by 1789 there were over seventy official scientific societies. In reference to this growth, Bernard de Fontenelle coined the term \\"the Age of Academies\\" to describe the 18th century.\\"?

Which group studied more about mutations that cannot be passed to the next generation? Scientists studied mutations on groups of fruit flies. Group A presented gemline mutations, while group B presented somatic mutations. Hint: Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer. The answer to this question is:","response":"Group B studied more about mutations that cannot be passed to the next generation.

In the history of the National Football League (NFL), field goals have varied in distance, often ranging from 20 to 50 yards, depending on the respective expertise of kickers and the specific game situations. However, one momentous occasion delivered the incredible: the shortest field goal in NFL history. This article delves into the details behind the record-breaking field goal and the story of the individuals involved in making it possible. The Shortest Field Goal of All Time The title for the shortest field goal in the NFL goes to former Cleveland Browns placekicker Tom Dempsey, who achieved this feat on September 24, 1978. Dempsey, a long-standing member of the New Orleans Saints, set this astonishing record during a regular-season game against the Buffalo Bills. The shortest field goal in NFL history measures a mere 8 yards. However, it is essential to understand the context and rules of the time, which contributed to this exceptional event. The Significance of the Kick At first, an 8-yard field goal might seem like an unimpressive exploit when compared to Dempsey's record-breaking 63-yard field goal against the Detroit Lions in 1970. Nevertheless, the 8-yard kick deserves recognition due to the unique circumstances surrounding it. Besides demonstrating Dempsey's kicking prowess in a critical game situation, the 8-yard field goal also exemplifies the adaptability of the NFL's regulations since that kick would no longer be possible based on the current league's rules. The Importance of Rule Changes Between 1974 and 1993, the NFL had instituted rules that allowed teams to place the ball at the point of the previous line of scrimmage if the opposing team committed a penalty during a field goal attempt. The officials would assess the punishment after the kick, and the team could either accept the penalty or decline it, depending on the outcome. In Dempsey's case, the Browns kicked from the 15-yard line; however, the Bills incurred an offside penalty, automatically moving the ball up 5 yards. As a result, Dempsey was allowed to kick from the 10-yard line, which, given that the goalposts were situated at the front of the end zone, resulted in the 8-yard field goal. The Legacy of the Shortest Field Goal Since 1994, the NFL has witnessed crucial modifications in its policies, primarily concerning the placement of the goalposts at the back of the end zone. Presently, the shortest possible field goal would measure 17 yards, considering that a team could snap the ball from the one-yard line and incorporate the additional 10-yard depth of the end zone, compounded with the 6-foot distance from the end line to the goalposts. Consequently, Dempsey's 8-yard record has remained unchallenged and is unlikely to ever be replicated, precisely because of these rule adjustments. Conclusion Tom Dempsey's accomplishment in securing an 8-yard field goal stands as an enduring testament to his extraordinary kicking skills, as well as the historical progression of America's beloved sport. His achievement, now cemented within the annals of NFL history, highlights the continuous evolution of the game's guidelines. From an 8-yard field goal to a 63-yard kick that would stand as a record for over 40 years, Dempsey's legacy on the field remains a powerful reminder of the importance of determination, skill, and adaptability in the face of ever-changing circumstances."},{"question":"Please answer the following question by reasoning step-by-step. Given the sentence \\"Three people walk past a construction zone fenced off with orange plastic fencing.\\" is it true that \\"Three people are running past a construction zone.\\"?. Step-by-step reasoning:","response":"Step 1: Read and analyze the given sentence. The given sentence states, \\"Three people walk past a construction zone fenced off with orange plastic fencing.\\" Step 2: Extract relevant information from the sentence. In this sentence, we have - Three people - Walk past (indicates the action of the people) - Construction zone (which is fenced off with orange plastic fencing) Step 3: Compare the given information with the statement to be verified. The statement to be verified is \\"Three people are running past a construction zone.\\" Comparing this with the extracted information: - \\"Three people\\" match; both sentences mention the same number of people. - \\"Past a construction zone\\" matches; both sentences mention the same location. - \\"Running\\" in the statement to be verified and \\"walk past\\" in the given sentence differ in the action; the given sentence states that the people walk past the construction zone, while the given statement claims that they are running. Step 4: Determine if the statement to be verified is true or not. Since the given information and the statement to be verified differ in the action of the people (walking past vs. running past), it is incorrect to say that \\"Three people are running past a construction zone\\" based on the given sentence. Conclusion: The statement \\"Three people are running past a construction zone\\" is not true, given the sentence \\"Three people walk past a construction zone fenced off with orange plastic fencing.\\""},{"question":"The critic consesnsus is: Kevin Bacon's acting is so genuine that it's creepy and director David Keopp knows how to create true suspense.. What reviews supported this critic consensus?","response":"As an AI language model, I don't have direct access to specific reviews, but I can guide you on what steps to find reviews that support the critic consensus. Step 1: Search for the movie or show being referenced. In order to find reviews that support the critic consensus, first, identify the movie or show. In this case, the movie is \\"You Should Have Left,\\" starring Kevin Bacon and directed by David Koepp. Step 2: Look for reputable review websites. There are a number of well-known websites where professional critics post their reviews, such as Rotten Tomatoes, IMDb, and Metacritic. These websites often compile reviews and provide an overall score. Step 3: Search the websites for reviews that specifically mention Kevin Bacon and David Koepp. Once you've found the reviews on these websites, search for reviews that focus on the acting of Kevin Bacon and the direction of David Koepp. Look for phrases like \\"genuine performance,\\" \\"chilling acting,\\" \\"suspenseful moments,\\" or any statements that highlight the strengths of the actor and director. Step 4: Create a list and include quotes from the reviews. After finding relevant reviews, compile a list and include specific quotes from each review that supports the critic consensus. For example, a quote like \\"Kevin Bacon delivers a disturbingly authentic performance, adding to the overall atmosphere of dread\\" would support the statement about his acting. Similarly, a quote like \\"David Koepp masterfully builds tension and never lets the viewer feel at ease\\" would reinforce the consensus on the director's work in creating suspense. Step 5: Double-check the sources. It is always good to double-check the sources of the reviews to ensure that they come from well-respected critics and publications. This will provide credibility to the list of reviews that support the critic consensus."},{"question":"Q: You will be given a trivia clue, and the category it belongs to.

Article 2 of Brazil's Constitution defined the roles of both the Emperor and the Assembleia Geral (General Assembly or Parliament), which in 1824 was composed of 50 senators and 102 general deputies, as the nation's representatives. The Constitution endowed the Assembly with both status and authority, and created legislative, moderating, executive and judicial branches as \\"delegations of the nation\\" with the separation of those powers envisaged as providing balances in support of the Constitution and the rights it enshrined.The prerogatives and authority granted to the legislature within the Constitution meant that it could and would play a major and indispensable role in the functioning of the government—it was not just a rubber stamp. The General Assembly alone could enact, revoke, interpret and suspend laws under Article 13 of the Constitution. The legislature also held the power of the purse and was required to annually authorize expenditures and taxes. It alone approved and exercised oversight of government loans and debts. Other responsibilities entrusted to the Assembly included setting the size of the military's forces, the creation of offices within the government, monitoring the national welfare and ensuring that the government was being run in conformity to the Constitution. This last provision allowed the legislature wide authority to examine and debate government policy and conduct. Regarding matters of foreign policy, the Constitution (under Article 102) required that the General Assembly be consulted about declarations of war, treaties and the conduct of international relations. A determined legislator could exploit these Constitutional provisions to block or limit government decisions, influence appointments and force reconsideration of policies.During its annual four-month sessions the Assembly conducted public debates.

A long-standing resentment between the German states and the Swiss Confederation led to heated debate over how much Zwingli owed his ideas to Lutheranism. The German Prince Philip of Hesse saw potential in creating an alliance between Zwingli and Luther. A meeting was held in his castle in 1529, now known as the Colloquy of Marburg, which has become infamous for its failure. The two men could not come to any agreement due to their disputation over one key doctrine.

In the South Seas, a volcano explodes, eventually causing North Pole icebergs to shift. Below the melting polar ice caps, a 200-foot-long praying mantis, trapped in the ice for millions of years, begins to stir. Soon after, the military personnel at Red Eagle One, a military station in northern Canada that monitors information gathered from the Distant Early Warning Line, realize that the men at one of their outposts are not responding to calls. Commanding officer Col. Joe Parkman flies there to investigate, and finds the post destroyed, its men gone, and giant slashes left in the snow outside. When a radar blip is sighted, Joe sends his pilots out to investigate, but their intended target disappears. Soon an Air Force plane is attacked by the deadly mantis. He searches the wreckage, and this time, in addition to the huge slashes, finds a five-foot-long pointed object in the snow. He takes it to General Mark Ford at the Continental Air Defense in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Ford gathers top scientists, including Professor Anton Gunther, to examine the object, but when they cannot identify it, Gunther recommends calling in Dr. Nedrick Jackson, a paleontologist at the Museum of Natural History. When Ned gets the call from Ford, he is helping museum magazine editor Marge Blaine plan her next issue, and dodges her questions as she begs him for a big scoop. Later, after examining the object, Ned recognizes it as a torn-off spur from an insect's leg, and soon guesses, from evidence that the creature ate human flesh, that it must be a gigantic praying mantis. Meanwhile, in the Arctic, the people of an Eskimo village spot the mantis in the sky, and although they hurry to their boats to escape, it swoops down and kills several men.

The Tower of Hanoi is a classic problem-solving task that involves moving a stack of disks of varying sizes from one peg to another, with certain rules to follow. The task allows the individual to demonstrate a range of physical reasoning skills, including problem-solving, planning, spatial reasoning, and the ability to understand and manipulate various physical objects. Here's a detailed explanation of the puzzle and the skills it tests: The Tower of Hanoi puzzle consists of three pegs (or rods) and a number of disks of different sizes, which can slide onto any peg. The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one peg, with the smallest disk at the top, making a conical shape. The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another peg, following these three rules: 1. Only one disk can be moved at a time. 2. Each move consists of taking the top disk from one of the stacks and placing it on the top of another stack or an empty peg. 3. No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk. Testing Physical Reasoning Skills: 1. Problem-Solving: To complete the Tower of Hanoi, the individual must find a sequence of moves that successfully moves the entire stack to another peg while following the rules. This requires identifying the relationships between the disks and pegs, as well as foreseeing the outcomes of each move to avoid dead ends. 2. Planning: The Tower of Hanoi puzzle requires strategic planning. The individual must plan a series of moves ahead of time to optimize the solution for the given number of disks. This often involves devising a specific algorithm for completing the task efficiently. Additionally, the problem becomes more complex as the number of disks increases, requiring more advanced planning. 3. Spatial Reasoning: Spatial reasoning is an essential skill when working with the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. The individual must mentally visualize the positions of the disks on the pegs and keep track of these positions throughout the problem-solving process. Spatial reasoning is also critical for predicting the results of potential moves and understanding how each move affects the overall task. 4. Manipulation of Physical Objects: Manipulating the disks and pegs in the Tower of Hanoi puzzle is a physical task that requires precise manual dexterity. The individual must be able to move the disks with accuracy, as well as understand any possible constraints or limitations that the physical objects may impose, such as the size and weight of the disks. In summary, the Tower of Hanoi puzzle is an excellent task to test one's ability to perform physical reasoning. The puzzle requires a wide range of skills, including problem-solving, planning, spatial reasoning, and the manipulation of physical objects. Furthermore, the difficulty of the task can be easily adjusted by changing the number of disks, making it a versatile and challenging assessment of physical reasoning abilities."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: If you visited the Getty Center in July or early August, you may have encountered a group of high school students wearing white lab coats with “Teen Lab” splattered across the back. You might have spotted them testing kinetic sculptures made from recycled materials, sketching in front of artworks in the galleries, or taking Polaroid self-portraits inspired by David Hockney’s photocollages. Online, you may have seen the playful social media stories they created to share their experiments with artistic and scientific processes. The teens were participants in the Getty Teen Lab, a four-week paid internship for high school students. Supported by a generous grant from the Vera R. Campbell Foundation, Teen Lab was the first of several teen-focused initiatives that the J. Paul Getty Museum is launching in 2017 and 2018. The Getty’s Education Department developed Teen Lab in response to several seemingly disconnected questions that many art museums are grappling with today: How can we engage diverse youth in meaningful ways? How can museums help meet the rising demand for K-12 curriculum that integrates Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math (STEAM)? Can art museums themselves be sites for STEAM learning? To address these questions, we looked at other teen programs and discovered that the most successful models are those that give teens agency and a voice in the museum.(1) For example, many museums have teen councils that program events for their peers or offer opportunities for students to collaborate on projects with artists.(2) The Getty wanted to build on these models by empowering teens to be active creators of educational content. In keeping with this goal, we designed the program using the project-based learning approach, which develops skills and knowledge by inviting students to explore solutions to authentic, real-world problems.

Call her R. R was from an Eastern European country. We chit-chatted a lot, while she was taking my blood pressure readings and stuff. Lots of fun stories! But she relayed to me one of her first U.S. memories: She wanted to lose weight. She was impressed by some things the U.S. had to offer - \\"you have actual nutritional information on everything!\\" - and thus figured everything she encountered was on the level. And she found a \\"miracle cure\\" company who was along those lines! \\"These are AWESOME miracle shoe inserts!

And maybe the person who said do unto others means he would want someone to preach to him about Christianity would feel a WEE bit different if he were being preached to about Jewish or Hindu or Buddhist theology. Sorry, but nobody with a genuine belief likes to have someone else's belief shoved down his throat. Too bad more so-called Christians don't get that idea. A:","response":"The given review would most likely decrease the chances of buying the product. The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with the content, calling it unoriginal and tiresome, and criticizes the evangelistic approach taken by the book."},{"question":"Zombie Nation 2004 R Hey, I was bored. I looked in my Comcastic little box to find a movie to watch. Zombie Nation? Hey, I love zombie movies. Says the filmmaker has some sort of cult following in the description. Funny how it doesn't warn me not to watch this film. I could've used that advice. Zombie Nation is just like Troll 2 in that it's completely misnamed. It has little (if anything, depending on your point of view) to do with zombies, and takes place all within one city. This film revolves around a crooked cop, who acts as badly as possible (he has to be trying to suck this much), while he arrests women for trivial bullshit and then kills them. Yup, he's a serial killer cop. Not only is this film flawed in thinking that it's a zombie flick, it also gets its serial killer facts completely wrong. Serial killers enjoy killing, they live for it and they get down and personal with it. This guy knocks out the women, and injects them with some poison. He doesn't even have sex with the corpse or dismember it. Talk about boring! Eventually, one of the whopping five women he kills has Voodoo protection done to her and for no apparent reason, all five come back to life and head off to kill this guy. They were all buried or tossed into the ocean, but you wouldn't know it buy the sharp clean clothes they're all wearing. The women then act very poorly and take their revenge. Oh yay. This film was crap in every category. Crap acting, crap writing, crappier sets, and crappier make-up effects. The women don't look zombie-like, unless you count really dark make-up around the eyes to be the de facto definition of what makes a zombie. They can all talk, behave, think, and act perfectly human. The gore is weak compared to even many PG-13 films and the nudity is beyond brief. You see glimpse of breasts in the opening sequence... Then the exact same breasts later! Go figure. Guess only one actress was willing to go topless for this trite. The police station is so badly constructed that you can see where they stopped painting the walls of the warehouse they're obviously filming in. You can see the pipes and the bad lighting and the overly sparse set-up and even, unless you are blind, you can see the director failing. Steer clear, it's a waste of time. 1/10 How would you describe the sentiment of this review?","response":"The sentiment of this review is highly negative. The reviewer strongly dislikes the movie, criticizing its acting, writing, sets, make-up effects, and overall quality. They also express disappointment in the lack of gore, nudity, and the film's failure to accurately represent zombies or serial killers. The review ends with a warning to potential viewers to steer clear of the movie as it's a waste of time."},{"question":"If the average (arithmetic mean) of the four numbers K, 3K + 3, 3K – 4 and 5K + 1 is 60, what is the value of K? Options: (A) 11 (B) 15 3/4 (C) 20 (D) 23 (E) 25 3/10 Hmmm, my stream of consciousness:","response":"To find the value of K, we first need to understand the problem. We are given the average (arithmetic mean) of the four numbers and need to calculate the value of K. The formula for the arithmetic mean (average) is: ( Sum of the numbers ) / ( Number of items ) In this case, the sum of the four numbers is: K + (3K + 3) + (3K - 4) + (5K + 1) And the number of items (numbers) is 4. We are also given that the average of these numbers is 60. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: ( K + (3K + 3) + (3K - 4) + (5K + 1) ) / 4 = 60 Now we need to solve for K. First, let's simplify the equation by removing the parentheses: ( K + 3K + 3 + 3K - 4 + 5K + 1) / 4 = 60 Now let's combine like terms: (12K + 0) / 4 = 60 Now divide by 4 to isolate the K term: 12K = 240 Divide both sides by 12: K = 20 So, the value of K is 20, which corresponds to option (C)."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a sentence in the English language and your task is to convert it into the Hindi language.

Answer: The Orphan Drug Act provides incentives and benefits to companies developing drugs for rare diseases, also known as orphan diseases, which affect fewer than 200,000 patients in the United States, or larger populations in certain circumstances. These incentives are necessary because the medical research and development of drugs for such diseases is financially disadvantageous, often due to the smaller patient populations.

The harsh reality now looms that those initial feelings of hope and excitement will forever be replaced by an unflagging sense of disappointment and regret after witnessing this horrid excuse of a cinematic experience. To start, let's dissect the convoluted and vexatious plotline, which boasts an incredible feat of amalgamating every cliché known to man into one catastrophic mess. The story follows our anti-hero protagonist, Jack Steel, as he uncovers a nefarious corporation's plot to poison the world's water supply for profit. As if this premise isn't stale enough, the writers still felt it necessary to integrate every predictable genre trope, including an estranged brother as the villain, the damsel-in-distress love interest, and the rogue government agent who supposedly has our hero's back. This lazy, lackluster storytelling did nothing but underscore the movie's inane attempts at generating suspense and tension, ultimately leaving the audience begging for a conclusion that, needless to say, arrives far too late. Next, it's essential to discuss the disastrous and wooden performances put forth by the otherwise extraordinary cast. Leading man Tom Linx, who has been known to carry films on his back through sheer talent and charm, appears lost in this role, lacking his usual charisma and energy. Linx's palpable disinterest culminates in his cookie-cutter final confrontation with his on-screen brother, creating a scene that's not only contrived but downright cringe-worthy. Of course, Linx bears some responsibility for the film's failure, but the blame must also fall on the director, Alan Daresmith, who shatters any semblance of competent filmmaking with his misguided vision for Beyond Redemption. Pathetic performances aside, perhaps one of the film's most grievous offenses lies in its inability to define a consistent tone. Despite the filmmakers' best attempts to inject humor into this calamitous adventure, the jokes fall flat time and time again, leaving the audience in a state of confusion as to whether the whole affair should be treated as intentional comedy or taken seriously as a dramatic thriller. In the midst of this puzzling tonal rollercoaster, the film stumbles through its over-reliance on special effects, creating a jarring and disorienting viewing experience. Notwithstanding the film's substantial budget, the poorly-executed CGI detracts from any semblance of immersion and makes one wonder whether their wallets were better off with a little less padding. Finally, to call the soundtrack uninspired would be an overstatement. The film's audio backdrop features an indistinct and forgettable score, seemingly crafted by pulling sound samples out of a dime store bargain bin and arranging them with all the finesse of an inebriated orangutan. Adding to the film's many layers of mediocrity, the soundtrack's failings deliver yet another underwhelming aspect that left audiences checking their watches, yearning for the sweet release of an ending that grows increasingly elusive. In conclusion, Beyond Redemption sets the bar for how low a film can sink. With its tired plot and characters, abysmal acting, tonal inconsistencies, and unbearable soundtrack, it doesn't merely misfire – it is a veritable train wreck that takes viewers hostage for an agonizing, two-hour ride. The filmmakers might have aimed for a blockbuster, but instead, they achieved a textbook example of how not to make a movie. For the sake of your taste buds and sanity, spare yourself from this toxic cocktail of ineptitude and let this film rot in the annals of film history."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: You are considering whether to buy a product.

When Gale Sayers (Mekhi Phifer) joins the Chicago Bears in 1965, the running back is befriended by fellow rookie Brian Piccolo (Sean Maher), a brash young man whose personality is the exact opposite of stoic Sayers. As their friendship begins, the two compete for starting positions on the team, but Sayers' talent far outshines Piccolo's and he quickly rises to top of the game. When they become roomates, their friendship deepens, and when Sayers injures his knee it is Piccolo who encourages him to get back in shape and back in the game--if only so Piccolo can compete against him on an even playing field.

The Angevin kings had three main sources of income available to them, namely revenue from their personal lands, or demesne; money raised through their rights as a feudal lord; and revenue from taxation. Revenue from the royal demesne was inflexible and had been diminishing slowly since the Norman conquest. Matters were not helped by Richard's sale of many royal properties in 1189, and taxation played a much smaller role in royal income than in later centuries. English kings had widespread feudal rights which could be used to generate income, including the scutage system, in which feudal military service was avoided by a cash payment to the king. He derived income from fines, court fees and the sale of charters and other privileges. John intensified his efforts to maximise all possible sources of income, to the extent that he has been described as \\"avaricious, miserly, extortionate and moneyminded\\". John also used revenue generation as a way of exerting political control over the barons: debts owed to the crown by the king's favoured supporters might be forgiven; collection of those owed by enemies was more stringently enforced.

I'll choose \\"jumped\\" as the verb because it is a common action associated with cats and it adds some action to the sentence. Step 3: Introduce an object or additional information for context. I'll choose \\"on the table\\" as the additional information because it provides a destination for the action being performed by the subject. Step 4: Put the subject, verb, and additional information together to form a coherent sentence. The final sentence is: \\"The cat jumped on the table.\\" This sentence provides a clear subject performing an action with a specified destination, making it a complete and understandable English sentence."},{"question":"Kai took Casey to school then drove to the store for groceries.

Step 2: Checking for grammatical correctness The subject of the main clause is \\"Heidi,\\" and the verb is \\"said.\\" The subject of the subordinate clause is \\"pictures,\\" and the verb is \\"were.\\" All subjects and verbs are in agreement, and the sentence follows proper syntax. Step 3: Examining the usage of pronouns The pronoun \\"herself\\" is a reflexive pronoun that refers back to the antecedent \\"Heidi.\\" While some may argue that \\"her\\" could be a more appropriate possessive pronoun in this context, using \\"herself\\" emphasizes Heidi's personal connection and emotional reaction to the pictures. Step 4: Assessing sentence clarity and meaning The sentence is clear in conveying its meaning, which is that Heidi feels embarrassed by pictures of herself. From the analysis, I would conclude that this sentence is linguistically acceptable. A linguist might consider it acceptable as well based on its grammatical correctness, appropriate pronoun usage, and clear meaning, although the choice of using \\"herself\\" over \\"her\\" may be subject to some debate."},{"question":"Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Where people are more at risk of mental retardation, coastal area or inland? People in the coastal area naturally get more iodide from food items because the soil has more iodized salt. But farther we go inland, the soil lacks necessary iodine. As a result, inland population do not get enough iodine naturally. Hint: Before iodized salt was developed, some people experienced a number of developmental difficulties, including problems with thyroid gland function and mental retardation. In the 1920s, we learned that these conditions could usually be treated easily with the addition of iodide anion to the diet. One easy way to increase iodide intake was to add the anion to table salt. This simple step greatly enhanced health and development. Large amounts of iodide ion are also found in seaweed such as kelp (see picture above) and saltwater fish.

World opinion begins to turn against robotics, leading to the U.N. declaring a unilateral ban on further research in 2067. Japan, being home to robotics pioneer Daiwa Heavy Industries, strongly protests this ban, but is unable to prevent its passage. In protest, Japan withdraws from international politics. All foreigners are deported, and further immigration is prohibited. In addition, the R.A.C.E. network is constructedÂ â 270 off-shore installations that cover Japan with an energy field, nullifying all communication with the outside world and making satellite surveillance impossible. Trade and diplomacy continues, but Japan vanishes from the world scene.

You may find it best to get out and work or study among people, sitting at a coffee shop or cafe, or you may find that unbearable and distracting. Likewise, the best place for you might be in your living room, seated at your writing desk, or you may find the call of the Xbox way too tempting. Try to identify your tendencies toward distraction and create an environment that eliminates those distractions. Take a day and Try to write down everything that distracts you. If you're supposed to be studying and you click on Facebook instead, write that down. If you should be working on a paper and you're playing guitar, write that down. If you're supposed to be listening in class and you're daydreaming about your boyfriend, write that down. At the end of the day, look at your distraction habits. When you get down to work tomorrow, Try to create a space where you'll eliminate those distractions. Close your browser while you study, or go somewhere without wireless. Put the guitar in the basement, or leave the house. Put away your cellphone and stop texting the dreamboat. They'll all still be there when you've got free time. Sometimes, there's just no way around it: something will distract you from your work. Even if you've gone to the perfect spot in the library where it's quiet, where you can get work done, where it's perfect, and suddenly, the old guy reading old New York Times papers starts barfing up a lung at the desk next to you. What do you do? Two options: Leave. If the distractions are insufferable, don't overreact, and don't sit there stewing and wasting time. Get up, pack up your things, and find a less distracting corner of the library. Ignore it. Plug in your headphones and cue up some ambient music and drown out the distracting wheezing from the other people, or just focus in on your reading to such a degree that you don't notice it. He's not trying to annoy you on purpose. Get on with it. Sometimes it seems like the browser window is designed to ruin your life. The distance between your English paper and a rabbit hole of old wrestling videos and emails from your girlfriend is just in an adjacent tab. You don't even have to close out of your paper! If you can afford to do it, stay offline while you're working. Put your phone away, turn your Wi-Fi off and get to work. If you struggle to work on a computer, or you need the Internet to do your job, head yourself off at the pass. Block the websites you find the most distracting by using a program like Anti-Social, or download a time-restriction software that will only allow you to use the internet as set times. In between, you'll be in charge, not the evil vortex called YouTube. . One of the most distracting things can be dwelling on all the stuff that's crashing down on you: work, school, relationships. Something's gotta give! When you prioritize those items, however, you can control them, working through them and accomplishing them in order of importance and deadlines. Make good friends with the \\"to-do\\" list and stick to it as close as possible! Pick one thing at a time to work on, and keeping working on that one thing until it's done completely. You can't do two things at once, can you? Check your list for possibilities to double up and make your day more efficient. Need to study up for a math exam AND do the laundry? Review your notes at the laundromat and cross them both off your list, keeping up with home commitments and schoolwork. The most debilitating distraction has nothing to do with YouTube, Facebook, or the animated couple chattering next to you in the coffee shop; it's got to do with you. Our minds can be like keyed-up lizards bouncing around a rubber room, and it's everything we can do to get them to sit still and do what we say. No matter where you work, what you've got going on today, and what you need to work on, it's you who has to make the decision to do it. Calm your mind and get busy. Nobody's stopping you but you. Try meditating in the mornings, or doing some deep-breathing exercises to center yourself when you start feeling overwhelmed. People who have trouble concentrating have a tendency to spiral into different levels of distraction, making it worse rather than pulling themselves out of it. Reverse the cycle by learning to anticipate it and chill out.","response":"To summarize, finding the ideal place to concentrate can vary greatly for each individual. In order to optimize your focus, it is essential to identify your tendencies towards distractions and create an environment that minimizes them. Experiment with different locations to see where you are most productive. Be aware of your habits and develop strategies to eliminate distractions, including blocking or restricting access to specific websites or putting away your electronic devices while working. Additionally, don't be afraid to leave a distracting environment and move to a different location when necessary. Prioritizing tasks by creating to-do lists and focusing on one task at a time can also be beneficial in managing distractions from work, school, or personal life. Finally, the biggest obstacle in concentrating could be yourself. To improve focus, consider implementing mindfulness techniques such as meditation and deep-breathing exercises to calm your thoughts and concentrate on the task at hand. Develop a proactive approach to anticipate distractions and learn how to stay centered and productive throughout the day."},{"question":"If or think about looking at the mountains you got to throw in a dollar, can we conclude that \\"To look at the mountains longer, you'll have to pay more money.\\"?

Stream of consciousness reasoning: Firstly, let's consider the most common non-renewable energy sources, such as coal, natural gas, and oil. These sources are known to produce significant amounts of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, while getting depleted at the same time. Greenhouse gas emissions contribute to global climate change, which causes problems like more frequent and severe weather events, rising sea levels, and ecosystem disruptions. Now, let's look at renewable energy sources like solar and wind power. Both of them rely on natural processes and do not emit greenhouse gases during energy production. Solar panels capture sunlight and convert it into electricity, while wind turbines harness the wind's kinetic energy to create electricity. These energy sources are also much cleaner as they do not emit pollutants that are harmful to human health. Moreover, solar and wind power technologies have been improving rapidly, leading to increased efficiency and lower costs. This makes them more affordable and attractive for widespread adoption. By replacing non-renewable energy sources with renewables, we can significantly reduce our carbon footprint and dependence on finite resources. In addition, renewable energy sources can stimulate local economies by creating jobs and encouraging investment in new industries. By developing a low-carbon economy, countries can be better prepared to handle future challenges posed by climate change. Lastly, renewables like solar and wind energy are sustainable, meaning they can be used indefinitely without running out. This ensures that future generations can continue to benefit from clean energy sources and enjoy a better quality of life. Taking all these factors into account, it is evident that switching to renewable energy sources like solar and wind power has considerable environmental benefits.

Now, a new study find the years of little or no rain is taking a heavy toll on the state’s forests. The researchers at Stanford University’s Carnegie Institution for Science concluded that up to 58 million large trees in California experienced water loss that could be life threatening since 2011 due to the state's historic drought. Coupled with higher temperatures and insect outbreaks including from the destructive bark beetle, the drought is increasing the risk of the trees dying that would usher in widespread changes in these ecosystems. Related: When the wells run dry: California drought forcing some families to live in 'Third-World-type conditions \\"California relies on its forests for water provisioning and carbon storage, as well as timber products, tourism, and recreation, so they are tremendously important ecologically, economically, and culturally,\\" Carnegie’s Gregory Asner, a lead author on the study that appeared in the in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. \\"The drought put the forests in tremendous peril, a situation that may cause long-term changes in ecosystems that could impact animal habitats and biodiversity.\\" The team's advanced tools showed that about 41,000 square miles of forest containing up to 888 million large trees experienced measurable change in the amount of water stored in the canopy of the trees between 2011 and 2015. Of this group, up to 58 million large trees covering 3,861 square miles reached water loss thresholds that the scientists deemed extremely threatening to long-term forest health. To get an accurate picture of the tree’s health, Asner and his team used the laser-guided, imaging spectrometer – to measure the mass of the water in the canopy – that was mounted on the Carnegie Airborne Observatory (CAO). They combined the data from the CAO, which is directed by Asner, with traditional satellite data going back to 2011. Related: California drought could doom endangered fish caught in the center of state's water battles \\"The Carnegie Airborne Observatory's research provides invaluable insight into the severity of drought impacts in California's iconic forests. It will be important to bring their cutting-edge data and expertise to bear as the state seeks to address the effects of this epidemic of dying trees and aid in the recovery of our forests,\\" Ashley Conrad-Saydah, deputy secretary for climate policy at the California Environmental Protection Agency, said in a statement. Anthony Ambrose, a tree biologist at UC Berkeley who did not participate in the study but has researched the impact of the drought on giant sequoias, said the latest findings are “significant because it's the first to utilize high-resolution airborne data to assess and map forest conditions throughout the entire state.” Related: Historic California drought stressing Giant Sequoias, scientists say “The study documents substantial decreases in canopy water content over time,” he told FoxNews.com by email. “The current drought in California has contributed to substantial tree mortality, a trend that will certainly continue into the future. Increasing temperatures will continue to stress trees and forests of the state in the future, and having the ability to periodically monitor forest conditions over large spatial scales is important,” he said. “This information will be extremely useful for both public and private forestland managers in their decision-making process, e.g., for prioritizing areas for prescribed fire or mechanical thinning to reduce competition for water and decrease fire risk.” So far, the hardest hit tree species have been pine including sugar pine and certain types of oaks. Giant Sequoias are doing fine, Asner said, while their research found a mixed picture for coastal redwoods – some south of San Francisco have fared poorly while those in Northern California are doing better Related: Monster El Nino expected to shape this winter's weather “If we have recurring drought and it comes back strong after the El Nino, we predict we are going to have a lot more tree mortality,” Asner said of the weather pattern which is expected to be one of the strongest of its kind in history and bring much needed rain to California in the coming months. “If drought persists and we lose forest, it will be replaced with something. Typically when forests get too dry and they die off, usually shrub lands and grasslands do the replacing,” he said. “That means a major shift in the biodiversity of the system because there are a lot of species that live in forest and not in shrub lands or grasslands. The whole region could undergo a major shift.” Related: California cuts water use amid drought Not only would many animal species suffer but the state would lose a key source for storing carbon and water from snow packs as well as the economic benefits that come from logging and tourism. Thus, the state is going to have to consider managing these forests much differently, Asner said, including how it fights fires and sets prescribed burns. “There are many issues with losing these forests,” he said. “It isn’t about biodiversity but about water services, carbon sequestration, fire flammability … We can’t stop a drought but the measurements we are making today, the maps we are making today are a key way forward for managers to adjust how they manage these forests.” Write a one or two sentence summary.","response":"California's drought is causing trees in the state to experience heavy water loss, which can be life-threatening to the trees and lead to long-term changes in ecosystems that could impact animal habitats and biodiversity.

It is an important concept in decision theory. In order to compare the different decision outcomes, one commonly assigns a utility value to each of them. If there is uncertainty as to what the outcome will be, then under the von Neumann–Morgenstern axioms the optimal decision maximizes the expected utility (a probability–weighted average of utility over all possible outcomes of a decision). Now, I have a new situation: John and Keith are playing a decision making game. They have three decisions to make decision A, decision B, and decision C. Decision A and decision B have certain outcome, but decision C's outcome is uncertain. John would apply optimal decision making process while Keith would rather rely on his hunches. Answer this question please: Who would most likely assign a utility value to each of the decisions, John or keith? Answer:","response":"Based on the background information provided, it is clear that John would be the one to most likely assign a utility value to each of the decisions. This is because John is described as following the optimal decision-making process, which relies upon comparing the outcomes of different decisions using a defined utility value. The optimal decision-making process is rooted in decision theory, which is a structured approach to making choices among different options. In John's case, he will strive to make decisions that lead to the best known or expected outcome when compared to all other available decision options (decision A, decision B, and decision C, in this situation). By assigning a utility value to each decision, John is able to quantify the desirability or preference for each outcome and weigh them against one another to identify the optimal choice. For decision A and decision B, which have certain outcomes, John would be able to directly assess the utility values associated with those outcomes. However, for decision C, which has an uncertain outcome, John would apply the expected utility approach under the von Neumann-Morgenstern axioms. This entails calculating a probability-weighted average of utility across all possible outcomes associated with decision C. By doing so, John is able to incorporate the element of uncertainty into his decision-making process, thereby adhering to the principles of the optimal decision-making theory. On the other hand, Keith is described as relying on his hunches, which indicates that he does not follow a structured, logical approach to decision-making but rather bases his choices on intuition or gut feelings. Consequently, it can be inferred that Keith would be less likely to assign a utility value to each decision, as this process would involve a more systematic and analytical approach to determining preferences and weighing alternatives. In conclusion, given the information provided, John would be the one most likely to assign a utility value to each of the decisions in the described situation, due to his adherence to the optimal decision-making process."},{"question":"The victim was to take stand today, they were going to do what?

I'm as much of a man as you are, my dear.","response":"The given sentence, \\"I'm as much of a man as you are, my dear,\\" is both syntactically and semantically acceptable. Let's analyze the components of this sentence to understand why it is well-structured and meaningful. 1. Syntax: Syntax refers to the arrangement of words and phrases to create well-formed sentences in a language. Examining syntax involves observing grammar, sentence structure, and the use of linguistic elements. The sentence follows the Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) structure: Subject: I Verb: am (the contracted form \\"I'm\\" includes the subject and the verb) Object: as much of a man as you are Furthermore, we can break down the syntax of the sentence into the following key elements: - Clause: \\"I'm as much of a man as you are\\" (where the comparison is made between the subject and object) - Appellation: \\"my dear\\" (a term used to address or refer to someone in an endearing manner) Additionally, the sentence uses the comparative structure \\"as... as\\" to create a clear and accurate comparison between the subjects. In conclusion, the syntax of the sentence is correct and well-structured, making each component understandable and effectively conveying the intended message. 2. Semantics: Semantics is the study of meaning in language. It deals with the interpretation of words, phrases and sentences in context. When evaluating a sentence for semantic acceptability, it is crucial to ensure that the concepts presented are logically coherent and meaningful. In the given sentence, the speaker is using a comparison to make a statement about their own qualities and the qualities of the person they are addressing. In this scenario, \\"as much of a man\\" implies that the speaker possesses equal attributes typically associated with being a man, to the same degree as the person being addressed. The appellation \\"my dear\\" could be interpreted in a variety of contextual ways, such as endearment, sarcasm, or a form of politeness. Nevertheless, this term adds depth to the interpersonal relationship between the speaker and the person being addressed. Semantically, the sentence is acceptable because it conveys a comprehensible and logical meaning. The meaning imbued within the words and phrases work together cohesively, expressing a clear and relevant idea. In summary, the sentence \\"I'm as much of a man as you are, my dear\\" is both syntactically and semantically acceptable, as it presents a well-formed structure and a coherent, meaningful message. When understood within the context of a conversation or situation, this sentence can engage readers or listeners effectively while maintaining proper syntax and semantics."},{"question":"Question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context.

What is the common name for the fruit Fragaria vesca?","response":"Fragaria vesca, commonly known as wild strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant species belonging to the Rosaceae family. The wild strawberry is native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, Asia, and North America. It is also referred to by several other names, including woodland strawberry, alpine strawberry, European strawberry, or fraisier des bois which is French for \\"strawberries of the woods.\\" Wild strawberries are smaller in size compared to the garden strawberries (Fragaria × ananassa) that we typically see in supermarkets or grow in our gardens. The fruits produced by the wild strawberry plant are red, juicy, and fragrant, although generally smaller than the commercially cultivated varieties. They typically measure about 1-2 centimeters or 0.4-0.8 inches in diameter, with a conical or rounded shape. The taste of wild strawberries is often considered superior to that of cultivated strawberries, as they possess a more intense, sweet, and aromatic flavor. These tiny, flavorful fruits have been consumed by humans for centuries and were even used by the ancient Romans for their medicinal properties, including as a remedy for digestive problems, kidney stones, and fevers. Wild strawberry plants have trifoliate leaves, which means they have three leaflets per leaf. The leaves possess a serrated edge and are attached to the plant via a long petiole. They are usually dark green on the upper surface, and a paler, slightly hairy underside. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers which give rise to the small, red fruits. Apart from their delicious taste, wild strawberries are a great source of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, including vitamin C, manganese, potassium, and folate. They are also rich in various phytochemicals that provide potential health benefits, such as quercetin and ellagic acid, which may help prevent chronic diseases and support cardiovascular health. Wild strawberries can be found growing in various habitats, including meadows, clearings, woodland edges, and rocky hillsides. They prefer well-drained, loamy soil and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade conditions. They are often foraged in the wild, or grown in home gardens as a ground cover or an ornamental plant for their attractive foliage and flowers, as well as for their tasty fruits.

With the world governing body’s election less than a month away, Maradona, one of the greatest players to ever grace the game and the inspiration behind Argentina’s 1986 World Cup victory, said the time was long overdue for Blatter to go. He said he would do all he could to help Prince Ali bin al-Hussein win the presidency, even though the 39-year-old Jordanian royal hinted on Monday he might consider pulling out of the contest if he thought one of the other two challengers could win. In a syndicated interview with Guillem Balague, the moderator at the Soccerex Asian Forum at the King Hussein convention centre, 60km from Amman, the Jordanian capital, Maradona pulled no punches and gave his backing to the Jordanian royal. Asked why he replied: “If I didn’t believe that he would be a good president, I wouldn’t be here. “As the football world knows, inside Fifa there is total anarchy, where there is only one man who decides everything. “But he knows absolutely nothing. Therefore it is time for a change. And it is so because even his colleagues should actually advise him to leave.“ Maradona, 54, who was voted along with Pelé the joint-best player of the 20th century by Fifa in 2000, said he believed that the continued presence of Blatter, who is seeking a fifth term as president, would harm football. “He has done a lot of damage to football since he has been there. It’s time for him to step aside and let us, who are full of strength, renovate football.“ Maradona played in the World Cups of 1982, 1986, 1990 and 1994 and later coached Argentina to the World Cup quarter-finals of 2010. He implied he was unhappy about the way things were done at Fifa, particularly regarding the choice of Russia and Qatar for the 2018 and 2022 World Cup finals. “First we didn’t know where the World Cup was going to be held. Then we found out that after Brazil it was Russia and then Qatar. “Without any doubt whatsoever Blatter is scared. Blatter is scared. He’s scared of being left out of his share of the cake. “That is what really annoys someone like me, who has played in four World Cups.

People heading to work in Chelyabinsk heard what sounded like an explosion, saw a bright light and then felt the shock wave. According to Russian space agency Roscosmos, the fireball, travelling at a speed of 30km per second, had burnt very brightly across the horizon, leaving a long white trail that could be seen as far as 200km away.

Dimple piercings are fairly risky since you are dealing with an area more prone to infection than most. If done right, though, dimple piercings can partially mimic the look of dimples. Keep the piercings if you want to permanently highlight the dimple area or take them out eventually so that the skin eventually heals, leaving behind a dimple-like indentation. Due to the risks involved with dimple piercing, some professionals do not offer them at all. Others may offer them but often refuse them to anyone under the age of 18, even if that individual has the permission of a legal guardian. Dimple piercings cut through muscle and usually cause some mild form of nerve damage. This nerve damage can help hold the dimples in place even after the piercing closes up, but it can also be risky and could do unforeseen harm. The professional piercer should clean the outside of your cheek and should also instruct you to clean the inside of your mouth before making the dimple piercings. The needle and jewelry should also be sterilized. The piercer will puncture both cheeks symmetrically, right at the spot where natural dimples would fall. Afterward, he or she will place a straight barbell or other piece of piercing jewelry into each hole to prevent it from closing immediately. Your dimple piercings will need to be cleaned multiple times a day with a saline solution to prevent infection from setting in. You can keep the dimple jewelry in permanently if desired, but you can usually take them out after three months have passed. If the piercing did the expected nerve damage, you should have an indentation in your cheek even after the skin heals over the original hole. If you want something that looks more natural and will last for the rest of your life, learn about a plastic surgery procedure that will create dimple-like marks in your cheeks. Cosmetic surgery can be costly and does come with its own set of risks, but this option will give you fake dimples that look more natural than many other methods can. A plastic surgeon will use local anesthesia for the procedure. He or she will make a small incision on the inside of the mouth and into the inner surface of the cheek. Using specialized tools, the surgeon will make an indentation in the cheek muscles and mucosal tissues. Afterward, the dimple divot will be held in place with internal stitches, and external stitches will be used to close the wound in the inner mouth. For larger dimples, a plastic surgeon may perform a punch tissue excision. During this procedure, a portion of the cheek muscle is completely removed, creating a deeper and more obvious indentation. In either case, the procedure will take an hour or less. You should expect some pain, swelling, and bruising immediately after the procedure. The area is also weak to infection afterward, so you will need to carefully and thoroughly follow any instructions provided by the surgeon concerning proper wound care and cleansing. For the first few weeks, your dimple-like indentations will be present at all times. Once your cheek muscles partially heal, though, you should only notice the marks when smiling.","response":"Dimple piercings, while risky due to potential infection and nerve damage, can create a dimple-like appearance, but plastic surgery offers a more natural-looking and permanent alternative."},{"question":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

But how do they float up there? Helpful Assistant: Good question! You know how sometimes when you blow up a balloon, it floats in the air? That's because the air inside the balloon is lighter than the air outside. The same thing happens with clouds. The tiny water droplets or ice crystals are so small and light that they can float in the sky. Little Timmy: Oh, I get it now! But why are some clouds white and others grey?

Given the context: What does Jordan need to do before this? Possible answers: decide to break up with Riley, let the other party know they were done with them, get a pen and sharpener Answer:","response":"Before reaching the point of giving Riley the breakup letter, Jordan would have had to undergo several preparatory and emotional steps. One of the first things Jordan would need to do is introspect and evaluate their feelings about the relationship. This is typically a long and arduous journey where Jordan would likely weigh the pros and cons of their relationship with Riley. During this process, Jordan may seek the advice of friends or family, or even a professional, such as a therapist, to help them understand their feelings better. The next step would be the most crucial one, deciding to end the relationship with Riley. This decision is not made haphily; it usually comes after long periods of consideration, understanding that the relationship is not salvageable or not conducive for personal growth and happiness. Getting clarity about their reasons for wanting to end the relationship and becoming resolute about the decision would be important in this stage. After Jordan has confirmed their decision to break up with Riley, they need to consider how to communicate this decision in a respectful way. In this case, Jordan has opted for a letter. This gives him the opportunity to express himself clearly and comprehensively without the immediate emotional reactions that may occur in face-to-face communication. Before writing the letter, Jordan might want to outline their thoughts so they can communicate their feelings and decision effectively. This period of planning can help Jordan sketch out what they want to convey. This could also involve seeking advice on how to break the news empathetically, ensuring the message gets across without inflicting excessive hurt on Riley. Next is the process of actually writing the letter, which would require some physical tools aside from the emotional readiness. Jordan would need to get a suitable writing instrument, such as a pen. The mention of a sharpener, however, seems to be irrelevant in this context because sharpeners are generally used for pencils, not pens. But if Jordan prefers to write the letter in pencil, a sharpener might be necessary. The task of writing this letter would require Jordan to be thoughtful and sensitive. Jordan must make it clear in the letter that they're breaking up with Riley, while also expressing compassion and respect for the feelings that Riley might have upon receiving the letter. So, to summarize, the most relevant steps Jordan would need to undertake before giving Riley the breakup letter are: self-reflection and evaluation of the relationship, making the decision to break up, planning how to communicate this decision, acquiring the necessary tools (like a pen), and composing the breakup letter. The mention of letting the other party know they were done with them is part of the act of giving the letter and serves as the culmination of these steps."},{"question":"Title: Eats Tapes Review: Nothing but trouble with this unit.

He was a founding member and leader of the blues-rock band Double Trouble. Commonly regarded as a driving force behind the revival of blues music in the 1980s, Vaughan's talent and influence on the genre remain undeniable. Sadly, Stevie Ray Vaughan's life and career came to an abrupt and tragic end on August 27, 1990, when he was involved in a devastating helicopter crash. Vaughan, along with four other passengers, boarded a Bell 206B Jet Ranger helicopter after performing at a concert in East Troy, Wisconsin. The helicopter was heading to Chicago, but unfortunately, due to poor visibility and foggy conditions, the pilot failed to see the rising terrain ahead and the aircraft crashed into the side of a ski hill shortly after takeoff. All five people on board, including Vaughan, were killed instantly, provoking widespread shock and grief within the music community and among Vaughan's fans. At the time of his death, Stevie Ray Vaughan was just 35 years old and seemed to be stepping into what might have been the most creative and productive phase of his career. Prior to the accident, Vaughan had been experiencing a renaissance both professionally and personally. He had finally overcome his long-standing drug and alcohol addiction issues, and his recent works were being met with critical acclaim. Many anticipated that his music would continue to reach new heights, and the tragedy of his death left a gaping hole in the music industry. Following the accident, there has been a surge of interest in Stevie Ray Vaughan's music, contributions, and legacy. Many artists have cited him as a significant influence on their work, and his status as a blues icon has only grown stronger over time.

Each of these factors plays a role in how much light the object reflects and how it appears to our eyes. 1. Color: The color of an object greatly influences its ability to reflect light. In general, lighter colored objects tend to reflect more light, while darker colored objects absorb more light. For instance, a white surface reflects light of all visible wavelengths while a black surface absorbs most of the light, reflecting very little. This is because the pigments or molecules in the object's material either absorb or reflect different wavelengths of light, determining the color we perceive. 2. Surface texture: The texture of an object's surface also affects the way light is reflected. A smooth, polished surface, like a mirror, reflects light in a well-defined, specular manner, leading to clear, sharp reflections. In contrast, rough or irregular surfaces scatter light in multiple directions, resulting in diffuse reflections. Diffuse reflections cause the object to appear more uniform and less shiny, as we cannot see sharp or clear reflections on such surfaces. 3. Material composition: The composition of an object can impact its ability to reflect light. Different materials have varying levels of reflectivity due to their atomic or molecular structure. Metals, for example, have high reflectivity because of their free electrons, which cause a collective oscillation of charges when the light interacts with the surface. This phenomenon, known as surface plasmon resonance, results in strong reflections. Non-metallic materials, such as dielectrics (e.g., glass, plastic, wood), generally exhibit lower reflectivity due to different absorption and reflection characteristics. 4. Incident light angle: The angle at which light strikes an object's surface can influence the amount of reflection that occurs. When light impacts a surface at a shallow angle (close to the surface), the reflection is more pronounced, as the light travels a longer path through the material, which increases the likelihood of reflecting off the surface. This is known as the Fresnel effect, and it is particularly noticeable on surfaces like water or glass. Conversely, light hitting a surface at a steeper angle (close to perpendicular) will penetrate deeper into the material and cause less reflection. 5. Index of refraction: The index of refraction of a material impacts the light reflection at the interface between two media. It is the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum to the speed of light in the material. When light passes from one medium to another with a different index of refraction, some of the light is reflected while the rest is transmitted. The higher the difference in the indices, the more reflected light there will be. In summary, an object's ability to reflect light is determined by its color, surface texture, material composition, incident light angle, and the index of refraction of the material. By understanding these factors, we can manipulate the properties of objects and materials to control the way they interact with light, ultimately impacting their appearance and potential applications."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Question: What is a person who is well educated?

He was around 6.3 and probably not the most tidily presented utility man I'd met, but I believed him to be genuine and willingly invited him in out of the foul weather. It was pouring down outside, a freezing cold winter's day. As I closed the door I remembered that I should have asked to see his company I.D. , so as I opened the meter cupboard and switched on the light, I politely said, 'Oops, I should have asked to see your I.D. if you don't mind?. He stood there in front of the door and made no move to produce his card or do anything in fact. He just glared down at me in the most menacing way and said in a very sinister voice 'Isn't it a little bit late for that now? What are you going to do if I tell you I don't have it?'. There was an embarrassed silence. He continued to stare down at me without making a move for what seemed like minutes but was probably seconds. He didn't produce his I.D., instead he almost grudgingly read the meter as I looked on and then he swiftly left without saying goodbye. I closed the door and locked it, and then took a while to get my pulse rate back to normal and to realise I'd just learned a very big lesson. Such a creepy individual, I didn't make that mistake again. Question: What did the utility man think of the author's request? Options: A. That the request is funny. B. That the request is insulting.

Other works that followed continued the composer's new-found seriousness, including many settings of Éluard's surrealist and humanist poems. In 1937 he composed his first major liturgical work, the Mass in G major for soprano and mixed choir a cappella, which has become the most frequently performed of all his sacred works. Poulenc's new compositions were not all in this serious vein; his incidental music to the play La Reine Margot, starring Yvonne Printemps, was pastiche 16th-century dance music, and became popular under the title Suite française. Music critics generally continued to define Poulenc by his light-hearted works, and it was not until the 1950s that his serious side was widely recognised.In 1936 Poulenc began giving frequent recitals with Bernac. At the École Normale in Paris they gave the premiere of Poulenc's Cinq poèmes de Paul Éluard. They continued to perform together for more than twenty years, in Paris and internationally, until Bernac's retirement in 1959. Poulenc, who composed 90 songs for his collaborator, considered him one of the \\"three great meetings\\" of his professional career, the other two being Éluard and Landowska. In Johnson's words, \\"for twenty-five years Bernac was Poulenc's counsellor and conscience\\", and the composer relied on him for advice not only on song-writing, but on his operas and choral music.Throughout the decade, Poulenc was popular with British audiences; he established a fruitful relationship with the BBC in London, which broadcast many of his works. With Bernac, he made his first tour of Britain in 1938. His music was also popular in America, seen by many as \\"the quintessence of French wit, elegance and high spirits\\". In the last years of the 1930s, Poulenc's compositions continued to vary between serious and light-hearted works. Quatre motets pour un temps de pénitence (Four Penitential Motets, 1938–39) and the song \\"Bleuet\\" (1939), an elegiac meditation on death, contrast with the song cycle Fiançailles pour rire (Light-Hearted Betrothal), which recaptures...

At his first observation in December 1612, Neptune was almost stationary in the sky because it had just turned retrograde that day. This apparent backward motion is created when Earth's orbit takes it past an outer planet. Because Neptune was only beginning its yearly retrograde cycle, the motion of the planet was far too slight to be detected with Galileo's small telescope.

The study, published in the journal Psychological Services and conducted by Meyran Boniel-Nissim and Azy Barak, psychology professors at the University of Haifa, Israel, found the contact with an online community through a blog made it more effective in relieving the writer's social anxiety than a private diary would be. To track teenagers' experiences with blogging, the researchers randomly surveyed high school students in Israel and selected 161 of them who exhibited some level of social anxiety or stress.The teenagers, who averaged 15 years old, said they had difficulty making new friends or relating to their existing friends. The teenagers were divided into six groups.The first two groups were asked to blog about their social difficulties, with one group asked to open their posts to comments.The second two groups were asked to blog about whatever struck their adolescent fancy; again, with one group allowing comments.All four groups were told to write in their blogs at least twice a week.As a control, two more groups were told to keep either an old-fashioned print diary or to do nothing at all.

In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer.

Do you know who the President of the United States is? That's right! It's Donald Trump. He's a very important person and sometimes he talks about things that grown-ups care about. Today, we will learn about something new that President Trump talked about - waterboarding. Waterboarding is a way of making someone talk when they don't want to. It can be a bit scary for the person it's happening to. People put a cloth over that person's face and pour water on it, which makes it hard for them to breathe. Many grown-ups think this is not okay to do, but some believe it can help get important information from people who don't want to share it. Let's think of it like this - imagine you have two friends who don't get along, and one is bullying the other. Instead of being friendly to help solve the problem, they both choose to be mean to each other. This is similar to President Trump's idea of \\"fighting fire with fire.\\" He means that sometimes, you might need to use the same tough actions to deal with a difficult situation. Now, President Trump has said that he thinks waterboarding works. He believes that using this method might help protect people and his country, just like putting out a big fire by using another fire.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to safely remove lenses from glasses: 1. Gather the necessary tools: Ensure you have the following items at hand. - Microfiber cloth - Water - Dish soap or lens cleaning solution (optional) - A flat working surface - A plastic bowl (optional) 2. Clean the glasses: Using a microfiber cloth, gently wipe away any smudges or dirt from the lenses and frames. This step is crucial because any residual debris may scratch your lenses during removal. 3. Apply heat to the lenses: Heating the lenses can help soften the frame material, making it more pliable and easier to remove the lenses. There are a few ways you can do this: a. Use a hairdryer: Aim the hairdryer at the frame around the lens, keeping it about 6 - 8 inches away, and heat for 20-30 seconds. Be careful not to overheat the frames. b. Dip the frame in warm water: Fill a plastic bowl with warm water and a few drops of dish soap or lens cleaning solution. Submerge the frame and lenses in the water for 2-3 minutes. Ensure the water is not too hot, as this could damage the coating on the lenses or warp the frame. 4. Prepare the working surface: Spread a soft, clean cloth on a flat, sturdy surface. This will help protect your lenses and provide grip while removing them. 5. Locate the groove: Examine the frame where the lens meets the frame's edge. Most eyeglasses have a small groove where the lens fits into the frame. Note: Some high-end or sports frames might have a slightly different system, in which case consult your eyeglass manufacturer's guidelines. 6. Removing lenses from a full-frame glasses: a. Start at a corner: Position your thumbs near a corner of the lens, firmly pressing against the inner side of the lens, while gripping the frame with your fingers on the outside. b. Press gently and evenly: Apply gentle pressure to the lens, pushing it out of the groove and away from the frame. Keep the pressure smooth and consistent to avoid breaking the lens or frame. Do not force the lens out; if it's not coming out easily, repeat step 3 to apply more heat. c. Work around the lens: Continue to apply pressure around the lens perimeter, gradually working around the entire lens until it pops out of the frame. 7. Removing lenses from a half-frame or rimless glasses: For these types of frames, the lenses are usually held in place by a nylon cord or a small screw. a. For nylon cord systems: Carefully use your fingers to gently push the lens away from the cord while simultaneously pushing the cord toward the frame until the lens is released. b. For screw systems: Locate the tiny screws that hold the lens in place. Using a small screwdriver (like those for eyeglass repairs), carefully loosen the screws. Slowly remove the lens while holding the frame securely. 8. Store or discard the lenses: If you plan to reuse the lenses, handle them with care to avoid any scratches and store them in a safe place. Remember that practice makes perfect, and with time, you'll be able to remove lenses from glasses with ease. However, if you are uncomfortable or unsure about how to remove lenses from your specific eyeglass frames, it is always best to consult your optician or eyewear professional for assistance."},{"question":"Produce a sentence which mentions all of these concepts: content, tablet, watch","response":"You can watch fun content on your tablet, like cartoons and educational videos!"},{"question":"Add spaces between the words in the following text: Letterboxwithintegrateddoorcommunication.","response":"1.

Answer:","response":"The process described in the statement seems to be the process of photosynthesis, which is how plants convert light energy from the sun into chemical energy in the form of glucose. Now let's break down the process step by step to find out what the first step might be. 1. Absorption of Light Energy The first step of this process is the absorption of light energy by the chlorophyll present in the photosynthetic tissue i.e., leaves of the plant. Each leaf contains several layers of cells which hold chloroplasts, the tiny structures inside which photosynthesis happens. The cells of the top layer, called the epidermis, are transparent and allow the sunlight to pass through to the chlorophyll stored in the chloroplasts in the for the process. This light energy absorbed by the chlorophyll will be used to initiate the chemical reactions involved in photosynthesis. 2. Conversion of Light Energy to Chemical Energy After absorbing the light energy, chlorophyll uses this energy to combine carbon dioxide, which the plant pulls in from the air around it, and water to produce glucose (sugar) in a series of reactions. These reactions, collectively called the light-dependent reactions, convert the absorbed light energy into chemical energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), a molecule that stores and transports chemical energy within cells, and NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate), an electron carrier. Both ATP and NADPH will be used in the next stage of photosynthesis. 3. Use of Chemical Energy to Make Glucose The chemical energy (ATP and NADPH) produced in the light-dependent stage is then used in the next stage of photosynthesis, often called the light-independent reactions or the Calvin cycle. During the Calvin cycle, ATP and NADPH generated from light-dependent reactions are used to convert carbon dioxide into glucose. The glucose produced can then be used by the plant for its needs such as growth, reproduction, and defense, or stored for later use. 4. Release of Oxygen A beneficial by-product of photosynthesis is oxygen. During the process of converting water and carbon dioxide into glucose, oxygen is released into the atmosphere. This oxygen then becomes part of the air we breathe. 5. Use of Nutrients from the soil Though not directly a part of photosynthesis, the plant does absorb nutrients from the soil through its roots. These nutrients (like nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium etc) are important for the overall health and function of the plant, aiding in different biological processes, including photosynthesis. They assist in the production of chlorophyll and the overall growth and health of the plant. In conclusion, the first step of this process would be the absorption of light energy by the chlorophyll in the plant's cells. This absorbed energy is then used to kickstart the process of photosynthesis."},{"question":"(CNN) -- Women seeking an abortion in Texas will have to view a picture of the embryo or fetus and hear a description of its development before having the procedure, under a law that takes effect September 1. The bill stirred some controversy in Texas, but it easily passed through the state House and Senate, both of which are controlled by Republicans. It was signed into law Thursday by Republican Gov. Rick Perry. The law says that at least 24 hours before an abortion is performed, women must undergo a sonogram, a procedure that uses ultrasound to create an image. The doctor, then, is required to give, \\"in a manner understandable to a layperson, a verbal explanation of the results of the sonogram images, including a medical description of the dimensions of the embryo or fetus, the presence of cardiac activity, and the presence of external members and internal organs,\\" the law states. There are some exceptions, including pregnancies that resulted from sexual assault, incest or other violations of law. Women seeking abortions also are exempt if the fetus has been found to have an irreversible medical condition that will cause a disability. \\"Governor Perry was pleased to sign this important legislation, which bolsters our efforts to protect life by ensuring Texans are fully informed when considering such an important decision,\\" said his deputy press secretary, Lucy Nashed. Critics say the new law is unnecessary. \\"What no one is focusing on is that this is a mandate to humiliate women who want an abortion,\\" said Yvonne Gutierrez, vice president for public affairs at the Planned Parenthood Trust of South Texas. Texas already requires a 24-hour consent period, and the new law will simply add emotional and financial costs to those seeking abortions, she said.

According to studies and traffic laws around the world, driving without wearing a seatbelt is neither safe nor legal, leading to the answer \\"no\\" regarding the safety of driving without a seatbelt."},{"question":"What building the architect and owner of Portland's quarries design and build? Answer the above question based on the context below: Weymouth originated as a settlement on a constricted site to the south and west of Weymouth Harbour, an outlying part of Wyke Regis. The town developed from the mid 12th century onwards, but was not noted until the 13th century. By 1252 it was established as a seaport and became a chartered borough. Melcombe Regis developed separately on the peninsula to the north of the harbour; it was mentioned as a licensed wool port in 1310. French raiders found the port so accessible that in 1433 the staple was transferred to Poole. Melcombe Regis is thought to be the first port at which the Black Death came into England in June 1348, possibly either aboard a spice ship or an army ship. In their early history Weymouth and Melcombe Regis were rivals for trade and industry, but the towns were united in an Act of Parliament in 1571 to form a double borough. Both towns have become known as Weymouth, despite Melcombe Regis being the main centre. The villages of Upwey, Broadwey, Preston, Wyke Regis, Chickerell, Southill, Radipole and Littlemoor have become part of the built-up area. King Henry VIII had two Device Forts built to protect the south Dorset coast from invasion in the 1530s: Sandsfoot Castle in Wyke Regis and Portland Castle in Castletown. Parts of Sandsfoot have fallen into the sea due to coastal erosion. During the English Civil War, around 250 people were killed in the local Crabchurch Conspiracy in February 1645. In 1635, on board the ship Charity, around 100 emigrants from the town crossed the Atlantic Ocean and settled in Weymouth, Massachusetts. More townspeople emigrated to the Americas to bolster the population of Weymouth, Nova Scotia and Salem, Massachusetts; then called Naumking. There are memorials to this on the side of Weymouth Harbour and near to Weymouth Pavilion and Weymouth Sea Life Tower.

Sir Christopher Wren, a prominent English architect responsible for designing many famous buildings, including St. Paul's Cathedral in London, was not only the Member of Parliament for Weymouth in 1702 but also controlled Portland's quarries from 1675 to 1717. Given his significant influence on architecture across England and his connection to Weymouth and Portland's quarries, it is likely that during his career, Sir Christopher Wren would have designed and built various structures in the area, although there isn't a specific building mentioned explicitly in the context provided. It can be assumed that his use of Portland stone in the construction of St. Paul's Cathedral and other buildings would have brought attention and demand to this high-quality building material, increasing the market for the quarries he controlled. In addition to St. Paul's Cathedral, Wren was responsible for designing and building many other notable structures, such as the Royal Greenwich Observatory, the Royal Hospital Chelsea, and rebuilding over 50 churches in London after the Great Fire of London in 1666. It is plausible that a portion of these buildings had utilized Portland stone from the quarries he controlled. However, in the given context, there is no specific mention of a particular building in Weymouth or Melcombe Regis that Wren designed and constructed. In conclusion, although there is no clear indication in the context provided of a specific building in Weymouth or Melcombe Regis directly designed and built by Sir Christopher Wren, his influence on architecture and control over the Portland quarries significantly contributed to the prominence of Portland stone in the construction of various buildings, including his most famous work, St. Paul's Cathedral. It can be inferred that Wren might have been involved in designing and building structures in the area, utilizing the popular and high-quality building material from his quarries."},{"question":"Q: What does Warner Bros. call a flightless cuckoo ?

The narrator shares their experience of spending time outside the cafeteria and getting lost on campus, but they do not clearly indicate which particular task they find tedious. However, we can infer that the narrator might be talking about their classes or schoolwork. The reason for this assumption is that they mention \\"the intervening 4 hours between classes,\\" suggesting that they have attended a class or multiple classes before hanging out outside the cafeteria. This assumption is further reinforced by the casual tone and use of the abbreviation \\"lol,\\" which shows that the narrator might be expressing a laid-back or informal view of their situation. In the context of a school setting, it is common for students to find certain aspects of their coursework or classes tedious rather than difficult. This could include various tasks like studying, completing assignments, or engaging in group projects. Overall, the narrator appears to underscore a personal sentiment: the tasks at hand may not be inherently challenging but require effort and attention to complete, and that might be the reason behind finding them tedious. On the other hand, the narrator also exhibits a social side by mentioning their enjoyment in hearing different accents and meeting new people, demonstrating that they are open to new experiences and connecting with others."},{"question":"Question: I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

They are angry that they did not receive the necessary help from their government or aid agencies when they needed it most. Some have been sleeping rough on top of hills after they fled the rising waters. Others are sleeping on the floors of school classrooms, without food, blankets or dry clothes. The level of anger was evident when we traveled on Friday with the Malawian airforce on a mission to evacuate a group trapped in an area on the outskirts of Nsanje – the most affected district in the country. The airforce and police who accompanied the mission were also hoping to persuade people to move to government shelters situated in the town of Bangula. When we reached Nsanje, we found women cooking in the open. It's also where they'd been sleeping as well. Children were playing in the mud. Inside a crumbling mud-hit, an elderly and clearly unwell woman tried to sleep. Men, tasked with looking after their loved ones were most hostile towards the rescue workers at first. \\"Where were you when our people were dying - when we needed your help\\" one man shouted. After a lot of back and forth, and careful negotiation, some agreed to be airlifted from the site and to the the camp in Bangula. But others stubbornly refused to leave. Those frustrated by the response to their plight are, perhaps, justified. Aid and emergency efforts were slow - and to many it remains so. To be fair a disaster of this magnitude was unexpected even though parts of Malawi are flood prone. Those who live in these zones have often found a way of dealing with the problem after decades of living with it. But these floods were different. The dramatic rains affected more areas than ever, including many areas which usually do not experience floods. Roads and bridges have been washed away, cutting off crucial supply routes. On Tuesday, President Peter Mutharika declared a state of emergency in fifteen districts and appealed for help from the international community. The death toll now stands at 176 with more than 200,000 people displaced. The government is trying to ensure that the displaced are fed as a priority. At this point, they are receiving mostly maize and beans, but there are children under five and elderly people who need special meals. It is clear that Malawi cannot deal with this disaster all on its own. This Southern African country is one of the poorest in the world and the government simply does not have enough money to even properly run its administration. As is it stands, international donors have withheld 40 percent of their budgetary support of the nation after a corruption scandal in 2013 - in which more than 30m was stolen from government coffers. The scandal almost brought Malawi to its knees and the effects are being felt to date. So this disaster will only add further strain to an already struggling state. Help is coming though – albeit slowly. The World Food Programme (WFP) plans to airlift more than 100 metric tonnes of high energy biscuits. This will be enough to meet immediate food needs of 77,000 people. But we have not even started talking about other basic supplies that are still not available: blankets, mosquito nets, mattresses, clothes, cooking utensils. Most people came to the shelters with nothing. And rescue workers are still trying to reach those who are trapped, but getting supplies to these people is a logistical nightmare. Authorities are using boats and two military helicopters to try and reach the ones most in need. There's also the very real threat of water-borne diseases like cholera both in the shelters and villages. Robert Kisyula, national director of NGO World Vision, told me that the camps are crowding fast and sanitation facilities are hardly enough. \\"We need to prepare better, get everyone on board. If the rains continue and we experience more flooding I'm afraid the situation will be catastrophic.\\" he said. For now, the flood waters are receding and people have started going back home, unsafe as it is, to rebuild. Write a one or two sentence summary.","response":"Anger is rising among flood-hit Malawians who feel they have not received adequate help from their government or aid agencies, with many sleeping rough or in overcrowded shelters without sufficient food or supplies.

Charlie, Spencer, Beef, Grace and Donna sneak out, and proceed to enjoy themselves around the airport. When they are caught by the airport security guards and returned to the UM room, they find that the other minors, Katherine included, have been sent to a lodge down the road, and that the grouchy head of passenger relations, Oliver Porter â whose trip to Hawaii is among the canceled flights â intends for the kids to spend Christmas Eve in the UM room. Knowing that it will break Katherine's faith in Santa Claus if she does not receive a present by the next morning, Spencer asks the others to help him get a present for his sister in return for a plan to escape.

In conformity with the custom of designating areas of Jewish settlement with biblical names, Spain was denominated Sefarad (Obadiah 20), France was called Tsarefat (1 Kings 17:9), and Bohemia was called the Land of Canaan. By the high medieval period, Talmudic commentators like Rashi began to use Ashkenaz/Eretz Ashkenaz to designate Germany, earlier known as Loter, where, especially in the Rhineland communities of Speyer, Worms and Mainz, the most important Jewish communities arose. Rashi uses leshon Ashkenaz (Ashkenazi language) to describe German speech, and Byzantium and Syrian Jewish letters referred to the Crusaders as Ashkenazim. Given the close links between the Jewish communities of France and Germany following the Carolingian unification, the term Ashkenazi came to refer to both the Jews of medieval Germany and France. How did Byzantium and Syrian Jewish letters refer to the Crusaders?","response":"Byzantium and Syrian Jewish letters referred to the Crusaders as Ashkenazim."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What diocese was divided for owing to English reformation? The township of Crompton was originally within the parish of Prestwich-cum-Oldham in the Diocese of Lichfield, until 1541, when, owing to the English Reformation, this diocese was divided and Crompton became part of the Diocese of Chester. This in turn was divided in 1847, when the present Diocese of Manchester was created.The exact date of the establishment of a place of worship in Crompton is uncertain. Although Shaw Chapel is certain to have been in existence since the early 16th century, it has been put that \\"Shaw Chapel is even more ancient than Oldham Old Church\\", as evidenced by the ancient toponymy of the area. Shaw Chapel was anciently known as St Patrick's Chapel-on-the-Moor, and during the reign of James I of England, \\"it was situate in the midst of the common called Shaw Moor, not a single habitation being near it\\". It is thought to have been constructed following an increase in wealth produced by the localisation of the woollen trade during a very bleak period, although, in 1552 it was noted that it had no endowment, and its ornaments were in poor condition. It was rebuilt in 1739 and enlarged in 1798, and rebuilt again in 1870. It is now known as the Church of Holy Trinity.Shaw and Crompton has three Church of England ecclesiastic parishes: Shaw, High Crompton, and East Crompton. In addition to the established church, a variety of Reformed denominations, particularly Nonconformism and Methodism, have been practiced in Shaw and Crompton. Presbyterian ministers were recorded preaching at Shaw Chapel in as early as the 1650s. The Religious Society of Friends held conventicles in Whitfield in 1660s and 1670s.The following is a table of churches presently in Shaw and Crompton, as of 2018. Most of the above churches participate in Shaw's annual Whit Walks event, when congregations, choirs, and brass bands parade through the streets from their respective churches before taking part in one large, communal, inter-church service.

While it is possible that the woman is showing the man a problem related to their work, there could be other reasons for her sharing something on her cellphone in the middle of a busy street. Here are some alternative possibilities to consider: 1. Sharing a funny video or image: The woman could be showing the man something amusing or interesting she found online, and they could be good friends or acquaintances. 2. Giving directions: It's possible that the woman is helping the man with navigation, showing him a map, or pointing out a nearby location on her cellphone. 3. Discussing a news article: In the crowded, bustling environment, the woman may be sharing a recent news piece she read and wants to discuss it further with the man. 4. Demonstrating a new app: She could be excited about a new app she just downloaded and wants to teach the man how to navigate or make use of it. 5. Sharing a personal moment: The woman might be showing the man a picture of a family member, a pet, or a special moment she recently captured on her phone. 6. Showcasing an upcoming event: The pair could be planning to attend a local event or performance, and the woman might be providing further information found on her phone. 7. Recommending a product or service: The woman might have discovered a helpful product or service online and wants to share her findings with the man. 8. Settling a debate: The two could have been engaging in a conversation that led them to seek out an answer or clarification on the phone, and the woman is displaying the evidence. In conclusion, given the limited information provided by the premise, we cannot be certain that the hypothesis is true.

Hobbies can include collecting themed items and objects, engaging in creative and artistic pursuits, playing sports, or pursuing other amusements. A list of hobbies is lengthy and always changing as interests and fashions change. By continually participating in a particular hobby, one can acquire substantial skill and knowledge in that area. Engagement in hobbies has increased since the late nineteenth century as workers have more leisure time and advancing production and technology have provided more support for leisure activities. As some hobbies have become less popular, like stamp collecting, others have been created following technological advances, like video games. - Model building as a hobby involves the creation of models either from kits or from materials and components acquired by the builder . Categories of modelling include : Scale model building Live steam models Matchstick models Military models Model aircraft Model cars Model commercial vehicles Model construction vehicles Building models Architectural models Model figures Model military vehicles Rail transport modelling Model rockets Model ships Freelance model Cardboard engineering Firearm models ( See Airsoft guns ) Gundam Models - The hobby of collecting includes seeking, locating, acquiring, organizing, cataloging, displaying, storing, and maintaining whatever items are of interest to the individual collector. The scope of collecting is unlimited: \\"If something exists, somebody somewhere collects them.\\" - Leisure has been defined as a quality of experience or as free time. - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial. - Stamp collecting is the collecting of postage stamps and related objects. It is related to philately which is the study of stamps. It has been one of the world's most popular hobbies since the late nineteenth century with the rapid growth of the postal service, but is now in decline with the rise of the internet which has sharply reduced the number of postal items arriving in households. Stamp collecting proved to be an almost perfect hobby for collectors because there was a never ending stream of new stamps as each country sought to advertise its distinctiveness through its stamps. Because some stamps became rare, a thriving international trade in stamps was created. While stamp collectors are of all ages, it has been particularly popular hobby among children, many of whom continued the hobby as adults. After reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'model building' with the relationship of 'subclass of'. Choices: - activity - animal - art - collecting - computer monitor - country - display - display device - electronic game - game - hobby - interface - international trade - internet - leisure - perfect - philately - postal service - service - skill - technology - trade - type - user - user interface - video - video game The answer is:","response":"hobby"},{"question":"Answer the following question: What might the result of unwanted flirting be? - attraction - problems - the gallows - being slapped - curiosity The best answer is Answer:","response":"Unwanted flirting may result in several consequences, each depending on the individuals involved and the context of the behavior. Some potential outcomes include: 1. Attraction: Though unwanted flirting might initially be unwelcomed, there is the possibility of the receiving party developing a reciprocal attraction. An individual's charm, humor, and persistence can sometimes shift the dynamics between two people, leading to a mutual interest. It is essential, however, to consider and respect the feelings of the other person, and to stop any advances that make them uncomfortable. 2. Problems: Unwanted flirting can lead to issues in various aspects of one's life. Such problems can arise in both personal and professional settings. Strained relationships with friends or acquaintances may form due to discomfiture, disappointment, or broken trust. In professional environments, unwanted advances can lead to increased tension among colleagues, reduced productivity, and possible legal repercussions. 3. The Gallows: This term, which historically refers to a method of public execution, may represent extreme consequences for unwanted flirting in certain circumstances. In the context of this question, it symbolizes the potential for severe repercussions, such as damaging one's reputation, losing friends or family connections, or attracting adverse legal consequences due to inappropriate conduct. 4. Being Slapped: Although not considered an appropriate response in most settings, physical retaliation might ensue from unwanted flirting. Individuals who perceive the behavior as offensive, invasive, or intimidating may resort to slapping as a means of making their feelings clear. This may signal to the other person that they must stop immediately and acknowledge the harm they have caused. 5. Curiosity: Alternatively, the recipient of unwanted flirting may react with curiosity rather than outright repulsion. This could lead to further engagement in a conversation, a better understanding of the other person, or even the formation of a new connection. However, curiosity should not be misinterpreted as implicit consent, and it remains vital to maintain respect for boundaries and communicate openly. In conclusion, the result of unwanted flirting varies and may include attraction, problems, severe consequences, physical retaliation, or curiosity. Each situation and interaction is unique, and it is essential to remain mindful of how one's behavior affects others. Engaging in open communication and respecting individual boundaries can help minimize the likelihood of creating unwanted outcomes."},{"question":"The Harlem Globetrotters Popcorn Machine was a Saturday morning variety show featuring players from the basketball team the Harlem Globetrotters singing, dancing, and performing comedy sketches.

Context: SEOUL — South Korean Foreign Minister Kang, Kyung-wha said on Wednesday that the U.S. and South Korea jointly made the decision to suspend combined military exercises scheduled for August, but would not confirm if her government was given advanced notice before U.S. President Trump announced his intention to cancel the drills, after he met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore on June 12. “We have made it clear that this is a goodwill gesture to strengthen the dialogue momentum at this point, but they are not irreversible. They could quickly come back should we see the dialogue momentum losing speed or North Korea not living up to its denuclearization commitment,” said Foreign Minister Kang. During a press briefing in Seoul, the foreign minister said she was in in close communication with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the drills directly following the Singapore summit. And while the announcement canceling the exercises came suddenly, Kang said, South Korea was also considering this option to keep diplomatic momentum moving forward following the U.S.-North Korea summit where Kim reaffirmed his commitment to the “complete denuclearization” of North Korea. The now cancelled Ulchi Freedom Guardian exercises normally held in August usually bring in 3,000 more American troops from abroad and involve 50,000 South Korean troops. No decision has yet been made whether the other large-scale joint exercise held in the spring would be suspended as well. At the Singapore summit Trump said he would cancel the “war games” that he said were both enormously expensive and “provocative,” as an act of good faith and in response to North Korea’s commitment to denuclearization, its continued suspension of nuclear and missile teats, and the recent closing of its nuclear testing site. North Korea has long called for the end of these joint military exercises that it says are offensive “rehearsals for war.” In the past U.S. officials refused to suspend the joint drills, that they defended as defensive in nature...

Although it changes direction many times, it flows generally west for 215 miles (346 km) from the Cascade Range through the Rogue River – Siskiyou National Forest and the Klamath Mountains to the Pacific Ocean at Gold Beach. Communities along its course include Union Creek, Prospect, Trail, Shady Cove, Gold Hill and Rogue River, all in Jackson County; Grants Pass and Galice in Josephine County; and Agness, Wedderburn and Gold Beach in Curry County. Significant tributaries include the South Fork Rogue River, Elk Creek, Bear Creek, the Applegate River, and the Illinois River. Arising at 5,320 feet (1,622 m) above sea level, the river loses more than 1 mile (1.6 km) in elevation by the time it reaches the Pacific. It was one of the original eight rivers named in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1968, which included 84 miles (135 km) of the Rogue, from 7 miles (11.3 km) west of Grants Pass to 11 miles (18 km) east of the mouth at Gold Beach. In 1988, an additional 40 miles (64 km) of the Rogue between Crater Lake National Park and the unincorporated community of Prospect was named Wild and Scenic. Of the river's total length, 124 miles (200 km), about 58 percent is Wild and Scenic. The Rogue is one of only three rivers that start in or east of the Cascade Range in Oregon and reach the Pacific Ocean. The others are the Umpqua River and Klamath River. These three Southern Oregon rivers drain mountains south of the Willamette Valley; the Willamette River and its tributaries drain north along the Willamette Valley into the Columbia River, which starts in British Columbia rather than Oregon., can you guess it ?

When glider pilots look at the sky and see lenticular clouds, they know the flying will be good. The stationary, lens-shaped clouds - often mistaken for UFOs - tend to provide very smooth and strong lift, enabling gliders to fly vast distances. Skilled pilots can surf these \\"waves\\" in the sky for hours - until the lift or the light runs out. On Wednesday, strong north-westerly winds set up a series of giant \\"ripples\\" across the skies of Scotland and two pilots managed to break through the 1,000km (621 miles) barrier. John Williams, who lives near Scotlandwell in Perth and Kinross, said it was an \\"exceptionally good wave day\\" - the sort of day that only comes along every few years. He took off from the Scottish Gliding Centre's Portmoak airfield in his Antares glider at 06:50 and remained in the air for 11 hours and 38 minutes. He flew 1,684km - \\"which nicely puts it just over a thousand miles\\" - harnessing the power of the atmosphere alone. \\"When you get a wind from the north-west blowing across the mountains of Scotland, you get big ripples in the air set up. That's when you see these long, white lenticular clouds,\\" he told the BBC. \\"You can fly right along the edge of these clouds, just like a surfer on a beach. It's great fun.\\" The 63-year-old flew up to Killin, by Loch Tay, and then on to Aberdeenshire. He repeated the Killin to Aberdeenshire leg three times before flipping around and returning to his home airfield. \\"My first leg was a bit slower than I was hoping for, so I thought, I could do better than that, so I tried it again,\\" he said. \\"And then I tried it again which is a bit unusual.\\" His average speed on the middle run, which was the fastest, was 184km/h (114mph). To an untrained eye, it might appear that glider pilots are randomly floating around, but they're actually engaged in a constant search for lift and the best line to take them further and faster. It's something that becomes even more critical at the speeds Mr Williams was travelling. The pilot said he finds it an \\"endlessly fascinating\\" mental challenge, and one which enables him to concentrate hard for long periods of time. Mr Williams already holds the UK gliding distance record - 1,108km (688 miles) - which he set almost exactly 10 years ago. He said Wednesday's feat will not count as an official UK record, as the rules state you cannot repeat legs during the flight. But his achievement has still been noted as a \\"significant achievement\\" by members of the UK gliding community. \\"John is an exceptional pilot,\\" says Sant Cervantes, who holds four UK gliding records. \\"He's set the bar for people like myself to follow.\\" Mr Cervantes, 66, set off from Portmoak in a much smaller glider on Wednesday. He spent less time in the air, but still managed to fly 1,009km (627 miles) and reached an altitude of 13,000ft (3,962m). He followed a similar route to Mr Williams, who said it was the first time anyone had achieved such a distance in a glider that size. Mr Cervantes, a retired airline pilot, said there were only a handful of days each year which delivered really good wave days. But Scotland has more days like this than many countries and is generally recognised as having some of the best gliding conditions in Europe - which is why many committed gliders end up moving here. Mr Cervantes came to Scotland in 1972 and Mr Williams in 1997. Both of them now live conveniently close to the Portmoak airfield and devote much of their time to the world of gliding. \\"Your glider is extension of your personality,\\" Mr Cervantes told the BBC. \\"What you've got out there is an ocean of air and each day is different. It's a voyage of discovery - of the sky and yourself.\\" Each flight might be different, but days like Wednesday can live in a pilot's memory for a long time, the 66-year-old said. \\"If you're competent then you get in the zone like an athlete. You've got the conditions, you've got the glider and you've got yourself. \\"When you get it right you feel like you're in harmony with the environment. You're on a knife edge and you just shoot along. It's fantastic.\\" Summary:","response":"Two pilots in Scotland successfully glided over 1,000 km each by utilizing strong north-westerly winds and lenticular clouds, showcasing the country's exceptional gliding conditions."},{"question":"Generate a sentence about this data: Akrar POPULATION 28","response":"Step 1: Determine the subject of the sentence - In this case, the subject is \\"Akrar\\".

The answer is:","response":"Title: A Solid Accessibility Tool with Minor Room for Improvement Review: As a user who relies on accessibility tools, I recently downloaded the com.google.android.marvin.talkback app to my Android device. Overall, I have had a positive experience with this app, and I would like to give it a well-deserved 4-star rating. First and foremost, I appreciate the dedication of the developers to continually update and improve the app. The app offers a wide range of useful features to make smartphones more accessible for visually impaired users, such as the option for audio description and navigation assistance. The built-in text-to-speech engine is of high quality, making it easy to understand announcements and read-outs. In addition to the text-to-speech capabilities, this app also includes a feature called Explore by Touch. This allows users to glide their fingers over the screen and receive auditory feedback on the items they encounter, giving them a way to conveniently interact with their devices. Furthermore, I was amazed by the gesture-based navigation system. With just a swipe or tap of the finger, I could access different functions and features without any difficulty. The app also supports external switches, which opens the door for more users to take advantage of its functions. However, there were some areas where I felt the app could be improved. For instance, although the app claims to work seamlessly with most popular Android apps, I encountered some occasions where the talkback failed to function properly. This required me to restart the app to make it work again. While it is not a major issue, it did cause a bit of inconvenience. I also noticed that while using this app, my device's battery seemed to drain faster than usual. I understand this might be due to the additional processing required to support the accessibility features, but hopefully, future updates could optimize the app's efficiency to mitigate this issue. Lastly, while the app's gesture-based navigation does usually work well, there were some instances where the app failed to recognize my gestures accurately. Fine-tuning the gesture recognition might be beneficial in future updates. In conclusion, the com.google.android.marvin.talkback app is a valuable accessibility tool that helps make Android devices more user-friendly for those with visual impairments. With its extensive features and mostly seamless integration, it earns a solid 4-star rating. While there are some minor issues that can be addressed in future updates, I do recommend this app for anyone in need of its accessibility functions."},{"question":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Klein hired May Pang as a receptionist in 1969. Through involvement in a project with ABKCO, Lennon and Ono met her the following year. She became their personal assistant. In 1973, after she had been working with the couple for three years, Ono confided that she and Lennon were becoming estranged. She went on to suggest that Pang should begin a physical relationship with Lennon, telling her, \\"He likes you a lot.\\" Astounded by Ono's proposition, Pang nevertheless agreed to become Lennon's companion. The pair soon left for Los Angeles, beginning an 18-month period he later called his \\"lost weekend\\". In Los Angeles, Pang encouraged Lennon to develop regular contact with Julian, whom he had not seen for two years. He also rekindled friendships with Starr, McCartney, Beatles roadie Mal Evans, and Harry Nilsson. While Lennon was drinking with Nilsson, he misunderstood something that Pang had said and attempted to strangle her. Lennon relented only after he was physically restrained by Nilsson.In June, Lennon and Pang returned to Manhattan in their newly rented penthouse apartment where they prepared a spare room for Julian when he visited them. Lennon, who had been inhibited by Ono in this regard, began to reestablish contact with other relatives and friends. By December, he and Pang were considering a house purchase, and he refused to accept Ono's telephone calls. In January 1975, he agreed to meet Ono, who claimed to have found a cure for smoking. After the meeting, he failed to return home or call Pang. When Pang telephoned the next day, Ono told her that Lennon was unavailable because he was exhausted after a hypnotherapy session. Two days later, Lennon reappeared at a joint dental appointment; he was stupefied and confused to such an extent that Pang believed he had been brainwashed. Lennon told Pang that his separation from Ono was now over, although Ono would allow him to continue seeing her as his mistress. Guess a valid title for it!

The term \\"sousveillance\\", coined by Steve Mann, stems from the contrasting French words \\"sur\\", meaning \\"above\\", and \\"sous\\", meaning \\"below\\", i.e. \\"surveillance\\" denotes the \\"eye-in-the-sky\\" watching from above, whereas \\"sousveillance\\" denotes bringing the camera or other means of observation down to human level, either physically (mounting cameras on people rather than on buildings), or hierarchically (ordinary people doing the watching, rather than higher authorities or architectures doing the watching). - The Corps of Royal Marines (RM) is the United Kingdom's amphibious light infantry force, forming part of the Naval Service, along with the Royal Navy. The Royal Marines were formed in 1755 as the Royal Navy's infantry troops. However, the marines can trace their origins back to the formation of the English Army's \\"Duke of York and Albany's maritime regiment of Foot\\" at the grounds of the Honourable Artillery Company on 28 October 1664. - The Honourable Artillery Company (HAC) was incorporated by Royal Charter in 1537 by King Henry VIII and is considered one of the oldest military organisations in the world. Today it is a registered charity whose purpose is to attend to the \\"better defence of the realm\\", this purpose is primarily achieved by the support of the HAC Regiment and a detachment of Special Constabulary to the City of London Police. The word \\"artillery\\" in \\"Honourable Artillery Company\\" does not have the current meaning that is generally associated with it, but dates from a time when in the English language that word meant any projectile, including for example arrows shot from a bow. The equivalent form of words in modern English would be either \\"Honourable Infantry Company\\" or \\"Honourable Military Company.\\" - Behavior is the range of actions and mannerisms made by individuals, organisms, systems, or artificial entities in conjunction with themselves or their environment, which includes the other systems or organisms around as well as the (inanimate) physical environment. It is the response of the system or organism to various stimuli or inputs, whether internal or external, conscious or subconscious, overt or covert, and voluntary or involuntary. - The 30 Commando Information Exploitation Group is a Royal Marines unit of the British Armed Forces . The unit resources include communications , information operations , information systems , intelligence , surveillance , and Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance ( ISTAR ) . It is a redesignation of the former brigade headquarters battalion , the UK Landing Force Command Support Group , which was previously known as HQ & Signals Squadron RM. The unit 's title harks back to the original 30 Commando ( which in turn became 30 Assault Unit RM ) , formed in 1942 . This unit was tasked to move ahead of advancing Allied forces , or to undertake covert infiltrations into enemy territory by land , sea or air , to capture much needed intelligence , in the form of codes , documents , equipment or enemy personnel . In 2013 , 30 Commando Information Exploitation Group were granted the freedom of Littlehampton , West Sussex , in honour of the original unit being based in the town during the Second World War . - The Crown dependencies are three territories of the United Kingdom: the Isle of Man in the Irish Sea, and the Bailiwicks of Jersey and Guernsey in the English Channel. Being independently administered jurisdictions, they do not form part of either the United Kingdom or the British Overseas Territories. They are self-governing possessions of the Crown (defined uniquely in each jurisdiction). Internationally, the dependencies are considered \\"territories for which the United Kingdom is responsible\\" rather than as sovereign states. As a result, they are not member states of the Commonwealth of Nations. However, they do have a relationship with the Commonwealth, the European Union, and other international organisations and are members of the BritishIrish Council. They are not part of the European Union (EU), although they are within the EU's customs area. - The British Armed Forces form the military of the United Kingdom, tasked with defence of the country, its overseas territories, and the Crown dependencies. They also promote the UK's wider interests, support international peacekeeping efforts, and provide humanitarian aid. - The English Army existed while England was an independent state and was at war with other states, but it was not until the Interregnum and the New Model Army (raised by Parliament to defeat the Royalists in the English Civil War) that England acquired a peacetime professional standing army. At the restoration of the monarchy, Charles II kept a small standing army, formed from elements of the Royalist army in exile and elements of the New Model Army, from which the most senior regular regiments of today's British Army can trace their antecedence. Likewise, Royal Marines can trace their origins back to the formation of the English Army's \\"Duke of York and Albany's maritime regiment of Foot\\" at the grounds of the Honourable Artillery Company on 28 October 1664. - Postal interception is the act of retrieving another person's mail for the purpose of ensuring that the mail is not delivered to the recipient, or to spy on them. - The military, also called the armed forces, are forces authorized to use deadly force, and weapons, to support the interests of the state and some or all of its citizens. The task of the military is usually defined as defense of the state and its citizens, and the prosecution of war against another state. The military may also have additional sanctioned and non-sanctioned functions within a society, including, the promotion of a political agenda, protecting corporate economic interests, internal population control, construction, emergency services, social ceremonies, and guarding important areas. The military can also function as a discrete subculture within a larger civil society, through the development of separate infrastructures, which may include housing, schools, utilities, food production and banking. - The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide. It is a \\"network of networks\\" that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and peer-to-peer networks for file sharing. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - Light infantry (or skirmishers) are soldiers whose job was to provide a skirmishing screen ahead of the main body of infantry, harassing and delaying the enemy advance. Light infantry was distinct from medium, heavy or line infantry. Heavy infantry were dedicated primarily to fighting in tight formations that were the core of large battles. Light infantry fought in open-order, often in close co-ordination with heavy infantry, where they could screen the heavy infantry from harassing fire, and the heavy infantry could intervene to protect the light infantry from attacks of enemy heavy infantry or cavalry. Heavy infantry originally had heavier arms and more armour than light infantry, but this distinction was lost as the use of armour declined and gunpowder weapons became standardized. - Humanitarian aid is material and logistic assistance to people in need. It is usually short-term help until the long-term help by government and other institutions replaces it. Among the people in need belong homeless, refugees, victims of natural disasters, wars and famines. The primary purpose of humanitarian aid is to save lives, reduce suffering and respect to human dignity. Humanitarian aid is material or logistical assistance provided for humanitarian purposes, typically in response to humanitarian crises including natural disasters and man-made disaster. The primary objective of humanitarian aid is to save lives, alleviate suffering, and maintain human dignity. It may therefore be distinguished from development aid, which seeks to address the underlying socioeconomic factors which may have led to a crisis or emergency. - Peacekeeping refers to activities intended to create conditions that favor lasting peace. Research generally finds that peacekeeping reduces civilian and battlefield deaths and reduces the risk of renewed warfare. - Surveillance (or ) is the monitoring of the behavior, activities, or other changing information, usually of people for the purpose of influencing, managing, directing, or protecting them. This can include observation from a distance by means of electronic equipment (such as CCTV cameras), or interception of electronically transmitted information (such as Internet traffic or phone calls); and it can include simple, no- or relatively low-technology methods such as human intelligence agents and postal interception. The word \\"\\" comes from a French phrase for \\"watching over\\" (\\"sur\\" means \\"from above\\" and \\"veiller\\" means \\"to watch\\"), and is in contrast to more recent developments such as sousveillance. - The Royal Navy (RN) is the United Kingdom's naval warfare force. Although warships were used by the English kings from the early medieval period, the first major maritime engagements were fought in the Hundred Years War against the kingdom of France. The modern Royal Navy traces its origins to the early 16th century; the oldest of the UK's armed services, it is known as the Senior Service. - A troop is a military sub-subunit, originally a small formation of cavalry, subordinate to a squadron. In many armies a troop is the equivalent element to the infantry section or platoon. Exceptions are the Royal Horse Artillery and the US Cavalry, where troops are subunits that compare to an infantry company or artillery battery. - Internet traffic is the flow of data across the Internet.

As the turbine spins, it drives the generator, which consists of a rotating shaft with magnets and a stationary structure called a stator with coils of wire. The spinning motion of the turbine causes the magnets to rotate within the generator, creating a magnetic field. This magnetic field induces an electric current in the coils of wire within the stator, generating electricity. The generated electricity is then transformed and transported through power lines to be distributed for residential, commercial, and industrial use."},{"question":"Information: - Condensed milk is cow's milk from which water has been removed. It is most often found in the form of sweetened condensed milk (SCM), with sugar added, and the two terms \\"condensed milk\\" and \\"sweetened condensed milk\\" are often used synonymously today.

A representative democracy, Guatemala's capital and largest city is Nueva Guatemala de la Asunción, also known as Guatemala City. - Milk is a pale liquid produced by the mammary glands of mammals. It is the primary source of nutrition for infant mammals (including humans who breastfeed) before they are able to digest other types of food. Early-lactation milk contains colostrum, which carries the mother's antibodies to its young and can reduce the risk of many diseases. It contains many other nutrients including protein and lactose. - Water is a transparent and nearly colorless chemical substance that is the main constituent of Earth's streams, lakes, and oceans, and the fluids of most living organisms. Its chemical formula is HO, meaning that its molecule contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, that are connected by covalent bonds. Water strictly refers to the liquid state of that substance, that prevails at standard ambient temperature and pressure; but it often refers also to its solid state (ice) or its gaseous state (steam or water vapor). It also occurs in nature as snow, glaciers, ice packs and icebergs, clouds, fog, dew, aquifers, and atmospheric humidity. - The Aztec people were certain ethnic groups of central Mexico, particularly those groups who spoke the Nahuatl language and who dominated large parts of Mesoamerica from the 14th to 16th centuries. The Nahuatl words \\"aztecatl\\" (singular) and \\"aztecah\\" (plural) mean \\"people from Aztlan\\", a mythological place for the Nahuatl-speaking culture of the time, and later adopted as the word to define the Mexica people. Often the term \\"Aztec\\" refers exclusively to the Mexica people of Tenochtitlan (now the location of Mexico City), situated on an island in Lake Texcoco, who referred to themselves as \\"Mxihcah Tenochcah\\" or \\"Clhuah Mexihcah\\" . - Vanilla is a flavoring derived from orchids of the genus \\"Vanilla\\", primarily from the Mexican species, flat-leaved vanilla (\\"V. planifolia\\"). The word \\"vanilla\\", derived from the diminutive of the Spanish word (\\"vaina\\" itself meaning sheath or pod), is translated simply as \\"little pod\\".

It is one of six areas in the world where ancient civilization arose independently, and the second in the Americas along with Norte Chico (Caral-Supe) in present-day northern coastal Peru. - Chocolate is a typically sweet, usually brown food preparation of \\"Theobroma cacao\\" seeds, roasted and ground, and often flavored with vanilla. It is made in the form of a liquid, paste, or in a block, or used as a flavoring ingredient in other foods. Cacao has been cultivated by many cultures for at least three millennia in Mesoamerica. The earliest evidence of use traces to the Mokaya (Mexico and Guatemala), with evidence of chocolate beverages dating back to 1900 BCE. In fact, the majority of Mesoamerican people made chocolate beverages, including the Maya and Aztecs, who made it into a beverage known as \\"xocoltl\\" , a Nahuatl word meaning \\"bitter water\\". The seeds of the cacao tree have an intense bitter taste and must be fermented to develop the flavor. - Sugar is the generalized name for sweet, short-chain, soluble carbohydrates, many of which are used in food. They are composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. There are various types of sugar derived from different sources. Simple sugars are called monosaccharides and include glucose (also known as dextrose), fructose, and galactose. The table or granulated sugar most customarily used as food is sucrose, a disaccharide. (In the body, sucrose hydrolyses into fructose and glucose.) Other disaccharides include maltose and lactose. Longer chains of sugars are called oligosaccharides.

He hears story pitches from screenwriters and decides which have the potential to be made into films, green-lighting only 12 out of 50,000 submissions every year. His job is threatened when up-and-coming story executive Larry Levy (Peter Gallagher) begins working at the studio. Mill has also been receiving death threat postcards, assumed to be from a screenwriter whose pitch he rejected. Mill surmises that the disgruntled writer is David Kahane (Vincent D'Onofrio). Mill is told by Kahane's girlfriend, June Gudmundsdottir (Greta Scacchi) that Kahane is at a theater in Pasadena. Mill pretends to recognize Kahane in the lobby, and offers him a scriptwriting deal, hoping this will stop the threats. The two go to a nearby bar where Kahane gets intoxicated and rebuffs Mill's offer; he calls Mill a liar and continues goading him about his job security at the studio. In the bar's parking lot, the two men fight. Mill goes too far and accidentally drowns Kahane in a shallow pool of water, then stages the crime to make it look like a botched robbery. The next day, after Mill is late for and distracted at a meeting, Studio chief of security Walter Stuckel (Fred Ward) confronts Mill about the murder and says that the police know Mill was the last one to see Kahane alive. At the end of their conversation Mill receives a fax from his stalker. Thus, Mill has killed the wrong man, and the stalker apparently knows this. Mill attends Kahane's funeral and gets into conversation with June. Detectives Avery (Whoopi Goldberg) and DeLongpre (Lyle Lovett) suspect Mill is guilty of murder. Mill receives a postcard from the writer suggesting they meet at a hotel bar. While Mill is waiting, he is cornered by two screenwriters, Tom Oakley (Richard E. Grant) and Andy Sivella (Dean Stockwell), who pitch Habeas Corpus, a legal drama featuring no major stars and with a depressing ending. Because Mill is not alone, his stalker... My question: Who does Mill have feelings for?

Interesting one; while Clinton was still in office he was at a fund raising dinner at a restaurant I managed. I met his personal valet from the white house mess, Oscar, and he casually said, if you are ever in DC…. To which I replied, I sure can be! My husband and I made the trip a month or so later, we met up with Oscar for dinner on our first night there. We had just started planning all we wanted to see as it was our first visit there. We had no idea that Oscar would invite us for not one but two private tours of the White House. We saw the oval office, the situation room, the rose garden, the mess, the press room and the OEOB. We even heard Buddy bark! It was a trip I knew I’d never be able to repeat and was very grateful to have had the chance to take. For the fun one…My friend was turning 50 and she wanted a theme destination celebration. 18 of us went to Belize. She went all out. Two private villas that you could only access by boat, all the swag you can imagine. And plenty of booze. That alone is already a super special vacation but for me it had even more meaning. I’d never been invited to a group event like this before nor had I been to spring break, which this very much turned into. I know many people have plenty of over the top stories. And I’ve had some even more amazing trips than this. But those two had just enough special twists to make them really stand out. Thanks for asking. I too am a Disney fan!

ObamaCare, also known as the Affordable Care Act, is a set of rules made by the United States government to help people get medical care when they are sick. Sometimes, people are not happy with how these rules work, and they want to change them or wait before using them. But Kathleen Sebelius said that it's important to keep using ObamaCare because people who are sick can't wait for help.

At the heart of the maelstrom that has gripped Pakistan during the past eight weeks since I authored an opinion piece on the nuclear-armed nation's alleged intelligence sector malfeasance against U.S. regional interests lies nothing less than the struggle to define Pakistan's modern statehood. It is a fight between the feudal politics of Pakistan's barons, President Asif Ali Zardari being chief among them, and the military's dominance of its industry, security and strategic sectors. Stuck in the middle is a largely uneducated, underemployed and malnourished population that yearns for leadership -- any kind of leadership -- to guide the country forward. That struggle, hidden from the world's view through the many years of dictatorship and moribund civilian rule, has now come out in the open as a result of my column's disclosure of a confidential memorandum that Pakistan's then ambassador to the United States, Husain Haqqani, directed me to draft and deliver to Admiral Mike Mullen, then chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff. [Editor's note: Haqqani has denied any involvement in the memo.]. Inadvertent as my purpose was in disclosing the memorandum, the debate it has touched off is real and the issues being debated are finally the ones that need illumination in a country that survives on a rich diet of conspiracy theories and the adolescent antics of its political leaders. The memorandum called on Mullen to dissuade his friend, Pakistan's army chief Gen. Ashfaq Kayani, from moving against the civilian government in the tense days that followed Operation Neptune Spear -- the U.S. Special Forces raid that killed Osama bin Laden. In return, it offered a commitment by a reconstituted civilian government, which would have added national security muscle previously belonging to the army and intelligence sectors, to do a lot of what America and its allies in the region, India and Afghanistan, have long been calling on Pakistan to do. To some in Pakistan, the memo was the product of an honorable civil servant (Haqqani) attempting to save his boss's government from imminent demise at the hands of military men he had come to despise. To others, the memorandum's contents were nothing short of high treason, the product of a ruthless operator's (Zardari) directive and his cunning collaborator's (Haqqani) compliance. The truth probably lies somewhere in between. Yet far from harming the democratic institutions Haqqani claimed to be defending when he first contacted me on that beautiful May morning, the debate over the memorandum's who, what, when and why has had the remarkable effect of stimulating forces that make democracy real in a civilized society, not the mirage that was being peddled around the halls of Congress, Washington's think-tank lecture circuit or the Sunday talk shows by the able ambassador. Today, nearly two months after the memorandum's contents became known, the army remains in its barracks. The intelligence services continue to play their Patriot Games in Afghanistan while minding the store at home with an invisible hand. Zardari, who said he would address a special joint session of Parliament on \\"memogate\\" sometime next week, had his heart condition resurface on Tuesday, sending him scurrying off to Dubai (Pakistani doctors and hospitals wouldn't do) for a stay of undetermined length outside the country. The Supreme Court has taken on the challenge addressed to it by a leader of an opposition political party who felt he couldn't get the \\"memogate\\" truth out of a biased Parliamentary committee. An Inquiry Commission has been formed as a result. A former cricket hero turned politician now routinely attracts tens of thousands of supporters at gathering points around the country as he tries to coerce the Arab Spring's winds to blow further east. And the chivalrous prime minister, Yousef Raza Gilani, tells his party loyalists that he is prepared to resign if my facts are proven right and Haqqani, or worse, Zardari, are found to be the minds behind the memo. Pakistan's press is also doing its job well -- the hacks who support Zardari, Inc. are throwing knives at me hourly while those who want to see Zardari get his comeuppance will simply not let the story go and are eagerly digging at and reporting on every facet of it. All of which means everyone -- finally -- has a stake in the outcome of an issue that could have brought serious repercussions to the country's method of accountability and governance if the doctrine outlined in the memo had been enacted. Hmmm...... seems to me that democracy is doing exactly what it should: Self-corrective actions with heated debate about principled issues, all within the constitutional framework and rule of law as it exists today. David Frum can call me all the names he wants -- it won't change the facts. It certainly will not deter me. And it won't help to fix what ails Pakistan. Peter Bergen can ridicule my three or four claims that turned out to be inaccurate over a five year period of being interviewed nearly four or five times a week -- it won't change the facts, or the accuracy with which I recorded them in this instance. The think-tank crowd and my detractors at the State Department, never ones to like private US citizens running off and doing what they only talk about or dream of being able to do, have always pilloried my efforts -- but their frustrations and jealousies won't change the facts. Even the White House didn't have all the facts when it issued a denial of my opinion that Pakistani officials knew about the bin Laden raid before it happened. Its fact checkers could not readily find the May 2, 2011 story from CNN reporter Nick Paton Walsh which reported that Pakistan's High Commissioner to the UK had said -- when asked about the bin Laden raid -- that Pakistan was \\"in the know of certain things\\" and \\"what happened happened with our consent.\\" [Editor's note: Haqqani has been quoted as saying the allegation that he was informed of the raid in advance are \\"reckless, baseless and false.\\"]. I have largely ignored the attacks emanating from Haqqani's supporters in Washington because the former ambassador can't speak for himself since being put on ice by Zardari in a safe house. But enough is enough. Haqqani should be offered immunity from prosecution in Pakistan and simply tell the Pakistani people the truth about what he -- and his boss -- did. He will be seen as a hero for having the guts to call a spade a spade. Rogue operations inside governments have no place in our world today. The people of Pakistan deserve better. They deserve to know the truth. And it is alone for the Pakistani people to decide whether their political leaders deserve their faith and trust after learning the truth of what has been done in their names. I did not ask to be involved in the events that gave rise to this firestorm. I too face threats and haranguing from Zardari's supporters on a daily basis. But I had the courage to speak truth to power -- as I have done all my life -- and now I'm going to make sure the facts of what the ambassador and those behind him asked me to do in the name of democracy are put squarely on the table for the people of Pakistan to see, judge and decide. Facts, after all, are still stubborn things. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mansoor Ijaz.

By Associated Press Reporter PUBLISHED: 18:30 EST, 20 February 2014 | UPDATED: 02:23 EST, 21 February 2014 Two men pleaded guilty Thursday to a 2011 beating at Dodger Stadium that left San Francisco Giants fan Bryan Stow brain damaged and severely disabled. They were immediately sentenced by an angry judge who called them cowards and the sort of people that sports fans fear when go to games. Louie Sanchez, 31, saying he kicked and punched Stow, pleaded guilty to one count of mayhem that disabled and disfigured the victim. He was sentenced to eight years in prison with credit for 1,086 days. Witnesses at the hearing said","response":"Sanchez expressed remorse for his actions, but Judge Fernando Olguín felt that his apology fell short of genuine contrition. Sanchez's accomplice, Marvin Norwood, 33, also pleaded guilty to one count of assault likely to produce great bodily injury with an additional allegation of personally inflicting great bodily injury on Stow. Norwood received a sentence of four years in prison, with credit for time served since his arrest. During the hearing, the prosecutor, Deputy District Attorney Michele Hanisee, played a video of the attack, which showed the brutal and senseless nature of the beating. In the video, Sanchez and Norwood can be seen violently attacking Stow, who was wearing a Giants jersey, in the parking lot of Dodger Stadium after the opening day game. The video clearly demonstrated the severity of the attack, as Stow, a 45-year-old paramedic, and father of two, was left motionless on the ground after the assault. Throughout the court proceedings, the families of both the defendants and the victim expressed their anguish over the events that unfolded on that fateful night. Stow's family members were given the opportunity to address the court, and they spoke of the lasting impact this event has had on their lives. Bryan Stow's sister, Bonnie, recounted how her brother would never be the same, saying, \\"We shower him, dress him, and fix his meals. All the things he once did on his own.\\" Bryan Stow was also present at the hearing via a video conference, as his extensive injuries have left him wheelchair-bound and unable to travel. In a statement, he said, \\"I have seizures daily, I have memory problems, and so much more that I am dealing with for the rest of my life, all because of a senseless act of violence.\\" In his closing remarks, Judge Olguín lamented the brutal act that had marred the reputation of sportsmanship and fan camaraderie. He urged all sports enthusiasts to remember the spirit of friendly competition and to put aside violent behavior that turns a pastime enjoyed by many into a source of fear. After the sentences were handed down, the Stow family held a press conference, acknowledging that while nothing can undo the harm inflicted upon Bryan, they felt a sense of justice and closure with the conclusion of the legal proceedings. Stow's mother, Ann Stow, vowed to continue raising awareness about senseless violence at sporting events, stating, \\"We hope this serves as a deterrent for anyone thinking about engaging in this type of horrific behavior in the future.\\" Ultimately, this harrowing case serves as a potent reminder of the consequences of aggressive and uncontrolled actions, as well as the need for communities to come together to promote a culture of respect, empathy, and sportsmanship both in and out of the stadium."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: The film begins with a simplified recap of the events of the first film.

Indicate your answer by 'Option 1' if the first option is correct, otherwise 'Option 2'.

This selection is based on how well the option maintains the consistency of the events in the story. So first, read the partial story carefully. Next, examine the two provided options and think about how each one will affect the rest of the story. The goal is to make sure that all sentences in the story align properly and make sense when read together. The story begins with Johnny and his grandpa at a baseball game. The third sentence tells us that Johnny has always wanted to catch a ball from the game, but he never gets a chance. The fourth sentence reveals that a player hits a ball into the stands, and the fifth sentence discloses that the ball lands in Johnny's glove. Now, let's consider the options for the missing second sentence. Option 1: \\"He had his mitt, as always, ready to catch a foul ball.\\" This option implies that Johnny always has his mitt ready at games in the hope of catching a ball. This matches the remaining sentences in the story as Johnny finally catches a ball. Option 2: \\"He forgot his mitt at home.\\" This option contradicts the rest of the story. If Johnny forgot his mitt at home, then he wouldn't have been able to catch the ball in his 'outstretched' glove as mentioned in Sentence 5. Based on this analysis, the correct choice would be Option 1. It fits seamlessly into the story and maintains the consistency of the narrative.

Second question: What do spot rate and future rate mean in connection with bonds? Especially expressions like 2-year spot rate etc. Are these two questions asking the same thing? Select from the following. A. no B. yes","response":"A. No Firstly, let's break down the individual components of your questions. The spot rate refers to the current price in the marketplace to immediately purchase or sell a financial instrument such as currency, commodity, or a bond. It's essentially the price that you would pay (or receive) today, or \\"on the spot\\". The spot rate is determined by supply and demand for the financial instrument in question. In the context of bonds, the spot rate is also considered as the yield to maturity (YTM), which effectively serves as the ‘internal rate of return’. It's the percentage that equates the present value of a bond's future cash flows (payments to bondholder) to its current market price. The term \\"2-year spot rate\\" refers to the yield on a bond that matures in two years if that bond is bought today and held for its entire duration. On the other hand, a future rate is a rate that is agreed upon today for a transaction that will occur at a future date. It's essentially a locked-in price. In the bond market, the future rate often refers to the forward rate, which is a projection for what the interest rate on a bond is expected to be in the future. Both spot and future (forward) rates are important for bond valuation. The relationship between spot rates and future rates is essential to the term structure of interest rates, which is essentially a graphical depiction of interest rates (YTM) on debt for a range of maturities. If the future interest rate is higher than the spot rate, we say that the term structure is upward-sloping, which is typically the case. Conversely, if the future rate is lower than the spot rate, we have a downward-sloping term structure, which is less common but can occur. Now, to answer your question regarding the similarity between the two inquiries. Question one is asking for a definition of 'spot rate'. Question two, however, is more extensive. It is asking for an explanation of how 'spot rate' and 'future rate' are used in relation to bonds, particularly when one hears expressions like '2-year spot rate'. Therefore, while the two questions are related, they are not asking the same thing."},{"question":"Given the sentence \\"An older man and a teenage boy are running in a race.\\" can we conclude that \\"Father and son find joy in running the race together.\\"?

Answer:","response":"James Glickenhaus and Eric Red are both individuals who have contributed to the automotive industry in different ways; however, only James Glickenhaus can be accurately described as an automotive entrepreneur, while Eric Red is primarily known for his work as a screenwriter and film director but has also dabbled in automotive design. James Glickenhaus is an American investment professional and automotive entrepreneur recognized for his involvement in the supercar industry. He started out as an investment manager and is the founder of Glickenhaus & Co., an investment firm based in New York. His passion for automobiles led him to establish Scuderia Cameron Glickenhaus (SCG), a boutique manufacturer of high-performance sports cars and racing cars. SCG focuses on producing limited-run, road-legal supercars with a particular emphasis on the racing heritage of legendary sports car makers like Ferrari. Some of the brand's most famous and notable models include the SCG 003, SCG 004, and SCG 007. These unique creations have garnered critical acclaim and respect in the automotive world, making Glickenhaus a renowned figure in the industry. Eric Red, on the other hand, is an American screenwriter, film director, and author best known for his work in the horror and thriller genres. Some of his most famous projects include the films The Hitcher (1986) and Near Dark (1987), as well as his directorial work in films like Body Parts (1991) and 100 Feet (2008). While Red's main contributions to the world of art and entertainment are in cinema, his endeavors in the automotive industry have been limited to vehicles' conceptual design and artistic renderings. One of Red's most notable forays into automotive design came in the form of the \\"Vampyre\\" concept car. This project, which took inspiration from classic horror films and the 1960s Batmobile, was developed in collaboration with renowned car customizer George Barris. The Vampyre is a one-off design that showcases Red's creative abilities beyond screenplay and filmmaking, but it has not led to any significant entrepreneurial ventures in the automotive industry. In summary, while both James Glickenhaus and Eric Red have made contributions to the automotive world in their respective ways, it is Glickenhaus who is a true automotive entrepreneur. He has established a company focused on producing unique and high-performance vehicles and has made a name for himself in the industry. Eric Red, primarily known for his cinema work, has dabbled in automotive design but has not pursued it as a business or entrepreneurial venture."},{"question":"Question: What founder of pragmatism's collected papers did Charles Hartshorne ans Paul Weiss edit?

Article:","response":"Title: Taulupe Faletau's Hat-Trick Keeps Bath's Premiership Play-Off Hopes Alive and Ends Gloucester's Top-Six Dreams In a thrilling encounter at the Recreation Ground, Bath managed to secure a bonus-point win that not only keeps their hopes for a fourth Premiership play-off spot alive but also ends Gloucester's chances of making it to the top six. The victory is largely attributed to Wales' Taulupe Faletau, who scored a magnificent hat-trick, propelling Bath to triumph in this high stakes match. Under pressure to perform, Bath managed to register a stunning 34-20 victory, thanks to the heroics of number eight, Taulupe Faletau. The Welsh star scored three of the team's five tries, displaying his prowess on the field and cementing his status as one of the top players in the game. Faletau's contributions were instrumental in keeping Bath's chances for a play-off spot alive, as they head into the final day of the competition. Bath started the match with intent, and their determination was evident right from the kickoff. They opened the scoring with an early try by Faletau and continued to dominate proceedings thanks to their strong forward play. Gloucester fought back and managed to match Bath's intensity for a while but ultimately could not stave off defeat. Although the outcome of this match has dashed Gloucester's hopes of finishing in the top six, great credit must go to their players for putting up a brave fight. Despite trailing for most of the match, they never let their heads drop and pressed on till the final whistle. Even though the Premiership season has not panned out as desired, Gloucester can be proud of the effort they have displayed all year long. On the other hand, Bath head coach Stuart Hooper will be delighted with his team's resolve in overcoming a difficult challenge. With multiple injuries impacting their squad over the season, Bath has managed to stay competitive in the race for the top four. The energy exerted by the players in this match was commendable, as they refused to give in to the pressure and played till the end. As the Premiership season approaches its climax, there is still everything to play for. With a critical final day looming, Bath must replicate their impressive display against Gloucester if they wish to secure their spot in the play-offs. The victory will serve as a huge confidence booster, and the team will be looking to carry that momentum forward. Taulupe Faletau's hat-trick, however, must be the highlight of the match. The star player demonstrated his world-class abilities and ensured his team's survival in the race. As Bath look to the final day of the season, their hopes will undoubtedly rest on the shoulders of their talented number eight. With Faletau leading the charge, this ambitious team will undoubtedly believe that anything is possible. In summary, the epic battle between Bath and Gloucester at the Recreation Ground has given fans a match to remember. Despite Gloucester's valiant effort, it was Bath who emerged victorious, ensuring they remain in contention for a top-four finish. Wales' Taulupe Faletau was truly the hero of the match, scoring a hat-trick that will go down in the annals of Premiership history. As Bath's Premiership play-off hopes stay alive, it is safe to say that Faletau's performance will be remembered as a turning point in their season."},{"question":"Please capitalize where necessary: industri ab thule is a swedish company specializing in the development, manufacture and marketing of load carriers, roof boxes and accessories.","response":"Industri AB Thule is a Swedish company specializing in the development, manufacture, and marketing of load carriers, roof boxes, and accessories."},{"question":"You are given a sentence in Spanish.

The ancient Greeks called them the Cynetes (or Cunetes). Whatever their origins, their culture evolved under the pressure and influence of foreign forces. Among the many invading armies that settled here and contributed to nascent Portuguese culture were Phoenicians, who settled in the area around 1,000 b.c., followed by the Celts, Iberians, Greeks, and Carthaginians. But it was the Romans, who arrived late in the third century b.c., who most greatly influenced all of Iberia. They built towns, industries, roads, and bridges, developed agriculture, and bequeathed the Latin language, of which Portuguese is a direct descendant. The Romans named the southwestern province of the peninsula Lusitania, oddly enough for one of the Celtiberian tribes they defeated, and by the third century a.d. had introduced Christianity. By the beginning of the fourth century the Algarve had a bishop in place, based in Faro. But Rome had already fallen into decay, and soon hordes of northern tribesmen took over the empire. The Algarve fell to the Visigoths in the mid-fifth century. Under Moorish Rule In a.d. 711, the Moors brought powerful armies from North Africa and launched a devastating attack on the Iberian peninsula, conquering much of what would become Spain and Portugal. They imposed Islam and left an indelible influence on the countryside and the population of the Algarve. The Moorish legacy can still be seen in the form of wells and waterwheels, squat white houses, the dark complexions of the people, and in the very name given the region — taken from Al-Gharb, which means \\"country of the west\\" (when the Moors conquered the territory, it was the most westerly in the known world). The Moors governed their Iberian kingdoms from across the border in Seville, but the Algarve had its own regional capital and huge, invulnerable fortress. The capital was Chelb (or Xelb), and it was bigger and better defended than Lisbon. Today the town, known as Silves, is a provincial outpost whose only besiegers are busloads of tourists who climb the narrow streets up to the old Moorish ramparts.

When recommending an app to a friend, it is crucial to consider their needs and preferences. In this case, the reviewer appears to have found significant educational value in the app, describing it as an \\"ocean of knowledge.\\" This implies that the app may have a vast database of information or a diverse range of subjects covered, making it suitable for individuals seeking to learn from a seemingly inexhaustible resource. Furthermore, the reviewer's statement, \\"I like it,\\" highlights that they find the app enjoyable and engaging. When an app is both educational and enjoyable, it is more likely that users will remain engaged, continue to learn, and extract value from it. In this case, recommending the app to a friend who has a similar interest in expanding their knowledge and a curiosity for learning would be a suitable choice. However, while the review is positive, it does not provide specifics about the app's functionality, user experience, or interface. These factors can significantly impact the overall experience and the likelihood that a friend will benefit from it or enjoy using it.

Multiple pumps may be connected in series, called stages, to achieve higher vacuums. The choice of seals, chamber geometry, materials, and pump-down procedures will all have an impact. Collectively, these are called vacuum technique. And sometimes, the final pressure is not the only relevant characteristic. Pumping systems differ in oil contamination, vibration, preferential pumping of certain gases, pump-down speeds, intermittent duty cycle, reliability, or tolerance to high leakage rates. Now answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\"): How can chamber geometry be connected?","response":"Chamber geometry isn't something that can be connected like wires or puzzle pieces. Instead, \\"chamber geometry\\" refers to the shape and design of the chamber in a vacuum system. It's one of the many factors that can affect how well the system works. So, you can think of it like building a sandcastle: the shape and design of your castle can affect how well it stands up to the waves and the wind."},{"question":"(CNN) -- The threatening calls reportedly came one after the other to Mexico's main Catholic seminary. Callers, claiming to be from one of the country's feared drug cartels, offered an ominous warning: Pay up if you value the safety of your priests. \\"They called several times. They identified themselves as the Familia Michoacana, but who knows?\\" Cardinal Norberto Rivera, archbishop of Mexico City, revealed at a Mass this week. \\"I spoke with the authorities. We made the appropriate report. Because they wanted us to pay. Because if not, they would kill one of us. They wanted to extort 60,000 pesos (4,600).\\" Reports of extortion have become increasingly common as drug cartels expand their reach in Mexico. But public denouncements of such attempts are rare. Rivera called on parishioners to report extortion to authorities, and he urged them not to pay. His description Sunday of the extortion attempts and a statement denouncing drug violence give a glimpse into the problems faced by a Catholic Church often caught in the crossfire of warring cartels and government efforts to stop them. In the country's capital alone, more than 10 priests have been threatened with extortion, said the Reverend Hugo Valdemar Romero, a spokesman for the archdiocese. \\"None of them have paid,\\" he told CNN. \\"Last year, two extortionists were arrested.\\" It's not uncommon for individual parishes to face extortion threats, he said. But the calls last month to the Seminary of the Archdiocese of Mexico marked the first time such a large church-run institution in the capital had been targeted, Romero said.

Some cynics also erroneously point out that the Federal Reserve makes more profit from dollar bills than dollar coins because they wear out in a few years, whereas coins are more permanent. The fallacy of this argument arises because new notes printed to replace worn out notes, which have been withdrawn from circulation, bring in no net revenue to the government to offset the costs of printing new notes and destroying the old ones.

Russia had already sent 177,000 soldiers to Manchuria, nominally to protect its railways under construction. The troops of the Qing Empire and the participants of the Boxer Rebellion could do nothing against such a massive army and were ejected from Manchuria. After the Boxer Rebellion, 100,000 Russian soldiers were stationed in Manchuria. The Russian troops settled in and despite assurances they would vacate the area after the crisis, by 1903 the Russians had not established a timetable for withdrawal and had actually strengthened their position in Manchuria. What were the 177,000 soldiers guarding?","response":"The 177,000 Russian soldiers were guarding the railways under construction in Manchuria.

The Head and the Tail events are short phrases possibly involving participants. The names of specific people have been replaced by generic words (e.g., PersonX, PersonY, PersonZ). PersonX is always the subject of the event. You have to determine whether, as a result of the Head, PersonX will be seen as what is mentioned in the Tail or not. In this task, PersonX will be seen as the Tail if the Tail describes PersonX's persona or attribute as perceived by others given an event. In the gift-giving example, X may be seen as generous or giving. In contrast, in an event such as PersonX steals a car, PersonX may be perceived as evil. Classify your answers into \\"Yes\\" and \\"No\\". The phrase may also contain \\"___\\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action. Q: Head: PersonX asks PersonY's boyfriend<sep>Tail: If he loves her A:","response":"Explanation: In this task, the Head event is \\"PersonX asks PersonY's boyfriend\\" and the Tail event is \\"If he loves her\\". We need to determine if, as a result of the Head event, PersonX will be perceived as the Tail event or not. Simple steps to solve this task: 1. Understand the Head event - \\"PersonX asks PersonY's boyfriend\\". 2. Understand the Tail event - \\"If he loves her\\". 3. Assess if the action mentioned in the Head event leads to the perception of the Tail event. In this case, the Head event is PersonX asking PersonY's boyfriend about his love for PersonY. The Tail event does not describe any attribute or persona of PersonX. Therefore, we cannot conclude that PersonX will be seen as \\"If he loves her\\" based on the given event.

Over.\\" said in Czech?","response":"In Czech, \\"Yeah, copy that. Over.\\" can be translated as \\"Ano, rozumím. Konec.\\" Here's a detailed breakdown of the phrase: 1. \\"Yeah\\" can be translated as \\"Ano\\" in Czech, which is an informal way of saying \\"Yes\\" or expressing agreement. 2. \\"Copy that\\" means that the message has been understood. In Czech, you can use \\"rozumím\\" which means \\"I understand\\" or \\"I comprehend.\\" 3. \\"Over\\" is often used in radio communication to indicate that the speaker has finished their message and is now awaiting a reply. In Czech, this can be translated as \\"Konec,\\" which literally means \\"End\\" or \\"the end.\\" So, when you put it all together, \\"Ano, rozumím. Konec.\\" can be used to convey the meaning of \\"Yeah, copy that. Over.\\" in Czech.

Options: - yes - it is not possible to tell - no Let's solve step-by-step:","response":"1. Analyze the sentence \\"A woman is shopping at an outdoor flea market.\\" - The subject is \\"a woman,\\" - The action is \\"shopping,\\" - The location is \\"an outdoor flea market.\\" 2. Compare it with the statement \\"A woman is selling stuff at a store.\\" - The subject is still \\"a woman,\\" - The action has changed to \\"selling stuff,\\" - The location is now \\"a store.\\" 3. Determine if the conclusion can be made. Based on the analysis, the original statement tells us that the woman is shopping, not selling stuff. Additionally, the location has changed from an outdoor flea market to a store. Therefore, we cannot conclude that \\"A woman is selling stuff at a store\\" based on the original statement.

Possible answers: --yes. --it is not possible to tell. --no.","response":"The given statement is \\"This man is working in a wood shop and wearing ear protection.\\" Based on this information, we can discern that the man is working in a wood shop, likely using power tools, heavy machinery, or other equipment that would necessitate wearing ear protection. Woodworking typically involves processes such as cutting, shaping, or assembling wooden materials to create furniture, cabinetry, or other items. The question presented asks us to conclude whether \\"The man is fixing a plumbing issue.\\" Given the information provided, we are not able to make this determination. A plumbing issue would involve problems with water supply, drainage systems, or fixtures such as pipes, taps, or other plumbing apparatus. These tasks would likely be undertaken by a plumber or someone with expertise in fixing such problems, rather than a woodworking professional. Furthermore, the location of the man, a wood shop, does not suggest that he is currently dealing with a plumbing issue. A wood shop typically entails an environment dedicated to woodworking tasks, and it is unlikely that fixing a plumbing issue would be a priority in such a place. Considering the information available, the appropriate answer is: --no. The man working in a wood shop and wearing ear protection does not provide any evidence to support the conclusion that he is fixing a plumbing issue. It is important to distinguish between the different types of tasks, expertise, and environments involved in woodworking and plumbing, as they require distinct knowledge, tools, and skills."},{"question":"Generate a sentence that contains a fact.","response":"The colossal blue whale, which is considered to be the largest animal on Earth, has a heart the size of a small car and its massive tongue alone can weigh as much as an adult elephant."},{"question":"Data: name = The Phoenix, food = Fast food, priceRange = moderate, customer rating = 1 out of 5, area = city centre.

OPT: 1. yes 2. it is not possible to tell 3. no","response":"Option 2: It is not possible to tell The initial sentence \\"A person carrying a child piggyback style on a beach chasing a frisbee rolling toward the water.\\" does not provide information that allows us to definitively say whether the child is reaching out to catch the frisbee. In the original statement, we learn that there is a person carrying a child on their back, known as piggyback style, on a beach. The only actions attributed to them in the statement are that they are chasing a frisbee that’s rolling toward the water. While it's reasonable to guess that the child would reach out to try and catch the frisbee, it is not guaranteed. The child might be too scared to reach out, they might not be interested in the frisbee, or they might not have the physical capability to catch the frisbee due to their position on the adult's back. Overall, the statement does not present sufficient data about the child's actions. Therefore, it is not possible to conclusively answer whether the sentence \\"The child reaches out to catch the frisbee.\\" is accurate. Any answer beyond this would be speculation.

Context: As U.S. political candidates make their final appeals, voters in 35 states will decide policy issues Tuesday that include legalizing recreational use of marijuana and restricting access to guns and ammunition, voting yes or no on nearly 160 state ballot initiatives. California's Proposition 64, which is leading in the polls, could create a multibillion-dollar marijuana industry by legalizing the recreational use the drug for adults in the state. Similar measures are on the ballot in Arizona, Nevada, Maine and Massachusetts. Marijuana could be legalized for medical use in Florida and three other states. Medical marijuana is already permitted in half the 50 U.S. states, and recreational use is allowed in Alaska, Colorado, Washington state, Oregon and the District of Columbia. Marijuana is banned under federal law, but U.S. officials have taken a hands-off approach on the issue. Voters in Maine and Nevada are considering measures that would expand background checks for gun purchases, which is already required for buying guns from dealers, by extending the provision to private sales. Californians will consider measures requiring background checks for buyers of ammunition and banning high-capacity ammunition magazines. Washington state has a measure that would allow the courts to bar the sale of guns to individuals deemed an extreme risk to themselves or others. Californians are considering whether to eliminate the death penalty with Proposition 62, or to maintain capital punishment and make the process more efficient with Proposition 66, which supporters say makes it more fair to victims of violent crimes.

The plastic is cheap and the pieces do not stay together. It is not worth one tenth the cost of the item. Keep it in the store. MGA should re-evaluate this item. Is the review positive or negative?","response":"The review provided is negative. The reviewer expresses their dissatisfaction with the Runway Disco toy that their daughter received as a Santa gift. Their main concerns revolve around the quality of the product and its high cost, which lead them to believe it is not a worthy purchase. The reviewer starts by sharing their personal experience with the toy, highlighting the difficulties they had in assembling the product. They mention that they had to put the same piece together ten times, suggesting that the process was frustrating, time-consuming, and likely complicated. This is an indication of poor design or unclear instructions and contributes to the overall negative impression of the toy. One of the major complaints in the review is the perceived poor quality of the materials used in the toy. Specifically, the reviewer feels that the plastic is cheap and the pieces do not stay together as they should. This further adds to the dissatisfaction, as buyers expect a product to be well-made and durable, particularly when it comes at a high cost. In terms of the toy’s value, the reviewer argues that it is not worth one-tenth of its cost, indicating that they find the price to be exorbitant in comparison to the actual quality and enjoyment provided by the toy. This is a strong critique, as it suggests that the product may potentially feel like a waste of money for other buyers considering the purchase. The review concludes with a stern recommendation for potential buyers to keep the product in the store, essentially advising against purchasing it. Additionally, the reviewer suggests that the manufacturer MGA should re-evaluate the item, which affirms the dissatisfaction with the toy and promotes the idea that it should be improved. In conclusion, the review is decidedly negative, as it showcases dissatisfaction with various aspects of the Runway Disco toy – its assembly process, overall quality and durability, and its price. The reviewer not only would not recommend the product but also calls for the manufacturer to take action and reassess the item's design and materials."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

In hot climates, clothing provides protection from sunburn or wind damage, while in cold climates its thermal insulation properties are generally more important. Shelter usually reduces the functional need for clothing. For example, coats, hats, gloves, and other superficial layers are normally removed when entering a warm home, particularly if one is residing or sleeping there. Similarly, clothing has seasonal and regional aspects, so that thinner materials and fewer layers of clothing are generally worn in warmer seasons and regions than in colder ones.

Dual dating uses two consecutive years because of differences in the starting date of the year, or includes both the Julian and Gregorian dates. Old Style and New Style (N.S.) indicate either whether the start of the Julian year has been adjusted to start on 1 January (N.S.) even though documents written at the time use a different start of year (O.S.), or whether a date conforms to the Julian calendar (O.S.) rather than the Gregorian (N.S.). The Gregorian calendar was a reform of the Julian calendar instituted in 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII, after whom the calendar was named, by papal bull Inter gravissimas dated 24 February 1582. The motivation for the adjustment was to bring the date for the celebration of Easter to the time of year in which it was celebrated when it was introduced by the early Church. Although a recommendation of the First Council of Nicaea in 325 specified that all Christians should celebrate Easter on the same day, it took almost five centuries before virtually all Christians achieved that objective by adopting the rules of the Church of Alexandria (see Easter for the issues which arose). Answer the following questions: 1. How is Old Style abbreviated? 2. How about new style? 3. Dual dating uses how many years in succession? 4. What dates are included in dual dating? 5. OS and NS dictate the start of what year? 6. When does Julian year begin? 7. The Gregorian calendar modified which version? 8. When was the Julian calendar modified?","response":"1. Old Style is abbreviated as \\"O.S.\\" 2. New Style is abbreviated as \\"N.S.\\" 3. Dual dating uses two consecutive years in succession. 4. In dual dating, both the Julian and Gregorian dates are included to account for the differences in the starting date of the year or to avoid confusion between the two calendar systems. 5. O.S. (Old Style) and N.S. (New Style) dictate the start of the Julian and Gregorian years, respectively. O.S. signifies that the date conforms to the Julian calendar, while N.S. indicates the use of the Gregorian calendar. 6. The Julian year traditionally began on different dates depending on the country or region, with many following the start date of March 25 or April 1. However, in 1752, Britain and its colonies, including the present-day United States, adopted the new style calendar, and the start of the Julian year was adjusted to begin on January 1. 7. The Gregorian calendar modified the Julian calendar. 8. The Julian calendar was modified by Pope Gregory XIII in 1582 with the introduction of the Gregorian calendar, as part of his mandate by the papal bull Inter gravissimas dated 24 February 1582. The primary motivation for this reform was to bring the date for the celebration of Easter closer to the time of year it was initially observed by the early Church, as well as to improve the accuracy and alignment of the calendar with the astronomical year."},{"question":"In these two sentences (1) He can hold his liquor. (2) To carry well, i.e. to hold the head high, with arching neck., does the word hold mean the same thing?","response":"In the two sentences provided, the word \\"hold\\" does not share the exact same meaning. However, both meanings do have a common foundation in the sense of maintaining control, stability, or position. Let's break down the differences and similarities in the meanings of \\"hold\\" in each sentence. 1. \\"He can hold his liquor.\\" In this sentence, the word \\"hold\\" refers to the ability to maintain control or stability in the face of a challenge or influence, in this case, alcohol. When someone says that a person can \\"hold their liquor,\\" it means that despite consuming alcohol, the person is still able to maintain a level of composure, mental clarity, and physical control. They may not get as visibly drunk or impaired as others might after consuming the same quantity of alcohol. 2. \\"To carry well, i.e., to hold the head high, with an arching neck.\\" In this instance, the word \\"hold\\" is used with a more physical connotation, referring to the manner in which one maintains their posture or position. When applied to holding the head high and having an arching neck, it conveys a sense of grace, confidence, and poise. Here, \\"hold\\" signifies the act of maintaining a specific physical stance, suggesting a conscious effort or exercise of control to achieve or maintain that stance. While there is a common theme of control and stability in both cases, the application and context are different. In the first sentence, \\"hold\\" relates to how well someone can manage the effects of alcohol on their body and maintain the appropriate behavior. In the second sentence, \\"hold\\" pertains to the physical aspect of maintaining a certain posture or position with one's head and neck. In summary, although the word \\"hold\\" in both sentences retains a certain level of control, stability, or position, their meanings don't align exactly. The first sentence involves controlling the effects of an external influence (alcohol), while the second sentence pertains to the conscious effort of maintaining a specific physical posture or stance."},{"question":"By. Steph Cockroft for MailOnline. A mother has released harrowing footage which shows the moment her motorcyclist son was killed instantly in a 97mph crash. David Holmes, 38, was killed in June last year when a car turned into his path on the A47 in Honingham, Norfolk, where the speed limit is 60mph. The devastating moment was captured on the camera which he wore on his crash helmet. Mr Holmes's last word, uttered seconds before impact, was 'whoa'. Now his mother Brenda, 62, has decided to release the footage in a bid to stop others going through the same agony of losing a family member. Scroll down for video. A mother has released harrowing footage showing the moment her motorcyclist son was killed in 97mph crash on the A47 in Honingham, Norfolk. The devastating moment was captured by the camera which he wore on his crash helmet. The car is seen turning into his path as Mr Holmes drives along the road. The last word that he utters seconds before the impact - 'whoa' - can be heard on camera. The retired nurse wants both motorcyclists and drivers to be more aware of each other on the roads, to stop more crashes like this taking place. She said that the driver - who has since admitted causing death by careless driving - did not see the motorcyclist, but that Mr Holmes, who was driving nearly 40mph over the speed limit, also did not have time to take 'evasive action'. She said: 'I want to be involved in this campaign because I feel something positive can come out of his loss. 'If we can prevent one accident; one family going through what we have been through then David would not have died in vain. It is not easy to do but I hope somebody benefits from seeing it.' Mr Holmes was travelling back from King's Lynn, Norfolk, where he had been with colleagues. He overtook several cars on his powerful bike in the minutes leading up to the fatal crash. He was thrown from his Yamaha FJR1300 into the trees and pronounced dead at the scene. The car then drives into Mr Holmes's path, killing him instantly on impact. Mr Holmes was thrown from his Yamaha FJR1300 into the trees and pronounced dead at the scene. Speaking about the crash, his mother said: 'I know he rode fast that day. He loved speed and motorbikes. 'The driver did not see him and turned right across his path. David did not have time to take evasive action.' In the video, Mrs Holmes tells how her son, who worked at the British Antarctic Survey and had recently returned from The Antarctic, was first bought a motorbike for his 16th birthday. She said: 'We brought it back home in the back of his Dad's truck, He was jumping up and down with excitement. It was fabulous. A lovely, lovely memory. Mr Holmes, who worked at the British Antarctic Survey, was first bought a motorbike for his 16th birthday. His mother Brenda, 62, has agreed for the footage to be released as part of a police road safety campaign. 'Although his father said he wishes he had never bought him that first bike, I would not have deprived David his 22 years of riding.' She said he was 'the most wonderful son' and was described by his friends as a 'gentleman and a legend'. Chief Inspector Chris Spinks, head of the Norfolk and Suffolk Roads Policing Unit, said he was 'confident' that the clip would save a life. In just three days, the video, recorded on the motocyclist's camera, has been watched by almost 4.5million people. He said: 'David's family have always been of the belief that if this video could save just one life then it would be worth it. 'Unfortunately, we'll never know if we have achieved this but I'm confident, with the level of interest that we will.' Benjamin Austin, the driver of the Renault car that struck Mr Holmes, pictured, pleaded guilty to causing a death by careless driving. In April this year, Benjamin Austin, the driver of the Renault car that struck Mr Holmes, pleaded guilty to causing a death by careless driving. He was subsequently ordered to perform 130 hours of unpaid work. His driving licence was also suspended for 18 months. The court heard Austin admitted he had not seen Mr Holmes before making the turn. In passing sentence, Judge Veits said no one had suggested Austin had been driving dangerously, but he had made a mistake that 'sadly' too many other drivers also make, of 'simply' not seeing the motorcycle. Headded: 'Nothing I can impose can turn the clock back and undo the tragic consequences of the accident that sadly took away the life of Mr Holmes. I only hope the family of Mr Holmes can now move on as this case is concluded and attempt to rebuild their lives.'

The conductor Adrian Boult recalled, \\"Just before the Armistice, Gustav Holst burst into my office: 'Adrian, the YMCA are sending me to Salonica quite soon and Balfour Gardiner, bless his heart, has given me a parting present consisting of the Queen's Hall, full of the Queen's Hall Orchestra for the whole of a Sunday morning. So we're going to do The Planets, and you've got to conduct'.\\" There was a burst of activity to get things ready in time. The girls at St Paul's helped to copy out the orchestral parts, and the women of Morley and the St Paul's girls learned the choral part in the last movement.The performance was given on 29 September to an invited audience including Sir Henry Wood and most of the professional musicians in London. Five months later, when Holst was in Greece, Boult introduced The Planets to the general public, at a concert in February 1919; Holst sent him a long letter full of suggestions, but failed to convince him that the suite should be played in full. The conductor believed that about half an hour of such radically new music was all the public could absorb at first hearing, and he gave only five of the seven movements on that occasion.Holst enjoyed his time in Salonica, from where he was able to visit Athens, which greatly impressed him. His musical duties were wide-ranging, and even obliged him on occasion to play the violin in the local orchestra: \\"it was great fun, but I fear I was not of much use\\".

The notion of the ‘worried well’ is certainly alive and kicking. Vitamin and mineral supplements are big business. Reported figures in Australia suggest that 27% of women and 15% of men take some form of supplement with vitamin C, B complex, multivitamins, vitamin E and calcium all being popular choices. Contrary to the rationale for needing supplements in the first place, people who take supplements are more likely to be healthier than people who don’t take supplements. Supplement users also tend to be leaner, smoke less, exercise more, and eat more fruit and vegetables. While it may seem obvious that people who take supplements likely consume more nutrients from their regular diet to start with, this hasn’t been well studied in large population groups. Using data from a nationally representative government health survey, researchers from the United States looked at the mineral intake from food and supplements of over 8000 men and women between 2003 and 2006. The results were clear cut: people taking mineral supplements were consuming more minerals from their normal diet than those who didn’t take supplements. The observation was even stronger in women than in men. The eight most popular mineral supplements taken were calcium, iron, magnesium, zinc, phosphorus, copper, potassium and selenium. Proving that it is possible to have too much of a good thing, supplement users were more likely to be exceeding the recommended upper level of intake for magnesium, zinc, iron and calcium. For someone who believes that they are reasonably healthy and are conscious of what they eat most of the time, taking a mineral supplement ‘just in case’ offers little to no benefit. According to the above context, answer the following question. What did the research participants ingest? Answer:","response":"The research participants ingested mineral supplements, specifically calcium, iron, magnesium, zinc, phosphorus, copper, potassium, and selenium. They also consumed minerals from their normal diet. The study found that people taking mineral supplements were consuming more minerals from their normal diet than those who didn't take supplements."},{"question":"I'll give you a question, please answer with step-by-step reasoning process.

Low pay: Housework is usually done by individuals themselves at home and not necessarily for pay. Therefore, low pay is not a direct consequence of a long day of housework. 2. Become tired: Doing housework involves physical tasks like cleaning, organizing, and maintaining the home. Spending a long day doing these tasks can be energy-consuming, which may cause the individual to become tired. This option is a potential consequence. 3. Nice home: Doing housework improves the cleanliness and organization of one's home. As a result of spending a long day on housework, the home may indeed look nicer. This option is also a potential consequence. 4. Boredom: Housework may not be the most engaging activity, and it's certainly possible that doing it for an extended period could result in boredom for some individuals. This option is a potential consequence as well. 5. Dizziness: Dizziness is not typically a direct consequence of doing housework. However, if the individual is working without taking breaks, not drinking enough water, or using strong chemical cleaners without proper ventilation, dizziness could occur.

He is also known as a notable author of Latin prose. In 60 BC, Caesar, Crassus, and Pompey formed a political alliance that dominated Roman politics for several years. Their attempts to amass power as \\"Populares\\" were opposed by the \\"Optimates\\" within the Roman Senate, among them Cato the Younger with the frequent support of Cicero. Caesar's victories in the Gallic Wars, completed by 51 BC, extended Rome's territory to the English Channel and the Rhine. Caesar became the first Roman general to cross both the Channel and the Rhine, when he built a bridge across the Rhine and crossed the Channel to invade Britain. These achievements granted him unmatched military power and threatened to eclipse the standing of Pompey, who had realigned himself with the Senate after the death of Crassus in 53 BC. With the Gallic Wars concluded, the Senate ordered Caesar to step down from his military command and return to Rome. Caesar refused the order, and instead marked his defiance in 49 BC by crossing the Rubicon with the 13th Legion, leaving his province and illegally entering Roman Italy under arms.

However, I will do my best to provide you with a detailed explanation and translation of the given text. Looking at the text, it appears to be related to European Union (EU) regulations, specifically a name and registration number for either a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) or Protected Geographical Indication (PGI). These are legal frameworks that protect the names of regional food products, like cheeses, wines, or certain types of meat. PDO and PGI help safeguard the authenticity of products and preserve the traditions associated with their production. Now, let's break down the text and provide translations for each segment: - EU No: This stands for European Union Number, which is a unique identifier for the particular product or rule. Translation: \\"Číslo EU\\" - FR-PDO-0105-01277: This code appears to be a registration number for the product, divided into country code (FR for France, in this case), the type of designation (PDO or PGI), and two separate numerical sequences. Translation: \\"FR-PDO-0105-01277\\" - 17.11.2014: This is likely the date when the regulation or product registration took effect or was updated. Translation: \\"17.11.2014\\" - PDO (X) PGI (): These two acronyms, enclosed in parentheses with X indicating the active designation, stand for Protected Designation of Origin and Protected Geographical Indication, as discussed earlier. Translation: \\"PDO (X) PGI ()\\" - 1. Name(s): This refers to the name or names of the product or designation in question. It is common for products to have more than one name, based on languages or regional variations. Translation: \\"1.

Options: - liquid nitrogen - steam room - tidal waves - ocean - crushed ice Explain why a human would choose \\"crushed ice\\" to answer the question above: The answer to this question is:","response":"\\"crushed ice\\" To make a cup of water colder, a human would choose crushed ice over the other options - liquid nitrogen, steam room, tidal waves, and ocean - for several reasons. These reasons include safety, accessibility, practicality, and effectiveness. 1. Safety: Using crushed ice to cool a cup of water is the safest option among those given. Liquid nitrogen, being an extremely cold substance, has the risk of causing frostbite or other injuries if not handled properly. Also, due to the Leidenfrost effect, adding liquid nitrogen to water may result in an explosion. A steam room would not lower the water temperature, but rather increase it, as it uses hot steam to warm up the room. Tidal waves and ocean would not be relevant options for cooling water and can pose potential danger or inconvenience to humans. 2. Accessibility: Crushed ice is widely available and easy to obtain. It can be found in ice trays at home, purchased from stores, or sourced from ice machines at social facilities. On the other hand, liquid nitrogen requires special handling, and acquiring it might not be feasible for daily use. A steam room, being a specific type of room designed for relaxation and an increased room temperature, eliminates this choice as an option. Furthermore, ocean and tidal waves are natural phenomena that don't directly apply to the context of cooling a cup of water. 3. Practicality: The process of cooling water using crushed ice is convenient and straightforward. Simply adding crushed ice into a cup of water will effectively lower its temperature as the ice melts and absorbs the heat from the water. Meanwhile, liquid nitrogen demands technical expertise, protective gear, and specialized equipment for safe handling. A steam room, again, is not suitable due to its function of raising a room's temperature instead of lowering it. Lastly, ocean and tidal waves are not practical options for cooling down a single cup of water. 4. Effectiveness: Crushed ice is effective in cooling water due to the process of heat transfer. When the ice interacts with water, it absorbs heat from the water, causing the ice to melt and the water temperature to decrease. This leads to a quick and efficient cooling of the water. Conversely, liquid nitrogen, although effective in cooling, poses a significant risk due to its extreme temperature and handling difficulties. A steam room would not provide any cooling effect on the water, while ocean and tidal waves don't offer a direct, effective method to cool a cup of water. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"crushed ice\\" to cool down a cup of water as it is the safest, most accessible, practical, and effective option among those provided."},{"question":"Come up with a question and stream of consciousness reasoning that would justify this answer: no","response":"Question: Is it possible for a person to survive without water for a month? Stream of consciousness reasoning: When considering whether it is possible for a person to survive without water for an entire month, we should evaluate the human body's essential need for water and the time frame in which dehydration can become life-threatening. The human body is composed of about 60% water, and it plays a vital role in various functions such as temperature regulation, digestion, and nutrient transportation. Additionally, water is essential in removing waste and toxins from the body. Typically, a person can survive only about three days without water, depending on factors like temperature, physical activity, and overall health. After that point, severe dehydration sets in, which can lead to dizziness, confusion, and ultimately organ failure and death. So, when we evaluate the possibility of surviving without water for an entire month, we come to the conclusion that it is not feasible given the adverse effects of prolonged dehydration on the human body.

Christine was bedridden and couldn't move but not Kayla because","response":"Kayla had been regularly practicing yoga and strength training exercises for years, which had enhanced her overall physical fitness, flexibility, and mental resilience. This consistent dedication to her health enabled her to better adapt to any adversities or physical challenges that she may encounter in life. Although Christine was bedridden due to a combination of factors, including a severe illness, lack of physical activity, and possibly a poor diet, Kayla had always maintained a conscious effort to live a healthy lifestyle. She understood the importance of wellness and its impact on every aspect of her daily life, from her energy levels and mood, to her ability to withstand physical strain and recover quickly from injury. As they were faced with this unfortunate situation, Christine and Kayla began to truly comprehend how their lifestyle choices could drastically affect their overall well-being and energy in both the short and long term. While Christine was bedridden, Kayla's energy and physical capabilities were crucial to helping manage essential tasks for them both. During this difficult time, Kayla took on the responsibility of caretaking, running errands, cooking, and making sure Christine had everything she needed. Day after day, she cared for Christine, performing tasks diligently and ensuring that their home environment remained as comfortable as possible for her friend. Throughout this challenging period, Kayla's commitment to her own health became all the more apparent, evident in her ability to handle the extra strain of their situation without becoming unwell or overburdened herself. Through yoga and meditation, she took the time needed to maintain her mental well-being, ultimately equipping herself to better handle the emotional stress of the situation. Additionally, by adhering to a nutritious, balanced diet, she ensured her body was sufficiently fueled for the physical demands placed upon her. As time passed and Christine slowly began to recover, Kayla persisted in her unwavering support, encouraging her friend to make healthier lifestyle choices by sharing her knowledge about exercise, mindfulness, and nutrition. Through their bond, they started down the path of healing together, embarking on a journey towards renewed health and fortifying their friendship even further. In conclusion, Kayla was not bedridden like Christine because her dedication to a healthy lifestyle, incorporating both physical fitness activities and mental resilience techniques, played a pivotal role in her overall well-being. Her maintained energy and strength during this time showcased the importance of fostering our own health, and in turn, served as an important lesson to her friend, Christine, on the value of embracing healthy habits and cultivating resilience in the face of adversity."},{"question":"Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Who wrote the novels on which a mecha anime series by Studio Fantasia is loosely based on, and whose writings were serialized in St Nicholas Magazine from December 1887?

Context: SEOUL — Arms control experts estimate that the dismantlement of North Korea’s nuclear program could take a decade to complete, and cost 20 billion, if a nuclear agreement is reached between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un when they meet in Singapore on June 12. “The hard work has not yet begun, and it is gong to take sustained energy on the part of the United States, South Korea, Japan, China and North Korea. It’s going to be a multiyear long process,” said Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association in Washington. President Trump has said he expects a \\"very positive result\\" from the North Korea nuclear summit, but he also said it will likely be the beginning of a process to resolve differences over the extent of the North’s denuclearization, and the specifics regarding what sanctions relief, economic aid and security guarantees would be offered in return. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Sunday that North Korea would only receive sanctions relief after it takes \\"verifiable and irreversible steps to denuclearization.\\" This position aligns closer to the Kim government’s stance that denuclearization measures and concessions be matched action for action. And it backs away from demands made by some in the president’s national security team that Pyongyang quickly and unilaterally dismantle all its weapons of mass destruction before any concessions would be offered. North Korea is estimated to have 20 to 80 nuclear warheads, both known and covert nuclear research and processing sites, and thousands of ballistic missiles that can be launched from mobile vehicles, and submarine based launchers have been tested in recent years. With such an extensive nuclear arsenal it could cost 20 billion to achieve the U.S. goal of complete, irreversible, and verifiable nuclear dismantlement (CVID), according to a recent study conducted by Kwon Hyuk-chul, a Kookmin University professor of security strategy. Kwon based his assessment in part on past nuclear deals... Question: What is probably true about Kwon Hyuk-Chul?

Question: suppose less heat available happens, how will it affect higher temperature used. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect","response":"If less heat is available in the process, it will have the following effects on the steps: 1. Salt water is contained in a factory or plant - No effect. This step remains the same since it does not rely on heat. 2. The water is boiled to a very high temperature - Less effect. With less heat available, it might be challenging to achieve the desired high temperature for boiling, which may lead to slower evaporation or less efficient separation. 3. The salt becomes separated from the water - Less effect. If the water does not reach the required high temperature, the salt separation process may get affected and might be slower or less effective. 4. The salt is removed - No effect. The actual removal of salt may not be affected by heat, but a lower separation efficiency in the previous step might lead to the removal of smaller quantities of salt. 5. The water is able to be drank at this point - Less effect. If the temperature is not high enough for efficient salt separation, the resulting water might still contain some salt, making the water not entirely safe for consumption. In summary, the perturbation of less heat available will have less effect on the higher temperature used and the salt separation process in general. The second effect mentioned, which is the salt becoming separated from the water, will also experience a less effect due to this perturbation."},{"question":"Here is a news article: President Barack Obama and House Republicans clashed in a meeting Thursday afternoon over how soon the government can be reopened, even as the GOP offered to lift the debt limit for six weeks, according to sources familiar with the session. House Republicans told Obama at the White House that they could reopen the federal government by early next week if the president and Senate Democrats agree to their debt-ceiling proposal. After the debt ceiling is lifted, a House GOP aide said they would seek some additional concessions in a government funding bill. Text Size - + reset Boehner offers temporary debt hike Lew warns about debt ceiling Obama repeatedly pressed House Republicans to open the government, asking them “what’s it going to take to” end the shutdown, those sources said. He questioned why the government should remain closed if both sides agreed to engage in good-faith negotiations on the budget, according to a Democratic source briefed on the meeting. (WATCH: 10 great quotes on debt ceiling fight) The meeting was described by both sides as cordial but inconclusive. Obama acknowledged to Republicans that notable progress had been made. Sources described the meeting without attribution, because the meeting was private. Aides will continue the discussion through the night to see if they could find common ground on how to move forward on the debt limit and government funding. The short-term debt hike — which was originally proposed at the closed GOP meeting Thursday — did not include plans to reopen the government. Obama agreed to review the House Republican proposal for reopening the government, but reiterated that he wouldn’t pay a ransom, the Democratic source said. At the meeting, Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) described the Republicans’ process as being two steps: passing the debt ceiling bill, and then opening a broad budget conference before the government can be reopened. (PHOTOS: 18 times the government has shut down) Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) told Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and Treasury Secretary Jack Lew that this was a “good-faith” effort by Republicans. Ryan said both sides should “put their guns back in their holsters” — a bid to reach an agreement to avoid default, reopen the government and start broader budget talks. Biden was mostly quiet in the meeting but did say at one point that Obama has made concessions as president that he hasn’t seen in 36 years in the Senate. Publicly, House Republicans were mum when they returned to the Capitol. “We had a very useful meeting,” Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) said, upon returning from the White House Thursday evening. “It was clarifying I think for both sides as to where we are and the takeaway from the meeting was, our teams are going to be talking further tonight, we’ll have more discussion, we’ll come back to have more discussion. The president said that he would go and consult with the administration folks and hopefully we can see a way forward after that.” (PHOTOS: Debt ceiling fight: 20 great quotes) A senior House GOP aide said Obama “did not say yes or no to House Republicans’ offer.” Both sides are continuing talks tonight, according to the aide. The White House said Obama had a “good meeting” with House Republican leaders that lasted about 90 minutes. “After a discussion about potential paths forward, no specific determination was made,” according to a White House readout. “The President looks forward to making continued progress with members on both sides of the aisle.” For much of Thursday, it appeared that Washington slowly edged away from a potential default on Thursday as congressional leaders crafted plans to raise the debt ceiling ahead of the Oct. 17 deadline.

(POLITICO's full government shutdown coverage) Obama met separately with Senate Democrats and House Republicans at the White House. Senate Republicans will meet with Obama on Friday morning. The talk in the House GOP visit centered around Speaker John Boehner’s proposed measure to lift the debt ceiling through Nov. 22, while banning Treasury from employing so-called extraordinary measures to keep paying the nation’s bills. The legislation had no corresponding spending cuts, as other debt ceiling bills had. The legislation would also set up a negotiation over the borrowing cap and government funding. At this time, there are no spending cuts attached to the legislation. There is also no vote scheduled. If Obama buys into the GOP plan, senior Republican sources say that Boehner could have enough internal political capital to move a bill next week to reopen government until Nov. 22. Across the Capitol, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is taking the temperature of his own GOP colleagues on ways to reopen the government — which has been shuttered for 10 days — and raise the debt ceiling. Among the options under consideration is a proposal building on the work of Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) that would raise the limit for two months and reopen the government for six months in return for a repeal of Obamacare’s medical device tax, a requirement to means test those seeking Obamacare subsidies and provide more flexibility for agencies to maneuver around the sequester. Though ideas to move on from the budget mess are growing, there’s no consensus yet. A White House official sounded cool to the House GOP plan and offered support for a Senate Democratic proposal to raise the debt ceiling through the end of 2014, reiterating that the government should reopen and the debt ceiling be raised ahead of any talks.

Obama was accompanied by Vice President Biden, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, White House chief of staff Denis McDonough and deputy chief of staff Rob Nabors. The White House statement said the administration officials “listened to the Republicans present their proposal,” adding that Obama’s goal remains to both raise the debt ceiling and reopen the government. House Republican leaders initially offered a six-week increase in the federal debt ceiling in exchange for negotiations with President Obama on longer-term “pressing problems,” but they stopped short of agreeing to end a government shutdown now in its 10th day. Later in the day, Senate Republicans put forward a plan that would reopen the government and raise the federal debt limit for as long as three months. Returning to the Capitol after meeting with Obama at the White House, members of a 20-strong House Republican delegation described the session as a good first step. The White House denied a news report that Obama had rejected the House GOP’s proposal outright, saying that “no specific determination was made” after Obama, Vice President Biden and top officials listened to the presentation. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) said the gathering was “a very useful meeting” and indicated that conversations would continue into the evening. “It was clarifying, I think, for both sides as to where we are,” he said. “We put an offer on the table,” Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), chairman of the House Budget Committee, told reporters. Obama “didn’t say yes; he didn’t say no,” Ryan said. “We’re continuing to negotiate this evening.” Earlier, in a news briefing following a closed-door meeting of House Republicans to present a plan to raise the debt limit temporarily, House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) said, “What we want to do is offer the president today the ability to move a temporary increase in the debt ceiling.” He described the offer as a “good-faith effort on our part to move halfway to what he’s demanded in order to have these conversations begin.” Obama is “happy” that House Republicans agree a federal debt default is not an option, but he would prefer a longer extension of the debt limit, White House spokesman Jay Carney said after the plan was disclosed. Boehner did not immediately tell reporters specifics of the plan. But the speaker made clear that House Republicans were not agreeing to Obama’s demand that they pass legislation to fund the government without partisan riders, thereby ending the first government shutdown in 17 years. [See the latest updates on the shutdown.] In any case, Boehner’s proposal fell flat in the Senate, where members of both parties were clamoring to end the shutdown. Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.), speaking to reporters after a White House meeting between Obama and Senate Democrats, said the shutdown must end and the debt ceiling must be raised ahead of negotiations with the Republicans, who he complained keep changing their demands. “This is a situation where they do not know what they want,” Reid said. His message to the GOP: “Open the government. Pay our bills. We’ll negotiate with you about anything.” Reid also said that Senate Democrats would “look at anything [House Republicans] send us,” but when asked about negotiating with them before reopening the government, he replied: “Not going to happen.” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), meanwhile, was consulting fellow Republican senators to develop a proposal, advanced by Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), to end the shutdown and raise the federal debt limit for as long as three months. The package sparked the first bipartisan negotiations since the standoff began in early September. But Collins’s proposal called for Democratic concessions including repeal of a tax on medical devices needed to fund Obama’s health-care initiative, and it would maintain deep budget cuts known sequestration through at least March. The House GOP plan would suspend the debt limit until Nov. 22, the Friday before Thanksgiving, while also forbidding Treasury Secretary Jack Lew from using “extraordinary measures” that his department has used in recent years to extend his borrowing authority for weeks after the ceiling is reached, according to a senior GOP aide who was in the room. This creates a hard “X date,” as financial analysts call the issue, leaving no wiggle room beyond that day. The House Republicans essentially are offering a “clean” debt-limit increase in exchange for negotiations over reopening the government, aides said. The government shutdown would not end until Obama agreed to “structural reforms” to the tax code and federal health programs. The Republican plan for a six-week increase in the debt limit, without conservative strings attached, was aimed chiefly at calming jittery financial markets, according to senior GOP advisers. Financial markets soared earlier Thursday on the first sign of optimistic news out of Washington in almost a month, with the Dow Jones industrial average up 169 points in the first 15 minutes of trading. The rally continued when Boehner confirmed the plan at an 11 a.m. press briefing, and by 1:30 p.m. the Dow was up more than 225 points. The plan was presented to the House GOP caucus Thursday morning after Lew warned lawmakers that he would be unable to guarantee payments to any group — whether Social Security recipients or U.S. bondholders — unless Congress raises the federal debt ceiling. If the GOP plan goes over well with rank-and-file Republicans, Boehner could put the legislation on the floor for a vote late Thursday, aides said. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) described the plan at the news briefing as “a temporary extension of the debt ceiling in exchange for a real commitment by the president and the Senate majority leader to sit down and talk about the pressing problems” facing the country. Rep. Kevin McCarty (R-Calif.), the House majority whip, characterized these problems as “drivers” of increasing federal debt. Obama has indicated he could support a short-term debt-limit hike, but he has also demanded that Republicans allow the government to reopen before he would negotiate with the GOP. If the Republicans want to negotiate, they should “reopen the government, extend the debt ceiling,” Obama said last week. “If they can’t do it for a long time, do it for the period of time in which these negotiations are taking place.” Carney, the White House spokesman, told reporters Thursday afternoon: “The president is happy that cooler heads at least seem to be prevailing in the House, that there at least seems to be a recognition that default is not an option.” However, Obama “believes it would be far better . . . to raise the debt ceiling for an extended period of time,” as Senate Democrats are proposing. “It would be far better for the economy if we stopped this episodic brinksmanship and . . . mothballed the nuclear weapon here, which is the threat of default, for a longer duration,” Carney said. “But it is certainly at least an encouraging sign that . . . they are not listening to the debt-limit and default deniers.” If Republicans now recognize that default cannot be permitted, he added, “why keep the nuclear weapon in your back pocket?” [Members of Congress are collecting pay during the shutdown.] The first reactions from Republican House members appeared generally positive. But several insisted they would back the measure only with a commitment from the president to open negotiations over the next debt-ceiling hike. “All we’re doing is saying, if the president hasn’t come towards us, we’ll just move the deadline out and offer it again,” said Rep. John Fleming (R-La.). “We haven’t changed our position. We’ve just changed the timeline.” Fleming rejected the idea that the proposal represents a concession from Republicans. “Not really, if we get a concession from the president, to sit down and negotiate. If he doesn’t agree to that, I won’t agree to the debt ceiling.” Meanwhile, several of the House’s most conservative members withheld comment about the proposal. “I’m not very enthusiastic,” Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) said without elaborating. Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.), chairman of the Republican Study Committee, was noncommittal when asked about the plan and said his support depends on what happens in the meeting with the president Thursday. “Some of this involves a conversation with the president,” Scalise said. “There’s nothing unilateral that can be done. It’s going to involve having the president finally put some things on the table of his own.” Heritage Action for America, a conservative advocacy group influential with tea party Republicans, said Thursday that while it remains committed to fighting Obama’s health-care law and opposes “clean debt ceiling increases,” it wants to give House GOP leaders “the flexibility they need to refocus the debate on Obamacare.” Therefore, the group said, it will not include votes in favor of the proposal in its rankings of lawmakers’ conservatism. The plan would meet Obama’s demand for an increase in Treasury’s borrowing authority without any legislative attachments. But it would set the stage for tough negotiations, possibly lasting until Thanksgiving, over bigger fiscal matters, since the tentative plan calls for only a six-week increase of the debt limit. Advisers cautioned that Boehner’s often unruly caucus, which has repeatedly rejected leadership initiatives in the past, needs to sign off on the plan before it can advance. Reacting to the GOP proposal, a White House official said: “It is better for economic certainty for Congress to take the threat of default off the table for as long as possible, which is why we support the Senate Democrats’ efforts to raise the debt limit for a year with no extraneous political strings attached.” Obama also wants House Republicans to allow a vote on the “clean” government funding bill that has been passed by the Senate, the official said. “Once Republicans in Congress act to remove the threat of default and end this harmful government shutdown, the president will be willing to negotiate on a broader budget agreement,” the official added. “While we are willing to look at any proposal Congress puts forward to end these manufactured crises, we will not allow a faction of the Republicans in the House to hold the economy hostage to its extraneous and extreme political demands. Congress needs to pass a clean debt-limit increase and a funding bill to reopen the government.” Financial experts much prefer a longer-term extension of the debt ceiling, but even a brief extension would ease some of the turmoil that has been brewing on Wall Street. By the time markets closed Monday afternoon, the Dow had dropped 900 points in 14 trading days, losing almost 6 percent of its value. Just three weeks ago, Boehner’s leadership team presented a plan to lift the debt ceiling accompanied by a one-year delay of Obama’s health-care law and a litany of other conservative domestic policy demands. With Washington in gridlock and a key deadline in the debt-limit debate just one week away, Lew told the Senate Finance Committee Thursday morning that he would do all he can to minimize the pain of breaching the 16.7 trillion debt limit. But Lew also told the senators that in an unprecedented situation in which he would be relying entirely on the erratic flow of incoming revenue, the economy would suffer and there would not even be certainty that the government could make all interest and principal payments. “No credible economist or business leader thinks that defaulting is good for job creation or economic growth,” Lew said. “If Congress fails to meet its responsibility, it could be deeply damaging to the financial markets, the ongoing economic recovery, and the jobs and savings of millions of Americans.” Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), a key conservative with ties to leadership and more junior tea party-backed colleagues, said Thursday morning that he and his colleagues “potentially” could support the new GOP debt-ceiling plan. “We think there needs to be some movement in dealing with the overall problem,” he said. “It’d be nice to get some dollar-to-dollar cuts there.” Asked whether he could support a short-term increase without related cuts, Jordan said he expected that question would be the primary topic of conversation among House Republicans on Thursday. Amid growing anxiety about a debt default, Republicans in the House and the Senate floated ideas Wednesday for raising the debt limit — if only for a short time — in hopes of forcing Obama to the negotiating table. One of the most significant ideas was brewing in the House, Ryan briefed conservatives on a plan to raise the debt limit for six weeks, which would give party leaders time to negotiate a broad agreement to overhaul the tax code and trim federal health-care and retirement spending. The plan, which Ryan sketched in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece Wednesday, was short on details. And it called for spending cuts of roughly 200 billion to cover the cost of raising the debt limit even in the near term — although senior GOP advisers said late Wednesday that they were also considering an increase with no strings attached. Lew’s appearance is the first public confrontation between a senior administration official and Republicans since the fiscal showdown began last month. The meeting comes as some lawmakers on Capitol Hill are questioning whether the administration has been too alarmist about the threat of going past an Oct. 17 deadline to raise the debt ceiling. Republicans have cited reports by credit-rating firms saying that the United States would not technically default unless it fails to make interest payments on its debt — which they regard as unlikely. Echoing points made by Republican presidents and officials in prior administrations, Lew is tried to counter that argument by highlighting the broad risks of leaving the government with no borrowing authority. “Certain members of the House and Senate believe that it is possible to protect our economy by simply paying only the interest on our debts, while stopping or delaying payments on a number of our other legal commitments,” Lew said. “The United States should not be put in a position of making such perilous choices for our economy and our citizens. There is no way of knowing the irrevocable damage such an approach would have on our economy and financial markets.” For example, officials say, Lew pointed out that the Treasury routinely refinances about 100 billion in debt every week, paying back principal and taking on new debt. He noted that should investors back away from Treasury debt, it could make refinancing difficult and throw the country’s financial markets into even greater chaos. Lew said the administration will face a series of difficult decisions even if Treasury can avoid what the credit-rating firms consider a default. In a scenario where federal spending will far exceed revenue, he said, the administration would have only imperfect options in deciding whom to pay. Officials say Lew will try to push Republicans to decide whom they wouldn’t pay — Social Security recipients or veterans. “We are relying on investors from all over the world to continue to hold U.S. bonds . . .,” Lew said. “If U.S. bondholders decided that they wanted to be repaid rather than continuing to roll-over their Treasury investments, we could unexpectedly dissipate our entire cash balance.” A Treasury official said Wednesday night that Obama would have to make the final decision in such a scenario. Lew confronted a Senate Finance Committee stocked with Republicans who have been skeptical about the administration’s claims that breaching the debt limit would be catastrophic. Among the committee’s members is Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.), who has championed the notion that the Treasury Department could avoid chaos in financial markets by continuing to make interest payments to investors. The senior Republican on the panel, Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (Utah), has also expressed doubts about the risk of a debt-ceiling breach. But on Wednesday, Hatch acknowledged that blowing the Oct. 17 deadline would “scare the hell out of people.” And while Treasury might be able to pay interest on the debt, Hatch said, “the real question is whether it’s going to tank the stock market.” Obama, when he meets Thursday with House GOP leaders, is planning to emphasize his refusal to “pay ransom” to avoid default and reopen the government. Ryan, nonetheless, held out hope that the “meeting at the White House will allow us to work together and find common ground.” Thursday’s meeting is the second in a series the White House announced Wednesday aimed at breaking the impasse, reopening the government and raising the 16.7 trillion debt limit. Obama met first with House Democrats late Wednesday and plans to meet with each party in the Senate in the coming days, starting with a meeting with the Senate Democratic caucus Thursday. Obama invited the entire 233-member GOP House conference to join him at the White House, but Republicans decided to send only an 18-member group comprising top leaders and key committee chairmen, including Ryan, Appropriations Chairman Harold Rogers (Ky.) and Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp (Mich.). “Nine days into a government shutdown and a week away from breaching the debt ceiling, a meeting is only worthwhile if it is focused on finding a solution,” Brendan Buck, a spokesman for Boehner, said in a statement. “That’s why the House Republican Conference will instead be represented by a smaller group of negotiators.” The White House said Obama is “disappointed” by Boehner’s decision to limit Republican attendance and emphasized that Obama will not be negotiating. “The president thought it was important to talk directly with the members who forced this economic crisis on the country about how the shutdown and a failure to pay the country’s bills could devastate the economy,” White House press secretary Jay Carney said in a statement. Obama “will talk to anyone anytime . . . but will not pay the Republicans ransom for doing their job,” Carney said. “If the Republicans want to have a real discussion, they should open the government and take the threat of default off the table.” Republicans on Capitol Hill, meanwhile, circulated a memo from one of the nation’s leading credit-rating agencies that seemed to play down the threat of default. In the memo, Moody’s Investors Service said the Treasury Department is likely to continue paying interest on the government’s debt even if Congress refuses to lift the limit on borrowing, preserving the nation’s sterling AAA credit rating. “We believe the government would continue to pay interest and principal on its debt even in the event that the debt limit is not raised, leaving its creditworthiness intact,” said the Oct. 7 memo. “The debt limit restricts government expenditures to the amount of its incoming revenues; it does not prohibit the government from servicing its debt. There is no direct connection between the debt limit (actually the exhaustion of the Treasury’s extraordinary measures to raise funds) and a default.” The memo offered a starkly different view of the consequences of breaching the debt limit than is held by the White House, many policymakers and other financial analysts. Over the weekend, economists at Goldman Sachs said the economy would take a devastating hit even if Treasury kept making payments on the debt, because the pullback in federal spending would amount to roughly 175 billion, or 4.2 percentage points of gross domestic product. Mohamed El-Erian, the chief executive of PIMCO, the world’s largest bond company, agreed that the administration could take steps to contain the worst damage. But, he said, there would still be severe consequences. “It would avoid a series of major and cascading disruptions to the functioning of a financial market that is at the heart of the core of the global financial system,” he said. “Having said that, equities and other risk assets would still likely sell off hard.” Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) noted that Moody’s analysis is geared toward the well-being of its own investors, not average Americans. “When they say their clients will be okay, they’re not talking about people on Society Security, Medicare or our troops in the field. Moody’s doesn’t give a damn about any of those people.” William Branigin, Rosalind S. Helderman and Scott Wilson contributed to this report. ||||| Still, the House Republican offer represented a potentially significant breakthrough. Even if Democrats found fault with the Republicans’ immediate proposal — for example, it would prevent the Treasury secretary from engaging in accounting maneuvers to stave off potential default — it was seen as an opening gambit in the legislative dance toward some resolution before the government is expected to breach its debt limit on Thursday. Even before the meeting, the White House and its Democratic allies in Congress were all but declaring victory at the evidence that Republicans — suffering the most in polls, and pressured by business allies and donors not to provoke a government default — were seeking a way out of the impasse. After some fretful weeks, the Democrats believe, Mr. Obama was seeing some payoff for his big gamble this year. Burned by his experience with House Republicans in mid-2011, when brinkmanship over the debt limit hobbled the already weak economy, Mr. Obama began his second term vowing never again to negotiate over raising the ceiling or to give any concessions to Republicans for performing an act that is their constitutional responsibility. “The good news is that Republicans have accepted the principle that they’re not going to attach conditions to the debt ceiling,” said Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the senior Democrat on the House Budget Committee. “The bad news is they’ve only extended the debt ceiling for six weeks.” Photo For House Republicans, the maneuvers represented a near-reversal of their original strategy in September of going to the mat over the debt limit but not shutting down the government. Now, under pressure from falling poll numbers and angry business supporters, they are seeking a compromise on the debt ceiling. Yet for now, they are still refusing to finance and reopen the government without some concessions. Mr. Boehner and his colleagues left the White House without speaking to waiting reporters, and quickly gathered in his Capitol suite for further discussion. Their debt limit proposal could come to a vote as soon as Friday. Before the White House meeting, administration and Congressional Democrats said they were skeptical that House Republican leaders could pass the proposal. A large faction of Tea Party conservatives campaigned on promises never to vote to increase the nation’s debt limit. And Congressional Democrats vowed to oppose any proposal that did not also fully finance a government now shuttered since the fiscal year began Oct. 1.

Senate Democrats had their own White House meeting with Mr. Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. three hours before the House Republicans arrived, and the majority leader, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, declined to embrace the Republicans’ debt limit proposal until he saw it. He told reporters that Democrats would not negotiate on further deficit reductions until House Republicans agreed to the measure passed by the Senate to finance and open the government through mid-November. Advertisement Continue reading the main story “Not going to happen,” Mr. Reid said. “Open the government,” he added. “There is so much pain and suffering out there. It is really tear-jerking, to say the least.” Separately, members of the Senate’s Republican minority, who are to meet with Mr. Obama on Friday, worked on a proposal for full-year government funding — at levels reflecting the across-the-board spending cuts known as sequestration, but giving agencies flexibility to shift money around. They are considering adding it to any short-term debt limit increase that the House might pass and send to the Senate. Mr. Ryan said before the White House meeting that Republicans were now willing to formally negotiate with Senate Democrats over a long-term, comprehensive budget framework. The Republicans have resisted such a move since April, fearing that it would require compromises, like raising additional tax revenues, that would enrage the party’s conservative base heading into the 2014 midterm elections. Many House Republicans, leaving a closed-door party caucus earlier Thursday that at times grew contentious, said they would support their leadership’s short-term debt limit proposal. But they said they would do so only if Mr. Obama agreed to negotiate a broader deficit reduction deal, with big savings from entitlement programs. The president has insisted he will not agree to significant reductions in projected Medicare and Medicaid spending — even his own tentative proposals — unless Republicans agree to raise revenues by curbing tax breaks for corporations and wealthy individuals. And Mr. Boehner in recent days reaffirmed the party’s anti-tax stance, which suggests that future talks could founder. Economists across a broad spectrum agree that breaching the debt limit would damage the economy. The new Republican proposal could temporarily remove that threat. ||||| A summary of this is?","response":"House Republicans clashed with President Barack Obama over reopening the government while offering a temporary increase to the debt limit.

The first statement talks about a group of women who are making flower arrangements behind a green counter.

The important information here is that these are girls, typically implying they are younger than adult women, and they are occupied with an academic activity, namely writing a test. 4. We can notice that there are two significant differences between the two statements: a. The participants differ in age: women vs. girls. b.

You have two terms with the variable c: -26c and +82c. Combine these terms by adding them together. -26c + 82c = 56c Step 2: Rewrite the equation with the simplified terms. Now the equation looks like this: 56c - 280 = 0 Step 3: Isolate the variable (c). To do this, you want to get c by itself on one side of the equation. Start by moving the constant term (-280) to the other side of the equation. You can do this by adding 280 to both sides: 56c - 280 + 280 = 0 + 280 Which simplifies to: 56c = 280 Step 4: Solve for c. Now, to solve for c, you need to divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of c, which is 56: 56c / 56 = 280 / 56 This simplifies to: c = 5 Therefore, the solution for the equation -26c + 82c - 280 = 0 is c = 5."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: What is the name of the person who warned conductor Eduard Nápravník that \\"I shan't be at all surprised and offended if you find that it is in a style unsuitable for symphony concerts\\"? Answer the above question based on the context below: Tchaikovsky remained abroad for a year after the disintegration of his marriage. During this time, he completed Eugene Onegin, orchestrated his Fourth Symphony, and composed the Violin Concerto. He returned briefly to the Moscow Conservatory in the autumn of 1879. For the next few years, assured of a regular income from von Meck, he traveled incessantly throughout Europe and rural Russia, mainly alone, and avoided social contact whenever possible. During this time, Tchaikovsky's foreign reputation grew and a positive reassessment of his music also took place in Russia, thanks in part to Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoyevsky's call for \\"universal unity\\" with the West at the unveiling of the Pushkin Monument in Moscow in 1880. Before Dostoyevsky's speech, Tchaikovsky's music had been considered \\"overly dependent on the West\\". As Dostoyevsky's message spread throughout Russia, this stigma toward Tchaikovsky's music evaporated. An unprecedented acclaim for him even drew a cult following among the young intelligentsia of Saint Petersburg, including Alexandre Benois, Léon Bakst and Sergei Diaghilev.Two musical works from this period stand out. With the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour nearing completion in Moscow in 1880, the 25th anniversary of the coronation of Alexander II in 1881, and the 1882 Moscow Arts and Industry Exhibition in the planning stage, Nikolai Rubinstein suggested that Tchaikovsky compose a grand commemorative piece. Tchaikovsky agreed and finished it within six weeks. He wrote to Nadezhda von Meck that this piece, the 1812 Overture, would be \\"very loud and noisy, but I wrote it with no warm feeling of love, and therefore there will probably be no artistic merits in it\\". He also warned conductor Eduard Nápravník that \\"I shan't be at all surprised and offended if you find that it is in a style unsuitable for symphony concerts\\".

Although I mentioned this to my “so called” lawyer, he refused to mention her unstable psychological condition in the court. I believe by doing so, he also committed a crime by preventing a child sexual abuse case go unveiled.

Thomson was largely self-taught. His experiences as a graphic designer with Toronto's Grip Ltd. honed his draughtsmanship. Although he began painting and drawing at an early age, it was only in 1912, when he was well into his thirties, that he began to paint seriously. His first trips to Algonquin Park inspired him to follow the lead of fellow artists in producing oil sketches of natural scenes on small, rectangular panels for easy portability while travelling. Between 1912 and his death in 1917, Thomson produced hundreds of these small sketches, many of which are now considered works in their own right, and are mostly found in the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto, the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg and the Tom Thomson Art Gallery in Owen Sound.Thomson produced nearly all of his works between 1912 and 1917. Most of his large canvases were completed in his most productive period, from late 1916 to early 1917. The patronage of James MacCallum enabled Thomson's transition from graphic designer to professional painter. Although the Group of Seven was not founded until after his death, his work was sympathetic to that of group members A. Y. Jackson, Frederick Varley, and Arthur Lismer. These artists shared an appreciation for rugged, unkempt natural scenery, and all used broad brush strokes and a liberal application of paint to capture the beauty and colour of the Ontario landscape. Thomson's art also bears some stylistic resemblance to the work of European post-impressionists such as Vincent van Gogh. Other key influences were the Art Nouveau and Arts and Crafts movements of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, styles with which he became familiar while working in the graphic arts. The answer is:","response":"The first name of the person whose art bears some stylistic resemblance to the work of European post-impressionists such as Vincent van Gogh is Tom. The artist being discussed is Tom Thomson, who was a Canadian artist known for his brilliant oil sketches of natural scenes and an important influence on the Group of Seven."},{"question":"When do you get out of a bed? Options: - footbed - during the day - awake - sleep - floor Step-by-step reasoning process below:","response":"To determine when to get out of bed, consider the following steps: 1. Assess your state of mind: Begin by checking whether you are awake or asleep. You can only get out of bed when you are awake. If you are asleep, you won't be able to make the conscious decision to exit the bed since you will be unconscious during sleep. 2. Gauge the time of day: Assess whether it's day or night. In general, people tend to get out of bed during the day when they need to start their daily activities. While some may work night shifts and sleep during the day, the majority follow a regular daytime schedule. 3. Evaluate your position in bed: Consider your current position in the bed. If you are lying down, you will need to transition to an upright position to get out of bed. You'll want to ensure that you have adequate room to move and that you won't accidentally hit your face or body on any nearby objects. 4. Find a stable footing: Locate a suitable spot to place your feet when exiting the bed, such as the floor. A stable surface is necessary to safely stand and support your body weight. Stepping on an unstable surface like a pillow or blanket can cause you to lose balance or trip. 5. Prepare to step out of bed: If you are now awake, lying in bed during the day, and have found an appropriate spot to place your feet, you can move forward with the process of getting out of bed. Begin by shifting your body towards the edge of the bed and placing your feet on the stable surface (floor). 6. Get out of the bed: With your feet on the floor, gently push yourself up using your arms while simultaneously swinging your legs over the edge of the bed. You should now be in a seated position on the edge of the bed. Gradually stand up, using your legs, core, and arms for support and balance as needed. Based on these steps, the correct option when to get out of bed would be during the day, given that you are awake and have located a suitable spot to place your feet on the floor."},{"question":"Jordan helped Riley find her way back to the start.

How should I start preparing for IPCC Apr'17? Please tell me if those questions are the same. Options are: A). no B). yes","response":"The questions are the same as they both ask about preparing for IPCC. So, the answer is B). yes. Now, let's focus on providing a detailed and long answer to the question of how to prepare for IPCC (The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India - Integrated Professional Competence Course). 1. Understand the course structure and requirements: Start by understanding the IPCC syllabus, which is divided into two groups, each consisting of four subjects. Group 1 includes Accounting, Business Laws, Ethics, and Communications, Cost Accounting, and Financial Management, while Group 2 covers Advanced Accounting, Auditing, and Assurance, Information Technology and Strategic Management, and Taxation. 2. Develop a study plan: A well-structured study plan is crucial for success. Develop a timeline, set goals for each subject, and divide your study sessions into manageable chunks. Allocate enough time for each subject according to its weightage in the exam. Make sure you have ample time for revisions and practice. 3. Choose the right study material: Select comprehensive study materials and reference books for each subject. Start with the study materials provided by ICAI and refer to quality reference books to deepen your understanding of the concepts. Verify that your study materials are updated with the latest syllabus and exam pattern. 4. Join a coaching institute or study group: Joining a coaching institute can help you get expert guidance and clarify your doubts. It can also provide structure and discipline to your preparation. Alternatively, you can join a study group to share notes, discuss issues, and keep yourself motivated. 5. Focus on conceptual understanding and practical application: The IPCC exam tests your understanding of concepts and their practical application. Focus on understanding the fundamental concepts and do not rely solely on memorization. Practicing various problems and case studies can help you improve your practical application skills. 6. Prepare thoroughly for each subject: Do not ignore or skip any subject, as each subject carries equal weightage. Develop a study routine that ensures you cover the entire syllabus and complete multiple revisions. 7. Maintain regularity and discipline: Consistency is the key to success in competitive exams. Set daily targets and adhere to your study schedule. Avoid procrastination and maintain a disciplined approach to your preparation. 8. Practice mock tests and previous year papers: Attempting mock tests and previous years' question papers can help you identify your weak areas and improve your time management skills. Analyze your performance after each test and learn from your mistakes. 9. Revise and refresh your knowledge: Revision is crucial for retaining information and maintaining confidence. Allocate dedicated time for revising each subject regularly. Create short notes and summaries to facilitate revision during the final stages of preparation. 10. Stay positive and confident: Maintaining a positive attitude and strong self-belief is essential for success. Do not let self-doubt or stress affect your preparation. Practice stress management techniques, get proper rest, and maintain a healthy lifestyle. In conclusion, preparing for IPCC requires persistence, dedication, and a methodical approach. By adhering to a well-planned study schedule, focusing on conceptual understanding, utilizing the right resources, and continuously evaluating your performance, you can achieve success in the IPCC examination."},{"question":"Summarize: Mark Barnes said the attack on some versions of the Echo let him do almost anything he wanted to it. Mr Barnes managed to enter the device's software innards via connections found on its base. He said taking over the device was \\"trivial\\" once an attacker had access to an Echo. Amazon's Echo uses artificial intelligence (AI) to respond to voice commands from users to carry out many different functions, including answering queries, playing songs and ordering goods from a retailer. The hack started by peeling off the rubber base of the Echo to expose a grid of electrical contacts, wrote the researcher from MWR Info Security in a blog. Connecting to one of the contacts let Mr Barnes watch the Echo's boot-up procedure and work out how it was configured. Armed with this knowledge Mr Barnes wrote software that, once loaded on a small memory card and connected to one contact pad, gave him control over the device. Using this he examined how it handled audio and then created attack code which forwarded everything it heard to a remote server. That deep access meant he had complete control over the code the device ran and what it did with customer data, he said. Amazon did not comment directly on Mr Barnes' findings but said in a statement: \\"Customer trust is very important to us. \\"To help ensure the latest safeguards are in place, as a general rule, we recommend customers purchase Amazon devices from Amazon or a trusted retailer and that they keep their software up-to-date.\\" The security researcher acknowledged that the requirement to get physical access to the device to carry out the attack was a \\"major limitation\\". However, he added, it was possible that Echo owners would take their devices with them on holidays or business trips - situations that could expose them to attack. Second-hand devices may also be compromised in some way. The attack was carried out on the versions of the Echo that were released in 2015 and 2016. More recent versions of the Echo are not susceptible to the same attack. Mr Barnes recommended that hardware makers start assessing novel gadgets on their ability to resist physical attacks \\"as early as possible\\". \\"Product recalls and modifications can be expensive in post-production, so physical security should be considered throughout the development life cycle,\\" he said.","response":"A man named Mark Barnes found a way to control some older versions of a device called the Echo. The Echo is a smart speaker made by Amazon that listens to your voice and does things like play music and answer questions. Mark took off a part of the Echo, connected some things to it, and was able to control it and listen to what people say. But, he needed to touch the Echo to do this, which means it's harder to do unless the person is close by.

While children (IV) and critical organs, particularly the brain (VI), are also affected by mental illness, these are essentially subsets of 'an organism' and 'people'. However, if we're looking at more specific impacts, they could potentially be considered correct answers as well. Mental illness does not affect films (II), photographs (V), inanimate objects (VII), or the nervous system (I) per se.

It's a story about a big, scary shark that scares a lot of people. Well, this movie has changed how some grown-ups think about sharks. They saw the movie and thought that the only way to solve the problem of sharks is by getting rid of them. This research showed that Jaws has influenced leaders in a place called Western Australia (that's a state in a country called Australia). After the movie Jaws came out, some politicians or leaders in Western Australia started saying that it's okay to kill sharks because they are dangerous. Even though there are many kinds of sharks and not all of them are scary or harmful, people still got scared because of that movie. So, those politicians thought that they had to do something, and they did what they saw in the movie - they wanted to find and kill sharks. Many people today still think that the only solution to the shark situation is to catch and kill them, all because of that movie! But actually, sharks are important for our oceans. They help to keep the seas healthy and can balance the food chain. In conclusion, the movie Jaws made people think that killing sharks is the right thing to do, even when they aren't hurting anyone.

UPDATED:. 12:10 EST, 22 February 2013. A mother-of-six was hailed a hero today after she dragged an unconscious neighbour from his £140,000 Bentley convertible as it exploded into a huge fireball. Karen Buckland, 39, put 'her life on the line' to save the 49-year driver after she found him slumped at the wheel at the silver GTC supercar as it was bursting into flames on his driveway. Despite the obvious danger, Mrs Buckland opened the driver's side door of the blazing vehicle then used all of her strength to hoist him to safety. As she did so the fire ripped through the rest of the luxury vehicle - leaving it a burnt out wreck. Wreckage: Karen Buckland dragged her neighbour from his £140,000 Bentley convertible as it exploded in to flames on his driveway in Marple, near Stockport, Manchester. Brave: Mother-of-six Karen Buckland has been commended for her bravery after putting her 'life on the line' to save her neighbour. The driver - a wealthy accountant with three children - was later treated in hospital for the effects of smoke inhalation but made a good recovery. He has moved out of the neighbourhood. Mrs Buckland was today commended for her bravery by Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service. Mrs Buckland, from Marple, near Stockport, said: 'I actually feel guilty thinking about how I could have saved him sooner and stopped his car exploding. We weren't that friendly, otherwise I would have popped over to say hello earlier.' Lucky escape: Mrs Buckland managed to drag the 49-year-old man to safety just moment before the entire car went up in flames. Quick thinking: Mrs Buckland could smell electrics burning in her kitchen and heard a huge bang. She then found her neighbour unconscious in his car with the engine compartment on fire. She added: 'My husband nearly had to. drag me to the awards ceremony - frankly I didn't know what the fuss was. about. I was overwhelmed when I found out the whole thing had been put. on especially for me. 'The. fact is my 16-year-old our daughter Morgan was there too and she was. brilliant, taking all the information from the control room and a. neighbour helped as well - and the crews were obviously also very good. Lifesaver: Karen Buckland grabbed her neighbour under his arms and dragged him away from the car. 'I was so touched and lost for words,. all I could say was that these fire fighters do what I did every day -. they are the real heroes in my opinion.' The. incident occurred when Mrs Buckland, who works as a director of. enrichment at a local grammar school came home from work and and after. dinner realised she could smell burning. Mrs Buckland, who lives with property. developer husband Eain, 52, said: 'Eain was still at work, so Morgan and. I were watching television. 'I went to fetch something from the kitchen and smelt an electrical burning smell. I checked on the tumble drier and then shouted upstairs to our friend, who is staying with us, if he knew. 'He told me the man next door, who was still sat in his car, had been revving it. I went to the front door and there was a huge bang. The front of his Bentley was on fire and the flames were spreading fast. 'He was sat behind the wheel with his head facing down and the flames were coming through the windscreen.' With the flames towering above the car and spreading up the walls of the house - burning the ivy and causing the windows to crack - all Mrs Buckland could think about was rescuing the man before he burned to death. She said: 'I didn't reason, I just did it. I didn't think about myself or anything else; it's all a bit of a blur but I managed to get him. As I went out, the car exploded and I just thought I had to get him out of there.' Mrs Buckland grabbed the man under the arms and pulled him from danger while her daughter Morgan called 999 and asked for help. Morgan took instructions from the GMFRS Control Room and crews from Marple and Offerton fire stations arrived shortly after and tackled the blaze and took over from Karen and gave first aid to the man. Presentation: Karen Buckland being presented with a County Fire Officer's Commendation with her husband Eain her daughter Morgan and Chief Officer Steve McGuirk. Mrs Buckland said: 'As he lay on the. ground unconscious, he looked in a bad way - he was singed, covered in. smoke and foaming and gurgling from the mouth. That image is hard to. forget. 'Even now I. drive up to our house, I can spot where the tiles have been replaced in. next door's driveway because of the damage - and what happens comes. flooding back. It's a constant reminder. Well-deserved: Karen Buckland pictured holding her award next to her proud daughter Morgan. 'It wasn't until later and I saw the damage to the car that I realised how bad the fire was. 'Morgan had some flashbacks, but apart from that we've been okay - we're just happy he's alive. 'I think it would have been much more difficult for us if the outcome had not been a good one. 'It's so fortunate that I went out exactly when I did, it would have been very difficult to get to him. 'I was meant to be there, I was meant to save him - if it had been another minute, it would have been a very different story. 'I didn't think about the danger to me - you do whatever you can to help someone survive and not think about the consequences for yourself. 'The fire also made me understand just how fantastic my daughter is and how calm she can be in a crisis.' Inquiries revealed the accidental blaze had been caused by an 'over revving' of the car's engine. County Fire Officer Steve McGuirk said: 'It is without doubt in the minds of all those emergency service personnel who attended the incident on the day that, had Karen not displayed the utmost bravery and ignored the risk to her own life, the man would most certainly have lost his. 'Karen put her life on the line - watched by her family - to save this man and let there be no underestimation of the courage and strength of character that such actions take.'

Identify the information provided in the first statement: In the first statement, we know that there is a man with a mustache, and he is standing in an empty street. However, there is no information about the time of day or the exact location within the street. 3. Analyze the second statement: The statement suggests that a man is standing in the middle of the street during the night.

Available choices: 1). unacceptable. 2). acceptable.","response":"The test sentence, \\"We abandoned the area,\\" is an acceptable English sentence in terms of grammar. Let's dissect the sentence and analyze its grammatical components: 1. Subject: \\"We\\" is a pronoun that serves as the subject of the sentence. In this case, \\"we\\" refers to two or more people, implying that a collective decision lies behind the action. 2. Verb: \\"abandoned\\" is the past simple tense of the verb \\"abandon.\\" The verb in this sentence agrees with the subject in terms of grammatical number, as it affects a plural subject. Moreover, using the past tense properly indicates that the action occurred in the past. 3. Object: \\"the area\\" serves as the object of the sentence, which receives the action of the verb. The definite article \\"the\\" points to a specific area, while \\"area\\" operates as a noun that gives context to the abandonment. In addition to satisfying the rules of grammar, the sentence is concise and conveys a clear meaning. The actions taken and the context are both easily understood. Therefore, the test sentence is indeed option 2 - an acceptable English sentence."},{"question":"Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Won't play in DVD player Review: Ordered this as Christmas gift.

This insulin helps in allowing the blood sugar, or glucose, to be absorbed by cells in the body for energy.

She left her milk and cookies on the kitchen counter and went down another flight of stairs, which came out in the Recreation Room. Macy could hear the sound of the TV coming from Media Room. She tiptoed to the open doorway and peeked in. There she was--that conniving slut--sitting where Macy should have been. How could Elmo have replaced her like that? She thought he had been falling in love with her. How could she have been so wrong? But it could still happen--if that woman would just go away. Elmo said, \\"Yeah.

Question: suppose No food consumption occurs happens, how will it affect the pancreas working HARDER. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","response":"Less effect. The pancreas works in two main ways - endocrine function (producing hormones that regulate blood sugar levels) and exocrine function (producing digestive enzymes that help break down food in the small intestine). In the absence of food consumption, the demand for the production of digestive enzymes is reduced. This essentially means that the exocrine function of the pancreas is utilized less. Therefore, the pancreas doesn't have to work as hard to produce these enzymes, leading to a reduced workload for the pancreas and hence a 'less effect'. The second effect you mentioned in your statement seems to be the pancreas' endocrine function: the production insulin and glucagon, hormones that help regulate blood sugar levels. With no food being consumed, blood sugar levels will drop. In response, the pancreas will produce less insulin (because insulin's job is to lower blood sugar by helping cells absorb glucose), and it will produce more glucagon (which raises blood sugar by signalling the liver to convert stored glycogen into glucose). However, this process doesn't necessarily mean the pancreas is working harder, it's simply altering the types of hormones it's producing in response to the body's needs. Thus the perturbation due to lack of food affects the balance of hormone production but doesn't make the pancreas work harder in a physical sense, denoting a 'less effect'."},{"question":"Given the question: What is the name of the character that shares a home with Shadow?

People wear sunglasses in the summer but not in the winter because the Select from the following. [I] summer is very cold.. [II] winter is very cold..","response":"People typically wear sunglasses in the summer but not in the winter because the intensity of the sunlight and UV radiation is generally higher in the summer months. This extended response will consider various factors that contribute to this difference in behavior across seasons, which can be divided into four main categories: the physical aspects relating to the position of the Earth in relation to the Sun, the physiological impacts of sunlight on the human body, the cultural associations between sunglasses and certain seasons, and the practical considerations that might affect the adoption of sunglasses. The first reason why people wear sunglasses in the summer but not in the winter lies in the physical nature of Earth's movements around the Sun. Earth is tilted on its axis, so during the summer months, the hemisphere experiencing summer is tilted towards the sun. This results in longer daytime hours and more direct sunlight, which increases the strength of the Sun's rays. In contrast, during the winter months, this hemisphere is tilted away from the Sun, leading to shorter daylight hours and less direct sunlight. Consequently, the need for eye protection is heightened in the summer when the risks associated with UV exposure are higher. Secondly, we can consider the physiological impacts of sunlight on the human body. UV radiation from the Sun can be harmful to the eyes, leading to conditions such as cataracts, macular degeneration, and even skin cancer in the eyelids. Because the intensity of UV radiation is generally greater in the summer months, wearing sunglasses becomes more crucial as a protective measure for the eyes. In contrast, in the winter, the lower intensity of UV radiation, the more subdued sunlight, and often cloudier weather means that sunglasses may not be needed as much for eye protection. Moreover, cultural factors also play a vital role in explaining the different habits of wearing sunglasses across seasons. Sunglasses have long been associated with summer, warmth, and holidays. People tend to associate sunglasses with an image of basking on a sandy beach or exploring a balmy city in the summer months. This cultural association likely influences our unconscious behaviors - people reach for sunglasses in the summer because it 'feels right'. On the other hand, winter is commonly associated with indoor activities and a lowered necessity for sun protection, hence the reduced usage of sunglasses. Lastly, practical considerations can impact whether people choose to wear sunglasses in the summer versus the winter. In the summer, activities such as swimming, beachgoing, or hiking can mean that there is not only high sun exposure but also a risk of glare from surfaces like water or sand, necessitating the use of sunglasses. In contrast, the nature of winter activities can mean that regular glasses or goggles are more suitable. For instance, people partaking in winter sports like skiing or snowboarding may opt for goggles instead of sunglasses for better protection and visibility. In conclusion, the use of sunglasses is dictated more by the season of summer primarily due to reasons tied to Earth's rotation, the physiological protection from sunlight needed by the human body, cultural norms, and practical activity-related needs. Even though one should protect one's eyes year-round, the perceived need for this protective gear - in this case, sunglasses - seems to be intensified during the hotter, longer days of the year."},{"question":"Choose your answer from options.

In case B, would the number of mesopredators be less or more than in case A? John was studying the species in Siberia. He found that the Siberian tiger is an apex predator. It had a pretty stable population during the sixteenth century. He noted that information as case A. Then with the introduction of guns the number of Siberian tigers decreased in the seventeenth century. He noted that information as case B. Hint: Apex predators can have profound effects on ecosystems, as the consequences of both controlling prey density and restricting smaller predators, and may be capable of self-regulation. They are central to the functioning of ecosystems, the regulation of disease, and the maintenance of biodiversity. When introduced to subarctic islands, for example, Arctic foxes' predation of seabirds has been shown to turn grassland into tundra. Such wide-ranging effects on lower levels of an ecosystem are termed trophic cascades. The removal of top-level predators, often through human agency, can cause or disrupt trophic cascades. For example, reduction in the population of sperm whales, apex predators with a fractional trophic level of 4.7, by hunting has caused an increase in the population of large squid, trophic level over 4 (carnivores that eat other carnivores). This effect, called mesopredator release, occurs in terrestrial and marine ecosystems; for instance, in North America, the ranges of all apex carnivores have contracted whereas those of 60% of mesopredators have grown in the past two centuries.

The location of the Acra is important for understanding how events unfolded in Jerusalem during the struggle between Maccabean and Seleucid forces. This has been the subject of debate among modern scholars. The most detailed ancient description of the nature and location of the Acra is found in Josephus' Antiquities of the Jews, where it is described as residing in the Lower City, upon a hill overlooking the Temple enclosure: ...and when he had overthrown the city walls, he built a citadel [Greek: Acra] in the lower part of the city, for the place was high, and overlooked the temple; on which account he fortified it with high walls and towers, and put into it a garrison of Macedonians. However, in that citadel dwelt the impious and wicked part of the multitude, from whom it proved that the citizens suffered many and sore calamities. The location of the \\"lower part of the city\\", elsewhere referred to as the \\"Lower City\\", at the time of Josephus (1st century CE) is accepted to be Jerusalem's south-eastern hill, the original urban center traditionally known as the City of David. Lying to the south of the Temple Mount, however, the area exposed today is significantly lower than the Mount itself. The top of the Mount is approximately 30 metres (98 ft) above the ground level at the southern retaining wall of the later Herodian-era expansion of the Temple enclosure. The elevation decreases to the south of this point. Josephus, a native of Jerusalem, would have been well aware of this discrepancy, yet is nevertheless able to explain it away by describing how Simon had razed both the Acra and the hill on which it had stood. Archaeological research south of the Temple Mount, however, has failed to locate any evidence for such large-scale quarrying. On the contrary, excavations in the region have uncovered substantial evidence of habitation from the beginning of the first millennium BCE down to Roman times, casting doubt on the suggestion that during Hellenistic times the area was significantly higher than it was at the...

However, I will try to provide a general overview of how Martin (or anyone) might not know something, and how it can be difficult to discern intentions based on actions. 1. How would Martin not know that that was not the case? There are several ways Martin might not be aware of a certain fact or situation. These reasons can be based on individual characteristics, external factors, or even the nature of the information itself. a. Lack of information or exposure: If Martin hasn't been exposed to the information required to know that something is not the case, he will remain unaware. This could be due to limited access to resources or the fact that no one has communicated the information to him. b. Misinterpretation or misunderstanding: Martin might have the relevant information but may have misunderstood or misinterpreted it, leading him to believe something different. c. Cognitive biases: People are subject to various cognitive biases that can affect their understanding or perception of a situation. Martin might be influenced by a bias that makes it difficult for him to recognize the truth of the matter. d. Willful ignorance: In some cases, people might actively choose not to know about a specific situation or topic. If Martin has some motivation to avoid certain information, he might remain intentionally uninformed. 2. How would Martin or anyone else know his intentions based on his actions? Understanding someone's intentions based on their actions can be challenging, as actions often don't convey the full depth of an individual's thoughts, feelings, or motivations. Here are some factors that can contribute to this complexity: a. Multiple interpretations: One action can often be interpreted in various ways, making it difficult to pinpoint the exact motivation behind the behavior. b. Unconscious motivations: People may sometimes act without being fully aware of their intentions, making it challenging for both themselves and others to determine the true driving force behind their actions. c. Disguised intentions: In some instances, individuals may intentionally hide their true intentions, acting in a way that is purposefully misleading. d. Cultural differences: People from different cultural backgrounds might interpret actions differently based on their unique cultural norms, making it challenging to understand someone's intentions universally. 3. On a scale from 0 to 5, where 0 is \\"no meaning overlap\\" and 5 is \\"means the same thing\\", how closely does the first sentence resemble the second one? After a careful analysis of both sentences, I would rate their similarity at around 2. While both sentences focus on the theme of uncertainty and understanding, they delve into distinct aspects of these concepts.

Never throw around false accusations and never judge your current lover by what people in your past did to you. Only resort to monitoring someone's device usage if these tips fail and your suspicions are not simply based on jealousy, but reasonable suspicion.","response":"If you've reached the point where you feel it's necessary to monitor someone's text messages, you must approach this task with caution and respect for their privacy. First, have a conversation with the individual, addressing any concerns or suspicions that you might have, and give them an opportunity to share their perspective and explain their behavior. Open, honest communication is key to resolving misunderstandings and building trust in any relationship. If this avenue doesn't alleviate your concerns and you still feel the pressing need to monitor their text messages, ensure that you have a legitimate reason and consider the potential legal consequences. In some jurisdictions, monitoring someone's private communication without their consent may be illegal, so it is important to stay informed and aware of your local laws. Assuming you've concluded that monitoring the text messages is necessary and are aware of the legalities, use reliable and secure apps or tools to obtain the information you need without causing further damage to your relationship. There are several third-party applications available on the market that claim to provide access to text messages on another person's device. Some popular options include mSpy, FlexiSPY, and Hoverwatch. These apps allow you to remotely view the contents of text messages, call logs, and social media messages on a target device. Keep in mind that using such apps has ethical implications, and they should only serve as a last resort when all other avenues have failed. When using any of these apps, be sure to carefully follow the installation instructions and set up the necessary permissions on the target device. This process can require physical access to the device, potentially raising suspicion or creating an awkward situation – so tread carefully. Also, consider the potential emotional impact and guilt that may arise from invading someone's privacy. Even if your suspicions are proven true, you may experience a significant internal conflict given the means by which you obtained the information. In conclusion, spying on text messages should only be considered as a last resort when all other avenues have been exhausted, and you have strong reasons to believe that there is something amiss in your relationship. Always prioritize open communication and understanding of each other's concerns before resorting to surveillance tactics. If you choose to monitor someone's text messages, do so in compliance with local laws and the ethical responsibilities you have toward the person whose privacy you are compromising. Remember, trust is a delicate and core component of any relationship, and repairing it can be exceedingly challenging once it is broken."},{"question":"Q: You are given a sentence in Italian.

Drawing from such concepts as the international scientific vocabulary and Standard Average European, linguists[who?] developed a theory that the modern Western languages were actually dialects of a hidden or latent language.[citation needed] Researchers at the International Auxiliary Language Association extracted words and affixes that they considered to be part of Interlingua's vocabulary. In theory, speakers of the Western languages would understand written or spoken Interlingua immediately, without prior study, since their own languages were its dialects. This has often turned out to be true, especially, but not solely, for speakers of the Romance languages and educated speakers of English. Interlingua has also been found to assist in the learning of other languages. In one study, Swedish high school students learning Interlingua were able to translate passages from Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian that students of those languages found too difficult to understand. It should be noted, however, that the vocabulary of Interlingua extends beyond the Western language families. What is the answer to this question: Along with Standard Average European, from what concept was Interlingua derived?","response":"Interlingua was derived from two main concepts: the international scientific vocabulary and Standard Average European. The international scientific vocabulary provided a significant source for technical and scientific terms, which are commonly shared among Western languages, while Standard Average European supplied the linguistic framework for the creation of Interlingua. By combining these two concepts, linguists developed the idea that modern Western languages were actually dialects of a hidden or latent language. This resulted in the formation of Interlingua, with the intention that speakers of Western languages would be able to understand it immediately, without prior study, since their own languages acted as its dialects."},{"question":"How to set up an eclectus habitat<br>Buy the largest aviary/cage possible.

In September, she was able to move down the aisle for her sister's wedding. Write an article based on these highlights.","response":"Title: Brave Sister Beats the Odds to Walk Down the Aisle at Wedding Once upon a time, there was a strong and determined girl named Mackenzie Gorden. One day, in June 2012, she had a big accident. She rolled her truck and hurt herself very badly. Mackenzie broke her neck, which made it very, very hard for her to move her body. The doctors told her that she might never be able to walk again. But Mackenzie didn't want to give up. She wanted to walk and move just like she did before the accident. So, she found a new kind of treatment called groundbreaking therapy. This special therapy helps people who can't walk learn how to walk again. The therapy kind of tricks the body by making it walk, even when the body has forgotten how to do that. Mackenzie worked very hard with her groundbreaking therapy. She practiced a lot and never stopped trying, even when it was tough. She was like a superhero, always fighting to get better. In September, there was a very special day for Mackenzie - her sister's wedding. Weddings are when two people who love each other get married, and they usually have their family and friends around them to celebrate. Mackenzie really, really wanted to walk down the aisle for her sister's wedding. The aisle is a path where people walk during the wedding ceremony. On the big day, Mackenzie's hard work, courage, and determination paid off. She walked down the aisle at her sister's wedding, just like she wanted to. Everyone who saw her was so proud and happy for her. Mackenzie proved that with lots of hard work and a little help from a special therapy, she could do amazing things.

Sabrina Bonner and Lionel Barthelemy, 31, allegedly covered the windows of a visiting room in the Toul detention centre, eastern France, to carry out the assault, the trial heard. Berthelmy was serving a sentence for domestic violence. According to the prosecution, the child was blindfolded by his mother, who then made him kneel on a chair and held him by the arms as Barthelemy raped his stepson. Bonner claimed she took part in the rape and filmed herself abusing the boy at other times because she feared Barthelemy. Her co-defendant, who has been diagnosed as a paranoiud schizophrenic, confessed to carrying out the rape but claimed he did it under pressure from Bonner. Evidence presented in court claimed that Bonner handed over video recordings, shot on a mobile phone, to Barthelemy of her sexually abusing the child on numerous occasions. She appeared in the dock of a court in Strasbourg charged with multiple sexual offences. The boy, who has not been named, is in care.

Sabrina Bonner, 25, and the boy's stepfather, Lionel Barthelemy, 31, are charged with multiple sexual assaults on the child, who is now eight and in care. It has been claimed they carried out the rape in the prison after covering the windows of the meeting room with black bin liners. Barthelemy has already admitted raping the boy, but he says that he only did so once after the act was prompted by Bonner. The boy's mother is also accused of sexually assaulting the boy at other times, filming those attacks and giving the recordings to Barthelemy while he was in jail. Schizophrenic Barthelemy was serving a three-year jail sentence for domestic abuse of his girlfriend at the time. Bonner says the prison incident and other rapes she filmed were carried out after her partner threatened her with violence if she did not comply. The trial, which is due to run for three days in Strasbourg, is threatening to expose a culture in French prisons which meant staff failed to notice an act of such brutality taking place. It is understood that prisoners were often allowed a degree of privacy for visits from partners, even though Bonner's visit was supposed to be supervised because he was in jail for domestic violence and had been diagnosed with schizophrenic tendencies. Yannick Pheulpin, a solicitor representing the boy, says that after the trial is over he may initiate action against the jail, in Toul, near Nancy, eastern France. Bonner has admitted carrying out multiple sexual assaults on her child during 2009 and 2010, recording them on her mobile phone and giving the phone's memory card to her imprisoned partner. She gave herself up to police in May 2011, shortly before Barthelemy was due to be released from prison. Her lawyer, Dominique Bergmann, said: \\"She will not try to minimise her responsibility.\\" The pair face up to 20 years in prison if convicted. ||||| A French mother who allegedly held down her four-year-old son while he was raped by his step-father in a prison visiting room went on trial in Strasbourg on Monday. In a case which could lead to the prison itself also facing legal action, Sabrina Bonner, 25, and the step-father, her partner Lionel Barthelemy, 31, are charged with multiple sexual assaults on the boy, who is now eight and in the care of social services. ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Barthelemy admits raping the child in the visiting room at the Toul detention centre in eastern France in February 2010, but claims it was an isolated act initiated by Bonner. She claims the prison incident and other rapes which she filmed were carried out under orders and the threat of violence from her partner, who allegedly listened to one assault from his prison cell on his mobile phone. The trial, which is due to run for three days, will shed light on why prison staff failed to stop, or even notice, an act of such brutality taking place during what was supposed to be a supervised visit to a prisoner serving a sentence for domestic violence who had been diagnosed as having schizophrenic tendencies. Prosecutors have indicated they will present evidence that black bin bags were used to cover the glass window of the door to the room in which the visit took place and that, as in other French prisons, this was standard practice to allow prisoners privacy with their partners during visits. Yannick Pheulpin, the advocate representing the little boy, said he intended, at the end of the trial, to initiate legal proceedings aimed at holding the prison to account for the suffering of the child. The prosecution alleges that Bonner blindfolded her son and made him kneel on a chair in front of Barthelemy, then held him by the arms as he was raped. \\"Mrs Bonner made herself an accomplice to the crime by bringing her son to the visiting room twice on the same day: once in the morning when a first rape took place and a second time in the afternoon, knowing perfectly well that it was going to happen again,\\" Pheulpin said.

As you go over the relationship with a friend, you may begin to see what went wrong. You can process the information out loud, which can allow you to see something you missed before. Let your friend know exactly what you need from them. Whether it's a shoulder to cry on, someone to bring you out for a good time, or a fellow person to be angry with, your friend should know what you want from them. For example, you could say, \\"Thanks for listening to me, Jen. I know I've talked a lot about this breakup with you, and I really appreciate that you're taking the time to listen. I need to talk this through again to help me understand what happened.\\" As with talking, writing is a great form of self reflection. Try writing down your thoughts in a journal. You can also write a letter to your ex you do not intend to send. Here, you can talk about your confusion and sadness over the breakup. You can express anything you wanted to say to your ex but could not. Talk about what you loved about the relationship, but also what was frustrating. Do not censor yourself.

Even if your ex were to explain, there's a chance you would not understand or accept his explanation. Remember, you can heal from the breakup without closure.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","response":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of increased groundwater can have an indirect effect on the process of spore dispersal and growth. Increased ground water can lead to a more humid environment, which can promote the growth of fungi and their ability to disperse spores. This can result in a higher number of spores falling to the ground and germinating, potentially increasing the overall number of new mushrooms formed in the area. Furthermore, a moist environment can also be more conducive to the growth of mycelium, which could also help with the overall mushroom formation process.

And I was wondering What will Alex want to do next? A:","response":"It's difficult to predict an individual's specific reaction or course of action to a situation, without knowing their personality and circumstances in detail. However, given that Alex has been in a long-term relationship with Sydney for five years and is now going through a break-up, it is not unreasonable to consider a few possible emotional responses and actions that Alex might choose with respect to their new situation. 1. Reflection and introspection: Alex may want to take some time to reflect on the reasons behind the break-up and analyze how their relationship progressed over the years. Introspection may help them understand any patterns or relationship dynamics that contributed to the break-up. It may provide an opportunity for personal growth for Alex, helping them to determine what they value and seek in future relationships. 2. Seeking support from friends and family: Alex might reach out to close friends and family members for emotional support during this time. Talking to loved ones can help process the feelings and emotions associated with a break-up, leading to a quicker recovery and a better perspective. It is essential for Alex to have a strong support network during this time. 3. Focusing on personal goals and self-improvement: Following a break-up, it is not unusual for someone to reassess their life and refocus on personal goals. This could include pursuing new hobbies, dedicating time to career aspirations, or engaging in self-improvement activities, such as exercise or therapy. By concentrating on themselves, Alex can find new meaning and purpose in their life beyond their relationship with Sydney. 4. Rebuilding social life: After being in a long-term relationship, Alex may have found their social life and friendships strongly intertwined with Sydney's. As a result, Alex might start reconnecting with old friends or seeking new social connections to rebuild their social life. Engaging in social events and activities helps regain confidence and provides positivity during a potentially difficult time in their life. 5. Grieving the loss and moving on: The process of grieving the loss of a long-term relationship involves various stages, such as denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and eventually, acceptance. Alex may need to allow themselves time to grieve before truly moving on from their relationship with Sydney. Through the grieving process, Alex can learn to accept the break-up and eventually let go, paving the way for emotional healing and open opportunities for new relationships in the future. 6. Considering reconciliation: It's also possible that Alex might contemplate attempting to reconcile with Sydney, depending on the reasons for the break-up. If both partners are willing, couples therapy or open communication might lead to resolving issues that contributed to the break-up and ultimately strengthen their relationship. However, Alex will need to carefully evaluate the feasibility and desirability of reconciliation. Keep in mind that each individual's response to a break-up, and their subsequent actions, will vary depending on their personality, coping mechanisms, and external factors. What Alex chooses to do next is ultimately up to them, but the suggested potential options provide an overview of some of the most common paths people take after ending a long-term relationship."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Read the passage below and choose the right answer to the following question (choices are red wagon or blue wagon ): The full box is harder to move because it has greater mass and therefore greater inertia.

A train traveling at 72 kmph crosses a platform in 30 seconds and a man standing on the platform in 17 seconds. What is the length of the platform in meters? Options: (A) 240 meters (B) 260 meters (C) 420 meters (D) 600 meters (E) Cannot be determined","response":"First, we will find the length of the train and the speed in m/s. Then, we will use the time taken to cross the platform to find the combined length of the train and the platform. Finally, we will subtract the length of the train from the combined length to determine the length of the platform. Step 1: Convert the train's speed from kmph to m/s. To do this, we multiply by (1000 m/km) and divide by (3600 s/h), i.e., 72 kmph * (1000/3600). This gives us 20 m/s. Step 2: Now, we'll find the length of the train. For this, we will use the time it takes for the train to cross the man (17 s) and the speed we just found (20 m/s). The length of the train can be calculated as speed * time, which is 20 m/s * 17 s = 340 meters. Step 3: Next, we'll determine the combined length of the train and the platform. Once again, we will use the speed (20 m/s) and the time it takes to cross the platform (30 s). The combined length is 20 m/s * 30 s = 600 meters. Step 4: Finally, to find the length of the platform, we subtract the length of the train (340 m) from the combined length of the train and platform (600 m). This gives us 600 - 340 = 260 meters.

During the first quarter, the Redskins appeared to be in the position to score after Fred Smoot intercepted Tarvaris Jackson and returned the interception deep into Viking territory. However, the Redskins' offense was unable to score a touchdown. Mike Sellers appeared to score a touchdown on 4th and goal, but a replay challenge by Brad Childress nullified the touchdown and gave the Vikings the ball. However, the Redskins immediately tackled Tony Richardson in the end zone for a safety. Following the subsequent free kick, the Redskins marched down the field and took a 9-0 lead on a 33-yard pass from Todd Collins to Chris Cooley. In the 2nd quarter, the Redskins expanded their lead to 16-0 on a 32-yard pass from Todd Collins to Santana Moss. Later in the quarter, the Redskins took a 22-0 lead when Clinton Portis took a handoff from Todd Collins and threw a 15-yard touchdown pass to Antwaan Randle-El in the end zone. Although the Redskins were not successful on the 2-point conversion attempt, they had a commanding lead at this point in the game, and the previously rowdy Metrodome crowd was very disheartened and silent at this point. The Redskins stretched their lead to 25-0 on a 26-yard field goal by Shaun Suisham. Later in the quarter, the Vikings got the crowd back in the game when Tarvaris Jackson threw a 2-yard touchdown pass to Jim Kleinsasser, cutting the Redskins' lead to 25-7. The Vikings further cut into the Redskins' lead around the 10-minute mark of the fourth quarter when Tarvaris Jackson scored on a 6-yard run, making the lead 25-14. The Metrodome crowd began sensing a comeback as momentum appeared to turn in the Vikings' favor. This came to a head midway through the fourth quarter when the Redskins appeared to complete a long pass to Santana Moss. Though initially ruled a catch by a referee on the sideline, the call was considered questionable by the game's announcers since Moss had to drag his toes to stay in-bounds as he caught the pass. Sensing an impending challenge by Childress, the Redskins raced down the field to snap the ball&#8212;since a play cannot be challenged after the ball has been snapped for the next play. However, the snap was fumbled and it appeared to be Vikings' ball after it was recovered by Vikings' defensive tackle Kevin Williams. As the Vikings rushed onto the field to take over on offense, coach Joe Gibbs challenged that Minnesota had twelve defensive players on the field at the time the Redskins snapped the ball and fumbled it. After review, Gibbs' challenge was upheld and the call on the field was reversed&#8212;a five-yard penalty was assessed to the Vikings for having too many men on the field and the Redskins maintained possession. After the Redskins had retain possession of the football they had eventually scored on a 13-yard touchdown run by Clinton Portis, making the score 32-14 capping off a 75-yard drive. Although Tarvaris Jackson later scored on a 1-yard touchdown run to make the score 32-21, the Vikings were unable to score again, and the Redskins emerged with a victory.

Step 3: Organize the article structure I will structure the article with an introduction, followed by information about the challenges Pizzerias are facing, the reasons behind the shortage, its effect on the market, and potential solutions to the problem. Step 4: Write the article Title: \\"Pizza Maker Shortage Hits Italian Pizzerias\\" Introduction: The pizza industry in Italy is facing an unprecedented crisis as a severe shortage of skilled pizza makers, or \\"pizzaioli\\", negatively impacts the quality and supply of artisanal pizza. With pizza being a staple of Italian life and a significant source of revenue for small businesses, this shortage has raised concerns within the food and tourism industries. Challenges faced by Italian pizzerias: Many pizzerias are finding it increasingly difficult to acquire skilled and experienced pizza makers. As a result, owners are being forced to compromise on the quality and authenticity of their pizza, resorting to hiring untrained staff or resorting to frozen, pre-prepared products. Reasons behind the shortage: The pizza maker shortage is a result of several factors, including the aging demographic of skilled pizzaioli, lack of interest among younger generations in pursuing pizza-making as a career, and the increasing competition for skilled labor from pizzerias abroad, where they can often earn higher salaries. Effects on the market: This growing shortage has led to an increased dependence on imported manpower and machinery within the industry. It has also exacerbated the existing competition between traditional pizzerias and fast-food chains, leading to a growing concern over the potential decline of Italy's rich culinary heritage. Potential solutions: To address this shortage, industry experts and pizzeria owners have advocated for initiatives such as government-sponsored training programs and subsidies, wider promotion of the pizza making profession, and restructuring the industry to offer competitive salaries and benefits that can attract the younger generations. Conclusion: The pizza maker shortage is a multifaceted issue that requires a collaborative effort between the industry, local communities, and the government to find sustainable solutions. For the time being, pizzerias will continue to grapple with the challenges of maintaining the quality of their products in an increasingly competitive landscape.

(The phrase \\"web television\\" is also sometimes used to refer to Internet television in general, which includes Internet-transmission of programs produced for both online and traditional terrestrial, cable, or satellite broadcast.) - Cable television is a system of delivering television programming to paying subscribers via radio frequency (RF) signals transmitted through coaxial cables or, in the 2010s, light pulses through fiber-optic cables. This contrasts with broadcast television, in which the television signal is transmitted over the air by radio waves and received by a television antenna attached to the television. FM radio programming, high-speed Internet, telephone services, and similar non-television services may also be provided through these cables. Analog television was standard in the 20th century, but since the 2000s, cable systems have been upgraded to digital cable operation. - Vimeo is a global video-sharing website in which users can upload, share and view videos. It was the first video sharing site to support high-definition video (started in October 2007). Vimeo was founded in November 2004 by Jake Lodwick and Zach Klein. - A voicemail system (also known as voice message or voice bank) is a computer-based system that allows users and subscribers to exchange personal voice messages; to select and deliver voice information; and to process transactions relating to individuals, organizations, products and services, using an ordinary telephone. The term is also used more broadly to denote any system of conveying a stored telecommunications voice messages, including using an answering machine. Most cell phone services offer voice-mail as a basic feature; many corporate PBXs include versatile internal voice-messaging services, and *98 Vertical service code subscription is available to most individual and small business land line subscribers. - Voice message refers to a message that could be sent to a destination using voice media. Voice itself could be 'packaged' and sent through the IP backbone so that it reaches its marked 'address'. In a technical sense, the process of sending 'voice packets' is a semi passive way of communication. However, given the speed at which it could be delivered can make the communication sound seamless. - A portmanteau (; plural \\"portmanteaus\\" or \\"portmanteaux\\" ) or portmanteau word is a linguistic blend of words, in which parts of multiple words or their phones (sounds) are combined into a new word. as in \\"smog\\", coined by blending \\"smoke\\" and \\"fog\\", or \\"popportunity\\", from \\"popping\\" and \\"opportunity\\", or \\"motel\\", from \\"motor\\" and \\"hotel\\". In linguistics, a portmanteau is defined as a single morph that represents two or more morphemes. - A web series is a series of scripted or non-scripted videos, generally in episodic form, released on the Internet and part of the web television medium, which first emerged in the late 1990s and become more prominent in the early 2000s (decade). A single instance of a web series program can be called an episode or \\"webisode\\", however the latter term is not often used. In general, web series can be watched on a range of platforms, including desktop, laptop, tablets and smartphones. They can also be watched on television. - A webisode is an episode of a series that is distributed as web television. It is available as either for download or in streaming, as opposed to first airing on broadcast or cable television. The format can be used as a preview, a promotion, as part of a collection of shorts, or a commercial. A webisode may or may not have been broadcast on TV. What defines it is its online distribution on the web, or through video-sharing web sites such as Vimeo or YouTube. While there is no set standard for length, most webisodes are relatively short, ranging from 315 minutes in length. It is a single web episode, but collectively is part of a web series, a form called web television that characteristically features a dramatic, serial storyline, where the primary method of viewership is streaming online over the Internet. The term \\"webisode\\" (a portmanteau formed from the words 'web' and 'episode') was first introduced in the Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary in 2009. - A vertical service code (VSC) is a special code dialed prior to (or instead of) a telephone number that engages some type of special telephone service or feature. Typically preceded with an asterisk, or * (star), key on the touch tone keypad and colloquially referred to as star codes, most are two digits in length; as more services are developed, those that use \\"2\\" or \\"3\\" as the first digit are sometimes three digits in length. - The answering machine, answerphone or message machine, also known as the telephone answering machine (or TAM) in the UK and some Commonwealth countries, ansaphone or ansafone (from a trade name), or telephone answering device (TAD), is used for answering telephones and recording callers' messages. - Voicemail was an online television show that can be seen through the ABC.com Full Episode Player . Each short webisode features Mike , played by Ezra Godden , with his voicemail messages played in the background . As each message plays they help explain Mike 's actions . In the episode entitled \`\` Supplies '' , for example , Mike is seen making a giant ball out of masking tape while a series of voicemails from his boss asking him where the tape is going . - YouTube is an American video-sharing website headquartered in San Bruno, California.

Options: - Sentence A: \\"The room is so hot, so he opens the heater\\" - Sentence B: \\"The room is so hot, so he opens the fan\\" Let's reason step by step:","response":"To determine the sentence that goes against common sense, let's analyze each option. Sentence A: \\"The room is so hot, so he opens the heater\\" Common sense tells us that when a room is hot, the appropriate response would be to cool the room down. However, in this sentence, the individual chooses to open the heater, which would make the room even hotter. This goes against common sense because it amplifies the initial problem instead of solving it. Sentence B: \\"The room is so hot, so he opens the fan\\" In this sentence, the room is hot and the individual chooses to turn on the fan. This action aligns with common sense since a fan will circulate the air and help to cool down the room. Therefore, Sentence A (\\"The room is so hot, so he opens the heater\\") is the one that goes against common sense."},{"question":"You are considering whether to buy a product.

Given the above question, please answer with reasoning first!","response":"Spider wasps and bullet ants are both insects that deliver painful stings. However, using either of these creatures to stop a criminal would not be a reliable or recommended method in any circumstance. Nevertheless, let's analyze their differences and potential effectiveness in this hypothetical scenario. Spider wasp: - The spider wasp's sting has been described as excruciatingly painful and can cause temporary paralysis in the stung area. - Spider wasps are known for their ability to paralyze spiders with their venoms to provide food for their larvae. - They are often solitary hunters and would not usually attack humans unless threatened. - Their sting pain usually lasts for a short duration, less than a day. Bullet ant: - Bullet ants have one of the most painful stings in the insect world, often compared to being shot, hence the name \\"bullet\\" ant. - Their venom contains a neurotoxin called poneratoxin that can cause swelling, pain, temporary immobility, and muscle contractions. - The pain from a bullet ant's sting can last for up to 24 hours. - They are more aggressive than spider wasps and will attack to protect their colonies or when threatened. Given the above differences, a bullet ant's sting is likely to be more effective at incapacitating an individual due to its stronger venom and longer-lasting pain. However, using insects to stop criminals is highly impractical, given that their response to threats can be unpredictable, and controlling them is essentially impossible. Additionally, it would raise significant ethical and legal concerns. Law enforcement relies on trained personnel, technology, and less-lethal equipment - such as tasers, batons, and pepper spray - to detain criminals. These methods are not only safer but also more efficient and ethical compared to using living creatures."},{"question":"Write a brief sentence.","response":"A brief sentence is a short group of words that tells a complete idea, like \\"The cat is on the mat.\\""},{"question":"Q: I heard that Aubrey had cast a magic spell that gave them powers of telepathy.

In fact, fermentation is a natural process that has been used for centuries in food preservation and preparation. Fermented foods can be nutritious and safe to eat when prepared and stored correctly. Fermentation is the process in which microorganisms (like bacteria, yeast, or fungi) convert carbohydrates and sugars into alcohol, acid, or gas. This process can actually make certain foods safer by inhibiting the growth of harmful bacteria and enhancing the nutritional content of some foods. Some popular examples of fermented foods include: 1. Yogurt: Fermented milk product containing beneficial probiotics (live bacteria) that support gut health and digestion. 2. Sauerkraut: Fermented cabbage known for its probiotic properties and high vitamin C content. 3. Kombucha: A fermented tea beverage with potential health benefits due to its probiotic content and antioxidants. 4. Kimchi: A Korean dish made from fermented vegetables (typically cabbage) with a unique spicy flavor. 5. Miso: A Japanese seasoning made from fermented soybeans, rich in protein, vitamins, and minerals. 6. Sourdough bread: Made from fermented dough, sourdough bread has a unique taste and texture and may be easier to digest for some people compared to regular bread. While these examples demonstrate that not all fermented foods are dangerous, it is essential to follow proper preparation and storage methods to ensure the safety and quality of fermented products. Additionally, it is always important to consider one's own dietary needs and any potential allergies or intolerances when choosing what foods to consume."},{"question":"Student: Premise: \\"A young couple kissing by a bike rake.\\" Hypothesis: \\"Some people are kissing after their wedding.\\" Do we know that the hypothesis entailed by the premise?.

Input: Context: To investigate whether the aberrant expression of microRNA (miR)-196a and miR-196b can be used as potential prognostic markers of human osteosarcoma.', \\"Quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis was performed to detect the expression levels of miR-196a and miR-196b in osteosarcoma tissues and patients' sera.\\", 'Expression levels of miR-196a and miR-196b in osteosarcoma tissues were both significantly higher than those in noncancerous bone tissues (both p<0.001), in line with which, the serum levels of the two miRNAs were also markedly upregulated in patients with osteosarcomas compared with healthy controls (both p<0.001). Then, the elevation of serum miR-196a and miR-196b levels both more frequently occurred in osteosarcoma patients with high tumor grade (p=0.008 and 0.01, respectively), positive metastasis (p=0.001 and 0.006, respectively) and recurrence (p=0.001 and 0.006, respectively). Moreover, high serum miR-196a, high serum miR-196b and conjoined expression of miR-196a/miR-196b were all independent prognostic factors for OS (overall survival) and DFS (disease-free survival) of osteosarcoma patients. Answer: Our present data indicate the involvement of miR-196a and miR-196b upregulation in the pathogenesis of osteosarcoma. More importantly, the altered levels of circulating miR-196a and miR-196b might have great potential to serve as novel and non-invasive prognostic factors for this malignancy.

Nixonâs literary agent, Irving \\"Swifty\\" Lazar, believes the interview would be an opportunity for Nixon to salvage his reputation, and to make some money. Nixon ultimately demands 600,000, and Frost accepts. After persuading his friend and producer John Birt that the interviews would be a success, Frost and Birt travel to California to meet with Nixon. On the plane to California, Frost flirts with a young woman called Caroline Cushing, and they begin a relationship. Frost struggles to sell the interviews to U.S. networks, and decides to finance the project with private money and syndicate the broadcast of the interviews. He hires two investigators â Bob Zelnick and James Reston Jr. â to help him prepare, along with Birt. Frost is not clear on what he wants from the interview, and Reston encourages him to aim for a confession from Nixon.

The unit's digit exceeds its ten's digit by 4: If we let the ten's digit be represented by x and the unit's digit by y, then: y = x + 4 2. The product of the given number and the sum of its digits is equal to 90: The two-digit number can be represented as 10x + y, and the sum of its digits is x + y. So, the equation becomes: (10x + y)(x + y) = 90 Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation: (10x + (x + 4))(x + (x + 4)) = 90 Simplify the equation: (10x + x + 4)(2x + 4) = 90 (11x + 4)(2x + 4) = 90 Now let's test the given options: Option (A) 26: In this case, x = 2 and y = 6.

After a whirlwind one-day courtship, Peter and Francey get married, and they and Keith return to the Morgan family's home, where Peter teaches at the university run by his father Peter Morgan Sr. (Coburn).

It has become the centerpiece of his effort to reform the country’s criminal-justice system, which has the highest incarceration rate in the world. Last Friday, the President granted commutations to 42 convicted nonviolent offenders, bringing the total so far in his presidency to 348 commutations — more than any president has in nearly half a century. His predecessor, George W. Bush granted clemency in just 11 cases. It's not just Obama pushing for reform. Top Republicans and Democrats in Congress also support relaxing the sentencing laws that have tripled the federal and state prison populations in the last 30 years, reaching more than 1.56 million inmates at the end of 2014. However in Congress, the main legislative effort for sentencing changes, the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act of 2015, has failed to pass either chamber of Congress. The bill would reduce long mandatory minimum sentences for many nonviolent drug crimes, give judges more control over the terms of punishment and provide inmates with more opportunities to get out early by participating in rehabilitation programs. Failing congressional help, Obama has in recent months relied on his presidential powers to commute the sentences of non-violent offenders. Under the Constitution, the president has the power to grant “pardons for offenses against the United States” or to commute federal sentences. A pardon is an act of presidential forgiveness and wipes away any remaining legal liabilities from a conviction. A commutation reduces a sentence but does not eliminate a conviction or restore civil rights lost as a result of the conviction. The American Bar Association has joined Obama's push and put its support behind the Clemency Project 2014, a national effort by multiple justice groups to help inmates who meet U.S. Department of Justice...

Almost every time I come to Vegas I stay here because its perfect for what I'm looking for in my Vegas adventure. I come here to get outside and enjoy myself or go gambling until 9am without having to sell a kidney and I get all of that here. Now let me also say, I'm a bit boogie when it comes to my hotel preferences so I'm not all about cost. I have realistic standards and understand the concept of \\"you get what you pay for\\" but I have NEVER gone wrong with LVH. I'm not a big gambler so I love being here where the tables are hot but not incredibly expensive to join. There are a lot of options on the machines which is great for me because I love the penny machines, lol. Its right off the strip and not on a street that is too hectic or in the hub of all the traffic, I don't care for any of that. I had bad customer service at the check in counter once but I attribute that to the lady who had a bad attitude and not the overall service at the hotel. When I requested toothpaste they had it to me very quickly which lets be honest, is kind of a big deal because no one goes out of their room with a hot mouth (let's hope not!) The room itself was very comfortable and didn't make me feel cheap. Now I understand this place isn't flashy like other hotels but I don't spend most of my time in my room, that's not why you come to Vegas! But when I am done with my daily adventure or need to rejuvenate I want to feel that I'm lying on clean sheets, the room is comfortable and I can relax. Each and every time it I was completely satisfied. Soooooo, try it out! It's very inexpensive and there are all kinds of ways to get deals on this place.

He was a Navy veteran and native of New York. (Several items in this photo gallery have been updated and corrected.) Fort Worth Police Department/via AP Standing at an ATM in the first-floor atrium of the building where she works at the Washington Navy Yard, Patricia Ward was startled by a rapid succession of sharp noises that seemed to come from overhead. Bam, bam, bam . . . It was about 8:15 a.m. Monday in Building 197, a brick edifice that houses employees of the Naval Sea Systems Command. “Was that a gunshot?” one of Ward’s companions wondered aloud. They were on their way to have breakfast in the cafeteria nearby. More loud cracks came almost instantly. “We knew it then,” Ward said. “We just started running.” So began a morning of tragedy and terror: a mass shooting that killed a dozen victims and injured eight others at the historic facility. Authorities said a 34-year-old Texas man apparently armed with high-powered guns opened fire, leaving a trail of bodies before he died, too, either from police bullets or his own hand. His motive remains a mystery, and the precise sequence of events has yet to become clear. But for those who survived, who saw or heard what happened from narrow vantage points — crouched under a desk, standing flat against a wall, prostrate on the floor beneath a table — the memory is indelible. A crisp September morning, Indian summer: At 8 a.m., reveille crackled over loudspeakers at the Navy Yard as two sailors hoisted an American flag up a pole, marking the official start of the workweek. This being a military installation, many on the grounds, on the north bank of the Anacostia River, had already been busy for a while. Tim Birkenbuel, a Navy contractor, was in his second-floor office when he heard what sounded “like a table falling on concrete.” He heard the same sound again, and again — what turned out to be several gunshots in rapid succession. Some of his co-workers ran to the glass panels that surround the building’s atrium to see what was going on. Birkenbuel then barricaded them in the office for safety. And they waited. Mark Vandroff, a retired Navy captain, had arrived by Metro from his home in Bethesda at 5:50 a.m. He had already worked out in the Navy Yard’s gym, showered and read through his e-mails. He was on the third floor, preparing for a meeting about the planned purchase of Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyers. A floor above him, Anthony Salemi, a logistics expert, was settling in at his desk. Down the hall, a dozen top civilian officials of the Navy’s Senior Executive Service were scheduled to soon meet for a briefing on billions of dollars’ worth of purchases. Then came the sound. A conference table falling, Salemi thought. “We’re always setting up for seminars and things like that,” he said. “I figured the leg had collapsed and one had fallen.” But: “I heard someone yell, ‘Call 911!’ And I knew it was a shooting.” He headed toward a staircase. Then, like Patricia Ward, Salemi heard a second series of sharp cracks — bang, bang, bang — and he broke into a sprint. Vandroff had heard the initial noise, too, and like the others, he wondered what it was. “The first sound that I heard, that I now think was gunfire . . . was a loud sound shortly after 8,” Vandroff recalled. “It sounded unusual, and we all looked at each other around the table, like, ‘What the heck was that?’ And then, the second sound — that was definitely gunfire. That was the unmistakable sound of gunfire. And it was very, very loud. . . . “After that, people started screaming: ‘Close the doors! Close the doors!’ ” Vandroff and eight others in the third-floor conference room stood up. Someone shut the door, but it didn’t have a lock. They decided to barricade themselves in. They flipped the conference table on its side. They wedged it under the door handle and packed chairs behind it. Then they got down on the floor. Another burst of gunfire sounded, this one closer. Vandroff said he buried his head, then looked up when the sound stopped. There were two bullet holes near the top of a wall, as the gunfire continued. “At different points, you couldn’t really tell where it was coming from,” he said. “The shot that when we looked up and saw the bullet holes in the wall was definitely close.” Rick Mason, a program management analyst, told the Associated Press that a gunman was shooting from a fourth-floor overlook in the hallway outside his office. He said the shooter aimed at people in the first-floor cafeteria. Navy Cmdr. Tim Jirus said that as he was leaving the building, he saw a co-worker who had been shot getting into a police car, and he heard more shots from inside his workplace. Jirus went to an alley where he thought he would be safe and spoke briefly with a man there about what was going on. Jirus said he heard two gunshots, loudly echoing off the building. He spun toward the sound. When he turned back, the man he had been talking with was lying on the ground, shot in the head. Uncertain where the shooter was, Jirus ran. “I was just lucky,” he said. “The other person was shorter than me. There were two shots. He got that guy. He didn’t get me. . . . The randomness of it — standing right next to me, one person gets shot.” David Stevens, a Navy contractor, was on the phone when he heard an initial volley of gunfire and people shouting that a shooter was on the fourth floor. He said he ran to the edge of the atrium and glanced up. Then he heard a “second deluge” of shots. The fire alarm sounded. The first call to D.C. police came about 8:15 a.m., and Chief of Police Cathy L. Lanier said officers arrived at the Navy Yard “within literally two to three minutes.” “Internal security had already . . . identified and engaged the suspect,” Lanier said — meaning they were trading shots with him. “We already had victims down at that point,” she said. “Within seven minutes, we had active-shooter teams inside the building, moving through the building.” Quickly, District police were joined by U.S. Marshals, U.S. Capitol Police and U.S. Park Police, who entered the building and, talking on one radio frequency, began moving floor to floor, helping victims and securing rooms. A Park Police helicopter airlifted an injured D.C. police officer from atop the building, while a helicopter from another agency circled to search for possible other suspects. The FBI arrived a bit later. At 8:28 a.m., an e-mail went out to Navy Yard workers: “ALL HANDS on WNY Shelter in place.” Twenty minutes later, another e-mail: “All Commands on WNY report accountability of your personnel.” Then, at 9:15 a.m.: “Shelter in Place and or a Lockdown is security posture taken to protect personnel. Stay indoors, if outside, get within a building. Stay away from windows or open buildings, Remain indoors until the ‘all clear’ is given. Secure doors and windows.” And a half-hour after that: “ALL PERSONNEL ON WASHINGTON NAVY YARD CONTINUE SHELTER IN PLACE. REMAIN CLEAR OF ALL WINDOWS.” Lanier said officers eventually encountered the gunman. “There was a gunfight with the suspect,” she said. And the suspect “was eventually deceased.” ||||| Alex Wong/Getty Images WASHINGTON, DC - SEPTEMBER 16: Emergency vehicles and law enforcement personnel respond to a reported shooting at an entrance to the Washington Navy Yard September 16, 2013 in Washington, DC. According to the latest news report, several people were shot with the shooter still possibly active. WASHINGTON — Two workers at the Washington Navy Yard who came face to face with a gunman in a dimly lit hallway recounted Monday how he silently raised his rifle and opened fire on them. \\"We're lucky he was far enough away he was a bad shot,\\" said Terrie Durham, a civilian employee in the Office of Naval Sea Systems Command. Her co-worker, Todd Brundidge, said the shots didn't come with a warning. Don Andres, a legislative aide to Rep. Steven Horsford, D-Nev., describes to MSNBC's Chris Jansing the scene near the Washington Navy Yard, where 12 were wounded and at least four people died after a shooting at the headquarters of the Naval Sea Systems Command. \\"No words. He raised the gun and started firing,\\" he said. More than a dozen people were shot in the Monday morning rampage, including a man who was standing next to Navy Commander Tim Jirus. Jirus said he had fled the building and was in a back alley when a worker from a maintenance facility approached, asked what was going on — and was shot right there. \\"He just came up and was like, 'Hey I understand you have a shooter in your building,'\\" Jirus said. \\"I said I heard some things earlier, I don't know if they were gun shots. And then I heard two more gunshots and it hit the guy next to me and not me.\\" He said the man fell to the ground and he took off. Speaking about the deadly shooting at a Washington D.C., area Navy Yard, Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus says, \\"The Navy family has suffered an horrific attack.\\" \\"We know people we work with were shot and they're on the way to the hospital and we don't know if they're going to make it or not make it,\\" Jirus said. \\"I consider myself very lucky.\\" Jirus didn't see the shooter, but Durham and co-worker Brundidge had a terrifying closeup. The pair were in their third-floor office when an alarm went off about 8:15 a.m., followed by an announcement of a fire emergency and orders to leave the building. \\"I was on the phone and someone came up to my desk and said, 'This is not a drill. Someone had just been shot. There are shots in the building,'\\" Brundidge said. \\"So I hung up the phone and started to try to get people out of the building.\\" Durham said she wasn't exactly sure what was happening but knew it was a dire situation. \\"Our wardens came running, yelling for everyone to get out of the building,\\" Durham said. \\"We were standing right outside the door to go to the exit and we saw a man standing down the hall,\\" she said. Dr. Janis Orlowski, the Chief medical officer at Medstar Washington Hospital Center, says, the three shooting victims in the deadly attack that left 13 people dead are \\"doing well.\\" He was about 40 yards away but close enough for them to see he was clad in blue and had a weapon. 'He aimed at us and shot but missed' \\"He was a tall man, appeared to have dark skin, looked like he was in some kind of uniform and he had a rifle,\\" Durham said. \\"And he aimed at us and shot but missed, thank God.\\" Before the shots, there was silence. \\"He said nothing,\\" Brundidge said. The stairwell was dimly lit so they didn't get a good look at the gunman's face, but Durham could see how close they came to being shot. \\"He aimed high and missed,\\" she said. \\"I saw where the shot missed. It was a few feet ahead of us and a foot or above where we would have been standing.\\" She said she ran for her life, yelling to everyone else on the stairwell, \\"There is a man shooting in the building, get out, get out!\\" Brundidge and Durham are among thousands of people who work at the Washington Navy Yard, a sprawling facility that is home to several naval commands. Ameisha Boatwright arrived for a job interview only to find police and fire trucks with sirens screaming. \\"I told myself, I'm getting outta here,\\" she said. \\"I can do this interview another day. I'm just going home now — I'm scared.\\" NBC News Doug Hughes, a project engineer at the Washington Navy Yard. Hours after the gunfire ended, relatives of Navy Yard employees were still waiting for word on their loved ones. Jacqueline Alston, who works for the National Parks Service, was hoping for a reunion with her husband, Earnest Johnson, who is an office cleaner in the building where the gunman stalked the halls. 'I'm numb' \\"I'm numb,\\" she said. \\"I'm asking God, let me hear that voice, let me see that man.\\" Doug Hughes, a project engineer at the Navy Yard who was at Nationals Park heading to a train home more than four hours after the shooting, said he was on lockdown during the rampage. \\"When I was told what we heard was shots, I went to one of the offices and myself and one other lady locked ourselves in,\\" Hughes said. \\"I'm glad I'm out of it and I just want I go home.\\" Asked what he’s going to say to his wife when he gets home, Edwards said, “I’m not going to say anything; I’m just going to hug her.” Antoinette Proctor, a supervisor at the Navy Exchange, said her hours-long lockdown was spent well away from the shooting. \\"It was very frustrating to be sitting there and not knowing what was going on, on the yard, what's actually happening around us. It was really frustrating,\\" she said, adding she was on her way home to her children. \\"Today was hell, I didn't wake up this morning to experience this.\\" 'This is not good' Dr. Janis Orlwoski, chief medical officer at Washington Medical Center, said she spoke to the three wounded victims taken to her hospital, who were described as in stable condition. \\"There is something evil in our society that we as Americans have to try to eradicate,\\" Orlwoski said. \\"I may see this every day, I may be the chief medical officer of a major medical center, but there's something wrong here when we have these multiple shootings. ... \\"We have to work together to get rid of it.

Plot title: Halloween Movie plot: On Halloween night of 1963, six-year-old Michael Myers, dressed in a clown costume and mask, stabs his teenage sister Judith to death with a kitchen knife. Fifteen years later, on October 30, 1978, he escapes from Smith's Grove Sanitarium in a car that was to take him to a court hearing, the verdict of which was for him to be locked up forever. The next day, 21-year-old Michael (Nick Castle), now wearing a mechanic's uniform and a white mask, returns to his hometown of Haddonfield, Illinois and begins stalking high school student Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) after she drops off a key at his old house (where the murder took place) so her father can sell it. Her two best friends Annie Brackett (Nancy Loomis) and Lynda van der Klok (P. J. Soles) dismiss Laurie's concerns that someone is following her. Michael's psychiatrist, Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence), having anticipated Michael's return home, goes to the local cemetery and finds Judith Myers' headstone missing. Loomis meets with Annie's father, Sheriff Leigh Brackett (Charles Cyphers) and monitors the local neighborhood to keep an eye out for Michael. When Annie's boyfriend Paul calls her to come pick him up, she takes Lindsey Wallace (Kyle Richards) to the Doyle house, just across the street, to spend the night with Laurie and Tommy Doyle (Brian Andrews). Michael strangles Annie after she gets into her car.

Movie title: Aladdin Movie plot: The story begins with a young boy named Aladdin, trying to make money by being a servant for a day, with no success. Meanwhile, a shifty man named Hassim, who has journeyed from Marrakesh, visits the local medicine woman, Fatima, who tells Hassim that in order to reach a certain treasure that he wants, he needs Aladdin. Hassim visits Aladdin and his mother, claiming that he's Aladdin's long lost uncle, and says that he can make them rich beyond their wildest dreams. The next day, Hassim and Aladdin travel outside the city to the location of the treasure. When they arrive, Hassim begins an incantation to open the cave; Aladdin finds out that Hassim isn't his uncle, and that he only brought Aladdin to this spot because he is the only one that can enter the corridors of a dark cave and claim the treasure inside: an old oil lamp. Aladdin reluctantly steps inside and walks past the traps within, leading him to a beautiful garden with friendly animals. He eventually finds the lamp; he pauses to pick flowers from a tree for his mother, which instantly turn into jewels, so he takes a whole sack full. Aladdin makes it back to Hassim, but fears that he may be killed after Hassim takes the lamp away from him, and so he refuses to give it to him. Enraged, Hassim uses his powers to close the entrance of the cave forever, trapping Aladdin. Aladdin kneels to pray and accidentally rubs the lamp, releasing a powerful genie inside, who can grant any wish. Aladdin wishes that he was out of the cave and back home. Aladdin tries showing his mother the magic lamp, but she fears it is too dangerous and wants him to put the lamp away and remain silent about it. Cut to four years later, Aladdin and his mother must hide indoors for the sultan and his daughter Layla are being escorted to the bathing house and the sultan orders that no one looks upon his daughter, or the punishment is death. Curious by the sultan's order, Aladdin sneaks out while his mother sleeps. He sneaks into the bathing house and sees Layla from inside, and is... A:","response":"Hassim closed the cave in an attempt to prevent Aladdin from escaping with the magical lamp. As the plot unfolds, we learn that Hassim, driven by his greed for the enormous treasure, had come from Marrakesh to acquire the powerful lamp through any means necessary. His intentions were to manipulate and deceive, in order to take the treasure for himself without facing any danger. He then went to Fatima, the local medicine woman, who revealed to Hassim that Aladdin would be the key to obtaining the lamp. Hassim approached Aladdin with lies, claiming to be his long-lost uncle and promising him and his mother a life of wealth beyond their wildest dreams. To execute his plan, Hassim brought Aladdin to the cave containing the treasure, knowing that Aladdin was the only one who could enter it and retrieve the lamp. Aladdin's role in this scheme was to brave the dangerous corridors and traps within the cave, ultimately delivering the lamp safely to Hassim. As events unfolded, Aladdin discovered Hassim's true intentions and rightfully decided not to hand over the lamp to him. Aladdin's courageous act of defiance enraged Hassim, who had gone to great lengths to deceive Aladdin and his mother to satisfy his greed for power and wealth. In a fit of anger and to ensure that he would not lose the treasure forever, Hassim used his powers to close the entrance of the cave, trapping Aladdin inside, hoping to either force him to comply or prevent anyone else from discovering the powerful secrets contained within. Fortunately for Aladdin, as he knelt to pray while trapped in the cave, he inadvertently discovered the power of the lamp he had found, releasing a powerful genie capable of granting any wish. Thanks to the genie, Aladdin was able to escape the cave and return home with the lamp, preventing Hassim from achieving his malevolent goals. In conclusion, Hassim closed the cave as a desperate measure to retain control over the valuable treasure and keep Aladdin confined, preventing him from exposing Hassim's true intentions and treacherous machinations. This crucial moment in the film's plot showcases the conflict between Aladdin, an innocent and resourceful young boy, and Hassim, a deceitful and greedy antagonist, setting the stage for the movie's ensuing dramas, challenges, and adventures."},{"question":"Barnardo's is calling on ministers to reserve 20,000 apprenticeships for 16-18 year olds from the care system. Care leavers' potential and not only their entry qualifications should be taken into account, Barnardo's says. The Department for Education said it was \\"improving the lives of care leavers and helping them make a successful transition to adulthood\\". According to the government's care leaver strategy 2013, around 10,000 youngsters aged between 16 and 18 leave care in England every year. The strategy says there is a significant gap between the educational achievements of care leavers and their peers. In June, the Prison Reform Trust launched an independent review to examine why so many children in care in England and Wales end up in the criminal justice system. The trust says children aged 10 to 17 and in care are more than five times as likely to be in trouble than others. In Chancellor George Osborne's Budget in July, the government pledged that three million new apprenticeships would be created by 2020, funded by a tax on large firms. Now Barnardo's wants to see a tranche of these reserved for those coming out of the care system to redress some of the inequalities they face. Instead of apprenticeships depending on entry qualifications only, care leavers' potential should also be taken into account, the charity says. It adds that intensive support throughout an apprenticeship would help the young people get the qualifications they need to go on to successfully establish a career. Barnardo's chief executive Javed Khan said: \\"Young people leaving the care system have ambition and talents. They want to work, to be financially independent and contribute to the country's economy. \\"But too often, care leavers find the door to employment is closed. Getting an apprenticeship and proving themselves in work can open up the door to a successful career instead of a dependence on benefits. \\"Young people are the future of Britain's economy. They must be invested in and given the right support to get into work.\\" A spokesman for the DfE said: \\"We are improving the lives of care leavers and helping them make a successful transition to adulthood. \\"A good apprenticeship can help support this, and that is why we're fully funding apprenticeships training for eligible care leavers aged 19-23. \\"We have also changed the law so young people can live with their foster family after they turn 18, and given every child who leaves care a personal adviser.\\" What was that article about?","response":"The article discusses Barnardo's, a UK children's charity, calling on the government to reserve 20,000 apprenticeships specifically for young individuals aged 16-18 years old who are coming out of the care system. They emphasize that these care leavers' potential, along with entry qualifications, should be taken into account. The goal is to address the significant gap in educational achievements between care leavers and their peers and help them transition into successful adulthood by offering opportunities for apprenticeships and reducing their chances of ending up in the criminal justice system.

It's world history.\\" The NT Rights of the Terminally Ill Law has left physicians and citizens trying to deal with its moral and practical influence. Some have breathed sighs of relief; but others, including churches, right to life groups and the Australian Medical Association, bitterly attacked the law. But the tide is unlikely to turn back.

Afterwards, the Giants responded with QB Eli Manning completing an 8-yard TD pass to TE Jeremy Shockey. In the second quarter, the Cowboys retook the lead as rookie kicker Nick Folk got a 44-yard field goal, yet New York answered with RB Reuben Droughns getting a 1-yard TD run. Dallas reclaimed the lead with Romo completing a 20-yard TD pass to WR Patrick Crayton.

The rest of the bill is for the ambulance ride. How much did the ambulance ride cost?. Me: Hmmm, let me think. I think this is the detailed solution:","response":"To find the cost of the ambulance ride in Josephine's hospital bill, we can break down the bill into its components and then calculate the remaining amount. Here's a step-by-step explanation. Step 1: Calculate the amount for medication. 50% of the total bill (5,000) is for medication. 0.50 * 5,000 = 2,500 Step 2: Calculate the amount for overnight stays. The remaining bill after subtracting the medication cost: 5,000 - 2,500 = 2,500 Now, 25% of the remaining bill is for overnight stays. 0.25 * 2,500 = 625 Step 3: Subtract the food cost. The food cost is 175. Step 4: Calculate the ambulance ride cost. Now, we subtract the costs of medication, overnight stays, and food from the total bill to find the cost of the ambulance ride. 5,000 (total bill) - 2,500 (medication) - 625 (overnight stays) - 175 (food) = 1,700 The cost of the ambulance ride in Josephine's hospital bill is 1,700."},{"question":"Generate a descriptive sentence about a restaurant using the following words: name = The Phoenix, food = Italian, priceRange = high, customer rating = average, area = riverside Sentence:","response":"The Phoenix is a riverside Italian restaurant with a high price range, offering average customer ratings."},{"question":"Given those answer options, answer the question: Remy wanted to have a nice garden, so they decided to grow flowers.

Mozart eventually became recognised among prodigies as the future standard for early success and promise.Of seven children born to Leopold and Anna Maria Mozart, only the fourth, Maria Anna (Nannerl), born 31 July 1751, and the youngest, Wolfgang Amadeus, born 27 January 1756, survived infancy. The children were educated at home, under Leopold's guidance, learning basic skills in reading, writing, drawing and arithmetic, together with some history and geography. Their musical education was aided by exposure to the constant rehearsing and playing of Leopold and his fellow musicians. When Nannerl was seven her father began to teach her to play the harpsichord, with Wolfgang looking on; according to Nannerl's own account \\"the boy immediately showed his extraordinary, God-given talent. He often spent long periods at the clavier, picking out thirds, and his pleasure showed that they sounded good to him... When he was five years old he was composing little pieces which he would play to his father who would write them down\\". A family friend, the poet Johann Andreas Schachtner, recounted that at the age of four Wolfgang began to compose a recognisable piano concerto, and was able to demonstrate a phenomenal sense of pitch., what would be the answer ? Answer:","response":"The answer is Leopold, as Leopold Mozart is the father of the boy (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart) who watched his sister (Maria Anna, or Nannerl) learn harpsichord."},{"question":"Please answer this question: What is the general term for a three-panelled altar piece?","response":"A three-panelled altarpiece is generally referred to as a \\"triptych.\\" The term originates from the Greek words \\"tri\\" (meaning three) and \\"ptychē\\" (meaning fold or layer). Triptychs are a form of religious art that was particularly popular during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance period in Europe. They typically consist of three hinged panels, with the central panel often being the largest and the two side panels functioning as wings or doors, which can be folded inwards when not in use. Triptychs have been used by various religious traditions, including Christianity and Buddhism, to convey spiritual themes and narratives. In Christian art, the subject matter often revolves around scenes from the life of Christ, the Virgin Mary, saints, and other biblical figures. The central panel typically features the most prominent scene or figure, while the side panels highlight supplementary or related stories and characters. During the Gothic and early Renaissance period, triptychs were commonly found in churches, cathedrals, and other places of worship, serving as devotional objects or as decorative elements in altarpieces. They were often commissioned by wealthy patrons who sought to garner prestige and express their dedication to their faith. Crafted by skilled painters, sculptors, and woodcarvers, triptychs exhibited masterful artistry, incorporating detailed imagery and intricate design motifs. Gold leaf was frequently applied to the frames and background elements, enhancing the sense of grandeur and spiritual significance. Over time, triptychs evolved to be made from varying materials, including wood, metal, and ivory. The use of wood was particularly prominent during periods of economic prosperity due to its availability and workability. Later on, however, artists began experimenting with materials such as copper and canvas. The panels in a triptych can be of equal size or have a central panel that is larger or more elaborate than the flanking panels. This design choice often depends on the intended function and style of the altarpiece. Although the traditional triptych remains a form of religious art, the format has also been adopted for secular purposes. Modern artists such as Francis Bacon and Max Beckmann have utilized the triptych structure in their work to explore themes that extend beyond religious subjects. Today, the triptych endures as an influential and versatile art form, allowing artists to present subjects in a unique and engaging manner."},{"question":"Baan was a vendor of enterprise resource planning (ERP) software that is now owned by Infor Global Solutions.Baan or Baan ERP was also the name of the ERP product created by this company.

One day, as a result of the suspension of a research project dealing with a dynamically mutating vaccine following the pattern of the eyesocket flu bacillus, they had absolutely nothing to do until the end of the day, because the boss didn't order them to wash test-tubes. They decided to play a game of hockey under the microscope. For a puck they used one of the millions of experimental bacillus, and one-arm pincettes, which as it happened also resembled hockey sticks, served as sticks. The bacillus was not happy with it at all. It wanted to rest after an exhausting task involving vaccine discouragement, and these whitecoats here planned to put it to work yet again. And this time the work was much more labor-intensive and even more exhausting than before, but the condition and health of the tired bacillus not as good as in the times of youth, about two hours ago. The scientists got excited. On a microscope slide they etched a hockey rink with laser, agreed on the rules, connected the microscope's camera to the big screen display and played until the morning. They had to change pucks several times, but that was fine, they had millions of them in stock. The next day they didn't have anything to do either and they continued to play. They even invited other colleagues and the popularity of the game was so huge they could afford to play it in a championship system. Soon, the games were joined by the guys from the car-repair garage next door.

The dim lighting and rustic wooden tables set the stage for a terrific dining experience. The pizza at Delicious Pizza Corner is simply divine.

The crust is crispy and chewy, a perfect blend of textures, while the high-quality ingredients like fresh mozzarella and garden-fresh veggies create an explosion of flavor in every bite. My personal favorite is the Veggie Lovers because it's just so amazingly colorful and satisfying. On my last visit, I had the pleasure of dining with a group of friends who all shared my love for their pizza. We were able to try several varieties, including a custom creation with goat cheese and prosciutto. This led to an unforgettable night of laughter, sharing, and mouth-watering pizza.

It was too hot too cook in the kitchen, so Mom decided we’d grill hot dogs & stuff outside. But we needed some things so Dad was elected to go to the grocery store. This turned out to be a big production; Dad was trying remember what all was needed without writing a list, and Mom kept adding things even as he was trying to leave. Finally, he got in the car and drove off. Mom & I had just turned around and sat down at our picnic table when all of sudden here was Dad pulling back into the driveway. He’d apparently just driven around the block & came right back. Mom & I looked at each other and smirked- she was thinking the same thing I was: “what’d he forget this time?” But then Dad got out of the car.. and on his face was the look. In my young life, I’d never seen that look before, but it chilled me to the core and I just knew something bad was coming. Mom knew it too; the smirk quickly left her face as Dad came over and said.. “Mom.. I hope I heard this wrong.. but on the radio they said a woman drowned at the lake.. I hope I’m wrong, I barely caught the name, but I think they said it was your sister..” The cookout was forgotten; we went inside & started making phone calls, and unfortunately it was indeed my aunt. She & her family had gone swimming to cool off; apparently she’d gotten a cramp or something and gone under while nobody was looking, and by the time she was missed it was too late. To this day, my Mom is miffed at some family members that we had to find out that way (she was pretty close to this sister so she feels someone should’ve called before it got on the news) but as for me, I will never forget that look on my Dad’s face. Question: Why was dad trying to memorize what to get at the store? Answer: The answer is:","response":"Dad was trying to memorize what to get at the store because he wanted to avoid writing a shopping list. He may have believed that he could remember everything needed for the cookout, or perhaps preferred to rely on his memory rather than taking the time to make a list. Additionally, it could be a matter of personal preference or habit. As Mom kept adding things to the list even as he was about to leave, it became a challenging and somewhat comical task for Dad to recall all the items. This situation ultimately led to some light-hearted interaction between the family members before the tragic news about the aunt reached them."},{"question":"Jacqueline Kemp, 64, has battled anorexia for more than 50 years. At 5ft 5in tall, she has never weighed more than seven stone. 'I married anorexia and everything else came second,' she says.

She has been fighting a very difficult battle with something called anorexia for more than 50 years. Anorexia is when a person doesn't eat enough food because they are scared of gaining weight or being too big. Because they don't eat enough, they become very thin and weak, and it can make them sick. Jacqueline is not very tall, she is 5ft 5in, which is just a little taller than a door. Throughout her life, she has never weighed more than seven stone, which is like having ten small dogs piled on top of each other. That's not very heavy for a grown-up lady! Jacqueline felt like she was married to anorexia because it was such a big part of her life. She said that anorexia came first in her life, and everything else was not as important. In our story, we want to celebrate the bravery and strength of Jacqueline, who keeps fighting this difficult battle. We want people to know that it's important to take care of our bodies by eating good food and being kind to ourselves. Anorexia is like a mean monster that tricks people into thinking they need to be thin and not eat. But just like any other scary monster, we can be brave, face it and learn how to take better care of ourselves. Remember, boys and girls, our bodies are wonderful and magical, and we must treat them with love and care. Eating healthy foods, getting enough sleep and exercise are important, so we can grow strong and happy. We hope that sharing Jacqueline's story can help other people who might be struggling with anorexia, and remind them that they are not alone, and they are stronger than they think. So, let's keep cheering for Jacqueline and all the other brave warriors who are fighting against anorexia and other challenges. Together, we can be strong and help each other!"},{"question":"Q:U.S. voters head to the polls in November for a high-stakes congressional midterm election in which Republican control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate appears to be in jeopardy. The outcome of the elections could have a profound impact on U.S. President Donald Trump as well, and the president is starting to take notice. At a recent campaign-style rally in Washington, Michigan, Trump turned up the heat on opposition Democrats: \\"A vote for a Democrat in November is a vote for open borders and crime. It's very simple,\\" he said. Opinion polls give Democrats an edge looking ahead to the balloting in November, and Trump is trying to get his supporters excited about turning out at the polls. \\"You know what it is? You get complacent,\\" he said. \\"We cannot be complacent. We have to go out, right?\\" The president also told supporters not to pay attention to Democrats who insist they have the House all but won in November. \\"We've got to go out and we've got to fight like hell and we have got to win the House and win the Senate,\\" Trump told the audience. \\"And I think we are going to do great in the Senate and I think we are going to do great in the House because the economy is so good.\\" According to the website RealClearPolitics, the Democrats enjoy a generic ballot advantage of nearly 7 percentage points over the Republicans looking ahead to November. RealClearPolitics averaged several recent polls and found that 45.6 percent of those surveyed said they would support Democratic congressional candidates in November, compared with 38.9 percent who said they would vote for Republicans. Analysts see the generic ballot as a key indicator of party strength heading into the midterms. Historically, the president's party usually loses congressional seats two years after winning the White House.The losses are usually worse if the president's public approval rating is under 50 percent. Trump's approval has recently averaged about 41 percent. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: Why was RealClearPolitics involved? Options: - not enough information - analysts are a key indicator of Republican strength heading into midterms - analysts are a key indicator of party strength heading into midterms - analysts are a key indicator of Democratic strength heading into midterms A:","response":"analysts are a key indicator of party strength heading into midterms"},{"question":"Q: On what part of bones would you expect to find cartilage?

The SS Meredith Victory was noted for evacuating 14,000 refugees, the largest rescue operation by a single ship, even though it was designed to hold 12 passengers. Before escaping, the UN Command forces razed most of Hungnam city, especially the port facilities; and on 16 December 1950, President Truman declared a national emergency with Presidential Proclamation No. 2914, 3 C.F.R. 99 (1953), which remained in force until 14 September 1978.[b] The next day (17 December 1950) Kim Il-sung was deprived of the right of command of KPA by China.

Herring (lyrics and vocals). The band was formed in January 2006 by Welmers, Cashion and Herring--the remaining members of the performance art college band Art Lord & the Self-Portraits--and drummer Erick Murillo. Murillo left in November 2007, after which the band relocated to Baltimore, MD, and released the debut album Wave Like Home through British label Context: When Art Lord & the Self Portraits disbanded in late 2005, its members forgot they had discussed with alt-country band The Texas Governor the possibility of touring together. Future Islands was formed in early 2006 to keep that commitment, with an original line-up consisting of Cashion, Herring, Welmers and Erick Murillo--bassist for The Kickass --who played an electronic drum kit. Already as Art Lord & the Self-Portraits, the band wanted to change their image and took this opportunity to do so. William Cashion stated: \\"Me and Gerrit had been talking for a while about how we wanted to get rid of the gimmick. We wanted to be taken seriously. Our songs had outgrown the gimmick that the band was made on. The songs were starting to deal with bigger, personal, universal themes. We wanted to be taken seriously.\\" The band played their first show on February 12, 2006 at an anti-Valentine's Day party in a venue called the Turducken house, opening for about a dozen bands. After writing 6-7 songs in only one week, they had to come up with a new name quickly, narrowing it down to two choices--Future Shoes and Already Islands--and combining them into one. Future Islands self-released the EP Little Advances on April 28, 2006 which they recorded in March 2006. A couple of months later, Herring dropped out college and left Greenville to deal with a substance abuse problem he had acquired: In June, I left town and didn't come back. It was just drug problems, man. I got sucked into the darkness of partying and shit college kids do. I came clean to my parents and said, 'Look, I have a problem and need your help.' I stayed at my parent's for about a month and then moved across the state to Asheville, North Carolina. It took about a year for me to get my act together. The band still continued and on January 6, 2007 they self-released a split CD with Welmers' solo project Moss of Aura, recorded in December 2006. Question: What did the band do after releasing Little Advances? Answer:","response":"After releasing the Little Advances EP on April 28, 2006, Future Islands continued to write and perform music together, despite the personal challenges faced by the members, including Samuel T. Herring's struggle with substance abuse. In June 2006, Herring left Greenville to seek help for his drug problems. During this period, the band still continued to work on their music. On January 6, 2007, Future Islands self-released a split CD with Gerrit Welmers' solo project, Moss of Aura. This CD was recorded in December of the previous year and showcased the band's ongoing commitment to making music, even as they faced personal hurdles. In November 2007, drummer Erick Murillo left the band, leading Future Islands to relocate to Baltimore, Maryland. After the move, the band continued to develop their sound and work on new materials. Their dedication and perseverance eventually culminated in the release of their debut album, Wave Like Home, which they released through the British label Upset The Rhythm in August 2008.

A study in 2007 by Mark Long, an economics professor at the University of Washington, demonstrated that the alternatives of affirmative action proved ineffective in restoring minority enrollment in public flagship universities in California, Texas, and Washington. More specifically, apparent rebounds of minority enrollment can be explained by increasing minority enrollment in high schools of those states, and the beneficiaries of class-based (not race) affirmative action would be white students. At the same time, affirmative action itself is both morally and materially costly: 52 percent of white populace (compared to 14 percent of black) thought it should be abolished, implying white distaste of using racial identity, and full-file review is expected to cost the universities an additional 1.5 million to 2 million per year, excluding possible cost of litigation.

The city lies on the banks of the River Garonne, from the Mediterranean Sea, from the Atlantic Ocean, and from Paris. It is the fourth-largest city in France with 466,297 inhabitants in January 2014. The Toulouse Metro area is, with 1 312 304 inhabitants as of 2014, France's 4th metropolitan area after Paris, Lyon and Marseille and ahead of Lille and Bordeaux. - Bordeaux (Gascon Occitan: \\"\\") is a port city on the Garonne River in the Gironde department in southwestern France. - The term cult usually refers to a social group defined by their religious, spiritual, or philosophical beliefs, or common interest in a particular personality, object or goal. The term itself is controversial and has divergent definitions in popular culture and in academia and has been an ongoing source of contention among scholars across several fields of study. In the sociological classifications of religious movements, a cult is a social group with socially deviant or novel beliefs and practices, although this is often unclear. Other researchers present a less-organized picture of cults on the basis that cults arise spontaneously around novel beliefs and practices. The word \\"cult\\" has always been controversial because it is (in a pejorative sense) considered a subjective term, used as an \\"ad hominem\\" attack against groups with differing doctrines or practices. Cults range in size from local groups with a few members to international organizations with millions. - The United States Army (USA) is the largest branch of the United States Armed Forces and performs land-based military operations. It is one of the seven uniformed services of the United States and is designated as the Army of the United States in the United States Constitution, Article 2, Section 2, Clause 1 and United States Code, Title 10, Subtitle B, Chapter 301, Section 3001. As the largest and senior branch of the U.S. military, the modern U.S. Army has its roots in the Continental Army, which was formed (14 June 1775) to fight the American Revolutionary War (17751783)before the U.S. was established as a country. After the Revolutionary War, the Congress of the Confederation created the United States Army on 3 June 1784, to replace the disbanded Continental Army. The United States Army considers itself descended from the Continental Army, and dates its institutional inception from the origin of that armed force in 1775. - The Rhine (, , ) is a European river that begins in the Swiss canton of Graubünden in the southeastern Swiss Alps, forms part of the Swiss-Austrian, Swiss-Liechtenstein, Swiss-German and then the Franco-German border, then flows through the Rhineland and eventually empties into the North Sea in the Netherlands.

By land area, it is the second largest region of France and the largest outermost region within the European Union. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - Genocide is intentional action to destroy a people (usually defined as an ethnic, national, racial, or religious group) in whole or in part. The hybrid word \\"genocide\\" is a combination of the Greek word \\"génos\\" (\\"race, people\\") and the Latin suffix \\"-cide\\" (\\"act of killing\\").

It comprised delegates appointed by the legislatures or assemblies of the several states. It was preceded by the Second Continental Congress (17751781) and governed under the newly adopted \\"Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union\\", which were proposed 17761777, adopted by the Continental Congress in July 1778 and finally agreed to by a unanimous vote of all thirteen states by 1781, held up by a long dispute over the cession of western territories beyond the Appalachian Mountains to the central government led by Maryland and a coalition of smaller states without western claims. The newly reorganized Congress at the time continued to refer itself as the Continental Congress throughout its eight-year history, although modern historians separate it from the earlier bodies, which operated under slightly different rules and procedures until the later part of American Revolutionary War. The membership of the Second Continental Congress automatically carried over to the Congress of the Confederation when the latter was created by the ratification of the Articles of Confederation. It had the same secretary as the Second Continental Congress, namely Charles Thomson. The Congress of the Confederation was succeeded by the Congress of the United States as provided for in the Constitution of the United States, proposed September 17, 1787, in Philadelphia and ratified by the states through 1787 to 1788 and even into 1789 and 1790. - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about .

They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out. From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council. - Military personnel are members of the armed forces. Usually, personnel are divided into military branches roughly defined by certain circumstances of their deployment. Those who serve in a typical large land force are soldiers, making up an army. Those who serve in seagoing forces are seamen or sailors, and their branch is a navy or coast guard . Marines serve in a marine corps. In the 20th century, the development of powered flight aircraft prompted the development of air forces, serviced by airmen. Designated leaders of military personnel are officers. These include commissioned officers, warrant officers and non-commissioned officers (NCOs). For naval forces, non-commissioned officers are referred to as petty officers (POs). military personnel are instructed to wear dog tags - Trench warfare is a type of land warfare using occupied fighting lines consisting largely of trenches, in which troops are significantly protected from the enemy's small arms fire and are substantially sheltered from artillery. The most famous use of trench warfare is the Western Front in World War I. It has become a byword for stalemate, attrition, sieges and futility in conflict. - The Continental Army was formed by the Second Continental Congress after the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War by the colonies that became the United States of America. Established by a resolution of the Congress on June 14, 1775, it was created to coordinate the military efforts of the Thirteen Colonies in their revolt against the rule of Great Britain. The Continental Army was supplemented by local militias and troops that remained under control of the individual states or were otherwise independent. General George Washington was the commander-in-chief of the army throughout the war. - A republic (from ) is a sovereign state, country, or government which is organized with a form of government in which power resides in elected individuals representing the citizen body and government leaders exercise power according to the rule of law. In modern times, the definition of a republic commonly refers to a government which excludes a monarch. Currently, 147 of the world's 206 sovereign states use the word \\"republic\\" as part of their official names; not all of these are republics in the sense of having elected governments, nor do all nations with elected governments use the word \\"republic\\" in their names. - The English Channel (\\"the Sleeve\\" [hence ] \\"Sea of Brittany\\" \\"British Sea\\"), also called simply the Channel, is the body of water that separates southern England from northern France, and joins the southern part of the North Sea to the rest of the Atlantic Ocean. - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved. - In general, a civilian is \\"a person who is not a member of the military or of a police or firefighting force\\", as defined by Merriam Webster's Dictionary. From the perspective of the U.S. Department of Defense, Chapter 18 of Title 10 United States Code refers to non-military law enforcement officers as civilians since they are employees rather than enlisted personnel, and also in order to distinguish itself from military police. In military and law enforcement slang, the term \\"Civies\\" or \\"Civvies\\" are often used to refer civilian population or civilian clothing. - Lyon or (more archaically) Lyons (or ) is a city in east-central France, in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region, about from Paris and from Marseille.

The currency is also officially used by the institutions of the European Union and four other European countries, as well as unilaterally by two others, and is consequently used daily by some 337 million Europeans . Outside of Europe, a number of overseas territories of EU members also use the euro as their currency. - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre.

Could you please translate this to English?","response":"Sure, little buddy! The phrase \\"Budu v pořádku, kapitáne.\\" in English means \\"I'll be okay, captain.\\""},{"question":"It's not quite the timeless masterpiece you would hope it would be based on the acclaim it garnered, but 1969's \\"Midnight Cowboy\\" is still a powerhouse showcase for two young actors just bursting into view at the time. Directed by John Schlesinger and written by Waldo Salt, the movie seems to be a product of its time, the late 1960's when American films were especially expressionistic, but it still casts a spell because the story comes down to themes of loneliness and bonding that resonate no matter what period. The film's cinematic influence can still be felt in the unspoken emotionalism found in Ang Lee's \\"Brokeback Mountain\\". The meandering plot follows Joe Buck, a naive, young Texan who decides to move to Manhattan to become a stud-for-hire for rich women. Full of energy but lacking any savvy, he fails miserably but is unwilling to concede defeat despite his dwindling finances. He meets a cynical, sickly petty thief named \\"Ratso\\" Rizzo, who first sees Joe as an easy pawn. The two become dependent on one another, and Rizzo begins to manage Joe. Things come to a head at a psychedelic, drug-infested party where Joe finally lands a paying client. Meanwhile, Rizzo becomes sicker, and the two set off for Florida to seek a better life. This is not a story that will appeal to everyone, in fact, some may still find it repellent that a hustler and a thief are turned into sympathetic figures, yet their predicaments feel achingly authentic. In his first major role, Jon Voight is ideally cast as he brings out Joe's paper-thin bravado and deepening sexual insecurities. As Rizzo, Dustin Hoffman successfully upends his clean, post-college image from \\"The Graduate\\" and immerses himself in the personal degradation and glimmering hope that act as an oddly compatible counterpoint to Joe. The honesty of their portrayals is complemented by Schlesinger's film treatment which vividly captures the squalor of the Times Square district at the time. The director also effectively inserts montages of flashbacks and fantasy sequences to fill in the character's fragile psyches. Credit also needs to go to Salt for not letting the pervasive cynicism overwhelm the pathos of the story. The other performances are merely incidental to the journeys of the main characters, including Brenda Vaccaro as the woman Joe meets at the party, Sylvia Miles as a blowsy matron, John McGiver as a religious zealot and Barnard Hughes as a lonely out-of-towner. The two-disc 2006 DVD package contains a pristine print transfer of the 1994 restoration and informative commentary from producer Jerome Hellman since unfortunately neither Schlesinger nor Salt are still living. There are three terrific featurettes on the second disc - a look-back documentary, \\"After Midnight: Reflections on a Classic 35 Years Later\\", which features comments from Hellman, Hoffman, Voight and others, as well as clips and related archive footage such as Voight's screen test; \\"Controversy and Acclaim\\", which examines the genesis of the movie's initial 'X' rating and public response to the film; and a tribute to the director, \\"Celebrating Schlesinger\\".

OPTIONS: (A). After removing the torte from the freezer, spread the whipping cream mixture all of the top using a loaf pan.; (B). After removing the torte from the freezer, spread the whipping cream mixture all of the top using an offset spatula.;","response":"Option B is the correct choice for spreading frosting on a creamy chocolate toffee torte. To spread frosting on a creamy chocolate toffee torte, you should follow these step-by-step instructions: 1. Prepare all necessary ingredients: Ensure that you have prepared the chocolate toffee torte, the frosting (typically a whipped cream or buttercream), and any additional toppings (such as crumbled toffee bits, chocolate shavings, or chopped nuts) as per your recipe. 2. Freeze the torte: To help prevent the torte from becoming too soft or falling apart during decoration, most recipes will require you to freeze the torte for at least one hour or until it has firmed up. 3. Collect your tools: For this task, you will need an offset spatula (option B) and a cake stand or a serving platter. An offset spatula is a versatile tool that is ideal for frosting cakes due to its angled handle, allowing better control and precision when spreading the frosting. 4. Place the torte on a cake stand or serving platter: Carefully transfer the frozen torte from the freezer to the cake stand or platter. This will make it easier for you to apply the frosting and create a visually appealing presentation. 5. Apply a crumb coat: If your torte has loose crumbs on the surface, you can apply a thin layer of frosting (known as a crumb coat) to the entire cake. This layer will trap any crumbs and set a smooth base for the final frosting. After applying this layer, chill the torte in the refrigerator for about 15-30 minutes. 6. Spread the frosting: After removing the torte from the refrigerator (or freezer if not applying a crumb coat), place a dollop of the whipping cream mixture onto the center of the torte. Using the offset spatula, spread the frosting evenly across the top of the torte, working from the center outwards in smooth, sweeping motions. As you frost the cake, rotate the turntable (if using one) or the cake stand to access all angles. 7. Frost the sides: To frost the sides of the torte, scoop a generous amount of the remaining frosting onto the offset spatula, and gently spread it around the torte's sides using smooth, even strokes. Ensure that the frosting is uniformly spread, from top to bottom. 8. Smooth the surface: Once the torte is completely covered in frosting, use the offset spatula to go over the top and sides again, smoothing any ridges or imperfections. This will give you a polished, professional appearance. 9. Add additional toppings: If desired, sprinkle crumbled toffee bits, chocolate shavings, or chopped nuts over the top of the torte to enhance the overall appearance and taste. You can also add designs with a piping bag for a more elaborate presentation. 10. Allow the torte to set: To ensure that the frosting adheres properly and sets firmly, return the cake to the refrigerator for at least 30-60 minutes, or until the frosting is firm to the touch. Once this process is complete, your delicious creamy chocolate toffee torte, beautifully frosted using an offset spatula (option B), will be ready to serve and enjoy."},{"question":"What is an example of a tweet?","response":"To create an example of a tweet, I will follow these steps: 1.

Samoa Air, which opened in 2012, asks passengers to give their personal weight during booking, which is then charged according to the length of a flight. The customers will also be weighed just before they board the plane. \\"It is believed that all people throughout the world are the same size,\\" Samoa Air CEO Chris Langton said. \\"Airplanes always run on weight, not seats.\\" \\"There is no doubt in my mind that this is the concept of the future. This is the fairest way of your travelling with your family or yourself.\\" Though the airline introduced the plan last November, it caught people's attention last week when the carrier began international flights to neighboring American Samoa. Almost at the same time, a Norwegian economist, Bharat Bhatta, published a report suggesting that airlines should charge obese passengers more. The Pacific Islands contain some of the world's most common countries for obesity, many ranking in the top 10, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Samoa is ranked number four, with 59.6 percent of the population considered obese, said the most recent WHO report. According to Samoa Air's latest schedule, the airline charges up to 0.57 per kg for flights in Samoa and 1.03 per kg for its only international flight to American Samoa, around 250 miles. Children under 12 are charged 75 percent of the adult rate, with fares also based on weight. Any overweight baggage is calculated at the same rate as the passenger's personal weight. The plan could actually prove cheaper in some cases, such as for families travelling with small children, and Langton said customer reaction has mainly been \\"amazingly positive\\". The idea of charging passengers by weight has been hotly discussed before, and in the US some airlines require those who do not fit into a seat comfortably to buy a second seat.
