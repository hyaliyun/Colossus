It is now day 22 and with only two days left of feasting, the creeper must find new victims before his time is up. The bat-like creeper has greater strength with his ability to fly. The story begins with the creeper as a scarecrow in a cornfield waiting to snatch the child of Jack Taggart (Ray Wise) who ends up wanting revenge on the creeper after he flies away with his son. This leads to the 23rd and last day of the creeper. A busload of high school basketball players, cheerleaders, and coaches are returning home after a Championship game on East 9 Highway. The creeper throws a spike made from the body parts of other victims and blows out one of the bus tires. As night falls, the creeper swoops down and takes the coaches away, and then he begins to feast on the terrified teenagers.

They steal a few pages from an ancient, mystical text belonging to the Ancient One, a long-lived sorcerer who has taught every student at Kamar-Taj, including Kaecilius, in the mystic arts. The Ancient One pursues the traitors, but Kaecilius and his followers escape. In New York City, Stephen Strange, a wealthy, acclaimed, and arrogant neurosurgeon, severely injures his hands in a car accident, leaving him unable to operate. Fellow surgeon and former lover Christine Palmer tries to help him move on, but Strange vainly pursues experimental surgeries to heal his hands, nearly bankrupting himself. Strange learns about Jonathan Pangborn, a paraplegic who mysteriously regained use of his legs. Pangborn directs Strange to Kamar-Taj, where he is taken in by Mordo, a sorcerer under the Ancient One. The Ancient One demonstrates her power to Strange, revealing the astral plane and other dimensions such as the Mirror Dimension. She reluctantly agrees to train Strange, whose arrogance and ambition remind her of Kaecilius. Strange studies under the Ancient One and Mordo, and from ancient books in the library that is now guarded by Master Wong. Strange learns that Earth is protected from threats from other dimensions by a shield generated from three buildings called Sanctums, in New York City, London, and Hong Kong, which are all connected and accessible from Kamar-Taj. The sorcerers' task is to protect the Sanctums, though Pangborn instead chose to channel mystical energy only into walking again. Strange progresses quickly, and secretly reads the text from which Kaecilius stole pages, learning to bend time with the mystical Eye of Agamotto. Mordo and Wong warn Strange against breaking the laws of nature, drawing a comparison to Kaecilius' desire for eternal life. answer the following question: What is the name of the person who is reminded of Kaecilius by Strange's arrogance and ambition? The answer to this question is:","response":"The Ancient One. The Ancient One is reminded of Kaecilius by Stephen Strange's arrogance and ambition. When Strange came to Kamar-Taj seeking help and training in the mystical arts, his personality traits sparked this association in the Ancient One's mind. Kaecilius was a former student of the Ancient One who had turned against her, stealing pages from a powerful mystical text and leading to a major conflict. The Ancient One had seen similar traits of arrogance and ambition in Kaecilius which eventually led to his betrayal. Observing these traits in Strange were concerning to the Ancient One, as she had experienced the dire consequences these traits can lead to in her past interaction with Kaecilius. Despite this, she reluctantly agrees to train Strange, possibly with a hope that Strange would not fall down the same path as Kaecilius did."},{"question":"Based on the premise \\"This award means a great deal to me, Kilgore said, pointing to others so honored. \\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"Kilgore got an award for his pro-bono work.\\" is true (see options)?

A key figure in helping Stafford to develop her solo career was Mike Nidorf, an agent who first heard her as a member of the Pied Pipers while he was serving as a Captain with the United States Army. Having previously discovered artists such as Glenn Miller, Artie Shaw, and Woody Herman, Nidorf was impressed by Stafford's voice, and contacted her when he was demobilized in 1944. After she agreed to let him represent her, he encouraged her to reduce her weight and arranged a string of engagements that raised her profile, and confidence.The success of Stafford's solo career led to a demand for personal appearances, and from February 1945 she embarked on a six-month residency at New York's La Martinique nightclub. Her performance was well-received—an article in the July 1945 edition of Band Leaders magazine described it as \\"sensational\\"—but Stafford did not enjoy singing before live audiences, and it was the only nightclub venue she ever played. Speaking about her discomfort with live performances, Stafford told a 1996 interview with The New Yorker's Nancy Franklin, \\"I'm basically a singer, period, and I think I'm really lousy up in front of an audience—it's just not me.\\"Stafford's tenure with the United Service Organizations (USO) during World War II—which often saw her perform for soldiers stationed in the U.S.—led to her acquiring the nickname \\"G.I.

Two markalongs were just born from different families in a zoo. The first markalong, animal A, has only one parent. The second markalong, animal B, has two parents. Although they used different forms of sexual reproduction, both animals are healthy and doing well at the zoo. But I can use this background: The advantage of asexual reproduction is that it can be very quick and does not require the meeting of a male and female organism. The disadvantage of asexual reproduction is that organisms do not receive a mix of traits from both parents. An organism that is born through asexual reproduction only has the DNA from the one parent. In fact, the offspring is genetically an exact copy of the parent. This can cause problems for the individual. For example, if the parent has a gene that causes a particular disease, the offspring will also have the gene that causes that disease. Organisms produced sexually may or may not inherit the disease gene because they receive a mix of their parents' genes. What is an answer for this question: Which markalong was produced asexually? A:","response":"To answer this question, let's go through the information provided step-by-step: 1. A species of animal called a markalong can reproduce either sexually or asexually. 2. Animal A has only one parent, while Animal B has two parents.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","response":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of having more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will have a direct effect on the process of the greenhouse effect, leading to a greater greenhouse effect overall. As the concentration of greenhouse gases increases, more heat radiation will be trapped in the Earth's atmosphere. This will lead to higher average global temperatures, causing a range of climate changes, including an increased risk of extreme weather events, impacts on ecosystems and habitats, and issues related to agriculture, water resources, and human health. The indirect effects of this perturbation may include feedback loops, which could further intensify the greenhouse effect, such as the release of methane from melting permafrost, or the reduction of albedo through the melting of ice caps and glaciers. These feedback loops can contribute to the acceleration of climate change, making the greenhouse effect even more pronounced."},{"question":"Translate to Finnish: We do not want to wait until the round of WTO negotiations has been concluded.","response":"Emme halua odottaa, että WTO-neuvottelukierros on saatu päätökseen. In this sentence, the English text has been translated to Finnish: - \\"We do not want\\" = \\"Emme halua\\", where \\"emme\\" is the negation of the verb \\"halua\\" (to want) in first person plural, \\"we\\". - \\"to wait\\" = \\"odottaa\\", which is the basic form of the verb \\"to wait\\" in Finnish. - \\"until\\" = \\"että\\", which is a conjunction used to connect the two parts of the sentence. - \\"the round of WTO negotiations\\" = \\"WTO-neuvottelukierros\\", where \\"WTO\\" stays the same as in the English text referring to the World Trade Organization, \\"neuvottelukierros\\" means \\"round of negotiations\\", and the two words are connected with a hyphen in Finnish. - \\"has been concluded\\" = \\"on saatu päätökseen\\", which is a passive form of the expression meaning that the action was completed. \\"On\\" is the auxiliary verb \\"to be\\" in the passive, while \\"saatu\\" means \\"received\\" or \\"obtained\\" and \\"päätökseen\\" is the illative form of \\"päätös\\" (conclusion).

Question: suppose there is no air available to breath happens, how will it affect MORE mold forming on bread. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","response":"If there is no air available to breathe, the mold growth on bread will be affected. Let's go step-by-step to analyze the situation. 1. A mold spore floats through the air: Without air, there will be no means for the mold spore to float and reach the bread's surface. 2. The spore lands on a piece of bread: As there is no air to transport the spore, there is a lesser chance of the spore landing on the bread. 3. The spore grows hyphae into the bread: Assuming the spore somehow reaches the bread, mold growth would still be affected. Mold needs oxygen to grow, and without air, it would have a difficult time growing. 4. The mold forms a colony: Colony formation will be slower or possibly stunted due to insufficient oxygen levels. 5. Sporangiophores grow upward: Limited oxygen will also affect the growth of sporangiophores, inhibiting the mold's ability to reproduce effectively. 6. The mold sends out spores: If sporangiophore growth is inhibited, sending out spores might not happen at the same rate or might not occur. In conclusion, without air, there would be less mold forming on bread due to the lack of transportation for spores, limited oxygen for growth, and inhibited reproduction processes. Therefore, the perturbation has a negative effect on mold formation."},{"question":"Please answer the following question about this movie plot. If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\". Question: Which kind of modern materiel do they avoid using? Movie plot title: The Wildest Dream Movie plot: In 1924 mountaineer George Mallory was torn between love for his wife Ruth, and his obsession with the last great adventure left to man: becoming the first person to reach the summit of the untouched Mount Everest. Dressed in gabardine and wearing hobnailed boots, Mallory risked everything in pursuit of his dream, but was last seen alive 800 feet below the summit. Then the clouds rolled in and he disappeared. After discovering Malloryâs body on Everest in 1999, modern climber Conrad Ankerâs life became intertwined with Malloryâs story. Malloryâs frozen body was found with his belongings intact; the only thing missing was a photograph of Ruth, which Mallory had promised to place on the summit. Haunted by Mallory's story, Anker returns to Everest with British climbing prodigy Leo Houlding to discover the truth about Mallory and to unravel the mysteries surrounding his disappearance. Anker and his climbing partner take on the Second Step without the use of the fixed ladder; free climbing it with the use of some modern safety precautions (e.g. perlon rope, camming devices, belay devices), to evaluate if indeed Mallory was capable of climbing the Second Step himself in 1924.","response":"In the movie plot of \\"The Wildest Dream,\\" modern climbers Conrad Anker and Leo Houlding avoid using the fixed ladder at the Second Step while attempting to retrace George Mallory's 1924 route up Mount Everest. Their primary goal is to evaluate if Mallory could have been capable of climbing the Second Step himself in 1924 without the assistance of the fixed ladder or other modern equipment that can aid a climber's ascent. While they are still using some contemporary safety precautions, such as perlon rope, camming devices, and belay devices, Anker and Houlding's decision to free climb the Second Step without the fixed ladder demonstrates their commitment to recreating the experience as closely as possible to what Mallory would have encountered. The fixed ladder aids climbers in overcoming the technical difficulties of the Second Step, which is considered one of the most challenging parts of the Mount Everest climb. By opting not to use the ladder, Anker and Houlding are putting themselves in the same position as Mallory in 1924 – climbing with limited equipment and relying more on their skill, determination, and physical abilities. This decision is a crucial aspect of the movie plot, as it adds authenticity to their journey and helps the audience to better understand the challenges Mallory faced in his quest to conquer Mount Everest. It gives a more accurate representation of mountaineering in the early 20th century and showcases the incredible determination and abilities of climbers like George Mallory who challenged the seemingly insurmountable without the advantageous tools and technology available to modern climbers."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text. Q: RAF Upwood, near Ramsey, was shut by the Ministry of Defence in 1994, but attempts to develop the land failed to take off. The airbase has played host to both British and American services and was the set of a 1953 Hollywood movie. Owner Strawsons Property said it was close to a sale that would see hundreds of homes built. RAF Upwood was built in 1917 for the Royal Flying Corps - before it became home to RAF squadrons and expanded from 1936. Much of the 1953 war film Appointment in London, starring Dirk Bogarde, was filmed there. In 1981 the site became one of three in Cambridgeshire - along with RAF Alconbury and RAF Molesworth - to come under the control of the United States Air Force. The prospective buyer for the redundant site has not been named. Adrian Sail, of Strawsons, said the site had become vulnerable to vandalism and graffiti. \\"When it was an operational airbase all these buildings would have been pristine, the grass cut neat and tidy, but clearly it has been empty now for over 20 years,\\" he said. \\"It is big enough to accommodate 450 houses which the Local Plan has allocated, and in due course these buildings will be demolished.\\" Alan James, of the Campaign to Protect Rural England, said creating housing on the site was a \\"good idea\\" but developers needed to consider the local community and infrastructure. \\"The existing owner is being responsible regarding planning consent for 160 homes,\\" he said, \\"but the 450 proposed in the Local Plan is quite a big increase\\". In a statement, Huntingdonshire District Council said it hoped any development would \\"maintain the character of the historic RAF use\\".

Does The Hague border multiple bodies of water? What is the step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the answer: no?","response":"To answer the question of whether The Hague borders multiple bodies of water, we need to follow a step-by-step reasoning process: 1. Identify the location of The Hague: The Hague is a city in the Netherlands, which is a country in Northwestern Europe. 2. Determine the geography of The Hague: The Hague is situated along the North Sea coast. It is the third largest city in the Netherlands and is the seat of the Dutch government. 3. Identify any bodies of water around The Hague: As The Hague is on the North Sea coast, we know that it has a coastline. Additionally, The Hague area has other bodies of water, such as canals, lakes, rivers, and ponds. 4. Define \\"multiple bodies of water\\": In this context, multiple bodies of water would mean that The Hague must share its borders with two or more distinct, significant water bodies (for example, two different seas, an ocean and a sea, or a large lake and a sea). 5. Apply the definition to The Hague: While The Hague has several bodies of water within or around the city, such as canals, lakes, rivers, and ponds, these are not distinct and significant water bodies that form the city's border. The only significant body of water that borders the city is the North Sea. 6. Conclusion: Based on the step-by-step reasoning process, the answer to the question \\"Does The Hague border multiple bodies of water?\\" is 'no,' because the city borders only one significant body of water – the North Sea."},{"question":"Though every student who qualifies \\"will receive their grant in full,\\" there are a few small exceptions.

Wedge Donovan is a tough construction boss, building airstrips in the Pacific for the U.S. Navy during World War II. He clashes with his liaison officer, Lieutenant Commander Robert Yarrow, over the fact that his men are not allowed to arm themselves against the Japanese. When the enemy lands in force on the island, he finally takes matters into his own hands, leading his men into the fray. This prevents Yarrow from springing a carefully devised trap that would have wiped out the invaders in a murderous machinegun crossfire, with minimal American losses. Instead, many of Donovan's men are killed unnecessarily. As a result of this tragedy, Yarrow finally convinces the US Navy to form Construction Battalions (CBs, or the more familiar \\"Seabees\\") with Donovan's assistance, despite their mutual romantic interest in war correspondent Constance Chesley. Donovan and many of his men enlist and receive formal military training. The two men are teamed together on yet another island. The Japanese launch a major attack, which the Seabees barely manage to hold off, sometimes using heavy construction machinery such as bulldozers and a clamshell bucket. When word reaches Donovan of another approaching enemy column, there are no sailors left to oppose this new threat. In desperation, he rigs a bulldozer with explosives on its blade, intending to ram it into a petroleum storage tank. The plan works, sending a cascade of burning liquid into the path of the Japanese, who retreat in panic, right into the sights of waiting machine guns. However, Wedge is shot in the process and dies in the explosion.

The quality of grass influences the roll of the ball as well as the ability of the player to \\"take a divot\\" (effectively, the ability to hit down into the ball, hitting the ball first, then hitting the turf and removing a portion of it as the club continues its arc). Fairways on prestigious tours, like the PGA Tour, are cut low. Mowing heights influence the play of the course. For example, the grass heights at U.S. Open events are alternated from one hole to the next in order to make the course more difficult. One example of this is the infamous roughs at U.S. Opens, which are often 3 to 5 inches high, depending on how close to the fairway or green the section of grass will be. This makes it difficult for a player to recover after a bad shot. Paragraph: The golf course at the Aurora Country Club cuts their grass to 2 1/2 inches high. The grass at the Augusta Country Club is cut to 4 inches. Sam likes more of a challenge when playing golf but Jack likes to play on turf where the ball rolls easier. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which Country Club would Jack enjoy playing golf at more, Aurora or Augusta? Answer:","response":"Given the information in the paragraph above, Jack would enjoy playing golf more at the Aurora Country Club. The reason for this is that the grass at the Aurora Country Club is cut to a height of 2 1/2 inches, which is shorter than the 4-inch grass at the Augusta Country Club. As mentioned, Jack prefers to play on turf where the ball rolls easier, and shorter grass generally provides a smoother surface for the ball to roll on. This makes the Aurora Country Club a more suitable choice for Jack's golfing preferences."},{"question":"Determine if the sentence is true based on the text below: The album was released in 1959 More of Tom Lehrer was the second studio album recorded by musical satirist Tom Lehrer.

In Bridger's Wells, Nevada in 1885, Art Croft and Gil Carter ride into town and enter Darby's Saloon. The atmosphere is subdued due to recent incidents of cattle-rustling. Art and Gil are suspected to be rustlers because they have rarely been seen in town. A man enters the saloon and announces that a rancher named Larry Kinkaid has been murdered. The townspeople immediately form a posse to pursue the murderers, who they believe are cattle rustlers. A judge tells the posse that it must bring the suspects back for trial, and that its formation by a deputy (the sheriff being out of town) is illegal. Art and Gil join the posse to avoid raising even more suspicion. Davies, who was initially opposed to forming the posse, also joins, along with \\"Major\\" Tetley and his son Gerald. Poncho informs the posse that three men and cattle bearing Kinkaid's brand have just entered Bridger's Pass. The posse encounters a stagecoach. When they try to stop it, the stagecoach guard assumes that it is a stickup, and shoots, wounding Art. In the coach are Rose Mapen, Gil's ex-girlfriend, and her new husband, Swanson. Later that night in Ox-Bow Canyon, the posse finds three men sleeping, with what are presumed to be stolen cattle nearby. The posse interrogates them: a young, well-spoken man, Donald Martin; a Mexican, Juan Martínez; and an old man, Alva Hardwicke (Francis Ford, brother of film director John Ford). Martin claims that he purchased the cattle from Kinkaid but received no bill of sale. No one believes Martin, and the posse decides to hang the three men at sunrise. Martin writes a letter to his wife and asks Davies, the only member of the posse that he trusts, to deliver it. Davies reads the letter, and, hoping to save Martin's life, shows it to the others.

Solve 46*w + 371*w + 34609 = -236*w for w.","response":"Alright, let's solve the equation step by step like we're telling a story. We have an equation: 46 * w + 371 * w + 34609 = -236 * w. Now, let's combine the numbers with \\"w\\" together. So, 46 * w and 371 * w and -236 * w. 46 * w and 371 * w make 46 + 371 = 417. And 417 * w - 236 * w makes 417 - 236 = 181. So now we have: 181 * w + 34609 = 0. Now, we want to find out the number \\"w\\", so we want to leave \\"w\\" alone on one side of the equation. We move 34609 to the other side to do that. When we move it, the sign switches from positive (+) to negative (-). So, it becomes: 181 * w = -34609. Lastly, we need to find \\"w\\". We do that by dividing both sides of the equation by 181. It looks like this: w = -34609 ÷ 181. Now, let's calculate it: w = -191. So, the answer to the equation is w = -191.

Every week, it seemed, another pretty young girl from a nice family, who was happy and popular and always did well at school, was being kidnapped or murdered by what the Sun newspaper cheerfully termed 'evil paedo scum'. Naming and shaming was as popular a feature in the Murdoch press as Page Three girls and discounted holidays to Butlin's. Of course you can't blame parents for wanting to keep their children safe; that's pretty much the job description of a parent. And, on the face of it, the tabloids were doing a public service in warning us about the paedophile menace lurking in our midst. The problem came when it turned out that a huge number of these concerned tabloid-reading parents were also absolute fucking morons. For every story of an actual sex offender being driven from their house by a baying mob there was one like that of Dr Yvette Cloete, a doctor at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport, South Wales, who returned home from work to find that a group of 'concerned parents' had daubed the word 'paedo' on her front door in bright red paint. Dr Cloete was a consultant paediatrician. Easy mistake. If you're an absolute fucking moron. And so it was that one hung-over morning, after reading yet another story about vigilantes who had threatened to stone Maxine Carr, the girlfriend of Soham killer Ian Huntley, to death during her high-profile trial for perverting the course of justice, I decided to set up a website parodying this collective national madness.

Verbal bullying occurs when someone says something to you in order to hurt you or lower your self-esteem. Don't be afraid to be assertive and stand up for yourself, but avoid being combative. You can also let others know that you are being verbally bullied and ask for their help. Don't respond with anger or emotion. Bullies want to knock you down or start a fight. Deny them this by staying calm and positive. Let the bully know that their attitude and behavior is unacceptable. Calmly listen to the bully and ask questions. For example, “It sounds like you think I'm stupid. Why do you feel that way?” Bullies won't often have actual reasons and will generally stop once you open an honest dialogue with them. Physical bullying occurs when physical violence is used against another person in order to intimidate and control them. This type of bullying is very dangerous and needs to be addressed immediately. Don't be afraid to seek help if you are being physically bullied. Tell someone immediately if you are being physically bullied. Bullies may threaten you with further violence or you may feel too embarrassed to talk about it. Don't be afraid to speak up, someone will help you. Physical bullying tends to escalate. The sooner it is addressed the safer you will be. Cyberbullying occurs virtually but its effects are just as real and serious as any other form of bullying. This form of bullying will usually occur when a bully makes threats or remarks on-line that aim to demean, hurt, or scare another person. Thankfully there are some established methods you can use to stop a cyberbully: Ignore any messages the bully sends to you. Bullies want you to get mad and respond. Ignoring them lets them know that you are not a target. Threats of violence made on-line are taken very seriously. These can be reported to police or the FBI. Save all instances and evidence of cyberbullying. For example, any emails from a bully that demonstrate their bullying should be downloaded or otherwise stored securely. Cut off communication. If you are able, block their email address, phone number, or whatever method they are contacting you with. Tell someone if you are being bullied online or through some other form of technology.","response":"This article talks about different types of bullying - verbal, physical, and cyberbullying - and gives advice on how to deal with each situation, such as staying calm, seeking help, and cutting off communication with the bully."},{"question":"Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: What will children do with dodge balls?

This might involve the allocation of public funds, private investments, or international financial assistance, depending on the context and the specific development goals the country has set. A detailed explanation about the concept: Mobilizing National Financial Resources for Development refers to the coordination and implementation of strategies, policies, and programs aimed at boosting a country's economic growth and well-being by promoting nationally generated financial resources. The concept encompasses several aspects, which are discussed below: 1. Public financing: This involves optimizing government revenues and expenditures to ensure efficient and equitable allocation of national resources. Examples of revenue sources for many governments include taxation, loans, grants, and the sale of public assets. By strategically allocating these resources in vital sectors such as education, healthcare, infrastructure, and social protection, governments can create conditions conducive to long-term development. 2. Private sector investment: Encouraging private investment in development projects is crucial for economic growth, job creation, and improving a nation's overall competitiveness. Governments can attract private investment through creating a favorable business environment, offering tax incentives, reducing bureaucratic red tape, and protecting property rights. Public-private partnerships (PPPs) are also a common strategy employed to mobilize private sector investment for development projects. 3. Domestic savings and investments: Encouraging and fostering a savings culture among citizens can lead to higher levels of investment in the economy, triggering economic growth. Domestic savings can be mobilized through various financial instruments, such as bank deposits, pension funds, and stock market investments. These investments can then be channeled into productive sectors like infrastructure, agriculture, and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), benefiting the overall economy. 4. Development finance institutions (DFIs): DFIs play a crucial role in mobilizing national financial resources for development purposes. These institutions provide financing, technical assistance, and risk management support to private sector projects in developing countries, thus encouraging entrepreneurship, innovation, and economic growth. 5. International financial assistance: Developing countries may also seek international financial assistance in the form of loans, grants, and concessional lending from bilateral or multilateral agencies, such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and regional development banks. These resources can help governments to close financing gaps, support critical sectors, and facilitate reforms necessary for a more inclusive and sustainable development. 6. Innovative financing mechanisms: Last but not least, mobilizing national financial resources for development also involves exploring innovative financing mechanisms, such as green bonds, social impact bonds, or blended finance. These instruments can help to bridge funding gaps, crowd in private sector investment, and direct funding towards specific development issues. In summary, the concept of mobilizing national financial resources for development underscores the importance of efficiently and strategically using a country's financial capacity to drive economic growth and improve the well-being of its citizens. It involves a combination of government actions, private sector engagement, domestic savings, and international financial assistance, as well as innovative financing solutions. By mobilizing these resources effectively, countries can enhance their development prospects and create a more prosperous and sustainable future for their citizens."},{"question":"Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What system pairs the eight songs off against each other? Prior to the introduction of the current format of semifinals (deltävlingar) in 2002, the competition was usually a single live show. Under the current system, four semifinals are broadcast at 20:00 CET on consecutive Saturday nights. The semi-finals begin in early February, and seven songs compete in each show. Unlike in the final, no juries are used; televoting decides the results. The songs are performed live with telephone lines open for the first round of voting; two songs with the fewest votes do not qualify to the second round. The top five battle for a place in the final and Andra chansen round – the 1st and 2nd placed songs qualifying to the final, and the 3rd and 4th placed songs progressing to Andra chansen. Both finalists reprise their entries at the end of the broadcast. The organisation of a semi-final system for Melodifestivalen popularised televised heats at national Eurovision selections. A similar system was adopted by the Eurovision itself in 2004. The Second Chance round (Andra chansen) is the fifth heat in which the remaining four entries to the final are chosen. The third- and fourth-placed songs from each semi-final (eight songs in total) compete in the event. The first Second Chance round in 2002 had a panel of former winners decide the two finalists. Between 2003 and 2006, the semi-final performances were re-broadcast, and a round of voting narrowed the songs to three or four. Another round then determined the two finalists. The programme was broadcast on the Sunday afternoon after the fourth semi-final. It was held in a smaller venue than those that would have hosted the semi-finals—such as Berns Salonger in Stockholm, which hosted the Second Chance round in 2005. In 2007, the Second Chance round became a full semi-final, taking place in a venue comparable in size to those hosting the others. The expanded Second Chance takes place on a Saturday night, adding an extra week to the event's timetable. The format of voting also changed with the introduction of a knock-out system. The...

This place is a fast food restaurant.... I just don't understand why their prices don't reflect this. The BF and I went in here last night to get the summer sampler, and we were excited to try this new place for less money. Well what we paid was STILL too much for what we got. We ordered the caprese salad, a pizza with pepperoni and arugula, and two glasses of chardonnay. The caprese salad was not what was expected. Usually it's just basil, tomato, mozz, balsamic, and evoo. This was a salad (like lettuce) with hidden chunks of mozz and tomato in it, as well as some soggy pieces of bread. The mozz was the most flavorless mozz cheese I have had in a long time.... not so good. Otherwise, the salad was a plain old salad, but not what I wanted when I ordered it.... oh well. The pizza came out ridiculously fast. This leads me to believe that they are all sitting back there made and waiting to be shoved in the oven real quick and brought out. Our pizza had some spots that were covered in black burnt crust and some that seemed like they'd barely been in an oven (droopy, chewy, meh tasting). The pizza also lacked a lot of flavor, the sauce was almost non existent in taste, and it could have been a frozen pizza for how it tasted. The wine we got was also not pleasant.... although, chardonnay is not my usual wine, I have had it and this was particularly bad. The people who work there were very friendly, however, so that is a plus. I suppose if you want expensive fast food pizza....come here.

Given the context: What will Austin want to do before that? Possible answers: have a plan on how to injure them, figure out where to hurt their rival, enter the competition A:","response":"Before Austin carried out their threat against their rival and injured them, Austin would likely want to: 1. Have a plan on how to injure their rival: Austin would need a well-thought-out plan to carry out the action effectively and secretly. This plan could include details on how to approach their rival, the tools or techniques they would use to cause injury, and any contingency plans in case something goes wrong. 2. Figure out where to hurt their rival: After formulating a plan, Austin would need to decide which part of their rival's body to target to cause enough injury to prevent them from participating in the competition. Injuries to vital parts of the body, such as joints or areas that bear weight, might be more effective in ensuring their rival couldn't compete. Additionally, they might consider aiming for a pre-existing weakness or vulnerability to maximize the impact. 3. Enter the competition: In order to benefit from the act of injuring their rival, Austin would need to be a participant in the competition themselves. This would give them a clear motive for their actions and, once the rival is injured and unable to compete, a better chance of winning or reaching their desired goal in the competition."},{"question":"Dialogue: Tim: Hi John: How are things?

Movie title: Class Trip Movie plot: The story begins with Nicolas at ten years old and dreading the school ski trip. Nicolas was worried that he wouldn't fit in with the other boys. His overprotective father decides to take Nicolas by himself instead of going with the group. En route, Nicolas and his father pass the aftermath of an apparently fatal car accident. Seeing police ahead while the traffic had stopped, Nicolas' father becomes nervous and conceals all loose items within the car in the trunk â and we see that Nicolas' travel bag is next to several matching briefcases. Nicolas subsequently forgets his bag in his father's car, increasing his awkwardness. He is befriended by Hodkann, another pupil. One of Nicolas main fears is wetting his bed, and the situation gets worse when he gets a bed just above Hodkann. At night Nicolas tries to stay awake but falls asleep, waking up from a wet dream but believing he has wet his pants. He leaves his bed to clean his clothes and while returning he discovers it snowing outside. Nicolas goes outside into the freezing cold and ends up locked out, and in desperation curls up inside the car of his ski instructor, Patrick. Before he drifts off to sleep he sees a van driving away. He is found in the morning by Patrick and is taken in to a study with a fever. Later that day he goes to a cafÃ© while the other boys are skiing. While in the cafÃ©, police come looking for RenÃ©, a young boy who is missing. That night while sleeping he has a nightmare.

Once he is on the caterpillar he sees his brother being walked to a white van by the stranger. Later he is found outside the park after having one of his organs taken.

However, we can infer a few possibilities from the available information: 1. Nicolas' father might be involved in some illegal activity. This could be the reason for his nervousness when he sees the police, and his decision to hide all loose items in the trunk, where Nicolas' travel bag is placed next to several matching briefcases. 2. Nicolas' father is highly overprotective and controlling; this behavior might stem from his own insecurities or past experiences. His decision to take Nicolas by himself instead of going with the group, and the fact that he never allowed Nicolas to go on a similar ride before, suggests that he might be overly worried about his son's safety. 3.

Trump spokesman Raj Shah rejected any suggestion that Trump had engaged in wrongdoing because his personal attorney, Michael Cohen, paid the porn star 130,000 from his own funds in hush money shortly before the 2016 presidential election. \\"False charges are settled out of court all the time,\\" said Shah, who faced a barrage of questions from reporters after a lengthy Daniels interview aired Sunday night on 60 Minutes, a CBS News show that drew its biggest ratings in a decade for the spectacle. \\"He's consistently denied these accusations,\\" Shah said of Trump. The spokesman said the 39-year-old Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, was \\"inconsistent\\" because she has at various times denied she had a sexual encounter with Trump, but now claims she is telling the truth that she met up with him at a celebrity golf tournament in Nevada. Shah also dismissed Daniels' claim that in 2011, when she was on her way to a fitness class in Las Vegas with her infant daughter, she was approached by a stranger who threatened her. \\"A guy walked up on me and said to me, 'Leave Trump alone. Forget the story,' \\" Daniels told journalist Anderson Cooper. \\"And then he leaned around and looked at my daughter and said, 'That's a beautiful little girl. It'd be a shame if something happened to her mom.' And then he was gone.\\" Trump has yet to comment directly on Daniels' story. However, he posted a Twitter comment Monday that seemed to allude to the controversy.

Hypothesis: The little girl is sitting cross legged. .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","response":"Given the premise provided, we cannot directly conclude that the little girl is sitting cross-legged, as there is no explicit information given about her posture or position. To deduce a conclusion about her posture, we need to incorporate context clues, observations, and reasoning based on the information we have at hand. Firstly, let's analyze the available information: 1. A little girl seems pretty bored: This statement informs us about the girl's emotional state, but it doesn't provide direct information about her physical posture. 2. A male friend is having a lot of fun with the toy tea set: This statement informs us about the male friend's activity and emotional state; however, it doesn't give clear information about the girl's posture. To attempt to make a reasonable conclusion regarding the girl's posture (specifically, if she's sitting cross-legged or not), we have to consider typical behaviors and settings where children might play with a toy tea set. In many cases, children may sit on the floor (indoors or outdoors) to engage with such an activity. Sitting cross-legged is a common posture when sitting on the floor, particularly for young children who find it comfortable and easy. Although this analysis raises the possibility that she might be sitting cross-legged as it is a common posture in such a situation, it is still not a definitive conclusion. There are various other ways a little girl could be sitting or standing while feeling bored around her friend who is playing with a toy tea set. For instance, she could also be sitting with her legs stretched out or standing beside him with folded arms. In conclusion, given the premise, we cannot definitively conclude that the little girl is sitting cross-legged. However, based on context and typical behaviors, it is a plausible hypothesis, but more information would be needed to confirm her posture."},{"question":"Explain simply why it is not possible to tell is the correct answer to: Premise: \\"A woman competitor on a white horse jumping over a fence.\\" Hypothesis: \\"A jockey competing at an event.\\" Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?

Yes or no? Answer: It does not result in sequestration of the carbon dioxide but the gas is recycled as much as possible. Question: what is fuel oil used for A:","response":"Fuel oil, also known as residual oil or heavy oil, is a refined byproduct of crude oil that is primarily used for various industrial, commercial, and domestic purposes. It is a complex mixture of hydrocarbons and is typically darker and more viscous than other fuels. Fuel oil is classified into different grades, based on its properties and intended usage. Some of the primary uses of fuel oil are: 1. Heating: Fuel oil is an important source of energy for residential and commercial heating purposes. It is commonly used in boilers, furnaces, and water heaters to provide space heating and hot water. The fuel is stored in tanks and is fed to the heating appliances when needed. 2. Power generation: Fuel oil is used in power plants to produce electricity through combustion. It is a popular choice for power generation because it is relatively inexpensive, widely available, and efficient. The oil is typically burnt in a combustion chamber, where it heats water to produce steam. The steam then turns a turbine, which generates electricity. Moreover, in regions where natural gas is not easily accessible, fuel oil serves as an alternative fuel for power generation. 3. Industrial applications: Fuel oil is used in various industrial processes as a source of heat or as an ingredient in the production of various chemicals. In industries such as steel, cement, glass, and paper manufacturing, fuel oil is often utilized. It is employed in furnaces and smelters to maintain high temperatures and as a backup fuel for some industrial processes when other fuels are not available. 4. Marine transport: Heavy fuel oil is extensively used for ship propulsion in marine transport due to its low cost and high energy density. However, its usage has raised environmental concerns because of greenhouse gas emissions and the release of sulfur compounds. As a result, more stringent regulations have been imposed to limit the sulfur content in marine fuels. This has led to a gradual shift towards cleaner fuels such as low-sulfur fuel oil and alternative energy sources. 5. Road construction: Heavy fuel oil is frequently employed as a binding agent in the production of asphalt, which is used to pave roads and highways. The oil helps to bind the various components together, improving the strength and flexibility of the road surface. In conclusion, fuel oil is a versatile and widely-used energy source with a broad range of applications. While it plays a significant role in fulfilling the world's energy demands, its environmental impact and contribution to climate change have led to increased efforts to reduce its usage and transition to cleaner and more sustainable alternatives, such as renewable energy sources and low-emission fuels."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: For pet owners, the hundreds of pet food recalls taking place each year has raised a lot of alarm. \\"Most people are caring pet owners, and they want to do what helps protect their pet,\\" explains Will Post, founder and CEO, Hound & Gatos Pet Foods Corporation. \\"Yet the problem is that most are not sure what that means and how to go about it.

Audioslave was an American rock supergroup formed in Los Angeles in 2001. The four-piece band consisted of Soundgarden lead singer/rhythm guitarist Chris Cornell and Rage Against the Machine members Tom Morello (lead guitar), Tim Commerford (bass/backing vocals), and Brad Wilk (drums). Critics first described Audioslave as a combination of Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine, but by the band's second album, Out of Exile, it was noted that they had established a separate identity. Audioslave's sound was created by blending 1970s hard rock with 1990s alternative rock. Moreover, Morello incorporated his well-known, unconventional guitar solos into the mix. As with Rage Against the Machine, the band prided themselves on the fact that all sounds on their albums were produced using only guitar, bass, drums, and vocals. In its six years of existence, Audioslave released three albums, received three Grammy nominations, sold more than eight million records worldwide and became the first American rock band to perform an open-air concert in Cuba. Audioslave disbanded in February 2007 when Cornell issued a statement announcing that he was permanently leaving the band \\"due to irresolvable personality conflicts as well as musical differences.\\" The 2007 Rage Against the Machine reunion and tour involving the rest of the band, as well as solo albums released that same year by Morello and Cornell, cemented the supergroup's permanent demise.

Luke Garratt. A First World War bomb killed two construction site workers when it exploded 100 years after being fired at a Belgian battlefield. The bomb had laid dormant for a century at an industrial site in the former area of Flanders battlegrounds, killing two and injuring two more. Johan Lescrauwaert of the Ypres prosecutor's office confirmed that the armament from the 1914-1918 war exploded near the workers, but did not say whether it was a shell or a grenade. Emergency personnel remove evidence near a covered body after a World War One armament exploded in Ypres, Belgium. It was not confirmed whether the bomb was a grenade or a shell, but it has been confirmed that it killed two and injured two more. The circumstances were unclear because there was apparently no digging at the site - the usual cause of such accidents. Every year the battlefields in western Belgium throw up hundreds of armaments from the Great War, and most are destroyed without incident by a special Belgian army bomb squad. In a nearby city, the army was completing the destruction of over 800 gas canisters. More and more unexploded shells are discovered every year in the areas in and around the former Flanders field battleground. Evacuation works are the common cause of exploding the dormant shells, as the heavy machinery used in the process can jostle the delicate armaments back to life, although this case was peculiar because no digging took place. The Flanders battlefields cover dozens of cities where allies clashed with German forces for most of the war. Earlier this year, members of the bomb disposal unit managed to disarm an unexploded shell at a construction site in Ypres, Northwestern Belgium. Also earlier this month, a large amount of ammunition from the First World War was discovered on the border of the West Flemish municipalities of Passchendaele and Moorslede, for which the Belgian bomb squad is still working to clean up the site. Earlier this month members of the bomb disposal unit in Ypres, Belgium, were lucky as they managed to evacuate and disarm a WWI-era bomb before it exploded. The unexploded bomb from January 2014 was found during similar evacuation works to the ones that caused a bomb to explode this month. What are the important parts of this article?","response":"1.

The game can be played for free, but nearly all in-game activities require personal resources that you have available to use.Although there are various activities to keep you busy on Calypso, what most people do first is to find themselves a profession, such as hunting the fierce animals on Calypso, mining the precious minerals and making tools.Then they can think about buying their virtual house or paying a visit to a virtual nightclub or doing any of the other activities that make life bearable. Entropia has its very own economy and its own currency, the PED (Project Entropia Dollars).Players move real world money into PED which they then use to pay for their life on Calypso.However, the virtual things inside Entropia do have a real value in the outside world, and careful business deals mean that players can actually make real money there.PED can be changed into dollars any time at a rate of 10PED to 1US.

Bette Davis plays Mildred. This is a woman who men are drawn to. Not because she is a nice beautiful girl but because she is a sexual entity. Now the movie does not come out and say that but it is obvious. There is a scene in the movie in which men are all going googly eyes over her. She works as a waitress in a coffee shop, she can't read and she not really anybody to look at but she is a flirt. It is obvious the male customers in that coffee shop are there because of her. One day Phillip a club footed failed painter medical student comes in the shop to say a good word for his friend but he becomes besotted the moment he sees her. He starts buying her things even pays for her apartment. Meanwhile she is seeing other people and she makes no secrets of it. He dreams about her like she is a angel, but she is no angel. He is constantly thinking about her. His med school grades are even failing. So what the nookie is too good. He wants to marry her but she rejects him because she is marrying another guy. She always lets Phil know she really doesn't have love feelings for him all of time. He is heart broken but he meets another woman. They seem fine but it is obvious he is still dreaming of the Bimbo. Mildred does comes back with a baby and unwed. Phillip takes her in again, but she starts going out with a friend of his, the light bulb comes on a little and he kicks her out. She does what she knows works so she tries to seduce him, well it doesn't work and she proceeds to burn his tuition money up. Oh we have a club foot that he has problems about, even though a street teenager who has the same problem tells him to lighten up about it. He meets another girl named Sally we have a March of time montage which shows her aging while he strings her along still waiting for Mildred. Well he has no school tuition, can't find a job. Finally Sally and her dad takes him in. Not before another March of Time montage showing him going downhill. Soon his uncle who raised him dies and he gets money to become a doctor. Meanwhile he finds Mildred needs him again. She has TB. meanwhile he is still leading Sally down the Primrose path about marriage and he takes a job on a steamship. Finally the bimbo dies and Phillip declares he is free now and he will marry Sally. I wished she told him to stuff it. Now I know my take on the characters are not going to get me any points. But I feel Phillip was the bad guy. Yes Mildred is a Strumpet BUT he knows it, and he keeps coming back. Mean while he has two other girlfriends who love him but he treats as appetizers. I guess the sex wasn't as good. But in any case he dogs those women waiting for Mildred. Not only that but the man who gets Mildred pregnant is already married and when Philip asks him what he intends to do about Baby ( apparently the baby's name) he laughs is off, he has no intention in supporting her and Baby and he is wealthy. Sally's father who has 9 children say some pretty nasty things about women but he is said to be a old traditionalist. Philip doesn't seem to refute his feelings either. Men are using Mildred as a Boy Toy but the men in this movie come out as unscathed. Yes she was not a respectable woman but far from a villain. To me it is Philip who was had the real problem and it was his sexual obsession for Mildred.","response":"This story is about a movie where a woman named Mildred is not very nice or pretty, but she is very good at getting men to like her because she flirts a lot.

'' stanton rogers had replied tightly , \`\` back off ,","response":"Paul. This is none of your business. My personal life and career are separate entities, and I can handle them.\\" This situation showcases a significant issue faced by many individuals today: the challenges of balancing one's personal and professional life. Stanton Rogers and Barbara, despite their differing political views, had found love and built a life together. Their marriage was widely seen as ideal, especially by their loved ones like Paul Ellison, who believed them to be the perfect couple. However, these conflicting ideologies had begun to take a toll on their relationship, ultimately leading Stanton to consider a divorce. Despite Paul's harsh response and concern for Stanton's career, it is essential to recognize that no outsider can truly understand the intricacies of a relationship or the factors contributing to the decision to end a marriage. Divorce is never an easy decision, and it often involves a myriad of emotions and potential consequences, but it may be the best option in certain situations when the individuals involved are no longer able to be in a healthy, supportive partnership. Contrasting political views can also significantly impact a couple's ability to maintain a harmonious relationship, especially if political involvement and activism are a major part of their lives. For liberal Stanton and archconservative Barbara, their conflicting perspectives likely led to frequent clashes, potentially making it difficult for them to find common ground and maintain a balanced relationship. This situation also reflects the impact of ideological differences on personal relationships during the current era of political polarization, where finding common ground between opposing views can often be challenging. When considering the potential impact of divorce on Stanton's career, it is important to remember that personal and professional life should remain separate, though they can indeed influence one another. A person's career should not dictate their happiness and well-being in their personal life, and vice versa. However, societal expectations and norms related to marriage and success may make people hesitant to choose divorce for fear of harming their professional advancement. Regardless of the potential consequences, Stanton's decision should ultimately be based on the pursuit of happiness and fulfillment, both personally and professionally. The challenges faced by people in balancing their personal ideologies with their professional lives remind us of the importance of self-awareness and meaningful communication in relationships. While ideological differences may not lead to the end of a relationship in every case, they highlight the need for empathy, understanding, and compromise to make it work. In conclusion, Stanton Rogers and Barbara's dilemmas serve as a prime example of the challenges faced by modern couples when confronted with the complexities of balancing personal and professional lives, particularly in an increasingly polarized political climate. Ideological differences can add strain to a relationship, but these differences can be managed if couples are willing to communicate openly and genuinely. Determining the impact of personal decisions on one's career is a delicate balancing act, but personal happiness and well-being should always be the priority."},{"question":"Given the question: Information: - Sid Meier 's Civilization IV ( also known as Civilization 4 or Civ4 ) is a turn - based strategy computer game and the fourth installment of the Civilization series .

What might be the first step of the process? A:","response":"A: The first step of the process is bread absorbing water from the air. To provide a detailed explanation of the mold growth process on bread, let's break down each step: 1. Bread absorbs water from the air: The process begins with bread absorbing moisture present in the surrounding air. Bread contains water-soluble starches and sugars which makes it hygroscopic, meaning it can easily absorb water molecules from the air. The environment's relative humidity plays a significant role in this process. Higher humidity allows bread to absorb more moisture, consequently helping to create favorable conditions for mold growth. 2. Bread absorbs warmth from the air: Apart from moisture, warmth is another crucial factor that contributes to mold growth on bread. Most mold species thrive in temperatures ranging from 70°F to 90°F (approximately 21°C to 32°C). However, some species can grow at lower or higher temperatures. Bread can absorb warmth from the surrounding air, which in turn accelerates mold growth. 3. Dust particles with mold spores fall on bread: Mold spores are microscopic fungi particles that are present in the air. They can easily be transported by air currents or even a slight breeze, settling on various surfaces, including bread. Dust particles often carry these mold spores and can introduce them to the bread's surface. 4. Mold spores start to consume the bread for energy: Once the mold spores are in contact with the moist and warm bread, they can begin to grow and multiply. They release enzymes that break down the bread's carbohydrates, sugars, and proteins into simpler compounds, which the mold uses for energy and growth. This process causes the bread to become spoiled and inedible. 5. Mold colonies grow until they are visible: As the mold consumes nutrients from the bread and multiplies, it forms visible colonies on the bread's surface. These colonies can appear in different colors and textures, depending on the mold species. Some common mold colors include green, black, white, and blue. Preventing mold growth on bread involves limiting the factors that contribute to its development, such as reducing exposure to humidity and warmth, and keeping the bread in a clean and protected environment. Storing bread in airtight containers or refrigerating it can help maintain its freshness and delay the onset of mold growth."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: The provided files include famous book titles and sentences in the English language, and we ask you to translate those to the Finnish Language.

How much did he pay in total? Think carefully first, then make a decision:","response":"To calculate the total amount John paid, we can follow these steps: Step 1: Calculate the cost of the shirts before tax. John buys 3 dress shirts at 20 each, so the cost would be: 3 shirts * 20 per shirt = 60 Step 2: Calculate the tax amount. John has to pay a 10% tax on the cost of the shirts, so we need to find 10% of 60: 10% of 60 = (10/100) * 60 = 6 Step 3: Calculate the total amount John paid by adding the cost of the shirts and the tax amount. Total amount paid = Cost of shirts + Tax amount Total amount paid = 60 + 6 = 66 So, John paid a total of 66 for the 3 dress shirts including tax."},{"question":"Translate \\"How do you define local, regional, national and pan-European?\\" to Finnish?","response":"In order to translate the phrase \\"How do you define local, regional, national and pan-European?\\" to Finnish, I will follow these steps: 1.

(July 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) MI6 agent James Bond meets a Swiss banker in Bilbao, Spain to retrieve money for Sir Robert King, a British oil tycoon and friend of M. Bond tells the banker that King was buying a report stolen from an MI6 agent who was killed for it, and wants to know who killed him. The banker is killed by his assistant before he can reveal the assassin's name. Bond escapes with the money, but it is revealed to be booby-trapped, and Sir Robert is killed by an explosion inside MI6 headquarters back in London. Bond gives chase to the assistant/assassin on a boat on the Thames to the Millennium Dome, where she attempts to escape via hot air balloon. Bond offers her protection, but she refuses, then causes the balloon to explode, killing herself. Bond traces the recovered money to Viktor \\"Renard\\" Zokas, a KGB agent-turned-terrorist. Following an earlier attempt on his life by MI6, Renard was left with a bullet in his brain which is gradually destroying his senses, making him immune to pain. M assigns Bond to protect King's daughter, Elektra; Renard previously abducted and held her for ransom, and MI6 believes that he is targeting her a second time. Bond flies to Azerbaijan, where Elektra is overseeing the construction of an oil pipeline. During a tour of the pipeline's proposed route in the mountains, Bond and Elektra are attacked by a hit squad in armed, paraglider-equipped snowmobiles. Afterwards Bond visits Valentin Zukovsky at a casino to acquire information about Elektra's attackers; he discovers that Elektra's head of security, Davidov, is secretly in league with Renard.

Inside, Renard is removing the GPS locator... The answer is:","response":"Bond flies to Azerbaijan on his mission."},{"question":"Q:GoDaddy has pulled the plug on another online peddler of violence. The popular internet registration service last week shut down altright.com, a website created by white nationalist leader Richard Spencer and popular with many in the so-called alt-right movement.

Terra is a peaceful planet of alien creatures who have a rich semi-advanced culture. One day a large, mysterious object blocks the Terrian sun, piquing the Terrians' interest. However, since the Terrian culture bans the development of new technologies, such as telescopes, without the approval of the ruling council, none of the inhabitants are able to get a closer look at the huge object in their sky. Mala, who is inventive and headstrong, goes against the rules of her community and creates a telescope, which she takes out into the dark empty area outside the Terrian city and uses to view the object and witnesses smaller objects coming from the large object that turn out to be incoming scout spaceships. She returns to the city to find that the scout spaceships have already started abducting Terrians (who willingly offer themselves to the scout spaceships mistaking them as their new \\"gods\\"). After Mala's own father, Roven (Dennis Quaid) is abducted she goads a ship into tailing her and lures it into a trap, which causes it to crash. Afterward, she saves the life of the pilot, revealed to be a human, an officer named Lieutenant Jim Stanton (Luke Wilson). After his personal robot assistant named Giddy (David Cross) warns Mala that Stanton will die without a supply of oxygen (which the Terrian atmosphere does not contain), she creates an oxygen generator and fills a tent with air containing oxygen so that Jim can breathe, and eventually convinces Giddy to teach her human language. The Robot informs Mala that the mysterious object is a generation ship called The Ark, containing humans from Earth. Centuries beforehand, both Mars and Venus were terraformed by humans and colonized.

If Hector had 6 gumballs remaining, what is the total number of gumballs that Hector purchased? Your thoughts:","response":"Let's break down the problem step by step: 1. Hector gave 4 gumballs to Todd. 2. He then gave twice as many as he had given Todd to Alisha. Since he gave 4 to Todd, he gave 2 * 4 = 8 gumballs to Alisha. 3. He gave 5 less than four times as many to Bobby as he had given to Alisha. Four times as many as he gave to Alisha would be 4 * 8 = 32 gumballs. So, he gave 5 less than that amount to Bobby, which is 32 - 5 = 27 gumballs. 4. Hector had 6 gumballs remaining. Now we will sum up all the gumballs given away and the remaining gumballs to find out the total number of gumballs Hector purchased: Total gumballs = (gumballs given to Todd) + (gumballs given to Alisha) + (gumballs given to Bobby) + (remaining gumballs) Total gumballs = 4 + 8 + 27 + 6 By adding these values, we get: Total gumballs = 45 So, Hector purchased a total of 45 gumballs."},{"question":"Remove the spaces from the following sentence: 8 months ago 08:00 xHamster Swedish, doctor","response":"Step 1: Identify the spaces in the sentence The sentence is: \\"8 months ago 08:00 xHamster Swedish, doctor\\" Spaces are present between \\"8 months\\", \\"months ago\\", \\"ago 08:00\\", \\"08:00 xHamster\\", and \\"xHamster Swedish,\\".

In this article, we attempt to answer the question: Which year were divorce rates higher, 2004 or 1991? To provide a comprehensive and accurate answer, we will examine the available statistics, identify possible reasons for these trends, and discuss the broader implications. Step 1: Research and gather data To make a valid comparison between divorce rates in 1991 and 2004, we first need to gather reliable data from reputable sources such as national statistical agencies or credible research papers. Access to accurate figures is essential to perform an informed analysis. Step 2: Analysis of data Upon obtaining the necessary data, we proceed to analyze the reported divorce rates in both years. It is important to recognize that raw numbers alone may not present the whole picture; we must also consider factors such as population growth, marriage rates, and other demographic changes that could influence our comparison. By calculating the ratio of divorces to marriages or per capita divorce rates, we can obtain a clearer picture of how the likelihood of divorce has changed over time and determine which year faced higher divorce rates. Step 3: Identify possible reasons for the observed trends With the statistical analysis complete, the next step is to identify possible reasons for the observed trends in divorce rates between 1991 and 2004. Societal factors may include changes in attitudes towards divorce, legislative changes, shifts in religious beliefs, and varying levels of financial stress. By examining these causes, we can describe the social context that contributed to the differences in divorce rates during these years. Step 4: Discuss the broader implications of the findings The final step is to discuss the broader implications of our findings. Identifying the year with higher divorce rates is not merely a matter of historical fact; it can also provide insights into how societies adapt and evolve in response to changing circumstances. Further, understanding the factors that contribute to fluctuations in divorce rates can help policymakers and researchers design more effective strategies to address issues related to family stability, mental health, and overall wellbeing. Conclusion: In conclusion, to determine which year had a higher divorce rate, 2004 or 1991, we must conduct an in-depth analysis of the available data, taking into account several underlying factors that may affect these rates, and examine the broader implications of our findings. By doing so, we not only answer the specific question asked, but also provide valuable context to better understand the evolving nature of marriage and divorce in modern society."},{"question":"Drone at LAX Nearly Hits Lufthansa Passenger Jet A drone nearly hit a passenger jet preparing to land in Los Angeles on Friday afternoon.

She clearly doesn't like us and seems to think Thomas Jefferson was living in Monticello only 17 years ago. Liz Kelly: I have to admit that since I've lately been warming up to Gwyneth, I was disappointedwhen I saw Gwyneth's latest foot-in-mouth incident this morning. For anyone who missed it, Gwynnie basically repeated her \\"England is better than the U.S.\\" gaffe of a few years back, but this time subbed in Spain for England. Hmm. I wonder if Spain beats England in her hierarchy, too. I'm not trying to defend her, but I honestly don't think she means any harm. She's just not much good without a script in front of her. Cleveland: Did you ever choose Creative Captioning winners for the pic of Paris and the camel? I can never find the winners -- I usually check the original post, is that the wrong place? washingtonpost.com: Paris Hilton's New BFF? Liz Kelly: I did not. I am a menace to society and should probably be penalized in some way. I won't even bother blaming Farrah Fawcett and Michael Jackson for distracting me. In any case, I want to give the entries a good going over, so I'll announce the winning captions on Monday. Howzat? The lame future: Liz, what will you be doing next Tuesday morning at noon? Will you be staring at your computer with a wistful smile and a rueful sigh? I will. Liz Kelly: Oddly, this job has a way of filling any void created so I'm sure I'll be as busy as ever, but yeah, I'll probably get a bit misty at 11:50. Arlington, Va.: Liz, I would like to follow the chat today, but my head just exploded after reading your selection of celebrity tweets. washingtonpost.com: I want to know what Young MC thinks about Afghanistan. Liz Kelly: Wait -- did everyone see this recent Barbara Walters tweet? I didn't include it because Gene beat me to it and used it in his update today: If u see ads for products with Resveratrol showing my photo and name they are false. Also isn't it great twitter helped uprising in Iran9:48 AM Jun 16th Seattle: Liz, Has Michael Vartran had some work done? I keep seeing him on the promos for \\"Hawthorne\\" and can't even really recognize him... he used to be so handsome! washingtonpost.com: You be the judge. Vartan '09 on the left, Vartan '06 on the right. Liz Kelly: My god -- are you sure that isn't Christopher Walken on the left? Could it just be a receding hairline issue? Arlington, Va.: Liz, Is Producer Paul single? washingtonpost.com: I have asked my girlfriend, and she says no. Liz Kelly: There you have it. MY soul mate is : a guy who does laundry, makes funny sounds to make the baby laugh, and buys me flowers. He doesn't have to look good in a tux or even nude. Liz Kelly: Yes, yes -- but what kind of animal does he most remind you of? Liz Kelly: Just did a quick search. Could hockey injuries be to blame for Vartan's changing mug? Gwyneth: Regarding her Spanish host family: \\"Her success as an actress, she says, hasn't impressed them.\\" Bradley Cooper: Dating choices starting to look a tad suspicious--attractive women a few years older who perchance recently appeared in a film with him and are likely to garner papparazzi notice. I next look for him to dine with that fetching tiger he seemed so fond of in \\"The Hangover.\\" Liz Kelly: You make an excellent point. Who is this man's publicist, I wonder. Here's the thing -- I really want to like Bradley Cooper. He's smart. He's funny. He's hawt. Is it wrong that I want him to surprise us all by romancing Sarah Silverman and foregoing the usual Hollywood merry-go-round? Alexandria, Va.: I am boycotting \\"Today.\\" They led this AM with another 20 minutes of Jackson crap. I mean, really, wasn't there anything more important, like a soldier in enemy hands in Afghanistan or a major offensive there? Liz Kelly: They led with Jackson? That does seem a tad too much at this point. I could understand that maybe Tuesday when the memorial service is expected to draw (possibly) a crowd of 1 million mourners/gawkers to L.A., but today makes no sense. It isn't as if it's a slow news day otherwise. Did that Ann Curry have something to do with it? Don't Stop Til You Get Enough!: I for one, can't understand my OWN fascination with all things MJ. I'll be 50 this year so I grew up listening to all his music. Loved his dancing but like a friend with nothing in common anymore, completely lost touch with him except for his lawsuits in the 90s. Now, I just feel sad and stay up to watch \\"Nightline\\" if they are going to have any new info on him. I actually watched Larry King for g-d's sake! LARRY KING!! Watched my dvd of \\"The Simpsons\\" with MJ voicing a fat mental patient and singing Lisa It's Your Birthday and had tears in my eyes. Why is this happening to me?? Liz Kelly: This probably won't help, then. I think the combination of Jacko's former dominance of the pop charts and his later descent into an utterly bizarre lifestyle -- not to mention the plastic surgery and child molestation charges -- have all combined to make this gripping viewing. Oh, and of course the fact that he died from what we assume to be unnatural causes. A comparison has been made between Jacko's death and Princess Diana's, but I think we need to add a smattering of Anna Nicole Smith into that equation to get at the truth. We loved him, we hated him, we were fascinated by him. So we watch. I am a menace to society and should probably be penalized in some way.: Lizard Island General District Court hereby sentences you, Liz Kelly, to create an annotated bibliography of Marc Fisher's blogs. Liz Kelly: So breaking rocks in the hot sun isn't an option, then? Paltrow?: Are people really upset about this? I don't get the impression she thinks every building in the US is 17 years old. Rather, I get the impression that she was using hyperbole to make a point. Are American's really so self-centered that they can't accept the fact that someone may prefer ANOTHER country to their own? And I got what Gwyneth was saying with that statement. Whenever I go to Europe I am struck by the awesomeness of being able to walk where Michelangelo walked or get a beer in a pub that has been in continuous business since the Middle Ages. It's just a different feeling from the United States where most of our antiquities don't predate the 18th century. Sadly, many of the ancient civilizations of the Americas -- and they were copious and built really cool and efficient cities and settlements -- were constructed of materials that didn't stand the test of time. Things like wood, so we have to read about them rather than actually walk through them. Maybe Gwyneth should hire me to think these things through for her. Hoya Saxa: According to the bio on IMDB, Bradley Cooper rowed crew at Georgetown. (So he's by definition hawt; and arguably yes, he's smart.) Isn't he therefore constitutionally incapable of declining to \\"ride the Hollywood merry-go-round\\" if it's offered to him? Or any other merry-go-round, for that matter? Liz Kelly: Okay, that makes me feel old because I rushed to Wikipedia to find out when he graduated from Georgetown -- 1997. Which means he was out on the river exactly 10 years after me (I rowed Crew in high school). I was hoping that perhaps our eights had passed each other under the Key Bridge. Marc Fisher reference: I don't get the Marc Fisher reference, but I would break rocks in the hot sun all day every day if I could be there with Sawyer! Liz Kelly: Which reminds me -- I hope the \\"Lost\\" watchers out there plan to stick around for the 3 p.m. \\"Lost\\" Hour chat. Omaha, Neb.: I asked Ruth Marcus if she could remember any previous lyin' cheatin' politicians who have gushed sooo much about the new love in their life whilst not yet divorced from the previous love of their life. She couldn't come up with any, but surely the ranks of celebrities has more to offer. Liz, can you think of any celebs who haven't just dumped/stepped out on their SO, but really went off the bleeding rails while doing so? Liz Kelly: Well, Mel Gibson isn't gushing, per se -- but he seems to have dispatched with any pretense of allowing a reasonable amount of time to go by after his wife's divorce filing before taking his relationship with that Eastern European model/\\"singer\\" public. And their expected baby is kind of a slap in the face. Oh, and of course the Jon and Kate stepping out rumors if they're indeed to be believed. Bethesda, Md.: Amy and Roxanne opined as to why Kate Gosselin was eating lunch in Rockville yesterday. (Raising hand) - a coincidence that Thai Pavilion is a few blocks from Kate's favorite bodyguard, Steve Neild's office? I think not. He's been MIA ever since they returned from N.C. in May. Liz Kelly: Or maybe because the Discovery Channel -- of which TLC is a subsidiary brand -- is based in Silver Spring? Bradley Cooper rowed crew at Georgetown. (So he's by definition hawt; and arguably yes, he's smart.): He also spends time teaching acting workshops to inner-city kids, so he's also has a good heart. Hawt, smart and nice. Liz Kelly: And he is also a good sport. Not sick of Jacko yet...b, UT: I am sick of MJ and women: Should we find it odd that many of Michael Jackson's songs were about love and women, yet he seemed to have so few love interests during his life? I mean, I guess he and Brooke Shields sorta \\"dated\\", but the marriage to Lisa Marie Presley seemed like a farce from the get go, and who knows what he had going with Debbie Rowe, other than he wanted her to bear children. I bring this up because most songwriters write about their own experiences, but there seems to be a disconnect on this regarding MJ. washingtonpost.com: Well, it does validate that Billie Jean was not his lover. Liz Kelly: Indeed. And Billy Jean was based on a real experience, supposedly (from Wikipedia): The song's lyrics refer to a real-life experience, in which a mentally ill female fan claimed that Jackson fathered one of her twins. Generally, though, I think artists -- especially pop artists -- write to the market. I mean, look at the very adult songs tween artists like Miley Cyrus belt out. Gibson: Maybe not gushing, but wasn't there a story that he helped \\"compose\\" the songs his paramour was crooning on her new CD? (hard to imagine him composing something that didn't involve gunfire or bombs going off--maybe she sings the \\"1812 Overture\\"?) Liz Kelly: Yep, according to People he did in fact help her to write this song. Maybe Gwyneth should hire me to think these things through for her.: You should, because when I was first reading this post I thought you were quoting her and I was thinking, hey Gwynnie is actually saying this quite coherently, what is wrong with that statement? Liz Kelly: See -- I hope someone in the Paltrow camp is reading this. the unflattering picture of Debbie Rowe that everyone uses : hey, if you can find a flattering one, let us know. Liz Kelly: I'm just putting this out there. Just in case someone has one handy. Jon and Kate: See, the person talking about the location of the bodyguard's office in Silver Spring or wherever is part of the problem. Why do you care? Why do you even know where this person works? I love celebrity gossip as much as the next person, but these people are not celebrities and this kind of stuff seems absolutely ridiculous to focus on. Find something important to post to every chat and comment board. Liz Kelly: Yeah, there's that, too. I broke up with NBC this morning: I also couldn't believe \\"Today\\" led with Jacko given that it was decidedly NOT a slow news day. Not to get all Paltrow here, but I'm glad I upgraded my cable and now have BBC America to give me actual news in the morning (you know, non-celebrity stuff like North Korea missiles). Liz Kelly: My mother watches CNN, Fox, French News, BBC and now the Al Jazeera English news broadcast every day. I'm proud of mom. The lame future: Liz, what will you be doing next Tuesday morning at noon? : OK, I'll be the idiot. What happens on Tuesday at noon? Liz Kelly: Well, until yesterday, Gene Weingarten's weekly chat. Washington, DC: So, actors from two of my favorite TV shows have, in the last 2 weeks, eaten at the pizza place two blocks from where I live (Comet Ping-Pong, and the shows are \\"30 Rock\\" and \\"Lost\\"). When will someone from \\"Mad Men\\" be dining there? Preferably John Hamm? washingtonpost.com: Would you play Ping-Pong with this man? Liz Kelly: Paul, now you're just trying to bait us. Kal Penn?: Looking at the salaries of highly paid White House aides reminded me, did Kal Penn ever take up employment here? Liz Kelly: As far as I know he hasn't surfaced yet, but Amy and Roxanne would probably have the latest intel. Washington, D.C.: You know you are going to do it eventually, Liz. Just go ahead and post the required photos of your lovely four-legged beasties now. Liz Kelly: I haven't got a good new pic of Page, so I won't just send out any old thing -- but here's one I took of Andy and Opie this morning. Alexandria, Va.: Saw the Billy Mays tribute last night. Leave it to Billy to add to the troika of death of McMahon, Fawcett, and Jackson a FOURTH DEATH ABSOLUTELY FREE!!! Liz Kelly: Well, and then we have Karl Malden and, today, word that we lost the indomitable Mrs. Slocombe. Arlington, Va.: \\"The Other\\" Jonas brother is getting engaged? I thought he was the gay one. Liz Kelly: Either you thought wrong or he's going to great lengths to throw us all a curve ball. Washington, DC: If Kate were visiting the Discovery building, she should have had lunch up the block at Lebanese Taverna then go shoe shopping at DSW. Trekking all the way to Rockville is too much. Liz Kelly: Maybe she really likes Thai. But she really should try Leb Tav. One of my faves. Lucky for Mr. Liz and I we live about a half a mile away from the Lebanese Taverna Market. So we can get our falafel fix any time. washingtonpost.com: Gushing: Eric Clapton writing \\"Layla\\" about George Harrison's wife? Liz Kelly: Ooh -- good one. Arlington, Va.: I submit that lighting and makeup are playing a role in that Vartan before-and-after. washingtonpost.com: True. '09 is at an event and '06 is a publicity shot. (I was in a rush, sue me...) Liz Kelly: I may sue you, Paul. Watch yourself. celebs who haven't just dumped/stepped out on their SO, but really went off the bleeding rails while doing so?: Eddie Fisher when he dumped Debbie Reynolds for Liz Taylor? Then a few years later Liz Taylor when she dumped Eddie Fisher for Richard Burton? Liz Kelly: Yeah -- Carrie Fisher still hasn't gotten over that one. Darboy (Wisc.) Chickenfest: Hi Liz- Last week, the missus and I went to the Darboy Chickenfest. The fact that Brooke Hogan was the headliner was too much irony to pass up. Darboy, btw, is a former farm town that's been gobbled up by suburban developments. It's like 40 minutes south of Green Bay. We expected Brooke to at least try (with the help of her AutoTune). Um. No. She lip synched to an Invisible Orchestra while strutting around in her sequin number. Something was wrong with the first track and she got discombobulated. Everyone was just there for the beer- anyway and didn't seem to notice. She lip-synched three more identical songs and scrammed, Diva-style, to her elegant white limo. Beer was 7 a PITCHER! Liz Kelly: Oh man, I wish I could see video of this. Atlanta, GA: I would play ping pong, beer pong, Pong, read the book \\"Ping: the story about a Duck\\" while feeding him dim sum, if it was Jon Hamm. Sign me up! Liz Kelly: I know ping and pong are perfectly legit words, but something about the idea of \\"playing ping pong with Jon Hamm\\" just sounds dirty. Not Missing MJ: Showing my age, but I'm still torn up about Farrah. Not to get all Mark Sanford TMI-ish, but that poster helped get me through puberty. Liz Kelly: Thanks for sharing. And that's not Sanford-ish at all. Unless you happen to have been president of your student council and disappeared to \\"go hiking\\" with your poster. Pete Wentz: is so wrong about Val Kilmer in the Doors. He has definitely been stoned before. A lot. (And also, does a pretty dead-on Jim Morrison, so not lame.) Did he miss Val as the pot-selling Sherpa on \\"Entourage\\"? That may be my favorite episode of that show. Liz Kelly: I know. Wentz is such a tool. If he knew anything he'd know that Kilmer took his portrayal of the Lizard King to an extreme and even creeped out co-star Meg Ryan (who so should not have been cast as Pamela Courson) because of his insistence on staying in character even when the cameras weren't rolling. Jonas brothers: So which one is supposed to be the \\"cute one.\\" I keep hearing people talking about the cute one, but naming him. I've seen photos of them and can't tell. Liz Kelly: I don't know what the conventional wisdom is, but if you ask me Joe Jonas is the only cute one. The other two look like cheap Adrian Zmed knock-offs. On that note, I'm out of here.

The band currently consists of Luke Pritchard (vocals/rhythm guitar), Hugh Harris (lead guitar/synth), Alexis Nunez (drums), and Peter Denton (bass guitar). The original bassist was Max Rafferty, and the founding drummer was Paul Garred. The lineup of the band remained constant until the departure of Rafferty in 2008. The Kooks have mentioned drawing on a number of varied sources to create their sound, listing the Rolling Stones, the Beatles, Bob Dylan and Chris de Burgh among influences on songwriting style and musical presentation over the course of their four albums. The band's debut album Inside In/Inside Out was touted as a typical Britpop record, and was influenced by the Libertines, Thin Lizzy, the Police and containing elements of the 60s British pop movement. Pritchard's lyrical style was compared to that of a \\"younger, less pathetic version of Pete Doherty's mush-mouth style\\". The band themselves felt the album was not consistent in its direction. \\"The first record was definitely genre-hopping. [...] The first album was finding its feet, it was gadabout\\", said Harris in an interview for The Sunday Business Post. On the follow-up Konk, the band attempted to find a more mature and polished sound. Drawing on a much wider choice of material for the album (about 80 to 90 new songs had been accumulated within the band's repertoire by this stage), the band began to incorporate more a hard-edged rock focus into their music. Critics drew comparisons to the work of The Kinks throughout the album, it being recorded at the studio owned by Ray Davies. Also noted were the band's growing similarities in musical direction to The Fratellis and the Arctic Monkeys. \\"I think we've made a dynamic album\\", Pritchard said. \\"Every song has its own character. It's a good pop album.\\" The most recent album, Listen, includes much more percussion and cross rhythms than previous material. Pritchard described the band's most recent album Listen as \\"percussion sonnets\\". \\"The first couple albums I made I never really thought about rhythms, I focused on the recording and the lyrics\\", Pritchard said. Did Thin Lizzy say anything about the Kooks influence on their music?","response":"As an AI, I cannot directly ask or interact with individuals. However, based on available information, there are no public statements directly from Thin Lizzy about The Kooks' influence on their music. It is important to note that Thin Lizzy was formed in 1969 and disbanded in 1983, while The Kooks formed in 2004, long after Thin Lizzy's active years. In the text you provided, it is mentioned that The Kooks' debut album \\"Inside In/Inside Out\\" was influenced by several bands and artists, including Thin Lizzy. This means that Thin Lizzy's music had an impact on The Kooks rather than the other way around."},{"question":"Choose from options: Determine if the sentence is true based on the text below: Brazilians love having good ethics.

Silver Proofs tend to be the standard designs but with the dime, quarter, and half dollar containing 90% silver.

Another type of proof set is the Presidential Dollar Proof Set where four special 1 coins are minted each year featuring a president.

In his first leading role Ben Mendelsohn plays Danny Clark, a bumbling eighteen-year-old guy. He knows what it takes to be cool and have some style, it is just that he seems to struggle to get there. Danny has enthusiasm and passion and only wants two things more than anything in the world. A Jaguar XJ6 and a date with the gorgeous Joanna Johnson (an early role for then 17-year-old Claudia Karvan). Get these and his life will be complete. Unfortunately for Danny, when he finally gets the courage up to ask Joanna out, he somehow manages to promise her a ride in his new Jaguar. She is not particularly impressed by cars, but still agrees to his invitation. The problem is, Danny does not own a Jaguar. His form of transport is his recently received birthday present - and it most certainly is not a Jaguar. His eccentric parents have decided to pass on their pride and joy to Danny for his use. Their 1963 Nissan Cedric has been in the family for years and is immaculate but extremely uncool. Danny is aghast at the thought of driving around in a car as dorky as a Cedric and, with the promise of a date with Joanna and the need for a Jaguar in a hurry, decides to trade in the old Nissan.

The idea of combining motion pictures with recorded sound is nearly as old as film itself, but because of the technical challenges involved, synchronized dialogue was only made practical in the late 1920s with the perfection of the Audion amplifier tube and the introduction of the Vitaphone system. During silent films, a pianist, theatre organist, or, in large cities, even a small orchestra would often play music to accompany the films. Pianists and organists would either play from sheet music or improvise; an orchestra would play from sheet music. - A screenplay writer, screenwriter for short, scriptwriter or scenarist is a writer who practices the craft of screenwriting, writing screenplays on which mass media such as films, television programs, comics or video games are based. - California is the most populous state in the United States and the third most extensive by area.

At age 12, his parents separated, and he remained with his mother. Vladimir Bure, a Russian swimming legend, had dreams of Pavel becoming a professional swimmer, but he aspired to play hockey at an early age. He attended his first tryout with the CSKA Moscow hockey school at the age of six, despite his limited skating ability. At age 16, Bure began his professional hockey career playing for CSKA Moscow. He was invited to the senior club's training camp for the 1987-88 season. Although he was deemed too young, and not yet ready, for the Soviet League, Bure earned minimal playing time filling in for absent regulars. He made his debut in September 1987, and played five games for the senior team, scoring his only goal in his first game. Bure joined the club full-time in 1988-89 and amassed 17 goals, a Soviet League record for rookies. The record would last for 18 years until Alexei Cherepanov scored 18 goals in 2006-07. Bure added 9 assists for 26 points to earn the league's rookie of the year honours. His individual success helped CSKA Moscow capture their thirteenth consecutive Soviet championship and twelfth consecutive IIHF European Cup in 1989 (they repeated as European champions the following year). As a member CSKA, Bure joined a lineup that featured several future NHL players, including linemates Sergei Fedorov and Alexander Mogilny, as well as Igor Larionov, Viacheslav Fetisov, Sergei Makarov, and Vladimir Konstantinov. The combination of Bure, Fedorov and Mogilny formed a promising combination for head coach Viktor Tikhonov, with expectations to replace the previous top Soviet line, the K-L-M combination of Vladimir Krutov, Larionov and Makarov. The trio was short-lived, as Mogilny defected to play for the Buffalo Sabres in 1989, and Fedorov joined the Detroit Red Wings the following year. In his third and final season with the Red Army, Bure tied for the lead in team-scoring with Valeri Kamensky, tallying 46 points. His 35 goals was second in the league, one goal behind Ramil Yuldashev of Sokil Kyiv. Bure turned down a three-year contract extension in August 1991, which resulted in him being left off the roster of the Soviet team for the Canada Cup. Was it the Rangers?","response":"No, it was not the Rangers. Pavel Bure played for the CSKA Moscow hockey team when he started his professional hockey career at age 16.

Article: If you travel to a new exhibition at the San Francisco Conservatory of Flowers, you will have chances to see some meat-eating plants. Take bladderworts, a kind of such plant, for example. They appear so small and grow in a quiet pond. \\"But these are the fastest known killers of the plant kingdom, able to capture a small insect in 1/50 of a second using a trap door!\\" Once the trap door closes on the victim, the enzymes similar to those in the human stomach slowly digest the insert. When dinner is over, the plant opens the trap door and is ready to trap again. Meat-eating plants grow mostly in wet areas with soil that doesn't offer much food nutrition. In such conditions, these amazing plants have developed insect traps to get their nutritional needs over thousands of years. North America has more such plants than any other continents. Generally speaking, the traps may have attractive appearance to fool the eye, like pitcher plants, which get their name because they look like beautiful pitchers full of nectar . Hair-like growths along the pitcher walls ensure that nothing can escape, and the digestive enzymes can get to work. A tiny insect can be digested in a few hours, but a fly takes a couple of days. Some of these pitchers are large enough to hold 7.5 liters. Meat-eating plants only eat people in science fiction movies, but sometimes a bird or other small animals will discover that a pitcher plant isn't a good place to get a drink.

The suspension was Youssef's second in less than a year. In September, his previous employers, CBC, terminated an earlier incarnation of the show after he lightly criticised supporters of Egypt's government – and on Monday Youssef said he and his team lacked the stamina to move to a third channel. The announcement marks a sharp reversal in fortunes for a man who was once the poster-boy for Egypt's post-revolutionary gains. Following the fall of Hosni Mubarak, he took advantage of the freer political climate to post homemade satire shows on YouTube. He came from obscurity to first earn millions of YouTube hits, and then later his own slick TV show – the first of its kind to feature a live audience in Egypt. He became known outside the country as Egypt's Jon Stewart, after the American comedian whom Youssef aimed to emulate. But he first ran into trouble during the tenure of the now-ousted Mohamed Morsi, whose prosecutor-general investigated him for insulting the president. Matters turned worse after Sisi ousted Morsi last July, and the country was swept by a wave of nationalism that left little space for government critics – including, as of Monday, Youssef himself. At his farewell speech, Youssef did not specify exactly who had pressured his employers to end his show. But in a recent interview with the Guardian's Sunday sister paper, Youssef made it clear that Egypt's military-backed government had created an environment in which censorship was possible. \\"You can always implement some sort of a mood, without actually giving direct orders,\\" Youssef said at the time. \\"It is about creating a certain atmosphere that would make this acceptable or doable, and I think it reflects badly on everybody. Even if the people in authority do not do it, it reflects badly on the freedom of speech in Egypt.\\" ||||| Image copyright AP Image caption The satirist posed with his writers and producers as he announced the show would end after almost three years One of Egypt's most popular TV satire shows has come to an end, its creator Bassem Youssef has announced. The satirist said he was \\"tired of struggling\\" and worried about the safety of his family. His \\"al-Bernameg\\" (The Programme) show came under pressure after poking fun at Egypt's military establishment. The show has been sued dozens of times since it began in the wake of ex-President Hosni Mubarak's downfall in 2011. Mr Youssef, a former heart surgeon, told a news conference on Monday that the channel that carried the show had been pressured to drop it. \`The present climate in Egypt is not suitable for a political satire programme,\\" he added. He denied that he was capitulating to pressure, saying: \\"Stopping the programme sends a much stronger message than if it continued.\\" Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The show is inspired by US satirist Jon Stewart, who appeared on the programme last year At its height, the show was watched by an estimated 8 million viewers inside Egypt and many millions more abroad. Household name The show began as a series of amateur YouTube clips filmed in Mr Youssef's Cairo flat in the days following Egypt's 2011 revolution. Inspired by Jon Stewart's Daily Show, Bassem Youssef went on to develop al-Bernameg, a satirical show filmed in front of a studio audience. Its success made him a household name throughout the Arab world and he was named as one of the world's top 100 most influential people by Time Magazine in 2013. However, the show's sharp satire repeatedly angered the authorities, who tried to close it down. Under the presidency of Muslim Brotherhood president Mohamed Morsi, Mr Youssef faced charges of insulting Islam. The charges were later thrown out of court, shortly after which Mr Morsi was too thrown out of office by Egypt's military. In November the private Egyptian CBC channel refused to broadcast one episode because it had \\"violated editorial policy\\". Image copyright AP Image caption A heart surgeon by training, Mr Youssef became one of Egypt's best known and controversial satirists The decision came days after Mr Youssef had lampooned the then head of the army, General Abdul-Fattah al-Sisi, over chocolates that bore his name. In February, prosecutors filed fresh complaints, accusing Mr Youssef of insulting the armed forces, the will of the Egyptian people and the \\"symbols\\" of Egypt. The show had been on temporary hiatus during Egypt's presidential election, which Mr Sisi won by an overwhelming margin. Before its cancellation, the show had been due to return later this week. ||||| Egyptian satirist Bassem Youssef speaks at the Committee to Protect Journalists' International Freedom Awards after accepting an award in New York City, on November 26, 2013. Egyptian satirist Bassem Youssef speaks at the Committee to Protect Journalists'... Read More Egyptian satirist Bassem Youssef speaks at the Committee to Protect Journalists' International Freedom Awards after accepting an award in New York City, on November 26, 2013. Close Egyptian satirist Bassem Youssef said his popular political satire show won’t return to Egyptian television screens, amid a crackdown on media as former army chief Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi prepares to take over the presidency. Youssef, known as Egypt’s Jon Stewart, said at a Cairo press conference that the Saudi-owned channel MBC, which has been broadcasting his show, has come under pressure to take it off the air. Youssef said the program won’t be shown on another channel because of “the atmosphere surrounding the media,” the state-run Ahram Gate website reported. El-Sisi, who won a landslide victory in last week’s presidential election, has presided over restrictions on media since he led the overthrow of Islamist President Mohamed Mursi in July last year. Journalists from the Qatar-based news channel Al-Jazeera are being prosecuted on terrorism-related charges. Human Rights Watch said in February, when the Jazeera trial began, that it showed “how fast the space for dissent in Egypt is evaporating.” Mursi and his Muslim Brotherhood were among the favorite targets for Youssef’s satire. After an interlude, he returned to the airwaves in October and poked fun at the army-worship that gripped the country after El-Sisi led the military takeover. His then-broadcaster CBC suspended the show for attacking “symbols of the state.” MBC picked up the program in February. Youssef said his team has taped a final episode of the show, Al Bernameg, without expecting that it will ever reach the country’s screens because it “won’t be allowed to continue on any channel inside Egypt.”.

Article: Over the last 30 years, Bangkok, once a small fishing village, has transformed into a rich, concrete, high-rise city that it is today. The spreading metropolis and its population of 12 million now produces 35 per cent of Thailand's economic wealth. As a magnet for foreign companies, Bangkok attracts many overseas managers and business people from different fields, including tourism, automobiles and electronics. The city's population of foreigners is in the high hundreds of thousands, with tens of thousands of Japanese, Chinese and western employees working alongside hundreds of thousands of Burmese who mostly do unskilled jobs shunned by Thais. For those used to the good life, the variety and quality of the city's food is a key attraction, says one US manager, before listing many of his favourite Italian, Mexican and, of course, Thai restaurants. Most offer quality meals for less than the cost of a takeaway sandwich in London. Great choice and value can be found in Bangkok's other attractions, too. For overseas business people who enjoy shopping in luxury and air-conditioned comfort, the city has hundreds of modern shopping malls. Some foreigners, however, prefer the charms of Chatuchak Market, where anything can be bought at a good price by the skilled bargainer. When the time comes to talk business many overseas business people prefer to move out of the markets and onto the golf course. Thailand has thousands of courses, which can provide a welcome break from the busy and noisy city life. But most business people go to the golf course because it's the perfect place to discuss the next big deal. Because of the fast-paced life some foreign business people see Bangkok as a place to stay for the short term, rather than a lifetime.

They used tools, such as fishing nets. But their art was extremely good. The main cave at Lascaux is called the Great Hall of Bulls, which has a picture of bulls and horses in many colors. The largest animal is 18 feet long. There are smaller animals, such as bison, stags and a bear. There is also a strange spotted two-horned animal. To the left of the main cave are the most famous paintings that are the drawings of multicolored animals. One painting is called Little Horses. On the ceiling are horses and cows. The most unusual sight may be in the Shaft of the Dead Man where there is a thinoceros , a carefully drawn dead man, a wounded bison and a bird. Why did Cro-Magnon artists do these beautiful drawings on cave walls? Did the drawings call upon some magical power? Did the Cro-Magnon people hope that the drawings would bring good luck? There is one thing the paintings seem to tell us. The Cro- Magnons were interested in the world. They looked at beauty and they understood it. Question: Most of the drawings in the caves are about _ . Options: A: boys B: tools C: dead men D: animals Answer:","response":"D: animals"},{"question":"Continue writing the following text. The paint was peeling off the schoolhouse, but not the gymnasium because the OPT: [i] schoolhouse is in indirect sunlight.. [ii] gymnasium is in indirect sunlight..","response":"The paint was peeling off the schoolhouse, but not the gymnasium because the gymnasium is in indirect sunlight. Step 1: Understand the context of the text. Step 2: Determine the most appropriate option (i or ii) based on the given information. Step 3: Verify the correctness of the chosen option for maintaining the flow and continuity of the text. Step 4: Continue the text while keeping the focus on the chosen option. The indirect sunlight helped protect the gymnasium's paint from the harsh effects of direct exposure to UV rays, which can cause fading, chalking, and eventually peeling. This was an essential asset for the preservation of the gymnasium's appearance and structural integrity. Step 5: Add relevant information to further elaborate on the chosen option. Step 6: Ensure that the new information is consistent with the existing text and adds value to the story. On the other hand, the schoolhouse, located on the opposite side of the campus, faced the brunt of direct sunlight. This prolonged exposure led to the deterioration of its once vibrant colors and caused cracks in the exposed wood. Step 7: Continue describing the condition of the schoolhouse to clarify the contrast between the two buildings. Step 8: Illustrate the effect of sunlight on the paint and structure. Unfortunately, the budget for maintenance had been limited, and repainting the schoolhouse was not a top priority. As a result, students, teachers, and visitors were often struck by the striking difference between the well-maintained gymnasium and the aging schoolhouse. Step 9: Introduce a possible reason for the situation. Step 10: Describe the reaction of people interacting with the buildings. In an effort to raise funds for the schoolhouse's much-needed renovation, the community came together to organize a series of fundraising events. These events were held in the gymnasium, showcasing its pristine condition and highlighting the urgency of restoring the schoolhouse. Step 11: Describe a possible resolution to the problem. Step 12: Explain how the fundraising events use the gymnasium's condition to emphasize the need for renovation. With every dollar raised and every volunteer's hard work, the hope for a brighter future for the schoolhouse grew. Eventually, it would receive a fresh coat of paint, sealing its cracks and preserving its history, as a testament to the power of community and the importance of maintaining educational environments."},{"question":"Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context (see options)?

The Muslims were no longer given their rights provided by the Treaty of Granada, and were given the choice of: remain and accept baptism, reject baptism and be enslaved or killed, or be exiled. Given the expensive fee exacted for passage out of Spain, conversion was the only realistic option for them. Therefore, only a decade after the fall of the Emirate of Granada, the entire Muslim population of Granada had nominally become Christian. A proclamation in 1502 extended these forced conversions to the rest of the lands of Castile, even though those outside Granada had nothing to do with the rebellion. The newly converted Muslims were known as nuevos cristianos or moriscos . Although they converted to Christianity, they maintained their existing customs, including their language, distinct names, food, dress and even some ceremonies. Many secretly practiced Islam, even as they publicly professed and practiced Christianity. In return, the Catholic rulers adopted increasingly intolerant and harsh policies in order to eradicate these characteristics. This culminated in Philip II's Pragmatica of 1 January 1567 which ordered the Moriscos to abandon their customs, clothing and language. The pragmatica triggered the Morisco revolts in 1568-1571.

A metro area usually comprises multiple jurisdictions and municipalities: neighborhoods, townships, boroughs, cities, towns, exurbs, suburbs, counties, districts, states, and even nations like the eurodistricts. As social, economic and political institutions have changed, metropolitan areas have become key economic and political regions. Metropolitan areas include one or more urban areas, as well as satellite cities, towns and intervening rural areas that are socio-economically tied to the urban core, typically measured by commuting patterns. - Monochrome describes paintings, drawings, design, or photographs in one color or values of one color. A monochromatic object or image reflects colors in shades of limited colors or hues. Images using only shades of grey (with or without black or white) are called grayscale or black-and-white. However, scientifically speaking, monochromatic light refers to visible light of a narrow band of wavelengths (see spectral color). - BBC London is the BBC English Region producing local radio, television, teletext and online services in London and parts of the surrounding area. Its output includes the daily \\"BBC London News\\" and weekly \\"Sunday Politics\\" on television, the BBC Radio London radio station and local coverage of the London area on BBC Online and BBC Red Button. The region's headquarters are situated in the new eastern extension of Broadcasting House. - A metropolitan borough is a type of local government district in England, and is a subdivision of a metropolitan county. Created in 1974 by the Local Government Act 1972, metropolitan boroughs are defined in English law as metropolitan districts. However, all of them have been granted or regranted royal charters to give them borough status (as well as, in some cases, city status). Metropolitan boroughs have been effectively unitary authority areas since the abolition of the metropolitan county councils by the Local Government Act 1985. However, metropolitan boroughs pool much of their authority in joint boards and other arrangements that cover whole metropolitan counties, such as combined authorities. - BBC Radio Berkshire is the BBC Local Radio service for the English county of Berkshire, North Hampshire, and South Oxfordshire. Radio Berkshire broadcasts on 94.6 (Henley-on-Thames), 95.4 (Windsor), 104.1 (Hannington) and 104.4 (Reading) FM from its studios at Caversham Park near Reading.

Both the presenters had previously presented TV - am , the breakfast franchise which ran before the start of the regional ITV programming . - Entertainment is a form of activity that holds the attention and interest of an audience, or gives pleasure and delight. It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience. - Pebble Mill Studios was a television studio complex owned by the BBC located in Edgbaston, Birmingham, England. The nine acre site was opened by Princess Anne on 10 November 1971, and in addition to the studios contained two canteens, a post office, gardens, a seven storey office block, and an Outside Broadcasting (OB) base. - Anne Margaret Diamond (born 8 September 1954) is an English radio and television presenter and journalist.

Animal lover Sierra Jane Downing wanted to bury the squirrel, and disregarded her parents' instructions to leave the animal alone. She snuck back to it, leaving her sweatshirt on the ground near it before later tying the shirt around her waist, reports ABC News. She apparently contracted the disease from insects near the carcass and got ill a few days later; her fever spiked to 107 and she went into a seizure. The girl nearly died, but doctors zeroed in on the rare cause after learning about the camping trip and her exposure to the squirrel, reports the AP. After a course of antibiotics, she's expected to be good as new. Sierra Jane's case—the first in Colorado since 2006—follows that of a man who contracted the plague, or Black Death, in Oregon. And health officials in New Mexico, meanwhile, have seen an uptick in cases among the affluent.","response":"Title: A Surprising Return of the Bubonic Plague in the US: The Tale of a 7-Year-Old's Brush with the Black Death In recent years, the re-emergence of the bubonic plague has been making headlines in the United States. The story of a 7-year-old girl named Sierra Jane Downing is a gripping narrative of what happened when the young girl, from a recent camping trip, unexpectedly contracted the hauntingly notorious disease that was once responsible for wiping out millions of lives in the past. Sierra Jane Downing, a 7-year-old animal lover, went camping with her family in the picturesque location of Colorado. As adventures ensue during these family trips, Sierra Jane stumbled upon a dead squirrel. Despite her parents' instructions to leave the animal alone, the little girl went back to it with the intention of burying it. She had left her sweatshirt on the ground near the carcass and later wrapped the same sweatshirt around her waist. According to ABC News, little did Sierra Jane know that the tiny, seemingly insignificant insects around the carcass would carry the bubonic plague and introduce it into her life. A few days following the camping trip, the effects of the bubonic plague began to manifest. The girl had a fever that spiked up to a staggering 107°F, and seizures struck. Everything pointed to a life-or-death situation as the little girl struggled in excruciating pain. It was certainly a race against time to save Sierra Jane. Upon learning about her exposure to the dead squirrel, doctors identified the rare cause to be the bubonic plague. The accurate diagnosis led to prompt treatment, which consisted of a course of antibiotics to combat the aggressive symptoms. As reported by the Associated Press, Sierra Jane's recovery from the historical \\"Black Death\\" is proof of the effectiveness of modern medicine. Sierra Jane's case is the first in Colorado since 2006, following the disturbing report of a man who contracted the bubonic plague in Oregon. Furthermore, health officials in New Mexico have noticed a sudden increase in cases among the affluent population. These incidents serve as cautionary tales that anyone, regardless of age or social status, can inadvertently come into contact with the disease. The bubonic plague, infamously known as the Black Death, swept across Europe during the mid-14th century, claiming an estimated 75 to 200 million lives. It is caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, which often resides in vector species such as rodents and their fleas. A bite from an infected flea can transmit the bacteria to a human host, with symptoms usually appearing within one week. The symptoms may include fever, chills, weakness, swollen lymph nodes, and rapid heart rate. The bubonic plague is sometimes considered a thing of the recent past, yet the resurgence of cases in the modern-day United States serves as a stark reminder of how old diseases can re-emerge and remain a threat to human health. As depicted by Sierra Jane Downing's close encounter with the \\"Black Death,\\" the bubonic plague still lurks around the human population. With increased information and preventive measures, individuals planning outdoor activities such as camping can equip themselves with knowledge and precautions to avoid similar occurrences. In a world where ancient and new diseases coexist, it is paramount to remain vigilant and informed to continue safeguarding human health."},{"question":"Translate the following sentence to Russian: Please notice that the deadline for a cancellation of an order is 48 hrs. before the beginning of a service.","response":"Пожалуйста, обратите внимание, что срок отмены заказа составляет 48 часов до начала оказания услуги.

He noticed that both tribes spend the majority of the day outside, and therefore they are both exposed to fairly high amounts of UV light. He also quickly realized that one key difference between the tribes was that members of tribe A had dark skin, while members of tribe B had light skin. But I can use this background: The epidermis also contains melanocytes , which are cells that produce melanin. Melanin is the brownish pigment that gives skin much of its color. Everyone has about the same number of melanocytes, but the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin. The amount of melanin produced is determined by heredity and exposure to UV light, which increases melanin output. Exposure to UV light also stimulates the skin to produce vitamin D . Because melanin blocks UV light from penetrating the skin, people with darker skin may be at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency. What is an answer for this question: Members of which tribe will be at greater risk for vitamin D deficiency? Answer:","response":"Members of tribe A, with darker skin, will be at a greater risk for vitamin D deficiency. This is due to the relationship between melanin production and the skin's ability to produce vitamin D when exposed to UV light. In the provided background information, it is mentioned that the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin. Melanin is responsible for providing pigmentation to the skin, with higher amounts leading to a darker skin tone. One of the primary functions of melanin is to protect the skin from damage caused by UV radiation. It does this by absorbing UV light and converting it into heat energy, which prevents the harmful effects of the radiation on the underlying cells and DNA. However, the same UV light that stimulates melanin production is also required for the synthesis of vitamin D in the skin. Vitamin D is essential for maintaining healthy bones, immune function, and overall well-being. When the skin is exposed to UV light, a series of chemical reactions occur, eventually leading to the production of active vitamin D (calcitriol), which is then absorbed into the bloodstream. Since melanin blocks UV light from penetrating the skin, individuals with darker skin, such as members of tribe A, may have a reduced ability to produce vitamin D in response to sunlight exposure. This increased melanin production acts as a natural sunscreen, protecting the skin from damage but inadvertently interfering with the production of essential vitamin D. In contrast, members of tribe B, who have lighter skin and therefore lower melanin production, will have an increased ability to produce vitamin D when exposed to UV light. Their skin will absorb more UV light and initiate the conversion process more effectively, thus reducing their risk of vitamin D deficiency in comparison to those with darker skin. It is important to note that both tribes spend a significant amount of time outdoors, which should lead to increased UV exposure and potentially more vitamin D production. However, due to the melanin levels and their protective effects, members of tribe A would still be at a higher risk of vitamin D deficiency compared to members of tribe B."},{"question":"Skylar played a game in regulation and they ended up winning.

Justification: The answer that \\"it is not possible to tell\\" stands true in this context due to the inherent limitations associated with online communication. When we interact with others online, we primarily rely on text-based communication, which lacks the nonverbal cues (such as facial expressions, tone of voice, and body language) that provide a more complete understanding of someone's thoughts and emotions in face-to-face interactions. While it's true that there are a variety of emojis and other digital tools that offer a semblance of conveying emotions, these are often not enough to fully understand the complexity and nuances of someone's emotional state or thoughts. Additionally, in online communication, there is a high chance of misinterpretation, as individuals may project their own feelings and assumptions onto the written word. Furthermore, people often engage in online persona management, presenting a particular image of themselves that may not accurately represent their true emotions or thoughts. This could be done for various reasons, such as impressing others, fitting in with a group, or maintaining professional distance. In summary, due to the limited nature of online communication, the absence of nonverbal cues, and possible misinterpretations that can occur, it is not possible to accurately determine someone's emotions or thoughts with 100% certainty solely through their online interactions."},{"question":"Who was the wife of the Greek hero Agamemnon who murdered him on his return from Troy?","response":"The wife of the Greek hero Agamemnon, who murdered him upon his return from Troy, was Clytemnestra.

Her infamous motivation for murder stems from a complex web of deceit, power struggles, and retributive bloody vengeance. Before the Trojan War, faced with unfavorable winds that prevented the Greek fleet from setting sail, Agamemnon was told by the seer Calchas that the winds would only change if he sacrificed his daughter Iphigenia to the goddess Artemis. Agamemnon deceived Clytemnestra into thinking that their daughter was to be married to the hero Achilles, but instead, upon their arrival, Iphigenia was tragically sacrificed. This is widely taken to be the root of Clytemnestra's abhorrence for Agamemnon, and her eventual decision to plot his murder. During the ten years of Agamemnon's absence in the Trojan War, Clytemnestra began an affair with Aegisthus, who was the cousin and mortal enemy of Agamemnon. Aegisthus felt he was the rightful heir to the throne of Mycenae, as Agamemnon's father, Atreus, had killed Aegisthus's brothers. Fueled by her resentment towards Agamemnon and influenced by her lover's thirst for power, Clytemnestra formed a plot to murder her husband. Upon his victorious but weary return from Troy, Agamemnon was greeted by an apparently dutiful Clytemnestra, who prepared a lavish bath for him. Unbeknownst to Agamemnon, Clytemnestra had placed a net or a robe over the bath, which entangled Agamemnon when he arose, leaving him helplessly trapped. Clytemnestra then murdered him, with some sources stating she struck him with an axe. This act of treachery caused outrage among the Greek society of the time, and Clytemnestra’s actions are often discussed in light of an early debate about femininity, power, and morality. Her reputation in subsequent Greek tragedies is frequently that of a manipulative, deadly woman whose actions led to her own downfall, typically portrayed as being murdered in retaliation by her and Agamemnon’s son, Orestes."},{"question":"How to warm up your voice<br>Keep good posture. In order to have the best air flow and therefore the best sound, you need to have good posture. This goes for when you're both sitting and standing. Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? Another way to warm up your voice is to visit Florida in the summer. Options: * Yes * It's impossible to say * No","response":"* No The sentence about visiting Florida in the summer does not follow the preceding text, as it is not relevant to the topic of warming up your voice. Instead, below is a detailed response on how to warm up your voice effectively: 1. Maintain good posture: As mentioned earlier, good posture is essential for optimal airflow and producing the best sound. Whether sitting or standing, ensure that your spine is aligned, shoulders are relaxed, and chest is open. 2. Practice deep breathing: Inhale slowly through your nose, filling your lungs and diaphragm with air. This allows for better control and projection while singing. Exhale slowly and repeat a few times to increase lung capacity. 3. Humming: Begin by gently humming different notes, starting with a comfortable range and gradually extending the range. This warms up your vocal cords without straining them. 4. Lip trills and tongue rolls: Performing lip trills and tongue rolls helps in relaxing the lips and tongue, both of which are crucial for proper articulation and enunciation while singing. 5. Practice vocal exercises: Perform vocal exercises such as scales, arpeggios, and sirening, where you gradually move your voice from the lowest note to the highest note, and then back down again with a smooth transition. This not only warms up your voice but also strengthens your vocal range. 6. Work on resonators: Target different areas of resonance in your face and head by buzzing your lips, humming, or practicing the \\"ng\\" sound. This helps in achieving a rich and full tone while singing. 7. Articulate consonants: Practicing articulation of different consonants helps in warming up the muscles used for enunciation and diction. Exaggerate the pronunciation of consonant sounds to improve clarity when singing. 8. Perform a full vocal warm-up routine: Combine various elements mentioned above into a full vocal warm-up routine that focuses on breath control, resonance, vocal exercises, and articulation. This helps prepare your voice for sustained and healthy singing. 9. Stretch your body: Stretching your body, particularly your neck, shoulders, and upper back, can alleviate stress and tension, allowing for better vocal production. 10. Stay hydrated: Drinking enough water is essential for overall vocal health and flexibility. Ensure that you consume plenty of water before and after your warm-up. Remember to always warm up your voice gently, and never force or strain your vocal cords. Consistent practice and proper vocal warm-up techniques will help you achieve a healthy, strong, and flexible voice."},{"question":"What kind of task would test someone's ability to perform physical reasoning?","response":"A task that would test someone's ability to perform physical reasoning would typically involve manipulating objects, understanding the physical constraints of the environment, and predicting the outcome of specific actions. Physical reasoning primarily refers to an individual's ability to comprehend, analyze, and deduce problems that involve mechanical, spatial, or motion-based aspects. One example of such a task is the \\"Tower of Hanoi\\" problem. The objective is to move a stack of disks of different sizes from one peg to another, using a third peg, with the rule that a disk can only be placed on top of a smaller disk. This challenges participants to think about the spatial relationships between the disks and how to manipulate them within the constraints of the problem to achieve the desired outcome. Here is a more detailed breakdown of other tasks that can test someone's ability to perform physical reasoning: 1. Building a structure: Assembling a structure, such as a bridge or a tower, using wooden blocks, LEGO bricks, or other materials, will require recognizing the structural elements needed to support the design and how these elements interact with physical forces such as gravity and tension. 2. Creating a Rube Goldberg machine: Designing and building a complex, chain-reaction contraption to accomplish a simple task exemplifies physical reasoning. This involves understanding the relationships between different mechanisms and predicting the outcomes of each action in the sequence. 3. Navigating an obstacle course: An obstacle course requires a participant to maneuver through a series of physical barriers by analyzing the environmental constraints and determining the most efficient way to approach each obstacle. 4. Balancing objects: Balancing various objects on a fulcrum or trying to balance oneself on a beam requires an understanding of the forces at play and the distribution of weight to maintain equilibrium. 5. Sports activities: Engaging in sports like basketball, soccer, or pool requires predicting the trajectory of the ball, evaluating the required force, and understanding the principles of motion. 6. Solving a maze: Finding a path through a maze or labyrinth involves spatial reasoning, predicting the outcome of moving through different sections, and deducing the optimal route to the finish. 7. Unraveling tangled ropes or wires: Understanding the knots and connections of tangled ropes or wires involves analyzing the structure, visualizing the desired outcome, and determining the necessary actions to loosen and disentangle the mess. 8. Estimating the length or weight of objects: Making physical estimations entails comparing objects, visualizing proportions, and understanding the physical properties of the environment. 9. Jigsaw puzzles or tangram-style puzzles: Solving puzzles involving fitting irregular shapes together requires spatial awareness, pattern recognition, and an understanding of geometric relationships. 10. Catapult or slingshot challenge: Constructing and using a catapult or slingshot requires understanding the forces involved, predicting the projectile's trajectory, and adjusting the parameters to achieve specific goals. These tasks, as well as many others, test an individual's physical reasoning abilities by challenging them to operate within the constraints of the environment and predict the effects of manipulating objects or forces in specific ways. Such exercises can help develop problem-solving skills, spatial awareness, and a better understanding of the physical world."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer.

If Kristoff has 85 stickers, how many stickers does Riku have?. Explanation:","response":"Step 1: Identify the given information: - Riku has 25 times more stickers than Kristoff. - Kristoff has 85 stickers. Step 2: Set up the equation to find the number of stickers Riku has: - Since Riku has 25 times more stickers than Kristoff, to find out how many stickers Riku has, we must multiply the number of stickers Kristoff has (85) by 25. Step 3: Solve the equation: - Multiply Kristoff's number of stickers (85) by 25: 85 * 25 = 2125 Step 4: Find the total sticker difference between Riku and Kristoff: - Since Riku has 2125 more stickers than Kristoff, we must add Kristoff's 85 stickers to Riku's difference of 2125 to find the total number of stickers Riku has. Step 5: Calculate the total number of stickers Riku has: - Add Kristoff's number of stickers (85) to the difference between Riku and Kristoff (2125): 85 + 2125 = 2210 Explanation: Riku has 2210 stickers because he has 25 times more stickers than Kristoff who has 85 stickers.

Be careful not to shake too vigorously so that you don’t make the stain bigger or spread the soot around any more than is necessary. If you shake the fabric too vigorously, you also risk grinding the soot into the fabric – ultimately making it harder to clean. For fabrics stained with soot, try rinsing them with cold water to remove the stain. Turn the fabric inside out and run it under cool water to get as much of the soot out as possible. Try not to spread the stain further or grind the soot into the fabric with your hands. Try to let the cold water do its job and avoid touching the soot during the process. If you have soot stains on fabric materials like clothing, you can try soaking them overnight in laundry detergent. Fill a bucket with warm water and a small amount of laundry detergent and submerge the items. Let the fabric soak for at least six hours. If the soot-stained items can be bleached without being ruined, add a few drops of bleach to the detergent/water mixture. Use the hottest possible setting on your laundry machine to wash the soot-stained fabric. Use bleach (or color safe bleach, if the fabric requires it) when you run the washing machine. Make sure that you have done all you can to minimize the soot stain before you actually wash the fabric. Using several methods together will be much more effective at removing the stain than just attempting one method. Don’t put the fabric in the dryer until you have checked to make sure the soot stain was completely removed.

His father, Philip Hide, owned a small mixed-farm at Cust and also drove trucks. In 1960, due to sickness, Philip Hide sold the small farm and moved to Rangiora, continuing to drive trucks until his retirement. Rodney Hide attended Rangiora High School, before gaining a degree in zoology and botany from the University of Canterbury. Hide held the seventh place on the ACT party list for the 1996 elections. ACT received enough votes for Hide to enter Parliament, making him one of the party's \\"founding\\" MPs. He gradually rose through the party's ranks, reaching second place in the ACT list for the 2002 elections. In his maiden speech, Hide made a specific attack on \\"perks\\" enjoyed by MPs, and this \\"perk-busting\\" became a characteristic of his political career until he was himself exposed for taking advantage of such perks, in taking his girlfriend on a tax payer funded trip to London and Hawaii. Hide still however claims to have developed a substantial reputation for finding and exposing \\"scandals\\", whether they relate to MPs' perks or to other governmental matters. Hide's critics often claim that his \\"scandals\\" rely on sensationalism and exaggeration, and have as their only purpose the gaining of media attention; but his supporters believe that Hide's constant scrutiny \\"keeps the government honest\\" and ensures that the administration does not waste taxpayers' money. Roger Douglas himself has emerged as one of Hide's more prominent critics, referring to Hide's \\"stunts\\" as detracting from ACT's core economic message, shifting focus to populist issues of law and order and to provocative race relations policies. At a party conference, Douglas condemned MPs \\"who run any fickle line capable of grabbing short-term votes and attention\\", a comment allegedly directed at Hide or at his supporters. Hide acknowledges the criticism, but defends himself on the grounds that a focus on pure economic theory will not attract interest: \\"the problem is that the so-called stunts are particularly well-reported and my work explaining free market ideas disappears without trace.\\" The tension between Douglas and Hide increased when Hide made a bid for the vice-presidency of ACT in 2000: supporters of Douglas interpreted this action as a challenge to Douglas' organisational authority within the party. Both Douglas and Hide stood down from their roles as President and Vice-President, suggesting an uneasy truce between these two factions.

Can you generate a short summary of the above paragraph?","response":"A Spanish violinist began a unique, week-long experiment in a large glass cube in central Madrid on Wednesday. The goal of this innovative initiative is for the musician to compose a new piece of music entirely within this transparent environment, under the observation of the public. This experimental project aims to bring to light the process of creation and composition in a visual, accessible format, breaking down barriers between creator and viewers by making the process of musical composition an inclusive, publicly shared experience. The musician, by taking on this challenge, isn't merely undertaking a personal musical endeavor, but is also participating in an artistic project that folds performance art into the act of music composition. By working in full sight of the public, the violinist is blurring the lines between private creation and public performance, disrupting the traditional perception of music-making being a private, secluded process. The setting for this experiment - a large glass cube situated in central Madrid - is as much a part of the performance as the music itself, adding an element of exhibition and spectacle to the act of composing music. By placing himself on display, the violinist creates an environment where the public becomes passive participants, making this interactive performance experiment unique and drawing attention to the typically unseen process of art creation. This project could also act as a study of the artist's reaction to an unfamiliar and pressure-cooker style situation. Being surrounded by glass walls in the middle of Madrid subjects the violinist to constant surveillance, turning the act of composition into a social experiment of sorts. The artist must deal with constant distractions that he otherwise wouldn't have had in a traditional, secluded composing process, possibly putting to the test and enhancing the discipline and focus necessary for music creation. The outcome of this performance will not only generate a piece of new music, but also offer insights into the process of musical creativity under live public scrutiny, ultimately contributing to the dialogue about the intersection of public and private life in art creation, the resilience of artists, and the changing paradigms of music composition in the contemporary context."},{"question":"Teacher:In this task, you're given a statement, and three sentences as choices.

While I appreciate their honesty and commitment to the spirit of the game, it might be time for them to be more assertive and vocal about the penalty situations they encounter.\\" Crystal Palace has struggled with penalty calls for some time, oftentimes losing in situations where other teams might have gained an advantage. Warnock wants to ensure that his team members are being proactive in making their voices heard on the field, thereby maximizing their chances of success. \\"We cannot afford to let potential penalty opportunities slip away,\\" Warnock continued. \\"It is essential for our players to recognize when they are fouled and make the necessary appeals to the officials. It might seem like we are moving away from our honest approach, but in reality, we are only doing what other teams have been doing and simply seeking fair treatment.\\" In addition to urging his players to be more active in appealing for penalties, Warnock also praised their integrity and sportsmanship. He acknowledged that it is rare in today's football world to see a team dedicated to such values, and he remains proud of his team's commitment to fair play. However, he noted that it is essential for players to find a balance between maintaining their principles and capitalizing on game-changing opportunities. As Crystal Palace faces its upcoming opponents, it will be interesting to see whether Warnock's call for assertiveness will pay off and lead to more successful penalty appeals. In conclusion, Crystal Palace manager Neil Warnock urged his team to be more aggressive in appealing for penalties, while also acknowledging their admirable \\"too honest\\" nature. As the squad searching for ways to improve their performance, it will be crucial for them to strike a balance between integrity and taking advantage of key opportunities. With a challenging season ahead, only time will tell if this change in mindset will ultimately benefit the team and impact their overall results."},{"question":"Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: Ryman Auditorium (formerly Grand Ole Opry House and Union Gospel Tabernacle) is a 2,362-seat live performance venue, located at 116 5th Avenue North, in Nashville, Tennessee and is best known as the home of the \\"Grand Ole Opry\\" from 1943 to 1974.

Substitutions are generally made to replace a player who has become tired or injured, or who is performing poorly, or for tactical reasons (such as bringing a striker on in place of a defender). Unlike some sports (such as American football or ice hockey), a player who has been substituted during a match may take no further part in it. Answer this question, making sure that the answer is supposed by the text: if you get subbed out in soccer can you come back in?","response":"In association football, once a player has been substituted and taken off the pitch, they cannot re-enter the match or come back in. The substitution rule is designed to ensure that each team can make limited and strategic changes during the game, with a maximum of three substitutions allowed per team (which may be increased to five under specific competition regulations). Therefore, it is essential that coaches make careful decisions when substituting players, considering factors such as player fatigue, injuries, performance, and tactical adjustments. Once a player has been subbed out, they cannot return to the field, and their participation in the match is concluded. This aspect of the game requires thoughtful planning and management from coaches and players alike."},{"question":"Q: I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: how many times has whoopi been married Suggested answer: She is also acclaimed for her roles as the bartender Guinan in Star Trek: The Next Generation , as Terry Doolittle in Jumpin' Jack Flash , and as Carmen Tibideaux in Glee , as well as the voice of Shenzi the hyena in The Lion King .

On receiving the news of a robbery in his territory, Kattabomman and his retinue set out incognito to capture the robbers. When the robbers are captured, they confess that they had been hired by the British to create unrest in Kattabomman's domain. They also tell him that the British had enticed the neighbouring chieftain, Ettappan (V. K. Ramasamy), to help them in their endeavour to annex Panchalankurichi. Ettappan was promised that an additional two villages would be added to his land by the British, as a price for his betrayal. Ettappan, in disguise, goes to Kattabomman's court and tries to frighten him by extolling the omnipotence of the British. Kattabomman is indignant and tears off Ettappan's fake beard, but spares him because he had come to his court as an ambassador.At Chayalkudi, a village near Panchalankurichi, lives Vellaiyammal (Padmini), who vows to marry the man who tames her pet bull.

But to Casey Stevenson and Ryan Rajewski the S40 is an ideal starting point for something far more ambitious. They see the single-cylinder S40 as a blank canvas, the foundation for a runabout with a retro-cool appeal that can draw young urban riders. Their company, Ryca Motors of Whittier, Calif., has intervened on behalf of the cruiser-style S40, producing a parts kit that rescues the bike from its usual role as a none-too-attractive Harley-Davidson Sportster replica and gives it the identity of a classic cafe racer. When the transformation is complete, the bike’s spare lines echo those of single-cylinder machines from the likes of BSA and Norton, popular in the 1960s among enthusiasts who stripped them to the basics and raced one another over country lanes between British roadhouses. That cafe-racer style — signified by low-mounted handlebars, footpegs repositioned to the rear and barely muffled exhaust pipes — eventually grew into a trend. The cafe racer is enjoying a resurgence today, to the point of being seen as downright hip. But this time it’s image-conscious young Americans stripping inexpensive Japanese bikes. Ryca’s CS-1 is a thoughtfully engineered kit that includes custom bodywork, suspension parts and controls of its own design. The Suzuki that serves as its basis has been manufactured nearly unchanged since the ’80s — it still uses a carburetor to feed its air-cooled 652 cc engine. Mr. Stevenson, the Ryca’s designer, is an ex-NASA engineer who saw potential in the S40’s unprepossessing chassis. He reshaped and downsized the fuel tank, and created a sleek seat, tail section and side panels. Longer shock absorbers at the rear and a shortened front fork leveled the machine’s stance, and rear-set footpegs and clip-on handlebars completed the makeover. That prototype looked and worked so well that Mr. Stevenson and Mr. Rajewski decided to offer a conversion kit. In the two years since, more than 300 kits have been sold, Mr. Rajewski said. The basic package sells for 2,495, not including shipping or, for that matter, a donor bike, which costs anywhere from 800 for a neglected 1986 model, then known as a Savage, to 5,699, including shipping, for a 2012 S40 from a dealer. Assembly is required. Buyers send the factory fuel tank and rear-wheel hub to Ryca, where the tank is reshaped, reducing its capacity to about 2.2 gallons from the original 2.8, and the wheel is relaced to fit an 18-inch rim. Ryca details the entire process in a series of YouTube videos. But for riders who’d rather not get their hands dirty, Ryca will build an all-new CS-1, using a showroom-fresh S40, for about 9,500, depending on options. Ryca is also encouraging bike shops to buy kits and do conversions locally. On the street, the Ryca turns heads in a way that mass-produced machines do not. It’s striking and original, with its own aura of a classic thumper mixed with new-millenium chic. I was inspired to drag out my black racing leathers to stay in character: my usual brilliant yellow riding jacket was not going to cut it with the too-cool motorcycle subculture here in Los Angeles. The Ryca feels tight and tiny, a natural for in-city commuting and short-haul cafe hopping. The riding position is tolerable and the low seat height is perfect for smaller, lighter riders. The Suzuki engine is smooth, torquey and responsive, its exhaust crackling on downshifts like a Norton Manx slowing for the Creg-ny-baa section of the famed Isle of Man racecourse. Brakes and suspension are not quite up to racing standards. The Ryca kit’s shock absorbers are too flaccid for any but the lightest, slowest riders, and the stock Suzuki fork, its travel reduced two inches by internal spacers, is just as uninspired. The front brake, a small single disc, requires a determined pull on the lever. None of these problems are deal-breakers. The basic frame, engine and riding position are sound. Stiffer springs front and rear, higher-viscosity fork oil and stickier front brake pads would be economical upgrades. But if the CS-1 is not nearly as fast through a set of switchbacks as it looks, does it at least pass the hipness test? The two giggling teenage girls who chased me up Interstate 405 in their Camry just to snap it on their iPhones voted yes.","response":"Ryca Motors has introduced a conversion kit for the Suzuki Boulevard S40, transforming it into a classic cafe racer. The Ryca CS-1 kit includes custom bodywork, suspension parts, and controls which all work with the Suzuki's original chassis. Assembly is required, with buyers sending their factory fuel tank and rear-wheel hub to Ryca for modifications. The conversion kit has attracted over 300 sales in the last two years and changed the image of the original motorcycle, making it more appealing to young urban riders."},{"question":"@mrsmarlowe hopefully I won't be.

Question: Jim is far away from his friend with a flashlight. Jim can see that the light is getting brighter as he (A) walks away from it (B) walks towards it A:","response":"Jim can see that the light is getting brighter as he (B) walks towards it. When we analyze the two choices — \\"walking toward light\\" and \\"walking away from light\\" — the difference in perception and visual experience that Jim would encounter becomes clear. In this scenario, the light source is a flashlight that Jim's friend is holding. Due to the inverse-square law, the intensity of the light visible to Jim will change as he modifies the distance between himself and the flashlight. Option A considered \\"walking away from light.\\" In this scenario, if Jim decides to walk away from the light source, the intensity of the light he perceives will diminish as the distance increases. Gradually, the flashlight would appear less and less bright as the amount of light reaching Jim's eyes decreases. This is primarily because the light spreads over a larger surface the farther away it travels. Therefore, walking away from the light would result in Jim experiencing the flashlight's brightness becoming fainter, not brighter. On the other hand, Option B is \\"walking towards the light.\\" When Jim decides to walk towards the flashlight, he essentially shortens the distance between himself and the light source. As the distance between Jim and the light source decreases, more light reaches his eyes, causing the flashlight to appear brighter and more intense. Consequently, the flashlight's brightness increases as he walks towards the light, precisely aligning with the initial statement of \\"Jim can see that the light is getting brighter.\\" In conclusion, when Jim walks towards the flashlight held by his friend, he will perceive the light becoming brighter, as the light intensity increases due to the reduced distance between them. Therefore, the correct choice for this statement is \\"walking toward light,\\" or Option B. This phenomenon can be attributed to the inverse-square law, where the intensity of the light is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source."},{"question":"To remedy this he gave lectures on Geography and Astronomy to large and enthusiastic classes of ladies Add punctuation","response":"To remedy this, he gave lectures on Geography and Astronomy to large and enthusiastic classes of ladies.

She entered the sauna..","response":"b). She entered the sauna. When a woman's eyeglasses fog up, it is usually because of a sudden change in temperature or humidity levels in her environment. In this case, the cause of her eyeglasses fogging up is that she entered a sauna. A sauna is essentially a small, enclosed room with high temperature and humidity levels, typically used for relaxation and sweating. The temperature in a sauna can range from 150°F (65°C) to 195°F (90°C) and the humidity level might vary between 5% and 30%, depending on whether it is a dry or wet sauna. When a person enters a sauna, especially from a colder environment, the warm and moist air inside the sauna comes into contact with their eyeglasses, which are at a much lower temperature. As a result, the moisture in the sauna's air condenses on the cooler surface of the eyeglasses, causing them to fog up. On the other hand, if a woman was reclining by the pool (option a), the temperature and humidity around her would likely be more stable, and it would be less likely for her eyeglasses to fog up. While it is possible for eyeglasses to fog up when transitioning from an air-conditioned indoor environment to an outdoor poolside area with high humidity, the effect would not be as pronounced as entering a sauna. Moreover, since a sauna's main purpose is to induce sweating, it creates an atmosphere that readily causes moisture to accumulate on the surfaces within the room, including eyeglasses. In addition, breathing in the steamy environment further increases the likelihood of eyeglasses fogging up, as the moist, warm air breathed out by the person adds to the condensation effect. In conclusion, the most likely cause of the woman's eyeglasses fogging up would be her entering the sauna, as the sudden change in temperature and humidity upon entering the warm, steam-filled room leads to the formation of condensation on the cooler surface of her eyeglasses."},{"question":"What are the most important words in the following sentence: A pizza with cheese, onions and hot peppers.","response":"In the sentence \\"A pizza with cheese, onions and hot peppers,\\" the most important words are \\"pizza,\\" \\"cheese,\\" \\"onions,\\" and \\"hot peppers.\\" These words hold the highest importance due to their direct correlation to the main subject of the sentence, providing key information about the composition and ingredients of the pizza. Let's analyze the function of these important words in the sentence: 1. Pizza: This is the primary subject, around which the sentence is built and aims to provide information. By mentioning \\"pizza,\\" we know that the sentence is describing a specific type of food and sets the context for understanding the variety and ingredients that follow. 2. Cheese: As an ingredient, \\"cheese\\" serves to give the reader a clearer understanding of the type of pizza being described. Cheese is an essential and foundational pizza topping, providing both flavor and texture. As a widely popular pizza ingredient, its mention in this sentence contributes to an increased comprehensibility of the pizza's characteristics. 3. Onions: \\"Onions\\" is another crucial ingredient mentioned in the sentence. Adding onions to a pizza introduces a distinct flavor profile that may sway one's preference towards or away from this particular variety. As a recognizable and often-used pizza topping, it plays an essential role in further illustrating the specific nature of the pizza being described. 4. Hot peppers: The last key ingredient listed, \\"hot peppers\\" denotes the spice level and potentially the predominant flavor element of this pizza. Hot peppers can bring about a significant taste distinction, causing this pizza to vary notably from other options. As a deciding factor for many people when choosing their preferred pizza toppings, hot peppers' mention in this sentence amplifies the necessary details for understanding the pizza's composition. In conclusion, the important words in the sentence, \\"A pizza with cheese, onions, and hot peppers\\" - pizza, cheese, onions, and hot peppers - work cohesively to convey the central theme and provide a comprehensive picture of the specific kind of pizza being described. These words hold the highest degree of importance in the sentence due to their direct relation to the subject matter and their impact on the reader's understanding and visualization of the pizza."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Generate a question that has the following answer: Jakopur, Punjab,India for the following movie plot: Virsa is the story of Nawaz Ali and Ranvir Singh Grewal and their families. Nawaz Ali hails from Lahore in Pakistan and Ranvir Singh Grewal belongs to a village, Jakopur, in Punjab, India. About 20 years ago, both of them migrated to Sydney, Australia, in search of work, where they met and became the best of friends. Gradually, their hard work paid off. Ranvir opened an Indian restaurant, which became a runaway success. Nawaz Ali opened a shop opposite Ranvirâs restaurant. It did well and he could manage to lead a comfortable life but he was not as successful as Ranvir. Nawaz Ali was very grounded in his culture and values and this helped him to remain level-headed and not get carried away by the comforts of life in Australia. He never lost sight of what was morally and ethically right and stood by his Asian values. On the other hand, Ranvir got carried away by his success. He felt that he was superior to the other Indians and Asians who were not as successful. He found merit in all things associated with the white folks â their lifestyle, their values and culture, their behaviour and mannerisms â and looked down upon his Indian upbringing and values. He had no more use for ethics and morality. He became very conscious of his money, status and reputation. The difference in outlook and behaviour drive the two friends apart until they reach a point where Ranvir stops talking to Nawaz. However, Nawaz still cares for his friend and tries to keep their friendship alive. As the film opens, Ranvir and Nawaz are well settled in Australia with their respective families. Nawaz has one son, Amaan Ali and Ranvir has a son, Yuvraj, and a daughter, Meet. Amaan and Yuvraj are roughly the same age and best buddies since childhood, despite the rift between their fathers.

In May 1836 Bennett travelled to Düsseldorf in the company of Davison to attend the Lower Rhenish Music Festival for the first performance of Mendelssohn's oratorio St Paul. Bennett's visit was enabled by a subsidy by the piano-making firm of John Broadwood & Sons. Inspired by his journey up the Rhine, Bennett began work on his overture The Naiads (Op. 15). After Bennett left for home, Mendelssohn wrote to their mutual friend, the English organist and composer Thomas Attwood, \\"I think him the most promising young musician I know, not only in your country but also here, and I am convinced if he does not become a very great musician, it is not God's will, but his own\\". After Bennett's first visit to Germany there followed three extended visits to work in Leipzig. He was there from October 1836 to June 1837, during which time he made his debut at the Gewandhaus as the soloist in his Third Piano Concerto with Mendelssohn conducting. He later conducted his Naiads overture. During this visit he also arranged the first cricket match ever played in Germany, (\\"as fitting a Yorkshireman\\" as the musicologist Percy M. Young comments). At this time Bennett wrote to Davison:[Mendelssohn] took me to his house and gave me the printed score of [his overture] 'Melusina', and afterwards we supped at the 'Hôtel de Bavière', where all the musical clique feed ... The party consist[ed] of Mendelssohn, [Ferdinand] David, Stamity [sic] ... and a Mr. Schumann, a musical editor, who expected to see me a fat man with large black whiskers. Bennett had been at first slightly in awe of Mendelssohn, but no such formality ever attached to Bennett's friendship with Robert Schumann, with whom he went on long country walks by day and visited the local taverns by night. Each dedicated a large-scale piano work to the other: in August 1837 Schumann dedicated his Symphonic Studies to Bennett, who reciprocated the dedication a few weeks later with his Fantasie, Op. 16.

First step is to understand the sentence completely so I know exactly what the translation should convey. 2. I start by translating the beginning of the sentence, \\"If a bird's nest chance to be before thee in the way in any tree\\", into \\"اگر لانه پرنده ای به صورت اتفاقی در مسیر تو، در درختی\\". This portion includes some archaic English phrases like \\"chance to be before thee\\", which translates to \\"be in front of you by chance\\" in modern English. 3. Next, I translated the phrase \\"or on the ground\\" into \\"یا روی زمین\\". 4. Then, the next section of the sentence, \\"whether they be young ones, or eggs, and the dam sitting upon the young, or upon the eggs\\", becomes \\"چه جوانانی در آن باشند یا تخم، و مادر بر روی جوانان یا بر روی تخم بنشیند\\". Here, I used the word \\"مادر\\" for dam, because in Persian language, there is no specific word for \\"dam\\" in the context of referring to a mother bird. 5. Finally, I translated \\"thou shalt not take the dam with the young\\" into \\"تو نباید مادر را با جوانان بگیری\\". Again using \\"تو\\" for \\"thou\\" and \\"مادر\\" for \\"dam\\".

The team with the most points at the end wins the game. Now, let's talk about a game between Scotland and Sri Lanka. Once upon a time, Scotland and Sri Lanka were getting ready to play a cricket game. This wasn't just any game; it was a \\"warm-up game\\" in Kent. Warm-up games are like practice games before the big, important games. Scotland and Sri Lanka played this warm-up game on a Tuesday. Scotland is a country full of mountains, castles, and people who wear clothes called kilts. Sri Lanka is an island shaped like a teardrop, with beautiful beaches, forests, and animals like elephants and leopards. Both countries have cricket teams that are full of players who want to be the best. In this warm-up game, Scotland didn't do very well. They lost by a big number: nine whole points! In cricket, that's called a \\"nine-wicket hammering.\\" This means Sri Lanka's team played really well and scored a lot of points, while Scotland's team couldn't keep up. Both teams played two warm-up games, and this was the second one. The players probably learned a lot from these games and will try to do better in their big, important games that will come later. Even though Scotland didn't win this time, they'll keep practicing and try their best in the future.

In this task, the person would need to apply their knowledge of physics, stability, and balance to create a bridge that can support a certain weight. Step 1: Identify the available materials, such as wooden sticks, glue, or string. Justification: Knowing the materials allows the person to use their properties to make an effective bridge design. Step 2: Determine the parameters of the bridge, like the desired span and the weight it needs to support. Justification: The parameters set constraints on the design, which the person should take into account for their physical reasoning. Step 3: Design the bridge, considering basic structural elements such as trusses, arches, or beams. Justification: Different structures have unique strengths and weaknesses, so understanding their physical properties is key to creating a successful bridge. Step 4: Use physical reasoning to estimate the forces acting on the bridge's components, such as tension, compression, and shear forces. Justification: Adequately managing these forces is crucial for bridge stability and robustness, which a person skilled in physical reasoning could perform. Step 5: Build the bridge according to the design, ensuring proper connections between the structural elements. Justification: Construction quality affects the bridge's overall performance, making it essential for testing one's physical reasoning ability. Step 6: Test the bridge with the given weight to see if it can support it based on the initial parameters. Justification: This is the final step in evaluating the person's physical reasoning ability, as a successful bridge design should be able to withstand the prescribed weight. In this task, a person must consider multiple factors related to physics, material properties, and engineering principles, making it a suitable test for physical reasoning skills."},{"question":"Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Works Fine!

A: A:","response":"The type of energy that causes erosion at the shore is primarily wave energy, which is a form of kinetic energy generated by the wind blowing over the surface of the water. This wave energy is responsible for the constant shaping and reshaping of the coastline, as it erodes and transports sediments along the shore. There are also other supplementary factors that contribute to erosion, such as tidal energy, currents, and human-induced activities; however, wave energy remains the primary driving force. Wave energy has a significant impact on coastal erosion because of its continuous movement and relentless force. When waves approach the shoreline, they break against it, transferring their energy to the shore and causing the weakening and breakdown of rocks and sediments. This process is called abrasion. Wave impact and hydraulic pressure are other processes involved in this energy transfer, causing rocks to crack and break apart due to the sheer force and pressure from the waves pounding against them. Furthermore, wave energy affects the shore through a process called attrition, in which the eroded materials are smoothed and rounded as they collide with one another in the water. This action results in smaller, rounded sediments that are more easily transported by waves and currents. Tidal energy also contributes to shoreline erosion due to the gravitational pull of the moon and sun, which in turn influences the rise and fall of the tides. Tidal energy can result in the formation of tidal creeks and salt marshes in estuaries and the mixing of sediment along the coast. Moreover, it causes the shore to be alternately submerged and exposed, which further facilitates the weathering and erosion processes. Ocean currents, which are driven by temperature changes, salinity, and wind patterns, can also result in coastal erosion. They can transport sediments and redistribute them along the shoreline, causing distinct patterns of deposition and erosion that ultimately shape the coastal landscape. In addition to the natural energy sources that cause erosion at the shore, human-induced factors play a role as well. For example, construction of ports, harbors, and coastal defenses can alter the sediment balance and disrupt the natural movement and distribution of sediments along the shoreline. This disruption can increase erosion rates in certain areas and create unintended consequences for the coastal ecosystem. In conclusion, the primary type of energy that causes erosion at the shore is wave energy, with supplementary factors such as tidal energy, ocean currents, and human-induced activities also contributing to the process. These various forms of energy work in unison to shape and reshape the coastal landscape, constantly eroding and redistributing sediments to create the dynamic shoreline we observe today."},{"question":"Computer security, also known as cybersecurity or IT security, is the protection of information systems from theft or damage to the hardware, the software, and to the information on them, as well as from disruption or misdirection of the services they provide.

Generate a detailed description of this data.","response":"To accomplish the task of creating a detailed description of the provided data, I'll break down each piece of information and detail it comprehensively: 1. I can see that \\"Strada\\" appears to be the central subject of this data. It is highlighted repeatedly, suggesting that we're focussing on a location or entity named Strada. From the context, \\"Strada\\" is most likely a restaurant. 2. The 'eatType' attribute is assigned as 'restaurant' for Strada, confirming my previous assumption that Strada indeed is a restaurant. 3. The 'food' category states 'Indian', which is a significant feature. This means that Strada is a restaurant specializing in Indian cuisine. 4. The 'priceRange' is defined as 'cheap'. This indicates that eating at Strada is inexpensive or affordable compared to other restaurants, perhaps making it a good choice for budget-conscious diners. 5. The 'familyFriendly' status is 'no'. This might imply that the restaurant might not offer facilities or an environment suitable for family dinners, kids or could be more oriented towards adult guests. 6. Finally, the 'near' attribute says 'Rainbow Vegetarian Café'. This suggests that Strada is located near another venue known as the Rainbow Vegetarian Café. This may be useful for providing directions or understanding the geographical context of Strada. Based on all these data elements, a comprehensive description can be made: \\"Strada is an affordable restaurant specializing in Indian cuisine. Despite its appeal to those on a budget, it should be noted that the restaurant is not family-friendly, possibly catering more to adults or individuals. It enjoys a convenient location near the Rainbow Vegetarian Café.\\" This process is essential because understanding individual data points and their implications allows me to generate a complete and accurate narrative that conveys the full picture."},{"question":"Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context?

Vice President Cheney called Crown Prince Abdullah on July 5, 2001, to seek Saudi help in preventing threatened attacks on American facilities in the Kingdom. Secretary of State Powell met with the crown prince twice before 9/11. They discussed topics like Iraq, not al Qaeda.U.S.-Saudi relations in the summer of 2001 were marked by sometimes heated disagreements about ongoing Israeli- Palestinian violence, not about Bin Laden. The confirmation of the Pentagon's new leadership was a lengthy process. Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz was confirmed in March 2001 and Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Douglas Feith in July. Though the new officials were briefed about terrorism and some of the earlier planning, including that for Operation Infinite Resolve, they were focused, as Secretary Rumsfeld told us, on creating a twenty-first-century military. At the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Shelton did not recall much interest by the new administration in military options against al Qaeda in Afghanistan. He could not recall any specific guidance on the topic from the secretary. Brian Sheridan-the outgoing assistant secretary of defense for special operations and low-intensity conflict (SOLIC), the key counterterrorism policy office in the Pentagon-never briefed Rumsfeld. He departed on January 20; he had not been replaced by 9/11. Rumsfeld noted to us his own interest in terrorism, which came up often in his regular meetings with Tenet. He thought that the Defense Department, before 9/11, was not organized adequately or prepared to deal with new threats like terrorism. But his time was consumed with getting new officials in place and working on the foundation documents of a new defense policy, the quadrennial defense review, the defense planning guidance, and the existing contingency plans. He did not recall any particular counterterrorism issue that engaged his attention before 9/11, other than the development of the Predator unmanned aircraft system. The commander of Central Command, General Franks, told us that he did not regard the existing plans as serious. To him a real military plan to address al Qaeda would need to go all the way, following through the details of a full campaign (including the political-military issues of where operations would be based) and securing the rights to fly over neighboring countries. The draft presidential directive circulated in June 2001 began its discussion of the military by reiterating the Defense Department's lead role in protecting its forces abroad.

Gone are the days when you thought beer only came out of a keg and into a red plastic cup. There are an infinite amount of varieties out there, meaning there's a beer out there that matches your ideal taste. Here's a brief and not-at-all comprehensive rundown (that would take ages): Ales. These ferment quickly and are generally a bit sweeter, fuller-bodied, and have a fruity flavor. Indian Pale Ales (IPAs) have more hops and are generally bitter. This category includes pale ales, wheat beers, bitters, porters, stouts, barley wines, brown ales and tripels. Watch out for tripels – they've been fermented several times and can knock you off your feet. Lagers. These ferment slowly and tend to have a \\"crisper\\" flavor than ales and are, in general, less \\"hoppy.\\" Think of Heineken, Bud Light, Natural Light, Harp, Corona, Miller Genuine Draft – these are all light lagers. This category also includes pilsners, Vienna lagers, bocks and marzens. Stouts. These really fall under the \\"ale\\" umbrella, but they are their own beast. A stout is dark and often creamy, with tastes of chocolate and coffee undertones. There's also oatmeal and oyster stouts, too. For these, think Guinness, Beamish, and Samuel Smith Oatmeal Stouts. Bitters. These are English ales that have a deep bronze look and a well-hopped flavor (in other words, bitter). In general, they have greater depth than IPAs. It's hard to qualify their taste beyond that as there are several categories: session or ordinary bitter, best or regular bitter and premium or strong bitter (often called Extra Special Bitters (ESB)). Wheat Beer (or Hefeweizen). This is an ale with a light yet hazy appearance. It often has a slight banana or clove flavor. Sometimes it's spicy or apple-y, too. It's not bitter and it's often served with a wedge of lemon. Just like red wines and white wines (and hard liquors) need to be treated differently and put it in different glasses, the same goes for different varieties of beer. Here's a few things to consider: Mugs – good for IPAs, red, black, brown, and blonde American Ales, Pilsner, English Stouts, smoked beer, witbier, American and English Porters Pint glasses – good for American Ales, IPAs, Pale Ales, English Bitter and mild English Ales, cream ales, dark Lager and Stouts. Goblets: Belgian IPAs and strong, dark ales, quadruples and tripels Pilsner glasses: Vienna and Japanese lagers, Euro dark and strong lagers, American malt liquors, pale and red lagers, doppelbocks Weizen glasses: Dark and pale wheat ales, and all \\"weizens\\" Beer pairs just as well – if not better – with food like wine. And in general, it's the same idea: lighter foods like salads and fish go with lighter beers. Heavier foods and meatier meats go with darker beers. You should also pair \\"regional\\" beers with food of that region. Apart from that, here are a few things to remember: Does your beer have a caramel, cocoa or coffee flavor? Pair it with a smokey flavor, like with char-grilled foods. Is your beer hoppy? This can provide an herbal contract to fattier foods, like salmon, pizza, and fried foods. Is your beer sweet and fruity? Think appetizer plates, like grapes, cheeses, and bruschetta.","response":"There is a vast array of beer varieties available, each with unique tastes and characteristics. Ales ferment fast, are a bit sweeter and fuller-bodied with a fruity flavor. Indian Pale Ales have a higher hops content and are bitter, with types including pale ales, wheat beers, bitters, porters, stouts, and others. Lagers ferment slowly and have a crisp flavor, generally less hoppy. Examples include Heineken, Bud Light, and other light lagers, alongside pilsners, Vienna lagers, bocks, and marzens. Stouts are their distinct category under the ale umbrella, often dark and creamy with chocolate and coffee undertones. Bitters denote English ales with a deep bronze look and well-hopped bitter flavor. Wheat Beer, or Hefeweizen, is a light, hazy ale with banana or clove flavors. The type of glassware also matters, with mugs suited for IPAs and ales, pint glasses for American Ales and IPAs, goblets for Belgian IPAs, Pilsner glasses for lagers, and Weizen glasses for ales and 'weizens'. Lastly, the pairing of beer with food can enhance the dining experience. Similar to wine, lighter beers compliment salads and fish, while darker beers are ideal with heavier meats. Regional beers also pair well with dishes from their area. Key flavor pairing includes caramel, cocoa, or coffee-flavored beers with smokey foods, hoppy beers with fatty foods and sweet and fruity beers with appetizers like cheese and bruschetta."},{"question":"Multi-choice question: Same meaning?

Explanation: Letting the cookie dough rest in the refrigerator for a day or two (up to 72 hours) improves the flavor as it allows the dough to hydrate properly and for the flavors to meld. The butter, sugar, and other ingredients have time to absorb the flavors of the extracts and spices. Moreover, chilling the dough controls the spread of the cookies during baking, resulting in a thicker, chewier texture.

Neilston Community Council forms the lowest tier of governance whose statutory role is to communicate local opinion to local and central government. It is one of ten community councils of the East Renfrewshire council area. East Renfrewshire Council, the unitary local authority for Neilston, is based at Giffnock, close to the border with the City of Glasgow, and is the executive, deliberative and legislative body responsible for local governance. The Scottish Parliament is responsible for devolved matters such as education, health and justice, while reserved matters are dealt with by the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The territory of what became Neilston anciently formed part of the Kingdom of Strathclyde. It has lain within the county boundaries of Renfrewshire from a very early time. Neilston emerged as a parish and administrative unit in 1170, and was for many years under the lordship of the Mures of Caldwell whose tombs are at the parish church. The parish was 8 miles (13 km) in length and by from 2 miles (3 km) to 4 miles (6 km) in breadth, encompassing six sevenths of what is now the town of Barrhead. Neilston Parish Council, a local body with limited power, was established in 1895, following the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1894, and abolished in 1930 following the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1929.

The cartoon's removal marks a significant moment in the ongoing struggle between satirical representation and personal censorship considerations. The cartoon, which came under fire from several fronts, depicted the Senator's daughters as dancing monkeys. This image was based on a Christmas-themed political advertisement released by Senator Cruz, wherein he included his two young daughters. Initially, the cartoon's publication sparked widespread debate over its content, dexterity, and ethical considerations. It is important to understand that the use of political figures in cartoons is a longstanding tradition, intended to serve as a form of criticism or satire. However, it is generally considered a strict no-no to involve their offspring in any such depictions, out of respect for their privacy and innocence. After careful steps of deliberation, The Washington Post decided to retract the cartoon. Understanding this decision can be facilitated by dissecting the paper's policies and the ethical considerations surrounding journalism. The Washington Post, like many esteemed news organizations, strictly adheres to the Society of Professional Journalists (SPJ) Code of Ethics that emphasizes: \\"Minimize Harm\\". This provision ascertains that journalists should show sensitivity towards the subjects of news coverage, particularly when children are involved. When considering these guidelines, the newspaper believed that the cartoon was an infringement on the Cruz daughters' privacy. Furthermore, it could potentially inflict unnecessary harm on minors who are not personally involved in their father's political pursuits. Given these strong ethical grounds, the decision to pull the cartoon was justified. Cruz's reaction to the cartoon was swift and forthright. He condemned the cartoon as inappropriate and insisted on his children's right to privacy. Critics argue that Cruz violated this privacy himself by including his daughters in his political advertisements. However, this does not justify the further invasion of their privacy, especially in a disparaging manner. It is essential to remember that, although satire plays an important role in political commentary, there is a fine line between constructive criticism and invasive insult. By removing the cartoon, The Washington Post demonstrated its commitment to ethical journalism while also sparking wider conversations about the boundaries of satire and the need to protect the rights of innocent parties involuntarily dragged into public scrutiny. In conclusion, the removal of this contentious cartoon is not just a solitary incident, but a reflection of the perpetual balancing act between free speech, satire and the integrity of journalism. It serves as a key example that the press, while free, seeks to be responsible and reliable in its representations, and underscores its commitment to prioritizing ethical decisions over potentially harmful content."},{"question":"This page was last modified 15:28, 29.

Or maybe Senator Marco Rubio’s opponents have gotten into his head. But on Monday, Mr. Rubio, the Florida Republican, who has been under relentless criticism for uttering his talking points over and over in Saturday’s presidential debate, had another repetitious lapse. Speaking to a crowd in Nashua, he was lamenting the decline in American family values. Then he lamented the decline in American values again. This is what he said verbatim, as his wife and four children looked on: “We are taking our message to families that are struggling to raise their children in the 21st century because, as you saw, Jeanette and I are raising our four children in the 21st century, and we know how hard it’s become to instill our values in our kids instead of the values they try to ram down our throats. “In the 21st century, it’s becoming harder than ever to instill in your children the values they teach in our homes and in our church instead of the values that they try to ram down our throats in the movies, in music, in popular culture.” Mr. Rubio appeared to notice his own echo: As he repeated the word “throats,” he caught himself, but proceeded to the end of his sentence nonetheless. ||||| The main story on Sunday's Last Week Tonight was about 911, a service we all take for granted. \\"We make roughly 240 million 911 calls each year, and the dispatchers do amazing work, talking people through childbirth, CPR, abductions, and home break-ins,\\" John Oliver said. \\"In fact, we're so accustomed to relying on them, we even call when we don't have an emergency.\\" He played some of those non-emergency calls, which ranged from absurd to cute. \\"We have a lot of faith in 911,\\" he added, \\"but the system can break down more than you think, and when it does, people can die as a result.\\" One big problem is that 911 dispatchers can't accurately tell your location if you are on a cellphone, for reasons nobody seems to be able to explain. That's not the only problem with 911 centers, though, Oliver said. \\"Depending on where you live, they may also be underfunded, understaffed, and full of outdated technology — which is fine, if you're describing a Radio Shack.\\" But you expect more from your emergency centers, and so he explained some reasons why \\"we have an antiquated, disjointed system populated by workers who are understandably sick of listening to people's butts.\\" ||||| [There was a video here] Whatever frantic hackathon Marco Rubio’s programmers conducted after Chris Christie demagnetized their creation on Saturday night seems only to have made the existing problems worse, as the junior senator from Florida stumbled through his stump speech on Monday. Maybe try turning it off and turning it back on again? Then again, when the words coming out of one’s vocabulator speech/sound system are so utterly meaningless, it would be difficult for all but the most advanced artificial intelligence to recall what even the most recent were. ||||| Marco Rubio repeats speech line amid attacks he's too scripted Skip Ad x Embed x Share Instead of giving Donald Trump a run for his money in the Republican Presidential race, Marco Rubio looks tired as he enters a critical day in New Hampshire. USA TODAY If Marco Rubio was hoping to allay concerns that he's too reliant on talking points, he probably didn't help his cause at a Monday rally in Nashua on the eve of New Hampshire's primary. It happened as Rubio launched into a discussion of the challenges parents face in the 21st century. \\"We are taking our message to families that are struggling to raise their children in the 21st century because, as you saw, Jeanette and I are raising our four children in the 21st century, and we know how hard it’s become to instill our values in our kids instead of the values they try to ram down our throats.\\" Then, rather than pivoting to his next point, the Florida senator circles back on the same theme, using nearly the exact same line right after he'd just uttered it. \\"In the 21st century, it’s becoming harder than ever to instill in your children the values they teach in our homes and in our church instead of the values that they try to ram down our throats in the movies, in music, in popular culture.\\" Rubio briefly pauses after the \\"our\\" in the second recitation of the \\"ram down our throats\\" phrase. Whether it's because he's recognized the repetition is unclear, though. This storyline became a prevailing theme of the 2016 campaign beginning with Saturday night's debate in Manchester, as New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie blasted Rubio as inexperienced and whose campaign was based on a \\"memorized 25-second speech.\\" Rubio played into the attack as he repeatedly during the exchange said some variation on this line: \\"This notion that Barack Obama doesn’t know what he’s doing is just not true. He knows exactly what he’s doing.\\" Rubio defended his repeated use of the line in interviews the next day, saying it was something he believed \\"passionately.\\" \\"It's one of the reasons why I'm not running for re-election to the Senate and I'm running for president,\\" he said Sunday on ABC's This Week. \\"This notion and this idea that somehow, oh, this is an accident — Obamacare was not an accident.\\" Recent New Hampshire polls show Rubio, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and former Florida governor Jeb Bush in a tight battle for second in New Hampshire and Christie a few points behind.

Movie title: Wanted Movie plot: In Chicago, 24-year-old Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy) works at a dead-end desk job with an overbearing boss, takes anti-anxiety medication for panic attacks, and has an unfaithful live-in girlfriend who cheats on him with his friend and colleague, Barry (Chris Pratt). One night at the pharmacy, Wesley is told by a woman named Fox (Angelina Jolie) that his recently murdered father was an assassin, and the killer, a man named Cross (Thomas Kretschmann), is now hunting him. Cross and Fox engage in a shoot-out with hi-tech guns. Wesley panics and runs into the parking lot followed by Cross who steals a truck and attempts to run Wesley down. Fox flips Wesley into her car and then calmly executes a spectacular escape. Wesley awakens in the headquarters of the Fraternity, a secret society of assassins. The group's leader, Sloan (Morgan Freeman), explains that Wesley's panic attacks are actually the untrained expression of a rare ability that allows Wesley's body to distribute massive amounts of adrenaline, granting superhuman strength, speed, and heightened perception. Sloan wants to teach him to control this ability, and to become an assassin and join their cause. Wesley initially panics and returns to his former life. The next morning, he discovers that his bank account now contains several million dollars. The discovery changes his outlook on life, and during a tirade from his boss, Wesley snaps and delivers a public diatribe. Afterward, he picks up a keyboard and during his exit, hits Barry's face with it. Fox arrives while Wesley is outside looking at newspaper headlines of the previous night's events. Wesley is trained for his new life and is soon shown the Loom of Fate, which gives the names of future targets through errors in the fabric.

The text describes a baseball game in which Mike Mussina, a pitcher for the New York Yankees, performed exceptionally well by pitching three-hit ball for eight innings and striking out a season-high 11 players. This outstanding performance contributed to the New York Yankees' victory over the Kansas City Royals with a score of 4-0 on a Tuesday night. Baseball is a widely-followed sport, particularly in the United States, where it is considered a national pastime. It involves two competing teams with nine players each, taking turns to bat and field. The objective of each team is to score more runs than their opponents by successfully striking a pitched ball, running around the bases, and reaching the home plate. In this specific game report, Mike Mussina's standout performance as a pitcher played a crucial role in the Yankees' win. In baseball, the pitcher is a defensive player whose primary task is to throw the ball from the pitching mound toward the catcher behind the home plate, with the intent of getting the opposing batters out. Achieving a high number of strikeouts, as Mussina did by striking out 11 players, can be particularly influential in determining the outcome of a game, as it prevents the opposing team from scoring runs.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose power stroke will push piston happens, how will it affect MORE power being generated by the engine. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","response":"To answer the question, let's consider the perturbation hypothesis and evaluate its effect on the overall process step-by-step. Perturbation hypothesis: If more power is generated during the power stroke when the piston is pushed down. 1. Fuel mixes with air: No direct effect on this step. The proportion of fuel and air can be adjusted to deliver more power, as long as it's within the engine's capabilities and tolerances. 2. Mix gets inducted into the cylinder: No direct effect, but to generate more power, a larger volume of the fuel-air mix might have to be inducted into the cylinder, which may require adjustments in the intake system. 3. Piston compresses the mix: No direct effect, although higher compression ratios could lead to more power generation due to increased efficiency in the combustion process. 4. Spark plug emits a spark that ignites the mix causing combustion: No direct effect. However, optimal ignition timing is critical for maximizing power. Too advanced or delayed ignition can reduce power output and efficiency. 5. Combustion gases expand: This is where the perturbation hypothesis takes effect. If the power stroke generates more power, it means the combustion gases expand with more force, leading to increased piston movement and subsequently more mechanical energy being produced. 6. Pushes piston during the power stroke: Directly affected by the perturbation hypothesis. A more powerful power stroke will push the piston down with greater force, converting more of the combustion energy into mechanical energy. 7. Exhaust valve opens to vent exhaust out tailpipe: No direct effect, but a more powerful combustion process might lead to increased exhaust gas pressure, potentially requiring adjustments in the exhaust system to maintain efficiency. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis does have a direct effect on the power stroke, which can lead to more power being generated by the engine. This can, in turn, affect other aspects of the engine operation (intake system, compression ratio, ignition timing, and exhaust system), which can be adjusted to optimize the overall performance and efficiency of the engine."},{"question":"Hipmunk, stylized as hipmunk, is a consumer-oriented online travel company headquartered in San Francisco, California.

Context: Women in the Middle Ages were officially required to be subordinate to some male, whether their father, husband, or other kinsman. Widows, who were often allowed much control over their own lives, were still restricted legally. Women's work generally consisted of household or other domestically inclined tasks. Peasant women were usually responsible for taking care of the household, child-care, as well as gardening and animal husbandry near the house. They could supplement the household income by spinning or brewing at home. At harvest-time, they were also expected to help with field-work. Townswomen, like peasant women, were responsible for the household, and could also engage in trade. What trades were open to women varied by country and period. Noblewomen were responsible for running a household, and could occasionally be expected to handle estates in the absence of male relatives, but they were usually restricted from participation in military or government affairs. The only role open to women in the Church was that of nuns, as they were unable to become priests. The answer to this question is:","response":"The church role that was only for men was the role of priests. Women were only allowed to become nuns in the Church during the Middle Ages."},{"question":"Definition: Given a sentence in Dutch, generate a new Dutch sentence by performing small changes on the sentence.

The movie turned out to be a major letdown, leaving the audience wanting more than what was presented. Step 6: Write the detailed explanation of negative aspects The plot for \\"Disaster on the Horizon\\" was underdeveloped and failed to provide a coherent narrative. The twists and turns seemed contrived and disjointed, making it difficult for viewers to follow and stay engaged. The main characters were unrelatable; their motives were unclear and their dialogue was cringe-worthy at times, which did not help in evoking any emotional connection. The acting performances by the lead actors fell flat, causing the audience to feel detached from their struggles and victories. Despite the potential for stunning visuals given the action-packed storyline, the special effects were subpar and often appeared as if they were on a budget, undermining the magnitude of the disasters depicted. Lastly, the cinematography failed to impress and lacked the sweeping, immersive shots that are usually expected from this genre.

One evening, Cleveland Heep, who became the superintendent of a Philadelphia apartment complex after his family was murdered, discovers Story, a naiad-like character (called a \\"Narf\\") from the Blue World, in his building's pool, immediately rescuing her from an attack by a \\"Scrunt\\", a grass-covered, wolf-like creature that hides by flattening its body against the turf. Story is here to find the Author, a specific writer whose book will better humanity's future. After questioning residents Farber, Bell, Dury, and five nameless smokers, Heep discovers the author, Vick Ran, who is writing The Cookbook, containing views and ideas so significant they will inspire a future President, a great Midwestern orator, to greatly change the world for the better. Vick meeting Story eliminates his fear and sharpens his inner voice, but he learns he will be assassinated because of the controversial nature of his ideas. The Tartutic, an invincible simian trio that serve as the Blue World's peacekeepers, have forbidden Story from being attacked while returning home. The Scrunt nonetheless does just that because Story is destined to be a great leader as well. To recover from her wounds and return safely, she will now need the help of a Symbolist, a Guardian, a Guild, and a Healer. Story believes Heep to be her Guardian; Heep asks Farber, a West Coast émigré turned film critic, to help him figure out the others' identities.

To qualify this, I’m not normally bothered by product placements. Sometimes they can even add to the scene. But this one was bad, really bad. Agent is busy hunting for baddies. Finishes questioning one naughty person who climbs in his Ford F150 and speeds off. So far, so good - it is the sort of vehicle a country-living billionaire bad-guy would drive. The agent then pulls out her phone and… Move to close up of phone screen showing Ford app already loaded (and screen unlocked!). Agent slowly moves finger to app. Does something. Pause as app does fancy graphics. Cut to car interior. Shot of dash, showing Ford logo on steering wheel. It’s bright blue - are they not normally grey or more subtle? Pause for a second… Zoom in on dash. Dash light up. Car starts. Show pretty dash lights for a second or so. Cut to agent Agent walks to car, gets in drives off. Lingering shot of rear of car. It was just so clumsy. Massive halt to the flow of the scene to show it. In most films you never see anyone starting cars, putting on seatbelts or similar unless this is part of the plot because it’s unnecessary and not interesting to watch. I sort of expected the remote start function to have some sort of relevance later… but no, it was totally ignored. Added to that: There was no password or security on her phone - and this is an agent investigating super secret stuff. If you don’t show her unlocking the phone, why show her lovingly prodding the app? They are as relevant. She unlocked and started the car while she was 20–30 paces away, on the grounds of a suspect ranch. Someone could easily have jumped in the car. Not very security conscious. Question: Why did the dash light up and the pretty dash lights showed for a second or so? === The answer to the above question is A:","response":"The dash lit up and the pretty dash lights showed for a second or so because the production team wanted to emphasize the remote start functionality of the Ford vehicle and its app. This product placement, though arguably poorly executed, aimed to showcase the brand and specific feature of the Ford F150 for the audience. By illuminating the dashboard and displaying the lights, it made it clear to the viewers that the agent was using the app to remotely start the car. It is important to note that remote start functions generally require a user to have their key fob nearby and might demand additional security measures such as a password. However, in this particular scene, the agent's phone seemingly lacks any security measures, and the remote start feature does not seem to be approached with adequate caution, especially considering the high-stakes nature of their work. In summary, while the scene was criticized for its clumsy and disruptive nature, the dash lighting up and the display of the pretty dash lights for a moment were meant to highlight the remote start function and the Ford brand for the audience."},{"question":"How do you say \\"Discount for groups and extend stay\\" in Spanish?","response":"In Spanish, you can say \\"Descuento para grupos y estancias prolongadas.\\" Here's the breakdown of the translation: - \\"Descuento\\" means \\"discount.\\" - \\"para\\" means \\"for.\\" - \\"grupos\\" means \\"groups.\\" - \\"y\\" means \\"and.\\" - \\"estancias\\" means \\"stays.\\" - \\"prolongadas\\" means \\"extended.\\" So the whole phrase means a discount for groups of people and for staying a longer time."},{"question":"Next question: when did the rule of east india company end in the subcontinent?","response":"To answer this question, I would perform the following steps: 1.

Now let's verify whether the sentence makes sense based on these interpretations.

He and Gugler devised a room architecturally grander than the previous two rooms, with more robust Georgian details: doors topped with substantial pediments, bookcases set into niches, a deep bracketed cornice, and a ceiling medallion of the Presidential Seal. Rather than a chandelier or ceiling fixture, the room is illuminated by light bulbs hidden within the cornice that \\"wash\\" the ceiling in light. In small ways, hints of Art Moderne can be seen, in the sconces flanking the windows and the representation of the eagle in the ceiling medallion. FDR and Gugler worked closely together, often over breakfast, with Gugler sketching the president's ideas. One notion resulting from these sketches that has become fixed in the layout of the room's furniture, is that of two high back chairs in front of the fireplace. The public sees this most often with the president seated on the left, and a visiting head of state on the right.

A:","response":"Title: Decent, but with some room for improvement - 3 Stars Review: As a long-time user of FrostWire (com.frostwire.android), I have always enjoyed using the app for various purposes, from downloading music to acquiring a wide range of files. However, my recent experience has been a mix of pleasant moments and instances of frustration. There are indeed some aspects that the developers should definitely look into so that they can bring back the seamless experience that attracted users like me. Thus, I'm giving this app a 3-star rating as a virtual pat on the back for its previous accomplishments and as an encouragement for a potential upgrade. One of the aspects that I appreciate about FrostWire is its user interface. The design is clean, making it easy to navigate through the app. I also found the search engine quite powerful and comprehensive, as it can fetch torrents from various sources in one go, which indeed saves users a lot of time. Additionally, the built-in media player has been very helpful as it allows me to enjoy the content without switching between apps. Despite these features, there are certain areas that require the developers' immediate attention. First and foremost, the app is plagued with an increasing number of advertisements. While I understand that ads are necessary for revenue generation, the frequency and intrusiveness of the ads impact the overall user experience negatively. Incorporating an ad-free subscription model could be an excellent alternative that would benefit both the users and developers. The app's stability and performance could also use some improvements. I have experienced occasional crashes and freezing, which often force me to restart the app. Also, the download speed is sometimes slow, mainly when multiple files are being downloaded simultaneously. It would greatly enhance the user experience if the developers could devote some time to optimizing the app's performance and ensure that it runs smoothly. Furthermore, the app could benefit from improvements in terms of its torrent search functionality. Offering more options to filter and sort search results, such as by upload date or popularity, would enable users to find the desired content much more efficiently. In conclusion, FrostWire (com.frostwire.android) is a decent app for acquiring and enjoying content, but its recent performance leaves much to be desired. With some improvements in the areas of advertisement and app stability, this app could easily become a go-to platform for users who require a comprehensive torrent client. For now, the app earns a 3-star rating, which might change following future updates that hopefully focus on the users' concerns."},{"question":"Math problem: Solve -242*g - 237*g - 2874 = 0 for g. What is the solution?","response":"To solve the equation -242*g - 237*g - 2874 = 0 for g, we can perform the following steps: Step 1: Combine like terms Since both -242*g and -237*g contain the variable g, we can combine these like terms. -242*g - 237*g = (-242 - 237) * g = -479 * g Now the equation becomes: -479 * g - 2874 = 0 Step 2: Add 2874 to both sides of the equation To isolate the g term, we need to get rid of the constant term, -2874. We do this by adding 2874 to both sides of the equation. -479 * g - 2874 + 2874 = 0 + 2874 This simplifies to: -479 * g = 2874 Step 3: Divide both sides by -479 To solve for g, we need to isolate g. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of g, which is -479. (-479 * g) / -479 = 2874 / -479 This simplifies to: g = -2874 / 479 Now we have found the solution for g: g ≈ -6"},{"question":"According to Welch, the band name \\"Florence + the Machine\\" had \\"started off as a private joke that got out of hand.

Long before that time there had come a reaction in his favour. The new consuls were well disposed towards him; Clodius's insolence had already disgusted Pompey; Caesar was absent with his legions in Gaul; his own friends, who had all along been active in his favour (though in his querulous mood he accused them of apathy) took advantage of the change, his generous rival Hortensius being amongst the most active; and all the frantic violence of Clodius and his party served only to delay for a while the return which they could not prevent. A motion for his recall was carried at last by an immense majority. Cicero had one remarkable ally on that occasion.

Is \\"From his readings, Nasser, who frequently spoke of \\"dignity, glory, and freedom\\" in his youth, became enchanted with the stories of national liberators and heroic conquerors; a military career became his chief priority.\\" the correct answer?","response":"While the statement you provided touches upon Gamal Abdel Nasser's personal motivations and aspirations, it does not thoroughly address his overarching goals as the President of Egypt and a prominent leader in the Arab and African worlds during the mid-20th century. Here, we will provide a more comprehensive response to the question: What was Nasser's goal? Gamal Abdel Nasser (1918-1970) was an Egyptian military officer and politician who served as the second President of Egypt from 1954 to 1970. He is most well-known for his revolutionary, nationalist, and Pan-Arabist policies that aimed to create a united and powerful Arab world free from Western influence and imperialism. His principal goals can be divided into the following categories: 1. National Independence and Sovereignty: Nasser's primary goal was to assert Egyptian sovereignty and strengthen its independence from colonial powers, particularly the UK. This included the removal of British troops from Egyptian territories, the nationalization of the Suez Canal, and ending foreign interference in Egypt's domestic affairs. 2. Economic Development and Modernization: Nasser focused on modernizing Egypt's economy and industries through state-led economic planning and massive infrastructure projects, such as the Aswan High Dam. His socialist policies aimed to redistribute wealth, reduce economic disparities, and create social justice in the nation. 3. Pan-Arabism and Regional Unity: Nasser was a staunch advocate of Arab unity to oppose Western imperialism and the creation of Israel. He saw himself as the leader of the Arab world, championing a unified political and social framework that would bring about an Arab renaissance. He sought to establish an Arab League and helped found the United Arab Republic, which briefly united Egypt and Syria as a single nation. 4. Neutralism and Non-Alignment: Nasser pursued a foreign policy of neutralism and non-alignment during the height of the Cold War, distancing Egypt from both the United States and the Soviet Union. He sought to maintain Egypt's sovereignty and strategic independence by avoiding entanglements in the ideological and political divisions that characterized the period. 5. Egyptian Military Strength: Nasser felt that a strong military was essential to safeguard Egypt's sovereignty and achieve his ambitious political goals. He focused on building up Egypt's armed forces, acquiring arms, and signing deals to increase military aid and cooperation from diverse global powers such as the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and even North Korea. In summary, Nasser's goals encapsulated a range of political, social, and economic objectives that aimed to empower Egypt and the wider Arab world. While the quote you provided highlights some aspects of Nasser's motivations, it only partially captures the essence of his more comprehensive, strategic, and far-reaching goals."},{"question":"This text is missing some spaces, please add them: Outputscovera12monthperiodandarepresentedintabularandgraphicalform.","response":"Here you go, I've added spaces to make it easier to read: Outputs cover a 12 month period and are presented in tabular and graphical form."},{"question":"Question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

Movie plot title: State of Play Movie plot: One night, a thief fleeing through Georgetown in Washington, D.C., is shot by a man carrying a briefcase. A pizza delivery man who witnesses the incident is also shot by the killer and is left in a coma. The following morning, a young woman is killed by a Washington Metro train in what seems to be suicide. Congressman Stephen Collins (Ben Affleck) is distraught to hear that the woman was Sonia Baker (Maria Thayer), a lead researcher on his staff. Collins, who has military experience, is leading an investigation into PointCorp, a private defense contractor with controversial operations involving mercenaries. Collins tells his former college roommate and old friend Cal McAffrey (Russell Crowe), an investigative reporter, that he had been having an affair with Sonia and that she had sent him a cheerful video message on the morning of her death, which he says is inconsistent and unusual behavior for someone about to commit suicide. Della Frye (Rachel McAdams), a reporter and blogger with the online division of Cal's newspaper and its editor, Cameron Lynne (Helen Mirren), discover that Sonia's death occurred in one of only three CCTV blind spots in the Metro camera system. Cal believes the shootings are related to Sonia's death and finds a link between the petty thief and a homeless girl who sought out Cal. The girl gives him photographs that the thief, a friend of hers, had stolen from the killer's briefcase. The photos show surveillance images of Sonia talking to a well-dressed man. Della visits the hospital where the pizza delivery man is regaining consciousness. While at his room, she witnesses the pizza delivery man shot dead by an unseen sniper. Later, she reviews CCTV footage and recognizes a man she saw at the hospital.

They will be fresh on the judge’s mind, so you need to address them as soon as possible. Make sure to save room in your time allowance to briefly review your other arguments. If you believe you have already won an argument or that the other team dropped one, you can briefly summarize those points at the end of the speech, reminding the judge that they go to you. Provide a one-sentence summary of what your opponent has said. Take it one argument at a time, starting with the one that is either easiest to defeat or the most crucial to your case. Say, “My opponent wants to allow one of the most common allergens into our nation’s schools, regardless of how many students are at risk.” Remind the judge what your argument is, positioning it as the clear better choice over your opponent. Choose your words carefully so that your argument appears to be the most reasonable choice. Say, “A safe educational environment is necessary for all students. We stopped sending students to schools that have asbestos; now we need to stop sending them to schools that have peanuts.” Present the breakdown with your argument framed as the best choice. Make the case seem simple to the judge, but say it in a way that makes it seem like picking the other side is preposterous. For example, “The choice is simple: We can protect students from life-threatening allergy attacks, or we can allow a few students to eat peanut butter for lunch.” This argument makes it seem like critical health emergencies are being pitted against something as trivial as a sandwich. Link your argument back to the topic, and provide evidence to back it up. Tell the judge why this evidence proves that your argument is superior to your opponent’s argument. This should take several sentences and possibly several minutes, depending on how many arguments you plan to address in your rebuttal. Never list off your reasons without offering an explanation. Your rebuttal depends on your explanation of the argument. Say, \\"My plan to remove peanut products from schools fulfills the resolution to provide a safe learning environment for kids by removing a known, common hazard. The evidence shows that the threat to allergic individuals is great and that every day the number of allergic students walking the hallways increases. The easiest, least expensive way to protect students is to ban peanut products. Please vote for safe schools by voting for me.\\" You and your opponent may both win arguments within the debate, but the judge still has to pick a winner. Voting issues are the arguments that could make or break a case, so showing that your argument is a voting issue could make the judge choose your side. For example, relevancy is often a good voting issue because if an argument is not relevant, then it is ineffective. If you show the judge that your opponent has no relevancy on the topic, then that could be a voting issue that goes your way. Say, \\"My opponent argued that we should ban sugary foods instead of peanut butter, but that is not relevant to my case. None of the evidence she provided about the dangers of sugary food should be considered.\\" Briefly summarize your arguments and the voting issues, then urge the judge to vote for you. Say, “The evidence I’ve provided proves that my opponent’s argument lacks relevancy and fails to address the topic. Additionally, my opponent has falsely assumed that peanuts must be ingested to be harmful, which is factually untrue. For these reasons, you should vote for my case.” If you don’t address an argument, it could go to the other team. Even if you are losing an argument, it’s best to offer a short concession in your rebuttal before moving on to your stronger arguments. If your opponent points out that you dropped an argument, it will look worse than if you concede it yourself. You should also watch for arguments that your opponent has dropped. Make sure to point this out to the judge and tell them that you have clearly won that point. Summary:","response":"In a debate, you should start with new arguments and address them quickly. When you speak, briefly review your other points and remind the judge of your argument. Choose your words carefully and make your argument seem like the best choice. Provide evidence to support your argument and explain why your side is better. Show the judge the other side's weaknesses, like if their argument is not relevant. Remember to talk about all points in the debate, even if you're losing.

Hundreds and maybe thousands will gather in Gary, Ind., the Jackson family hometown, to witness the unveiling of a statue to honor the pop icon; his mother Katherine is expected to attend. In Los Angeles fans will gather at Forest Lawn Memorial Park where the King of Pop is entombed. And in Detroit, where it all started, Motown announces today the opening of an exhibit, which will feature photographs from concert performances, television appearances, international tours and the TV cartoon series featuring the Jackson 5. Motown Museum curator Lina Stephens was online Friday, June 25, at Noon ET to talk about the early days of the Jackson 5, the emergence of Michael Jackson as a solo artist and stories of of their lives on the road and on the charts. Lina Stephens: Hello, I'm Lina Stephens, Chief Curator of the Motown Museum. Bethesda, Md.: How was Michael offstage..during the Motown years..his demeanor Lina Stephens: He was a shy, child, he enjoyed playing with his brothers. Los Angeles, Calif.: What would be your thoughts about either moving or having a second museum honoring Michael Jackson in Los Angeles? I ask this because it would be more accessible to more fans than would Gary, and Michael also had strong roots to southern California. Lina Stephens: I have heard that there is to be a Jackson 5 museum in their hometown of Gary, Indiana. However, I do think that Michael is a big enough talent to support a museum anywhere. Fairfax, Va.: Back in the day were the Jackson 5 enamored of the big Motown stars before they themselves became stars? What did the old guard at Motown think of the new young guys? Lina Stephens: They thought that they were talented kids. It was also the beginning of a new era for Motown since the company had moved to LA. Therefore, they were handled in a different manner than the older artists. Washington, D.C.: What will the Motown Museum be doing special today to commemorate the one-year anniversary of Michael's death? Lina Stephens: We have local television and radio stations doing live interviews; we have a Michael Jackson impersonator performing; and, we have the Jackson 5 exhibit in the Museum. We also have Michael Jackson items in the gift shop. Annapolis, Md.: Did Michael and his brothers ever come back for a visit to Motown in Detroit? Lina Stephens: Michael has been to the Museum several times. However, we have no record of his brothers visiting. Orlando, Fla.: What's your fondest memory of Michael? Lina Stephens: Michael Jackson had a way of capturing his audience with a flair that can not be justly described. It is clear that he was a very old soul. Washington, D.C.: What was the reaction at Motown and in Detroit when Michael Jackson had died? Lina Stephens: Pure and utter shock. We got the news by 5:20 p.m. (EST) and by 5:30 p.m., his fans had started to leave tributes in his honor on the steps of the Museum. Washington, D.C.: I just have a comment about Michael Jackson. To me he was a man who loved people and just was not accepted for what he was. He was kind and gentle and in this world that should be the norm but it's considered weird. He was one of if not the best entertainer of all time. His fans seem to see him in a better light than others who made fun of him and made his life a living hell. I don't think we will see anyone of his talent for years to come. Annandale, Va.: Who discovered the Jackson 5? Diana Ross, Gladys Knight? Suzanne de Passe? Lina Stephens: Actually, it was Bobby Taylor of the Vancouvers. Then, Gladys Knight had witnessed the Jackson 5 during a performance at the Apollo Theater in New York. What the?: Am guessing I was born/raised between the two \\"icons\\" of music -- Elvis and MJ -- and so do not quite \\"get\\" their importance. Given this is a MJ chat, what was his definitive contribution to music/culture? Lina Stephens: Michael Jackson achieved a 'first' in a lot of musical milestones: He was the youngest performer to have a #1 hit song and four consecutive #1 hit songs; his album, \\"Thriller\\" is still the best-selling LP of all time; he has had awards created in his name and likeness to award other performers; he was the first African-American artist to have his music videos played on MTV. He also changed the scope of how music videos are traditionally made in that, they were like movie productions that each told a story. His messages of peace and love in his songs and in his philanthropy were not fake. Therefore, millions of people could identify with him and embraced his philosophy as, it did not attack anyone's religious, political or moral views, but it just had a universal appeal. This is what I think makes Michael a phenomenon and why he has so many people, globally, that absolutely adored him. Perryville, Md.: Where the Jackson 5 \\"good boys\\" or were they misbehaved? I've heard stories that MJ was mischievous. Lina Stephens: Yes, all of the Jackson 5 members were good boys. And, yes, Michael liked to play practical jokes, but I think that was to keep things lighthearted on the road. West Palm, Fla: Michael was obviously an profoundly talented child, a prodigy of sorts, but did you have any idea he would become an entertainment icon? Lina Stephens: No, I don't think anyone had an idea that Michael would become all that he did. However, in his musical evolution, his iconic status seemed almost inevitable. Washington, D.C.: What happens at Motown now? Is any recording ever done there anymore? Or is it basically a museum? Lina Stephens: Motown is a Museum. Hollywood, Calif.: Do you remember where you were when MJ died? I do! There is a CNN/HLN host, Jane Velez -- who has covered MJ from the beginning. She should have some fantastic guests on her show \\"Issues\\" tonight. Apparently Michael's father has finally filed a lawsuit -- and I think he could win. So sad.... Lina Stephens: Yes. I had just left work and I had received a call from a local reporter with a confirmation of Michael's passing. That info was the last thing I expected to hear. Hopefully, the events that have occurred after his passing will come to a quick and just resolution and not blemish the memory of Michael. Baltimore, Md.: Did you have any indication back then that Michael Jackson might turn into the person he did and that his end would be tragic? Lina Stephens: Again, I'm not sure that anyone could have predicted the person that Michael would have become. It is very sad that his life would be cut so short. But, as we've seen in history, some of the brightest stars seem to leave us way too soon. Chicago, Ill.: Will anybody move into their home? Lina Stephens: If you are referring to the home in which Michael died, there is someone already occupying it. I believe it is Christian Audigier, the designer of the Ed Hardy line. Neverland Ranch? Not anytime soon. Washington, D.C. : What other Motown stars have come back to visit their old digs? I realize many are dying off and I'm saddened by that. Lina Stephens: Martha Reeves and the Vandellas, Gladys Knight and the Pips, Diana Ross, Mary Wilson, Joe Billingslea (of the Contours), Duke Fakir (last living original member of The Four Tops), Otis Williams (last living original member of The Temptations), just to name a few! They all come back home. :) Washington, D.C.: When the group recorded for Motown there was a special production team that produced their records which included hand-picked staff producers by Berry Gordy and Gordy himself. Why did he do this? Lina Stephens: The reason is that the hit songwriting of Holland-Dozier-Holland was gone, therefore, Mr. Gordy created The Corporation to create hit songs for the J5. India: Dear Prince, Paris and Blanket We're With You When you miss mj, we're with you in spirit, wondering how you feel, hoping you're coping, and getting a little better each day. We understand. We care. When you're grieving, we're beside you, in our hearts, in our thoughts, we're sending you sympathy, encouragement, affection, and strength to carry on with life. mj would want it that way. we all love you mansi arora Lina Stephens: Michael would appreciate your concern for his children. Lina Stephens: I'm sure Murray will not pay what we all think that he needs to pay. But, he will have to live with what he has done. Jacksonville, Fla.: In the bustle of people coming forward saying all kinds of things what would you like the world to know about Michael that it may not already know? Lina Stephens: I think, basically, we know all we need. I think we need to celebrate the positive contributions of the man. washingtonpost.com: This concludes our chat with Lina Stephens, curator at the Motown Museum. Thanks for joining in.

PHILADELPHIA—When Joan Leitner joins relatives next month for a potluck papal party to celebrate Pope Francis’ visit here, she will bring the pontiff himself—in the form of a block of un-holey mozzarella cheese shaped to resemble the Holy Father. “When I first saw it, I thought it might be a little irreverent,” said Ms. Leitner, a 58-year-old office worker from South Philadelphia. But when the pastor of her Catholic church offered his blessing, she said, “I was right with it—I’m in.” She preordered four pope cheeses at 20 apiece from the Pastificio Homemade Pasta Co., down the street from her home. If she were so inclined, Ms. Leitner could spread it on a slice of toast bearing the pope’s visage, using the Pope Toaster sold by an area marketer. She could wash it all down with any of several papal-themed beers from area breweries, with names like You Only Pope Once and Holy Wooder, a play on the distinctive Philly accent. And for the occasion, she could don one of many locally flavored T-shirts. Choices range from the understated—a shirt with a waving Pope Francis amid images of the Liberty Bell and the LOVE sculpture—to the edgy: “Yo Pontiff!” and “The Pope is My Homeboy.” Pope Francis’ six-day visit to Washington, New York and Philadelphia next month has generated huge excitement among Catholics and non-Catholics alike. The capitalists among them are pretty pumped, too. “The pope has transcended religion in some sense, transcended Catholicism, just like Donald Trump has transcended politics,” said Jonah Berger, associate professor of marketing at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School. That has only broadened the market for pope gear: “There’s some savvy marketers in South Philly saying, ‘Hey, if I put the pope on top of a Philly building, somebody will buy that.’ ” Plenty of merchandise specific to the pope’s Washington and New York stops is available or soon will be. But so far the widest array has emerged in Philadelphia, where more than a million people are expected to attend an outdoor Mass on Sept. 27. Some entrepreneurs have gone with “Rocky”-pope mashups, including one selling a bobblehead with the pope wearing boxing gloves and holding a cheesesteak. Pub owner Dennis Hewlett designed a T-shirt that repurposes an image of Rocky standing on the art museum steps, arm raised high. He added a mitre atop Rocky’s head and put a pint glass in his right hand. “Pope Rocks Philly 2015,” the shirt says. “I wanted it to be respectful,” said Mr. Hewlett, a Catholic whose bar, Pub on Passyunk East, has long gone by the acronym P.O.P.E. “I didn’t want to insult anybody. I thought it was just cool, innocent.” A spokesman for the Philadelphia archdiocese said as long as products aren’t offensive, “you have to kind of take it in stride.” He added, “I’m so glad to see the enthusiasm.” The more out-there items don’t sit well with some purveyors of Catholic merchandise. “It’s almost borderline disrespectful,” said Gregory DiCocco, operations director at St. Jude Shop, a family-run business in Havertown, Pa. Though St. Jude is selling a Pope Francis bobblehead, Mr. DiCocco likened it to a dignified statue and emphasized it depicts the pope in a blessing position. “It’s very popular” he said. In Washington, papal visit-themed mugs, T-shirts, rosaries and holy water bottles are for sale at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, where Pope Francis will celebrate Mass on Sept. 23. Retail director Amy Maloney predicted she would sell 100,000 of the 1 prayer cards that day alone. “It’s a little more solemn here,” she said of the traditional product line. “Still fun and exciting and fresh, but not quirky.” Aramark Corp., official retail vendor for the World Meeting of Families, a four-day conference in Philadelphia that precedes the pope’s visit, said prayer cards and a Holy Family icon pin are popular. But its top sellers are the pope bobblehead and a 10-inch plush doll. Such products are too much for Kevin Nelles, marketing director at Nelson Fine Art and Gifts in Steubenville, Ohio. “We don’t make bobbleheads, we don’t make face masks, we don’t make pope soap-on-a-rope,” he said. “That’s not our game. Our game is to use our talents in the service of the Lord.” Mr. Nelles, whose firm sells Pope Francis shirts, mugs, key chains, prayer cards, dog tags, magnets and more, said the staff does have a sense of humor. In 2002 they created a life-size “standee” cutout of a young Pope John Paul II from a photo of him sporting sunglasses and a beret. This year the company is selling two versions of a Pope Francis standee for 160. In both he wears the traditional white cassock, and in one flashes a thumbs-up. Avoiding insult was important for Debby Fireman when she came up with the Pope Toaster: “I spoke to some very Catholic people to make sure this was tasteful and not going to offend anyone.” Ms. Fireman, who runs a suburban Philadelphia marketing firm called Fireworks, sends her clients toasters with an insert that puts their corporate logo on toast, and a note saying, “Here’s a toast to working together this year.” “When I found out the pope was coming to Philadelphia,” she said, “I put two and two together and thought, wouldn’t it be amazing to put the pope’s image on toast?” Ms. Fireman wouldn’t reveal sales but said interest in the 69.95 toasters is strong. Brendan Sharkey, a 44-year-old insurance executive from Malvern, Pa., bought one and plans to try it out when his parents, devout Catholics, visit next month. It will be a breakfast surprise. “They’ll be having some toast and marmalade and enjoying the pope,” he said. Mr. Sharkey thinks his folks will be amused. Pope Francis is “a pope for the common man,” he said, with a good sense of humor. At Pastificio Homemade Pasta, co-owners Frank Sangiuliano and Anthony Messina have received about 50 pope cheese orders. Mr. Messina acknowledged it can be hard to make out Pope Francis’ face in the six-inch-tall blocks of mozzarella. The likeness is there, he said, but “it’s not like we’re Michelangelo making a sculpture.” Write to Scott Calvert at scott.calvert@wsj.com What are the most important parts of this text?","response":"The most important parts of this text are: 1.

He has an older brother, Randy Fowler, who is a limo driver and Rod Stewart impersonator in Boise, Idaho, and a sister, Julie Ann Fowler Keir, an office worker. His family relocated to Southern California when Spacey was four years old. Randy Fowler (from whom Spacey is estranged) has stated that their father, whom he described as a racist \\"Nazi supporter\\", was sexually and physically abusive, and that Spacey had shut down emotionally and become \\"very sly and smart\\" to avoid whippings. Spacey's first professional stage appearance was as a spear carrier in a New York Shakespeare Festival performance of Henry VI, Part 1 in 1981. The following year, he made his first Broadway appearance, as Oswald in a production of Henrik Ibsen's Ghosts, starring Liv Ullmann. Then he portrayed Philinte in Moliere's The Misanthrope. In 1984, he appeared in a production of David Rabe's Hurlyburly, in which he rotated through each of the male parts (he would later play Mickey in the film version). Next came Anton Chekhov's The Seagull. In 1986, he appeared in a production of Sleuth in a New Jersey dinner theatre. His prominence as a stage actor began in 1986, when he was cast opposite Jack Lemmon, Peter Gallagher and Bethel Leslie as Jamie, the eldest Tyrone son, in Jonathan Miller's lauded production of Eugene O'Neill's Long Day's Journey into Night. Lemmon in particular would become a mentor to him and was invited, along with Spacey's high school drama teacher, to be present when Spacey received his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1999. He made his first major television appearance in the second-season premiere of Crime Story, playing a Kennedy-esque American senator. Although his interest soon turned to film, Spacey remained actively involved in the live theater community. In 1991, he won a Tony Award for his portrayal of Uncle Louie in Neil Simon's Broadway hit Lost in Yonkers. Spacey's father was unconvinced that Spacey could make a career for himself as an actor, and did not change his mind until Spacey became well-known. Some of Spacey's early roles include a widowed eccentric millionaire on L.A. Law, the television miniseries The Murder of Mary Phagan (1988), opposite Lemmon, and the comedy See No Evil, Hear No Evil (1989). He earned a fan base after playing the criminally insane arms dealer Mel Profitt on the television series Wiseguy. He quickly developed a reputation as a character actor, and was cast in bigger roles, including one-half of a bickering Connecticut couple in the dark comedy film The Ref (1994), a malicious Hollywood studio boss in the satire Swimming with Sharks, and the malevolent office manager in the ensemble film Glengarry Glen Ross (1992), gaining him positive notices by critics. His performance as the enigmatic criminal Verbal Kint in 1995's The Usual Suspects won him the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Spacey appeared in the 1995 thriller film Seven, making a sudden entrance late in the film as the serial killer John Doe after going unmentioned in the film's advertisements and opening credits. His work in Seven, The Usual Suspects and Outbreak earned him Best Supporting Actor honors at the 1995 Society of Texas Film Critics Awards. He remarked in 2013: \\"I think people just like me evil for some reason. They want me to be a son of a bitch.\\" Spacey played an egomaniacal district attorney in A Time to Kill (1996), and founded Trigger Street Productions in 1997, with the purpose of producing and developing entertainment across various media. He made his directorial debut with the film Albino Alligator (1996). The film was a failure at the box office, grossing 339,379 with a budget of 6 million, but critics praised Spacey's direction. He also voiced Hopper in the animated film A Bug's Life (1998).

Instead, the information provided suggests that the 2005 film is an adaptation and part of an existing media franchise created by Douglas Adams. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy originated as a radio drama on BBC Radio 4 in 1978, which was written by Adams himself. Following the success of the radio series, the story was adapted into a series of novels, a television series, video games, and other formats. The 2005 film, directed by Garth Jennings and starring Martin Freeman, Sam Rockwell, Mos Def, Zooey Deschanel, and the voices of Stephen Fry and Alan Rickman, is based on the previously established work within the franchise. Adams' work, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, is a humorous science fiction story that follows an unwittingly lucky earthman named Arthur Dent, who is suddenly thrust into space on a wildly unpredictable adventure with a cast of eccentric characters, such as the two-headed, ex-hippie goverment president Zaphod Beeblebrox and depressed robot Marvin. Along the way, the characters encounter a helpful electronic guidebook called \\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,\\" which provides them insightful, yet hysterically unhelpful advice.

On hearing that her husband, the Emperor Claudius, has died in a storm at sea, Agrippina plots to secure the throne for Nero, her son by a previous marriage. Nero is unenthusiastic about this project, but consents to his mother's wishes (\\"Con saggio tuo consiglio\\"). Agrippina obtains the support of her two freedmen, Pallas and Narcissus, who hail Nero as the new Emperor before the Senate. With the Senate's assent, Agrippina and Nero begin to ascend the throne, but the ceremony is interrupted by the entrance of Claudius's servant Lesbus. He announces that his master is alive (\\"Allegrezza! Claudio giunge!\\"), saved from death by Otho, the commander of the army. Otho himself confirms this and reveals that Claudius has promised him the throne as a mark of gratitude. Agrippina is frustrated, until Otho secretly confides to her that he loves the beautiful Poppaea more than he desires the throne. Agrippina, aware that Claudius also loves Poppaea, sees a new opportunity of furthering her ambitions for Nero. She goes to Poppaea and tells her, falsely, that Otho has struck a bargain with Claudius whereby he, Otho, gains the throne but gives Poppaea to Claudius.

To provide a more detailed context and explanation, in June 1950, North Korea invaded South Korea, marking the beginning of the Korean War. The United Nations Security Council, led by the United States, authorized a military intervention in Korea with the objective to reclaim the territory occupied by North Korea and defend South Korea from further aggression. Within a month after the war began, North Korean forces had managed to conquer most of South Korea, pushing the Republic of Korea (ROK) Army and the United States Army to the southeastern tip of the Korean peninsula, an area known as the Pusan Perimeter. This successful push by the North Korean forces led to a dire situation for the UN Command, as they only controlled a small portion of the peninsula. The Pusan Perimeter was established by the United Nations Command, consisting mainly of American and ROK troops, as a defensive line against the invading North Korean forces. This perimeter was set up around the port city of Pusan (now Busan), which was strategically crucial for the UN Command due to its access to the sea, allowing for the arrival of supplies and reinforcement troops. The Pusan Perimeter was roughly bounded by the Nakdong River to the west and was characterized by a series of defensive positions designed to slow the advance of the enemy. The area enclosed by the Pusan Perimeter represented approximately 10% of the Korean peninsula's total land area, showcasing the desperate situation that the UN Command found itself in. The perimeter itself stretched about 140 miles (225 kilometers) from north to south and about 50 miles (80 kilometers) from east to west. During the months of August and September 1950, the UN Command managed to maintain control of the Pusan Perimeter, despite heavy assaults from North Korean forces. Meanwhile, the UN prepared a counteroffensive in the form of the Inchon Landing led by General Douglas MacArthur, which took place on September 15th, 1950. The success of this operation led to the weakening of the North Korean forces and the eventual recapture of Seoul, the South Korean capital, by the end of September 1950."},{"question":"If \\"Barefoot girl in a pink shirt tackles the football equipment on the field.\\", can we conclude \\"A girl is barefoot and tackles the football equipment outside.\\"?","response":"Yes, we can say that \\"A girl is barefoot and tackles the football equipment outside.\\" The first sentence tells us that the girl is not wearing any shoes (she's barefoot), she is wearing a pink shirt, and she is outside on the football field, where she tackles the football equipment.

After a session, the hair growth should start to become noticeable after about a week, but it's recommended to wait for around 3 to 6 weeks for the hair to grow long enough to be removed effectively during your next waxing appointment. The statement \\"Hot waxing utilizes Hot wax (as opposed to strip wax)\\" is indeed a reasonable answer to describe the type of wax being used, but it does not address how long a back waxing lasts. Hot wax is a type of waxing technique that involves spreading warm, thick wax directly onto the skin and allowing it to harden before being removed, gripping the hair with it. This method is sometimes less painful than strip wax, which is applied in a thin layer and then removed using a small cloth or paper strip. Both methods can achieve effective hair removal results."},{"question":"8 Aconteció que cuando ellos iban matando y quedé yo solo, me postré sobre mi rostro, y clamé diciendo: \\"¡Ah, Señor Jehová!, ¿destruirás a todo el resto de Israel derramando tu furor sobre Jerusalén?\\".

Follow these steps: 1. Move all 'i' terms to one side of the equation and constants (numbers) to the other side. - To do this, add 50*i to both sides of the equation, and subtract 900 from both sides. 2. Apply the operations: -50*i + 7747 = -217*i + 900 + 50*i + 50*i ------------------------- 7747 = -167*i + 900 7747 - 900 = -167*i ----------- 6847 = -167*i 3. Now, divide both sides by -167 to isolate 'i': 6847 / -167 = i 4. Simplify the expression: i ≈ -41 So the value of i is approximately -41."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Title: very bad replacement battery to buy.

The record's two singles—the title track and \\"Prove It\\"—both charted on the UK Top 30. Its commercial success in the UK was partly fueled by Nick Kent's rave two-page review of the album for NME.While holidaying in London after Marquee Moon's completion, Verlaine saw that Television had been put on NME's front cover and notified Elektra's press department, who encouraged the band to capitalize on their success there with a tour of the UK. However, the label had already organized for the band to perform on Peter Gabriel's American tour as a supporting act. Television played small theatres and some larger club venues, and received more mainstream exposure, but were not well received by Gabriel's middle-American progressive rock audiences, and found the tour unnerving.In May, Television embarked on a highly successful theatre tour of the UK with Blondie as their supporting act. They were enthusiastically received by audiences there, and Verlaine said it was refreshing to perform at large theatres after playing smaller clubs for four years. He nonetheless felt that Blondie did not suit their show because they were too different artistically, even though both groups had emerged from the music scene at CBGB. Blondie guitarist Chris Stein said that Television were \\"so competitive\\" and unaccommodating on the tour, and that they did not treat it like a joint effort. He recalled one show where \\"all our equipment was shoved up at the [Glasgow] Apollo and we had like three feet of room so that [Verlaine] could stand still in this vast space.\\"By the time of Television's return to the US, Elektra had given up on promoting Marquee Moon, which they dismissed as a commercial failure.

A:","response":"The name of the band that did not meet commercial expectations and broke up in 1978 is Television. The band released Marquee Moon, which despite its success in the United Kingdom, did not do as well in the United States. Though they had some mainstream exposure, the band was not well received by the middle-American progressive rock audiences. They were disheartened by their inability to find success in the American market, which led to Elektra, their label, dismissing Marquee Moon as a commercial failure and eventually led to the band's break up in 1978."},{"question":"Question: Where would you go if you want to get many types of goods? Options: - shop - supermarket - shop - mall - grocery store The answer is \\"supermarket\\" because","response":"a supermarket is a large self-service store selling foods and household goods. It is specifically designed to serve a wide variety of products including fresh produce, meat, dairy products, canned and packaged goods, household cleaners, pharmacy products and sometimes clothing. It's a one-stop-shop for nearly all household needs, making it the place you'd want to go to obtain many types of goods. Comparatively, general shops or grocery stores may not have as extensive a selection of goods. They might specialize in specific categories of items and not offer other products. Similarly, a mall has various types of goods, but they are spread across different stores.

Definitions: 1. Premise: A premise is a statement or proposition that is used as a basis for constructing an argument or drawing a conclusion. 2. Hypothesis: A hypothesis is a proposed explanation or assertion about a particular phenomenon that is to be tested through empirical evidence and scientific investigation. 3. Grantees: A grantee is an individual or organization that receives a grant, which is a financial aid, award, or privilege conferred by the government, a foundation, or another entity to accomplish a specific project, research, or purpose. Now let's analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis: Premise: Number of Grantees The premise refers to the number of grantees, which is a quantifiable measure. It indicates the count of individuals or organizations that have been awarded grants for their respective purposes or projects. Hypothesis: The amount of grantees The hypothesis is less clear in its meaning, as \\"amount\\" can be interpreted in multiple ways. If \\"amount\\" refers to the total number of grantees, then the hypothesis is essentially equivalent to the premise, meaning that it is a restatement in different words. In this case, the premise would support the hypothesis as true because they are expressing the same concept. Alternatively, if \\"amount\\" refers to the total monetary value of grants awarded to all the grantees, then the hypothesis is distinct from the premise and must be analyzed separately. While the number of grantees might give an indication of the overall distribution of grants, it does not provide information about the actual amount of funds awarded to each grantee. Therefore, in this case, the premise does not adequately support the hypothesis as true. Conclusion: Based on the analysis, it is essential to clarify the meaning of the hypothesis because the premise's ability to support it hinges on the interpretation of the term \\"amount.\\" If \\"amount\\" refers to the total number of grantees, the premise supports the hypothesis as true since they refer to the same concept. If \\"amount\\" refers to the total monetary value of grants awarded, the premise is not sufficient for confirming the hypothesis as true. It would then be necessary to gather additional information about the value of the grants to meaningfully evaluate the hypothesis."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Build a movie plot around this: How does Rukh die?

Price of crude leaps after false reports lane had already been closed off. Cheney calls for airstrike after Iran's refusal to hand back downed spy plane. Iranian fury over Congress calls to assassinate key members of their Revolutionary Guard.","response":"Title: Crisis Looms Over the World's Most Important Oil Shipping Lane The world's most important oil shipping lane, a four-mile-wide strait that serves as a crucial transit point for crude oil, has recently become the center of a growing international crisis. The situation escalated rapidly following false reports of the lane being closed off, triggering a dramatic leap in the price of crude oil. It further intensified with the former US Vice President Dick Cheney's call for an airstrike in response to Iran's refusal to return a downed spy plane. In a separate, yet related occurrence, Iranian officials expressed fury over calls from the US Congress to assassinate key members of their Revolutionary Guard. At the heart of this crisis lies the strategic Strait of Hormuz, through which an estimated 20 million barrels of oil pass every day. Accounting for roughly a third of the world's seaborne oil trade, this narrow strait serves as a critical lifeline for the global economy, connecting major oil producers in the Middle East to key markets across the world. The strait's importance makes it a potential flashpoint for tensions between Iran and Western powers, particularly the United States. The situation began spiraling out of control when false reports surfaced claiming that the strait had already been closed off. While the source of these reports remains unclear, the impact on global oil markets was immediate, with the price of crude oil skyrocketing. This further underscored the strait's vital role in maintaining the stability of world oil prices and highlighted the potential consequences of its disruption. Adding fuel to the fire, former US Vice President Dick Cheney called for an airstrike following Iran's refusal to hand back a downed American spy plane. This demand intensified the already strained relationship between the two nations, raising concerns that an armed conflict could potentially break out in the region. The United States has been known to maintain a strong military presence in the area, with naval forces constantly patrolling to ensure the free flow of oil through the shipping lane. In an alarming series of events, Iranian officials became increasingly furious over calls from some members of the US Congress to assassinate key figures in their Revolutionary Guard. This elite military force, responsible for defending the Iranian government and its interests at home and abroad, has long been regarded as a formidable power in the region. The call for their assassination not only infuriates Iranian officials but also risks further destabilizing the situation in the Strait of Hormuz. As tensions continue to rise, the stakes for all parties involved grow ever higher. With millions of barrels of oil passing through the Strait of Hormuz daily and economies around the world relying on its smooth operation, any disruption could have disastrous consequences for the global economy. Furthermore, an armed conflict in the region could lead to unforeseen and potentially catastrophic consequences, affecting not only the supply of oil but also global security and stability. In conclusion, the significance of the Strait of Hormuz in the global oil market makes this brewing crisis especially alarming. The recent developments, including false reports of lane closure, calls for airstrikes, and proposed assassinations, have heightened tensions and created an increasingly precarious situation in this vital area. As the world watches closely, it is essential for all involved parties to exercise caution, adopt diplomatic approaches, and work toward a peaceful resolution to protect and preserve the region's stability, as well as the world's interconnected economies."},{"question":"Write a title for this article: The number of people killed in Haiti by the devastating effects of Hurricane Matthew was reported to have risen to at least 478 on Friday as rescue workers and aid agencies battled to reach remote areas of the country, assess the damage and deliver relief. The hurricane, which hit Haiti on Tuesday, brought 145mph winds and torrential rains that destroyed more than 3,200 homes, displaced 15,000 people, ruined plantations and drowned animals. With communications still down in many of the worst-affected areas, it will take days before a definitive death toll can be established. The government puts the number of dead at 122, Radio Television Caraibes at 264, while Hervé Fourcand, a senator for the Sud department, said more than 300 people had died in the region and local officials speaking to Reuters put the toll at 478. The International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies estimates that more than one million Haitians have been affected, with hundreds of thousands of people in urgent need of humanitarian assistance. It has launched an appeal for £5.8m to help provide medical relief, shelter, water and sanitation over the next year. By Friday morning Matthew was battering Florida, becoming the first major hurricane threatening a direct hit on the United States in more than 10 years. Efforts to access the worst-affected areas of Haiti – including the Grand’Anse and Sud departments – were at first hampered by flooding, the collapse of communications networks and the destruction of a key bridge. As the weather cleared, Haitian authorities, the UN and national and international non-governmental organisations were getting a better idea of the scale of the destruction. The airport in the capital, Port-au-Prince, reopened for humanitarian flights and communication was being restored to cut-off areas. “Several dozen” were killed in the coastal town of Les Anglais in Sud Department, said Louis Paul Raphael, the central government’s representative in the region. Inland in nearby Chantal, the toll rose to 90 late in the evening, the town’s mayor said. Marie Alta Jean-Baptiste, the head of the country’s civil protection directorate, warned the death toll was likely to rise as emergency workers reached the stricken regions. “We do know there’s a lot of damage in the Grand’Anse, and we also know human life has been lost there,” she told the Associated Press. The port city of Les Cayes in Sud was also feared to have suffered badly. “The situation in Les Cayes is catastrophic, the city is flooded, you have trees lying in different places and you can barely move around,” its deputy mayor, Claudette Regis Delerme, told Reuters. The devastation in Haiti prompted authorities to postpone a presidential election scheduled for Sunday. Many victims were killed by falling trees, flying debris and swollen rivers when Matthew hit on Tuesday with winds of 145 miles per hour (230 kph). Most of the fatalities were in towns and fishing villages around the western end of Tiburon peninsula in Haiti’s south-west, a region of white Caribbean beaches and rivers backed by hills. The storm passed directly through the peninsula, driving the sea inland and flattening homes on Monday and Tuesday. Yvonne Helle, the UN Development Programme’s Haiti director, said while the lack of access made getting precise numbers impossible at this stage, the scale of the damage was clearly enormous. She said the UNDP had received reports that up to 98% of the city of Jérémie, in Grand’Anse department, had been destroyed. “It has an old historical centre and the old houses have been completely destroyed, ripped to shreds,” she said. “There are aerial pictures of the level destruction and it’s mind-boggling.” Aid groups struggled to communicate with people in Grand’Anse. The Catholic Relief Services (CRS) said agricultural fields in Jérémie had been “decimated”. “Houses in some areas like Jeremie and Dame Marie, which are difficult to access in normal times, are almost entirely destroyed and there are other areas where we don’t know how bad the damage was yet,” said CRS’s senior regional information officer for Latin America and the Caribbean, Robyn Fieser. “Shelter is a huge concern”. Fieser said there was also an immediate need for food and water in the southern port town of Les Cayes as there are “scores” of people in shelters without access to them. Enzo di Taranto, the head of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in Haiti, said the agency was also waiting for a report on the northwest, where it was impossible for aircraft to fly until Thursday. “There has also been some damage in the northwest, but we have no information whatsoever at this stage,” Taranto said. The UN described the hurricane as Haiti’s worst humanitarian crisis since the devastating earthquake six years ago. The rains and flooding have prompted fears of a surge in the cholera epidemic that has killed almost 10,000 people since the disease was accidentally introduced to Haiti by UN peacekeepers. Helle said the 50-60cm of rain that had fallen in some areas had caused graves to open and flooded pit latrines. “I think there are going to be serious, serious health concerns that will lead to communicable diseases related to water and sanitation,” she said. “I’m very worried about that and obviously we still have cholera and this will have an effect on our ability to control that.” Action Aid issued a similar warning. Its country director, Yolette Etienne, said that more than 500,000 men, women and children urgently needed food, clean drinking water and safe shelter. “Cholera is now a real danger as the already extremely poor sanitation system has been totally overwhelmed by flooding and heavy rainfall meaning the disease could spread quickly,” she said. “The situation is even worse in the shelters which often don’t even have enough toilet and are short of clean drinking water.” According to the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs, 15,263 people displaced by the hurricane have been placed in 152 shelters. World Vision, which managed to get staff out to remote areas by helicopter on Wednesday, said sanitation, food and looking after children were its main concerns. “Our teams are seeing a lot of damage, a lot of destruction and a lot of distress,” said Julie Lee, the charity’s spokeswoman in Haiti. “Our biggest worry is children, who are most vulnerable in these times of disasters. We’re also worried about the crop damage … right now, this hurricane is wiping out the Congo bean crop, the sorghum crop – basically staples of the Haitian diet.” The UN’s World Food Programme (WFP) and its children’s agency, Unicef, began mobilising resources. WFP arranged enough food supplies to feed 300,000 people for a month, with a further 34 tonnes of food on standby in Miami. Unicef was preparing life-saving aid for 10,000 people in Haiti, while World Vision is to provide water and sanitation help to 50,000 families. The UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation was poised to deliver seeds to affected areas to help farmers rebuild their livelihoods. US military personnel and nine helicopters were expected to arrive in Port-au-Prince over the coming days to help the relief effort. In Aquin, a town outside Les Cayes, people braved the mud to see what Matthew had done to their clapboard houses and tiny shops. Like many Haitians who were reluctant to leave their homes for fear of losing their personal belongings, Cenita Leconte had initially ignored official calls to evacuate as the hurricane hit. Eventually, however, she gave in – and in doing so probably saved her life. “We’ve lost everything we own,” Leconte, 75, told AP. “But it would have been our fault if we stayed here and died.” In 2010 a magnitude 7 earthquake wrecked Port-au-Prince, killing upward of 200,000 people. However, the impact of this tragedy has been felt most in remote but populated areas far from the capital’s support. “We have nothing left to survive on, all the crops have gone, all fruit trees are down, I don’t have a clue how this is going to be fixed,” said Marc Soniel Noel, the deputy mayor of Chantal.

It is an integral feature of photography, as it permits the user to control the amount of light that enters the camera and reaches the sensor or film. This control, in turn, affects the image's brightness, color, and sharpness. Shutter speed is commonly measured in seconds and fractions of a second. A faster shutter speed (e.g., 1/1000 of a second) allows less light to enter the camera, resulting in a sharper capture of fast-moving subjects and minimizing the chances of motion blur. Conversely, a slower shutter speed (e.g., 1/10 of a second) permits more light to enter the camera, which can create a desirable motion blur for artistic purposes or reveal greater detail in low-light conditions. In addition to its artistic benefits, manual shutter speed grants photographers the ability to capture specific types of photos that are difficult or impossible to achieve using automatic settings. Some examples of such situations include: 1. Action photography - Sports, wildlife, and other fast-moving subjects require the ability to freeze motion by using a faster shutter speed to obtain sharp images without blur. 2. Low-light photography - In dimly lit environments, slowing down the shutter speed can help to gather more light and capture details that would otherwise be lost in darkness. 3. Long exposure photography - Utilizing a slow shutter speed with a tripod can produce stunning images of star trails, light painting, or smooth water effects in a waterfall or river scene. 4. High dynamic range (HDR) photography - Combining multiple exposures at different shutter speeds can lead to images with a broader range of tonality, detail, and color in high-contrast scenes. When using manual shutter speed settings, it is essential to understand the relationship between shutter speed, aperture (f-stop), and ISO. Collectively known as the \\"exposure triangle,\\" these three factors work together to determine the overall exposure of a photograph. Balancing these parameters is crucial to achieve the desired artistic result while maintaining optimal image quality. In conclusion, using manual shutter speed empowers photographers to explore and create unique images by controlling the time the camera sensor or film is exposed to light. It enables them to capture captivating photos of various subjects and under different lighting conditions, which might be difficult to accomplish with automatic camera settings. Having a solid understanding of the exposure triangle allows photographers to achieve stunning results with complete creative control."},{"question":"Q: In this task, you are given a sentence in the English language and your task is to convert it into the Hindi language.

He has appeared on some of the Stones' classic albums including Let It Bleed, Sticky Fingers and Exile on Main St.. After Brian Jones was removed from The Rolling Stones in June 1969, John Mayall recommended Taylor to Mick Jagger. Taylor believed he was being called in to be a session musician at his first studio session with the Rolling Stones. An impressed Jagger and Keith Richards invited Taylor back the following day to continue rehearsing and recording with the band. He overdubbed guitar on \\"Country Honk\\" and \\"Live With Me\\" for the album Let It Bleed, and on the single \\"Honky Tonk Women\\" released in the UK on 4 July 1969. Taylor's onstage debut as a Rolling Stone, at the age of 20, was the free concert in Hyde Park, London on 5 July 1969. An estimated quarter of a million people attended for a show that turned into a tribute to Brian Jones, who had died two days before the concert. The Rolling Stones' 1971 release Sticky Fingers included \\"Sway\\" and \\"Moonlight Mile\\" which Taylor and Jagger had completed in Richards' absence.

The term reniform is derived from the Latin word \\"renes,\\" which means \\"kidneys.\\" This distinctive shape is characterized by a smooth, rounded exterior and an inward curving indent on one side, which gives it an overall appearance of a kidney's bilateral symmetry. Reniform shapes can be found in various natural and man-made objects. Some common examples of objects with reniform shapes are: 1. Kidneys: The most obvious example is the human kidney. Kidneys are essential organs that play a crucial role in filtering waste products from the blood and maintaining the body's electrolyte balance. 2. Leaves: Many plant species, such as those from the genus Tropaeolum, have reniform-shaped leaves. The curved outline of their leaves serves various purposes, such as maximizing sunlight exposure or channeling water towards the plant's stem. 3. Pools: Some swimming pools are designed in a kidney shape to add visual interest and provide a more organic, natural look to their surroundings. The shape's irregular curves also enable swimmers to enjoy various depths and poolside spaces. 4. Organic Elements in Design and Architecture: In modern design and architecture, reniform shapes are often incorporated to create a sense of fluidity, softness, and natural aesthetics. For instance, furniture pieces like coffee tables, mirrors, and chairs may incorporate reniform shapes, as may certain architectural designs. 5. Minerals and Gems: Some minerals and gems like agate, jasper, or nephrite can have polished, reniform surfaces, often referred to as \\"kidney-shaped.\\" These shapes occur either naturally or through human manipulation during lapidary processing. 6. Ponds and Water Features: Landscape designers sometimes utilize reniform shapes for ponds, fountains, and other water features to imbue a natural and serene atmosphere in gardens or outdoor spaces. In summary, if an object is described as reniform, it means that its shape is similar to that of a human kidney, with a round, convex exterior and a concave indent on one side. The reniform shape is found in various natural and man-made objects, including leaves, pools, minerals, and elements of design or architecture."},{"question":"Question: She was taken aback by his real personality, what were other past boyfriends like to her?

Context: It will come as no surprise to those working in the UK’s higher education (HE) sector that universities are currently suffused with anxiety. The University and College Union (UCU) has recently been in dispute with employers over proposed changes to the USS pension scheme, and the most sustained period of industrial action in the sector’s history has highlighted the fears staff have for the security of their futures post-retirement. Such unprecedented strike action needs to be situated within the wider context of a public sector undergoing transformation: while the concept remains contested, the influence of “neoliberal” ideas on universities can most clearly be seen in Success as a Knowledge Economy – the government white paper that preceded the 2017 Higher Education and Research Act – which states: “Competition between providers in any market incentivises them to raise their game, offering consumers a greater choice of more innovative and better quality products and services at lower cost. Higher education is no exception.” Yet what might “raising our game” mean for academic staff? The university has been described as an “anxiety machine”: the creeping marketisation of the sector along with pressure to recruit students (now “consumers”), increasing managerialism, and the implementation of processes of audit – such as the REF and TEF – to evaluate performance have arguably contributed to a progressively anxious landscape in which to labour. In 2016/17, 34% of academic staff were employed on fixed-term contracts – a figure likely to be disputed by the UCU, since in 2016 it estimated the extent of casualisation in the sector to be closer to 54% once atypical contracts had been taken into consideration. In addition to pressures facing many staff in universities – such as time-management, meeting growing employer expectations, and the evaluation of performance – “casualised” contracts present particular challenges for those facing employment uncertainty: in a material sense, this can be a case of keeping up with...

Several states have sued the Trump administration over its executive order that temporarily blocks immigration and travel from seven countries in the Middle East and Africa. A federal trial court judge in Seattle ruled Feb. 3 that the federal government could not enforce the executive order while the case is pending. So lawyers for the administration appealed that decision to the 9th Circuit, which hears cases from most of the western United States and Alaska and Hawaii. On Feb. 9, a panel of three judges ruled unanimously to affirm the Seattle judge’s decision. (The court didn’t rule on whether the executive order is legal. That will happen later.) It’s possible the administration will try to appeal their case again, this time to the Supreme Court. Right after the judges handed down their decision, Trump tweeted, \\"SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!\\" As Hannity noted, the 9th Circuit has a reputation for being liberal. But we wondered if he was correct when he said the Supreme Court overturns more cases from the 9th Circuit than any other appeals court in the country — the implication being that the 9th Circuit is out of step with the Supreme Court. In our research, we found that the 9th Circuit has a higher-than-average reversal rate, but not the highest. Additionally, experts told us that counting reversals doesn’t necessarily say much about the quality or substance of the 9th Circuit’s work. The numbers To evaluate this claim, we turned to SCOTUSBlog’s Supreme Court statistics archive, specifically their Circuit Scorecards, which track how often the Supreme Court justices agree or disagree with the lower court decisions. The Supreme Court hears cases from the 50 state courts and 13 federal appeals courts, known as circuit courts. The cases that the Supreme Court chooses to take on are often disputed among the lower courts, complex, and problematic, so there’s a reasonable chance that the Supreme Court will decide that the lower court’s decision was wrong. In fact, the Supreme Court reversed about 70 percent of cases it took between 2010-15. Among cases it reviewed from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, it reversed about 79 percent. The 9th Circuit’s reversal rate is higher than average, but it’s not the absolute highest among the circuit courts. That distinction goes to the 6th Circuit, which serves Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky and Tennessee, with an 87 percent average between 2010-15. The 9th Circuit is in third place. 6th Circuit - 87 percent; 11th Circuit - 85 percent; 9th Circuit - 79 percent; 3rd Circuit - 78 percent; 2nd Circuit and Federal Circuit - 68 percent; 8th Circuit - 67 percent; 5th Circuit - 66 percent; 7th Circuit - 48 percent; DC Circuit - 45 percent; 1st Circuit and 4th Circuit - 43 percent; 10th Circuit - 42 percent. We also found that the 9th Circuit never had the highest reversal rate in any individual term between 2004-15. (That’s the farthest back we could go.) A spokesperson for Hannity pointed us to a 2014 article in National Review titled, \\"Ninth Circuit Leading the Pack for ‘Most Reversed.’ \\" But the evidence presented in the article does not support the headline. So Hannity’s claim that the 9th Circuit is the \\"most overturned court in the country\\" is incorrect. The Supreme Court only hears a handful of cases from each circuit each year, so the rate of reversal is highly variable, said Jonah Gelbach, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania and a statistician. In 2014, for instance, the 2nd Circuit had a reversal rate of 100 percent, which sounds pretty bad until you find out that the Supreme Court only heard one case from the 2nd Circuit that entire season. The 9th Circuit is by far the largest circuit. In the 12 months leading up to March, 31, 2015, just under 12,000 cases were filed in the 9th Circuit — more than 4,000 more than the next-largest circuit, the 5th Circuit. Despite that gigantic docket, the Supreme Court heard just 11 cases from the 9th Circuit in 2015, reversing eight. This means the Supreme Court generally reverses far less than 1 percent of all the cases the 9th Circuit (and other circuits) decide. \\"Given the small numbers of cases involved, it can be difficult to draw any serious conclusions from such statistics about the quality of the courts involved,\\" Gelbach said. \\"Having said that, the 9th Circuit does seem to consistently have a high reversal rate over time.\\" It’s possible that the sheer size of the 9th Circuit, as well as some of its procedures, cause it to produce more \\"outlier decisions,\\" which are cases the Supreme Court always reverses, than other circuits — leading to a higher reversal rate, said University of Pennsylvania law professor Kermit Roosevelt. Roosevelt said there might have been a time in the past when the 9th Circuit was considerably more liberal than the Supreme Court, stemming from the fact that Democratic President Jimmy Carter didn’t get the opportunity to appoint a Supreme Court justice, though he did appoint several judges to the 9th Circuit. Today, the 9th Circuit might still have the highest number of Democratic appointees of any appeals court, but there’s been enough turnover in the past few decades that it’s not as much of an outlier, Roosevelt said. Our ruling Hannity said the 9th Circuit is \\"the most overturned court in the country.\\" While the 9th Circuit has a higher than average reversal rate among cases it sends to the Supreme Court, it has not had the highest rate since at least 2004 (the oldest data point we could find). Even if it did, experts told us that the massive size of the 9th Circuit compared to the handful of cases it sends to the Supreme Court every year make reversal rates an imperfect measure of the quality of the 9th Circuit’s decisions. More broadly, experts say this statistic is a poor way of comparing courts. We rate Hannity’s claim False. ||||| President Donald Trump also suggested that the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals is biased against him and his policies. | Getty Trump attacks judiciary for blocking order on sanctuary cities President Donald Trump accused the “outrageous” 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on Wednesday of being “semi-automatic” with rulings against his administration. “Everybody immediately runs to the 9th Circuit,” Trump complained in an interview with the Washington Examiner. “And we have a big country. We have lots of other locations. But they immediately run to the 9th Circuit. Because they know that's like, semi-automatic.” Story Continued Below Trump said he is “absolutely” considering proposals to split up the three-judge panel, insisting that “there are many people that want to break up the 9th Circuit.” Earlier on Wednesday, the president renewed his attacks on the nation’s judiciary, blaming the 9th Circuit for the ruling by a federal district court judge that blocked his administration’s move to deny federal funding to so-called sanctuary cities. “First the Ninth Circuit rules against the ban & now it hits again on sanctuary cities-both ridiculous rulings. See you in the Supreme Court!” Trump tweeted Wednesday morning. “I’m never surprised by the 9th Circuit,” Trump told a reporter later Wednesday during a signing ceremony for an unrelated executive order. “As I said: We’ll see them in the Supreme Court.” Judge William Orrick, who handed down Tuesday’s injunction, is a U.S. district court judge based in San Francisco and does not sit on the 9th Circuit, although that is the next court that would hear the case should the Trump administration appeal the decision. Some observers consider all federals courts in the states where the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals has jurisdiction to be collectively the 9th Circuit. he ruling was panned by the White House, which released a statement from press secretary Sean Spicer’s office declaring that “today, the rule of law suffered another blow, as an unelected judge unilaterally rewrote immigration policy for our Nation.” “This case is yet one more example of egregious overreach by a single, unelected district judge,” the White House statement continued. “Today’s ruling undermines faith in our legal system and raises serious questions about circuit shopping.” Before Wednesday’s tweets, Trump’s most recent tirade against the judicial branch was also targeted at the 9th Circuit, which upheld a district court’s stay that blocked his executive order banning immigrants from certain Muslim-majority nations from entering the U.S. The 9th Circuit has yet to hear arguments on Trump's revised travel ban. Those arguments are slated for May 15. Breaking News Alerts Get breaking news when it happens — in your inbox.

Trump also suggested that the 9th Circuit is biased against him and his policies, tweeting in subsequent posts that “Out of our very big country, with many choices, does everyone notice that both the ‘ban’ case and now the ‘sanctuary’ case is brought in the Ninth Circuit, which has a terrible record of being overturned (close to 80%). They used to call this ‘judge shopping!’ Messy system.” In an interview Wednesday morning on Fox News, Spicer was critical of the federal district judge's ruling to block Trump’s sanctuary cities order. By basing his decision in part on rhetoric from Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Spicer said, Orrick had stepped outside the bounds of what should have been considered. “The idea that any judge or any jurisdiction would not be wanting to help make sure that we can protect our citizens runs counter to, frankly, what we should all be looking for,” Spicer said. “Do you think the 9th Circuit’s got it in for the White House?\\" Fox News anchor Bill Hemmer asked Spicer. “Well, I don’t know that they have it in for the White House,” he replied. “They have a horrible record of interpreting that law. And that’s just a fact.” Nolan D.

He called the administration's position on the order \\"schizophrenic.\\" (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) When a long list of comments from President Trump, his surrogates and his spokesmen shows up in a federal court ruling, it’s fair to say it can only mean one thing: a constitutionally questionable executive order is about to get a judicial smackdown. That was true in March, when federal judges in Hawaii and Maryland suspended Trump’s travel ban, saying the administration had showed a clear animus toward Muslims, despite government lawyers’ claims to the contrary. And it was true Tuesday, when U.S. District Judge William H. Orrick of California temporarily froze Trump’s executive order on sanctuary cities, ruling that a case could be made that it violated the Constitution. [Trump blasts federal court ruling that blocks his ‘sanctuary city’ order] Trump’s order, signed Jan. 25, threatens to cut off funding from local governments that refuse to cooperate with immigration authorities. Santa Clara County and the city of San Francisco challenged the order, arguing, among other things, that the president doesn’t have the power to withhold federal money. Orrick found the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on all their claims, as The Washington Post reported. San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera praised the ruling by a U.S. District judge in San Francisco that blocked President Trump's executive order that sought to withhold federal funds from so-called sanctuary cities. (Reuters) The 49-page ruling focused largely on an all-too-familiar theme for the young administration: the consequences of bragging and bluster by Trump and top administration officials. Just like the judges who ruled on Trump’s travel ban, Orrick homed in on the vast discrepancies between what government lawyers defending the sanctuary cities order argued in court and what administration officials said about it in public. In court, the government tried to make the case that the order doesn’t actually do anything, at least not at the moment, because the administration has yet to define what exactly a sanctuary city is or threaten any particular jurisdiction with a loss of funds. It was their way of convincing the judge to toss out the lawsuit on the grounds that no city or county has yet suffered any harm. But in public, administration officials boasted about how the order would force sanctuary cities to their knees, singling out particular places. The order described in court as essentially an empty shell was portrayed in news conferences, briefings and television interviews as a powerful tool to protect the public from dangerous undocumented immigrants being shielded by wayward cities and counties. It was that gap that disturbed Orrick. In his ruling, the judge pointed to a February interview between Trump and former Fox News host Bill O’Reilly, in which Trump called the order “a weapon” to use against cities that tried to defy his immigration policies. “I don’t want to defund anybody. I want to give them the money they need to properly operate as a city or a state,” Trump said in the interview. “If they’re going to have sanctuary cities, we may have to do that. Certainly that would be a weapon.” The judge also cited news conferences in which Attorney General Jeff Sessions threatened to “claw back any funds” awarded to a city that violated the order. And the judge brought up remarks by White House press secretary Sean Spicer, who said in no uncertain terms that “counties and other institutions that remain sanctuary cities don’t get federal government funding.” On top of that, the judge said, Trump and Sessions had repeatedly held up San Francisco as an example of the supposed dangers sanctuary cities pose to ordinary, law-abiding citizens because of the killing there of Kathryn Steinle in July 2015, allegedly by a man deported five times. It was more than enough to show the intent of Trump’s order, Orrick wrote. But government lawyers sang an entirely different tune. According to Orrick, the government contended that the order was merely an example of Trump using the “bully pulpit” to “highlight a changed approach to immigration enforcement” — in essence, something much more benign than what Trump and company had described. The argument was lost on the judge, who ridiculed the government’s position as “schizophrenic.” “If there was doubt about the scope of the Order, the President and Attorney General have erased it with their public comments,” Orrick wrote. “Is the Order merely a rhetorical device,” he added, “or a ‘weapon’ to defund the Counties and those who have implemented a different law enforcement strategy than the Government currently believes is desirable?” The ruling continued: “The statements of the President, his press secretary and the Attorney General belie the Government’s argument in the briefing that the Order does not change the law. They have repeatedly indicated an intent to defund sanctuary jurisdictions in compliance with the Executive Order.” If all that sounds familiar, it’s because other federal judges reached similar conclusions about the administration’s credibility in lawsuits challenging Trump’s travel ban. In March, judges in Hawaii and Maryland issued rulings that temporarily halted parts of the executive order, which seeks to bar new visas for people from six Muslim-majority countries. In both cases, judges found that what government lawyers said in court about the ban being religiously neutral didn’t line up with remarks from Trump and some of his closest advisers, who had previously called for a “Muslim ban.” The administration’s intent was obvious, the judges said. “Plainly-worded” statements by Trump and his surrogates “betrayed the Executive Order’s stated secular purpose,” one judge wrote, using language strikingly similar to Orrick’s. As long as the administration continues to issue broad executive orders, it should expect to have statements by its top officials to come up in court, said Jayashri Srikantiah, an immigration law professor at Stanford Law School. “It’s hard to imagine not seeing more of these kinds of legal challenges,” she said. “The president is the president and the attorney general is the attorney general, and we have to take seriously what they say about an executive order with such sweeping implications.” President Trump has threatened to go after sanctuary cities, which provide protections for illegal immigrants. Chicago announced on Aug. 6 they plan to sue the Trump administration over threats to withhold public safety grant money from sanctuary cities. This is how other state and local governments with sanctuary policies have responded. (Claritza Jimenez/The Washington Post) The Trump administration has vowed to fight rulings on the travel ban and sanctuary cities. In a series of tweets Wednesday, Trump vowed that the White House was ready to bring the case to the Supreme Court and blasted the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which was part of legal decisions blocking Trump’s travel restrictions on several Muslim-majority countries. “First the Ninth Circuit rules against the ban & now it hits again on sanctuary cities — both ridiculous rulings. See you in the Supreme Court!” Trump wrote. Orrick is a federal district judge in San Francisco. He does not serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, although those judges would review his decisions. In an earlier statement, the White House took aim at Orrick, saying his ruling “unilaterally rewrote immigration policy for our nation.” “This case is yet one more example of egregious overreach by a single, unelected district judge,” the White House statement said. The ruling puts the executive order on hold while the judge weighs the full evidence in the case. At issue is whether the order violates the Constitution by giving the president spending powers reserved for Congress and by infringing on state sovereignty by “commandeering” local officials to enforce federal immigration laws.

It was based on a ruling party, the Fatherland Front (\\"Vaterländische Front\\") and the Heimwehr (Home Guard) paramilitary militia. Leaders were Engelbert Dollfuss and, after Dollfuss's assassination, Kurt Schuschnigg, who were previously politicians of the Christian Social Party, which was quickly integrated into the new movement. - Engelbert Dollfuss (; October 4, 1892 July 25, 1934) was an Austrian Christian Social and Patriotic Front statesman. Having served as Minister for Forests and Agriculture, he ascended to Federal Chancellor in 1932 in the midst of a crisis for the conservative government. In early 1933, he shut down parliament, banned the Austrian Nazi party and assumed dictatorial powers. Suppressing the Socialist movement in February 1934, he cemented the rule of austrofascism through the authoritarian \\"First of May Constitution\\". Dollfuss was assassinated as part of a failed coup attempt by Nazi agents in 1934. His successor Kurt Schuschnigg maintained the regime until Adolf Hitlers annexation of Austria in 1938. - The Kingdom of Italy was a state founded from 1861, when King Victor Emmanuel II of Sardinia was proclaimed King of Italy, to 1946, when a constitutional referendum led civil discontent to abandon the monarchy and form the Italian Republic. The state was founded as a result of the unification of Italy under the influence of the Kingdom of Sardinia, which can be considered its legal predecessor state. - The Heimwehr (\\"Home Guard\\") or sometimes Heimatschutz (\\"Homeland Protection\\") were a nationalist, initially paramilitary group operating within Austria during the 1920s and 1930s; they were similar in methods, organisation, and ideology to Germany's Freikorps. Although opposed to parliamentary democracy, the Heimwehr maintained a political wing known as the Heimatblock, which cooperated with Engelbert Dollfuss' conservative government. In 1936, the Heimwehr was absorbed into the Fatherland Front by decree of Chancellor Kurt von Schuschnigg and replaced by a militia supposedly less inclined towards uproar against the regime, the \\"Frontmiliz\\". - Italian Fascism, also known simply as Fascism, is the original fascist ideology, as developed in Italy. The ideology is associated with the National Fascist Party, which under Benito Mussolini ruled the Kingdom of Italy from 1922 until 1943, the Republican Fascist Party that ruled the Italian Social Republic from 1943 to 1945, the post-war Italian Social Movement and subsequent Italian neo-fascist movements. - Nazi Germany is the common English name for the period in German history from 1933 to 1945, when Germany was governed by a dictatorship under the control of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party (NSDAP). Under Hitler's rule, Germany was transformed into a fascist state in which the Nazi Party took totalitarian control over nearly all aspects of life. The official name of the state was \\"Deutsches Reich\\" from 1933 to 1943 and \\"Großdeutsches Reich\\" (\\"Greater German Reich\\") from 1943 to 1945. The period is also known under the names the Third Reich and the National Socialist Period (abbreviated as \\"NS-Zeit\\"). The Nazi regime came to an end after the Allied Powers defeated Germany in May 1945, ending World War II in Europe. - Fascism is a form of radical authoritarian nationalism that came to prominence in early 20th-century Europe. The first fascist movements emerged in Italy during World War I, before it spread to other European countries. Opposed to liberalism, Marxism, and anarchism, fascism is usually placed on the far-right within the traditional leftright spectrum. - The National Fascist Party (\\"Partito Nazionale Fascista\\", PNF) was an Italian political party, created by Benito Mussolini as the political expression of fascism (previously represented by groups known as \\"Fasci\\"). The party ruled Italy from 1922 when Fascists took power with the March on Rome, to 1943, when Mussolini was deposed by the Grand Council of Fascism. - Benito Amilcare Andrea Mussolini (29 July 1883 28 April 1945) was an Italian politician, journalist, and leader of the National Fascist Party (\\"Partito Nazionale Fascista\\"; PNF), ruling the country as Prime Minister from 1922 to 1943. He ruled constitutionally until 1925, when he dropped all pretense of democracy and set up a legal dictatorship. Known as \\"Il Duce\\" (The Leader), Mussolini was the founder of Italian Fascism. - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state. - Kurt Alois Josef Johann Schuschnigg (14 December 1897 18 November 1977) was Chancellor of the Federal State of Austria from the 1934 assassination of his predecessor Engelbert Dollfuss until the 1938 \\"Anschluss\\" with Nazi Germany. He was opposed to Hitler's ambitions to absorb Austria into the Third Reich. - Adolf Hitler (20 April 1889 30 April 1945) was a German politician who was the leader of the Nazi Party (\\"Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei\\"; NSDAP), Chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945, and Führer (\\"Leader\\") of Nazi Germany from 1934 to 1945. As dictator of the German Reich, he initiated World War II in Europe with the invasion of Poland in September 1939 and was central to the Holocaust. - The Italian Social Republic, informally known as the Republic of Salò, was a state with limited recognition that was created during the later part of World War II (in existence from 1943 until 1945). Mussolini had originally intended to call his new republic the Italian Socialist Republic. It was the second and last incarnation of the Fascist Italian state and was led by Duce Benito Mussolini and his reformed Republican Fascist Party. The state declared Rome as its capital, but was \\"de facto\\" centered on Salò (hence its colloquial name), a small town on Lake Garda, near Brescia, where Mussolini and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was headquartered. The RSI exercised nominal sovereignty in northern and central Italy, but was largely dependent on German troops to maintain control. - The Republican Fascist Party (PFR) was a political party led by Benito Mussolini during the German occupation of Central and Northern Italy. It was founded as the successor of former National Fascist Party as an anti-monarchist party. It considered King Victor Emmanuel III to be a traitor after he had signed the surrender to the Allied powers. - The Fatherland Front ( German : Vaterländische Front , VF ) was the ruling political organisation of \`\` Austrofascism '' . It claimed to be a nonpartisan movement , and aimed to unite all the people of Austria , overcoming political and social divisions . Established on 20 May 1933 by Christian Social Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss as a one - party along the lines of Italian Fascism , it advocated Austrian nationalism and independence from Nazi Germany on the basis of protecting Austria 's Catholic religious identity from what they considered a Protestant - dominated German state . The Fatherland Front which was strongly linked with Austria 's Catholic clergy , absorbed Dollfuss 's Christian Social Party , the agrarian Landbund and the right - wing paramilitary Heimwehren , all of which were opposed to socialism , free - market capitalism and liberal democracy . It established an authoritarian and corporatist regime , the Federal State of Austria , which is commonly known in German as the Ständestaat ( \`\` corporate state '' ) . According to the Fatherland Front , this form of government and society implemented the social teaching of Pope Pius XI 's 1931 encyclical Quadragesimo anno . The Front banned and persecuted all its political opponents , including Communists , Social Democrats -- who fought against it in a brief Civil War in February 1934 -- but also the Austrian Nazis who wanted Austria to join Hitler 's Greater German Empire . Chancellor Dollfuss was assassinated by the Nazis in July 1934 . He was succeeded as leader of the VF and Chancellor of Austria by Kurt Schuschnigg , who ruled until the invigorated Nazis forced him to resign on 11 March 1938 . Austria was annexed by Nazi Germany the next day . The Fatherland Front maintained a cultural and recreational organisation , called \`\` New Life '' ( Neues Leben ) , similar to Germany 's Strength Through Joy . The role of the Fatherland Front has been a contentious point in post-War Austrian historiography . While left - wing historians consider it to be...

Many people regard long afternoon naps and late dinners as perfect aspects of the Spanish way of life. Until the 1940s, Spain was on the same time as Britain and Portugal. In World War II, Spain and Portugal moved the clocks forward to align them with Nazi Germany. The same happened in Portugal. After the defeat of Hitler, Portugal returned to Greenwich Mean Time, but Spain did not. \\"The fact that for more than 71 years Spain has not been in its proper time zone means we sleep almost an hour less than the World Health Organization recommends,\\" lawmakers in the Spanish Parliament wrote in a proposal.\\"This has a negative effect on productivity, absenteeism, stress, accidents and school drop-out rates.\\" Last September, a parliamentary commission recommended that the government turn back the clocks by one hour and introduce a regular eight-hour workday. For the time being, the Spanish government is treating the campaign seriously but it hasn't taken any action yet. Spain's time zone issue explains why everything in Spain happens later, from meal times to broadcast entertainment (primetime doesn't start until 10 pm). Many urban Spaniards complain of a never-ending workday that begins in the morning but is interrupted by a traditional late-morning break and then again by the midday siesta--a two-hour long lunch and nap that usually start at 2 pm. If workers return to their desks at 4 pm, they end up working late into the evening. Under the proposed new schedule, the lunchtime break would be cut to an hour or less. The interruption-filled Spanish workday would be replaced by something closer to a 9-to-5 schedule. Ignacio Buqueras, president of the Association for the Rationalization of Spanish Working Hours, told The New York Times that changing the Spanish schedule would be good news for working mothers. It would also allow families more free time together and boost Spain's economic... Question: According to the passage, Duran may agree with the following except that _ .

The Bengals dominated the first half time of possession by more than a 2-1 margin. The Bengals took the opening possession of the game and marched down the field, with quarterback AJ McCarron, playing in place of the injured Andy Dalton, throwing a 5-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver A. J. Green in the corner of the end zone. The Bengals later added to their lead in the second quarter, with wide receiver Mohamed Sanu rushing for a 6-yard touchdown, in a \\"wildcat\\" formation. The Bengals were threatening to add to their lead just before the two-minute warning, but placekicker Mike Nugent missed wide right on a 45-yard field goal attempt. The Broncos then marched down the field, but had to settle for a 23-yard field goal by placekicker Brandon McManus just before halftime. The Broncos took the initial possession of the second half, and pulled to within 14-10, with quarterback Brock Osweiler connecting with wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders on an 8-yard touchdown pass, which was the only scoring play of the third quarter. After having trouble stopping the Bengals' offense in the first half, the Broncos' defense forced the Bengals to punt on their first four possessions of the second half. The Broncos grabbed a 17-14 lead early in the fourth quarter, with running back C. J. Anderson scampering down the sideline for a 39-yard touchdown. A 52-yard field goal by Nugent helped the Bengals tie the game at 17-17 with 6:51 remaining in the fourth quarter. The Broncos had reached the Bengals' 27-yard line on the next possession, and were attempting a game-winning drive, but Bengals' defensive end Michael Johnson forced a fumble off Anderson, which was recovered by safety Reggie Nelson. However, the Broncos' defense forced a Bengals' punt, and the Broncos' offense began their next drive at their own 20-yard line with 1:40 remaining. However, McManus badly missed wide left on a potential game-winning 45-yard field goal attempt as time expired, sending the game to overtime. The Broncos won the overtime coin toss, and took a 20-17 lead on their initial possession, with a 37-yard field goal by McManus. The drive was aided by a 15-yard personal foul penalty on Bengals' linebacker Vontaze Burfict for a late hit out-of-bounds. The Bengals started their first offensive possession of overtime at their own 33-yard line, and on their first play, McCarron attempted a pass that was incomplete, as his arm was hit by Broncos' linebacker Von Miller. Broncos' head coach Gary Kubiak called a timeout, thinking the play should have been ruled as a game-ending fumble, however, the initial ruling was upheld by instant replay. On the very next play, McCarron fumbled the snap, which was recovered by Broncos' linebacker DeMarcus Ware to end the game and send the Broncos to the postseason for the fifth consecutive season. This was the third game of the season that the Broncos won after trailing 14-0 &#8212; the other two were Week 2 at the Kansas City Chiefs and Week 12 vs. the New England Patriots.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Strapping Young Lad was known for its energetic live performances, mostly owing to the eccentric appearance and persona of Devin Townsend. Adrian Begrand of PopMatters wrote \\"Nobody in metal today has the same kind of commanding stage presence as the self-professed Bald Bastard, Devin Townsend\\", and called Strapping Young Lad \\"one of the best live bands around\\". Townsend was famous for his on-stage antics; he integrated his ironic and tongue-in-cheek humor into live shows and interacted heavily with the audience. He would deliver comical, and often insulting remarks to them, organize circle pits, and parody heavy metal clichés as well as the genre itself.The band's humorous approach was also evidenced by a song frequently performed live from 1997, entitled \\"Far Beyond Metal\\", a parody of classic heavy metal. It became a live staple and a fan favorite, with lyrics changing practically every performance. Although it was recorded live on No Sleep 'till Bedtime, and on the For Those Aboot to Rock DVD, a studio version was not recorded until 2006 during The New Black sessions. The band was also sarcastic about their own Canadian heritage, they used \\"Blame Canada\\", a comedic anti-Canada song from South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut as intro music at many concerts in 2003 and 2004.For a period of time, Strapping Young Lad also played Townsend's solo material live. In 1998, after the release of Infinity, they began performing both Strapping Young Lad and Townsend's solo songs, as two separate sets. It was not until the 2003 release of Accelerated Evolution when Townsend formed a separate band, called The Devin Townsend Band, to act as his full-fledged solo band.

The main part of the tweet consists of two parts: \\"I would but it is FAR\\" and \\"have fun though.\\" In the first part, \\"I would but it is FAR,\\" the user implies that they would have liked to join or attend an event, but the distance appears to be a substantial obstacle. The use of the word \\"FAR\\" in capital letters may emphasize the extent of the distance or the inconvenience it poses. The sentiment expressed in this part is a mix of desire to participate and regret about not being able to do so due to the distance. In the second part, \\"have fun though,\\" the user displays a positive attitude and wishes Steven Crowder to enjoy the event. This friendly gesture contributes a positive sentiment to the overall tweet. Taking these components into account, the sentiment of the tweet can be considered as mixed or neutral-leaning positive.

It fits pretty good circumference wise, however it is a little too big for him as it covers a larger area than needed. Even though it is slightly too large for him, there has been no leaks.

Options: - good to eat - crisp - grocery store - good for - farm The answer is \\"crisp\\" because Answer:","response":"The type of apples that people generally prefer is \\"crisp.\\" This preference mainly arises from the texture, flavor, and versatility of crisp apples. An in-depth understanding of why crisp apples are favored can be derived by examining each aspect that contributes to their preference over the other options mentioned. 1. Texture: Crisp apples have a firm and crunchy texture. This adds to the eating experience, as many people enjoy biting into an apple that offers a satisfying snap. A crisp texture also means that the apple possesses a fresh and juicy quality, which is enjoyable for most people. 2. Flavor: Crisp apples come in an array of tastes, from sweet to tart and everything in between, making them appealing to a wide range of taste preferences. The mix of sweetness and slight acidity in crisp apples strikes the right balance for many individuals who are seeking a tasty and refreshing snack. Examples of popular crisp apple varieties include Honeycrisp, Fuji, and Gala apples. 3. Versatility: Crisp apples can be used for various purposes, making them a popular choice. Owing to their firm texture, they hold up well when used in cooked dishes such as apple pies, strudels, and tarts. They can also be eaten raw by themselves or sliced and added to salads, sandwiches, or paired with cheese. Additionally, crisp apples are excellent for juicing, as they yield appreciable amounts of juice that is both sweet and tart. Now, let's address the other options provided: - Good to eat: While this term may refer to the overall palatability of an apple, it doesn't specify any particular trait or quality. Crisp apples are considered \\"good to eat\\" if they offer the right combination of texture, flavor, and freshness, which contributes to their popularity. - Grocery store: This option is not a type of apple, but rather a place where apples can be purchased. Grocery stores typically offer various apple types, including crisp and soft varieties, making it an overarching category instead of a specific preference. - Good for: This phrase is also vague, as it does not signify a specific characteristic of apples that people might prefer. It could refer to apples being nutritious, suitable for cooking, or any other favorable quality. On the other hand, crisp apples possess numerous qualities that people generally look for, such as taste, texture, and versatility as mentioned earlier. - Farm: Similar to the grocery store option, a farm is a location where apples are grown and harvested. It doesn't reflect a specific type of apple but rather a source for procuring them. Farms can grow various apple types, including crisp and soft varieties, heirlooms, and new cultivars. In conclusion, people prefer crisp apples because they offer a satisfying texture, a perfect balance of flavors, and versatile usage. They are best suited for both eating raw and cooking, making them the popular choice among apple enthusiasts. While other options could refer to apple-related qualities, they don't address specific traits that people would find preferable, thus solidifying crisp apples as the most favored apple type."},{"question":"Solve -26*t = -40*t + 14 for t..

First, we want to move all the \\"t\\" terms to one side of the equation. To do that, let's add 40*t to both sides.

Dissatisfaction with Company rule led to the Indian Rebellion of 1857, after which the British provinces of India were directly administered by the British Crown and witnessed a period of both rapid development of infrastructure and economic stagnation. During the first half of the 20th century, a nationwide struggle for independence was launched with the leading party involved being the Indian National Congress which was later joined by other organizations.

Could you please translate this to English?","response":"The approach of institutions to this issue has changed in recent years, and European countries are fighting against the PKK with much greater commitment than before. The sentence you provided is in Turkish and discusses the changing attitudes of institutions, presumably governmental or political, towards a particular issue. The issue is not specified in the sentence, but it can be inferred to be related to the fight against the PKK. The PKK, or the Kurdistan Workers' Party, is a Kurdish militant and political organization which has been involved in armed conflict with the Turkish state since the 1980s, with the aim of achieving an independent Kurdish state. This conflict has been a major issue in Turkey and has also affected other countries, especially in Europe where there is a significant Kurdish diaspora. This sentence suggests that European countries, where the institutions referred to in the sentence are probably located, are now taking a much stronger stance in fighting against the PKK. This could mean that they are investing more resources in measures against the PKK, implementing tougher policies, or taking a stronger stance against the PKK in international forums. However, without further context, it's hard to provide a more detailed interpretation of the sentence. The specifics of how these institutions' approaches have changed, what actions they're taking in their fight against the PKK, and why, are all questions that the sentence leaves open.

The U.S. Department of Justice two-year grant will begin Oct. 1, which is the start of domestic violence awareness month. U.S. Rep. John Tanner announced Monday that the grant was awarded to West Tennessee Legal Services of Jackson. The organization provides legal assistance and advocacy in 17 counties. \\"This award will offer assistance as we look for whatever ways possible to stop domestic violence and help the women, men and children who are victims of abuse,\\" Tanner said in a news statement. The organization doesn't have a staff member who speaks Spanish and the need is increasing with growing Hispanic populations, said the organization's executive director Steven Xanthopoulos. He estimated the money will help handle at least another 180 cases next year. The group closes about 2,500 cases a year. The money was timed well because the legal group had recently lost about 120,000 in grant money due to a decrease in the poverty population in West Tennessee in Census 2000, Xanthopoulos said. \\"The drop in poverty is a good thing, but there is still a great need out there,\\" he said. \\"So this was a very good thing.\\" Having legal representation at divorce and child custody hearings is important in helping victims leave abusive and sometimes dangerous situations, said Margaret Cole, executive director of Wo/Men's Resource and Rape Assistance Program in Jackson. Her organization and Northwest Safeline are partners in the grant. Northwest Safeline, based in Dyersburg, is a family violence intervention project that serves Dyer, Obion, Lake and Crockett counties.

Passage: The Grainger Market replaced an earlier market originally built in 1808 called the Butcher Market. The Grainger Market itself, was opened in 1835 and was Newcastle's first indoor market. At the time of its opening in 1835 it was said to be one of the largest and most beautiful markets in Europe. The opening was celebrated with a grand dinner attended by 2000 guests, and the Laing Art Gallery has a painting of this event. With the exception of the timber roof which was destroyed by a fire in 1901 and replaced by latticed-steel arches the Market is largely in its original condition.

President Barack Obama and his administration have been quiet on the continued tensions between Vladmir Putin’s government and the area that is its federal subject. That follows the pattern of his predecessors: Bill Clinton pushed Boris Yeltsin to find a peaceful settlement to what began in 1994 as a war to gain independence from Russia, as did George W. Bush. Text Size - + reset Gov. Patrick: Boston on lockdown Boston Marathon suspects photos Since taking office, Obama hasn’t said the word “Chechnya” publicly. But on Friday, Secretary of State John Kerry declined to comment on the suspects’ apparent Chechen ties and on whether their involvement would effect relations with Russia. “I’m not going to get into speculation, I’m not going to deal with a hypothetical,” he said. (PHOTOS: Search for Boston Marathon bombing suspects) The Obama administration hasn’t done much on Chechnya, but the Treasury and State Departments have taken some action against Chechans. Defying Putin’s requests, Treasury last week released a list of 18 Russian “specially designated nationals” who face economic sanctions from the United States. The list included two Chechens, Letscha Bogatirov and Kazbek Dukuzov, both of whom are linked to murders. In 2010, State designated Doku Umarov, the leader of Al Qaeda affiliate Islamic Caucasus Emirate, as a global terrorist in 2010. The designation came after Umarov’s group took responsibility for a double suicide bombing on the Moscow Metro, in which at least 40 people died and more than 100 were injured. (Also on POLITICO: Reports: Suspects came from abroad) Umarov’s leadership of Chechen insurgents has “intensified the split between national separatists and radical jihadists and led to a movement seeking to create an Islamic Emirate of the Caucasus with Umarov as the Emir,” the department said in a statement when announcing the move. The White House referred questions to State, which advises that U.S. citizens not travel to Chechnya and the rest of the North Caucasus region. Daniel Benjamin, who was then the department’s coordinator for counterterrorism said in 2010 that the designation was “in direct response to the threats posed to United States and Russia.” “The recent attacks perpetrated by Umarov and his operatives illustrate the global nature of the terrorist problem we face today. We stand in solidarity with the Russian people in our condemnation of these deplorable terrorist acts,” Benjamin added. (Also on POLITICO: Bombing motive: Far from obvious) Umarov’s group has also taken responsibility for a January 2011 explosion at a Moscow airport that killed 36 people. Soon after the attack, Umarov said his group would bring “a year of blood and tears” to Russia, though his group was modest in size. “I won’t tell you there are hundreds of us prepared for jihad. But 50 or 60, God willing, we will find,” he said then. In March 2011, the United Nations Security Council’s Al Qaida and Taliban Sanctions Committee added to its list of people associated with Al Qaeda. Since then, in early 2012, Umarov told his followers to stop attacking Russian civilians and focus on military and security targets. (Also on POLITICO: Timeline: Search for Boston Marathon bombing suspects) The Kremlin, meanwhile, has since Sept. 11, 2001, characterized its conflict with Chechens as part of the global war on terror. But Washington has tended to characterize the conflict as an internal issue. “As regards [to] Chechnya, we still hope a solution can be found in a peaceful way,” Bush said in a 2002 interview. “This is Russia’s domestic problem. In my work with Vladimir Putin, I’ll be trying to direct him towards a peaceful solution to the problem.” Follow @politico ||||| A Soviet-made tank is seen near the town of Agdam, controlled by Nagorno Karabakh, and which was completely destroyed during fighting between Karabakh and Azerbaijan forces in 1990s, October 29, 2009. LINE OF CONTACT, Azerbaijan (Reuters) - A dusty trench, interrupted every few meters by lookout posts and gun positions, winds its way as far as the eye can see. \\"Put your head above the trench and they'll shoot you,\\" says a young ethnic Armenian soldier, peering through a narrow slit in a concrete watchtower at Azeri lines 400 meters away where he says snipers lie in wait. The bullets fly both ways. On the other side of the minefields, Khosrov Shukurov's daughter was recently shot in the arm. The 70-year-old Azeri farmer keeps his cows on leashes to stop them straying beyond the wall built to protect his village. Sporadic firefights have intensified along the front line around Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountainous enclave within Azerbaijan in the South Caucasus controlled by ethnic Armenians since a war in the early 1990s that killed about 30,000 people. Azerbaijan has stepped up threats to take the region back and its decision to give a hero's welcome to a soldier convicted of hacking an Armenian to death on a NATO course has highlighted the risk of a war that could draw in Turkey, Russia and Iran. When the ethnic Armenian majority in Nagorno-Karabakh declared independence as the Soviet Union collapsed, and took over more Azeri territory outside the region than within it, Christian Armenia avoided direct war with Muslim Azerbaijan. It now says it would not stand aside if the enclave it helped establish was attacked. Both it and Azerbaijan have more powerful weapons than two decades ago and if pipelines taking Azeri oil and gas to Europe via Turkey or Armenia's nuclear power station were threatened, war could spread. Armenia has a collective security agreement with its regional ally Russia, while Azerbaijan has one with Turkey, itself a member of NATO for which an attack on one member state is an attack on all 28. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton warned of a \\"much broader conflict\\" when she visited Armenia in June and NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Friday he was \\"deeply concerned\\" by the Azeri soldier's pardon last month. UPHILL BATTLE Political and military analysts say war is not inevitable, and that the potential for destruction and a regional war serve as a deterrent. But they are increasingly discussing how a conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan might play out. The most likely trigger is seen as a particularly deadly skirmish on the line of contact between Nagorno-Karabakh-held territory and the rest of Azerbaijan or on the Azerbaijan-Armenia border. Nine people died in clashes in June. \\"At some moment the crossfire will not be limited to the use of small weapons. One side will hit the other with heavy weapons,\\" said Rasim Musabayov, an independent member of parliament in Azerbaijan's capital, Baku. \\"Then you can see a scenario in which the other side responds with air power and then it all goes from there.\\" Less likely would be a political decision to go to war - despite Azerbaijan's threats to regain control of Nagorno-Karabakh - or a pre-emptive strike by Armenia or Nagorno-Karabakh if an attack by Azerbaijan seemed imminent. If a conflict did break out, Azerbaijan would likely try to besiege Nagorno-Karabakh, a region of about 160,000 people linked to Armenia by a narrow land corridor, since the enclave's troops dominate the high ground and have mined elsewhere. \\"A key factor is the topography, the extent to which Nagorno-Karabakh has created defenses in depth. This could make the lower land killing fields. Progress would come at a high cost,\\" said Wayne Merry, a former U.S. diplomat and an expert on the region at the American Foreign Policy Council in Washington. The Azeris could also attack the towns of Jebrail and Fuzuli to the south and southeast, outside the enclave before the 1991-94 war but part of the 20 percent of Azerbaijan under ethnic Armenian control since. \\"SPASMS OF MUTUAL DESTRUCTION\\" Azerbaijan's annual defense spending is more than Armenia's entire budget, but Armenia has warned of an \\"asymmetrical\\" response to any attack, threatening what Merry called a \\"spasm of mutual destruction\\" fuelled by bitterness from the last war. Abbas Aliyev, 66, was forced out of Fuzuli as it was seized by ethnic Armenian troops and settled with his wife and four children in the cramped basement of an apartment bloc in Baku where one toilet is shared by 16 families. He is one of hundreds of thousands of refugees, most of them Azeris, who cannot return home until the conflict is resolved. \\"I want to breathe the fresh air of my region again,\\" he said. Ethnic Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh use similar words to explain why they would not give the region up. \\"I got all the paperwork I needed to go to the United States but decided not to go. It's marvelous here. Look around you, breathe the air,\\" said Samvel Gabrielyan, an artist in Stepanakert, a quiet city of nearly 57,000 in the mountains. Smart new apartment blocs stand on the rubble of buildings destroyed there during the war. A few still have bullet marks. \\"We'd be ready to fight again if we had to. Otherwise what did all those deaths in the last war mean?\\" Gabrielyan said. Such passions, and a belief on both sides that they can win a war, risk encouraging the politicians and military. Thomas de Waal, a Caucasus expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, said a war now would be much more destructive than the low-tech conflict of the 1990s. \\"It would be much more bloody and become a full state-state conflict with unpredictable consequences.\\" Obvious targets in Azerbaijan would be the Baku-Tbilisi-Erzurum (BTE) natural gas pipeline and the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) crude oil pipeline. Both are in northwest Azerbaijan, within range of Armenian forces, and have a role in Europe's attempts to reduce its reliance on Russia for energy supplies. A consortium of Western oil companies operates the Azeri, Chirag and Guneshli oilfields in the Azeri sector of the Caspian Sea, as well as Azerbaijan's large Shah Deniz gas field. Led by British Petroleum and including Norway's Statoil and two U.S. companies, Chevron and ExxonMobil, it has plenty to lose if war breaks out. Each side can hit the other's capital, and Armenia's, Yerevan, is only 30 km from its Metsamor nuclear power plant. Northwest Azerbaijan contains a water reservoir and power station as well as an international highway and railway. REGIONAL ALLIANCES \\"We think that if hostilities resume, they could not be limited to a local or regional framework. I think they would have a wider geographical spread,\\" Bako Sahakyan, the self-styled president of Nagorno-Karabakh, said in an interview. Turkey closed its border with Armenia in a gesture of solidarity with ethnic kin in Azerbaijan during the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and rejects Armenia's insistence it recognize the killing of Armenians in Ottoman Turkey during World War One as genocide. Russia has a military base at Gyumri in northwest Armenia. Neither, however, would want to rush into a war that would damage their own, fragile relationship and Russia would not want to upset its efforts to deepen ties with Baku. Iran, another regional force, was neutral during the 1991-94 war and would be likely to remain so. But its relationship with Azerbaijan has soured, especially since Baku started buying arms from Israel, and it might be sucked into a conflict if it allowed goods to keep flowing through its border with Armenia. Efforts to find a political solution led by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), have had little success, and political concessions are hard for leaders who would risk losing power if they looked weak. \\"Nagorno-Karabakh is an integral part of Armenia. This is how ordinary people see it,\\" said Archbishop Pargev Martirosyan, the Armenian Apostolic Church's senior official in the enclave, which is still part of Azerbaijan under international law. \\"We will do everything to save our land.\\" On the other side of the line of conflict, farmer Shukurov will not move from the village of Ciragli, despite his daughter's injury and the bullet holes riddling his house. \\"That is what the Armenians want, but I will not give up,\\" he said. Diplomats and analysts say that if another war breaks out, it is likely to end in stalemate. \\"The Azeris can't retake Karabakh now. They are militarily incapable of doing it,\\" said Matthew Bryza, a former U.S. ambassador to Azerbaijan. \\"I don't think they could dislodge the Armenian forces from the high ground. I think that's extremely difficult.\\" Yusif Agayev, an Azeri military expert and veteran of the war, said there was no mood for a protracted fight. \\"I think it would be a month or two, that is the amount of time our armed forces could fight for. If it drags on longer then it will become a war that society will have to participate in, not just the army,\\" he said. \\"I don't think the society of my country is ready for war.\\" (Additional reporting by Thomas Grove in Azerbaijan, Hasmik Mkrtchyan in Yerevan, Fredrik Dahl in Vienna and Justyna Pawlak in Brussels; editing by Philippa Fletcher) ||||| Author: Preeti Bhattacharji Updated: April 8, 2010 Introduction Chechens are an ethnic minority living primarily in Russia's North Caucasus region. For the past two hundred years, they have generally been governed by Moscow, though they have had varying degrees of de facto autonomy. After the fall of the Soviet Union, Chechen separatists launched a coordinated campaign for independence, which resulted in two devastating wars and an ongoing insurgency in Russia's republic of Chechnya. Militants in and around Chechnya continue to agitate for independence, though the death of separatist leader Shamil Basayev in July 2006 weakened the separatist movement. However, violence in the North Caucasus has escalated since 2008, and Moscow experienced its most serious attack in six years with the bombing of a metro station in March 2010. Share Who are the Chechens? The Chechens are a largely Muslim ethnic group that has lived for centuries in the mountainous North Caucasus region. For the past two hundred years, Chechens have resisted Russian rule. During World War II, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin accused the Chechens of cooperating with the Nazis and forcibly deported the entire population to Kazakhstan and Siberia. Tens of thousands of Chechens died, and the survivors were allowed to return home only after Stalin's death. Has Chechnya ever been independent? Chechnya has experienced several brief periods of de facto independence. In January 1921, four years after the Russian Revolution, Chechnya joined Kabardino-Balkaria, Karachay-Cherkessia, North Ossetia, and Ingushetia to form the Mountain Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. But the following year, the Soviet Union seized control of Chechnya and turned it into a Soviet province called the Chechen Autonomous Oblast. In January 1934, Soviet officials merged the Chechen Autonomous Oblast with the neighboring Ingush Autonomous Oblast, largely to dilute each region's ethnic identity. During World War II, as German forces moved into the Soviet Union and toward the North Caucasus, many ethnic minority groups subject to Soviet and Russian rule for generations seized on the opportunity presented by the war to try and break free. German forces never reached Chechnya, but Chechen nationalist Khasan Israilov led a revolt against Soviet rule which lasted from 1940 to 1944. After Soviet troops crushed the rebellion, Stalin accused the Chechens of collaborating with Nazi invaders. In 1944, Stalin disbanded the Chechen-Ingush republic altogether and forcibly deported the entire Chechen population to Siberia and Kazakhstan. Chechens were not allowed to return to their homeland until 1957, when Stalin's successor, Nikita Khrushchev, restored the province amid de-Stalinization. What is the post-Soviet history of violence in Chechnya? In the early 1990s, following the Soviet collapse, separatists in the newly formed Russian Federation Republic of Chechnya started an independence movement called the Chechen All-National Congress. Russian President Boris Yeltsin opposed Chechen independence, arguing that Chechnya was an integral part of Russia. From 1994 to 1996, Russia fought Chechen guerillas in a conflict that became known as the First Chechen War. Tens of thousands of civilians died, but Russia failed to win control of Chechnya's mountainous terrain, giving Chechnya de facto independence. In May 1996, Yeltsin signed a ceasefire with the separatists, and they agreed on a peace treaty the following year. But violence flared again three years later. In August 1999, Chechen militants invaded the neighboring Russian republic of Dagestan to support a local separatist movement. The following month, five bombs exploded in Russia over a ten-day period, killing almost three hundred civilians. Moscow blamed Chechen rebels for the explosions, which comprised the largest coordinated terrorist attack in Russian history. The Dagestan invasion and the Russian bombings prompted Russian forces to launch the Second Chechen War, also known as the War in the North Caucasus. In February 2000, Russia recaptured the Chechen capital of Grozny, destroying a good part of the city center in the process, reasserting direct control over Chechnya. Tens of thousands of Chechens and Russians were killed or wounded in the two wars, and hundreds of thousands of civilians were displaced. Since the end of the second war, Chechen separatist activity has diminished, and the July 2006 death of separatist leader Shamil Basayev--in an explosion many see as the work of Russia's internal security services--seems to have stifled the movement. Since 2008, however, violence has markedly increased in the North Caucasus, according to a report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Incidents of violence rose from 795 in 2008 to 1,100 in 2009, and suicide bombings quadrupled in 2009, the majority of which occurred in Chechnya. Which terrorist groups operate in Chechnya? Information about groups linked to the conflict in Chechnya is hard to confirm, but experts say the struggle is between local separatists--a loosely organized group with semi-independent commanders--and the Russian army. According to the U.S. State Department, the Islamic International Peacekeeping Brigade (IIPB) is the primary channel for Islamic funding of the Chechen guerillas, in part through links to al-Qaeda-related financiers on the Arabian Peninsula. The United States also defined the Chechnya-based Special Purpose Islamic Regiment (SPIR) and the Riyadus-Salikhin Reconnaissance and Sabotage Battalion of Chechen Martyrs as terrorist entities in February 2003. Chechnya's long and violent guerrilla war has attracted a small number of Islamist militants from outside of Chechnya--some of whom are Arab fighters with possible links to al-Qaeda. Among the Islamist militants, the most prominent was Basayev, Russia's most wanted man. Basayev fought for Chechen independence for more than a decade, and was the mastermind behind the worst terrorist attacks on Russian soil. On July 10, 2006, Basayev was killed in an explosion in neighboring Ingushetia. His death cast doubt on the future of the Chechen separatist movement, and allegedly led to the surrender of five hundred militants. Four months later, Russian security forces killed Abu Hafs al-Urdani, the Jordanian-born commander of foreign fighters in Chechnya. Since then, violence in Chechnya has ebbed, though terrorism in the areas of Dagestan and Ingushetia has increased. What major attacks are the Chechen groups responsible for? The most notorious and devastating attack came in September 2004, when Basayev ordered an attack on a school in Beslan, a town in North Ossetia. More than three hundred people died in the three-day siege, most of them children. There were thirty-two militants, though only three or four were Chechens. All but one of the militants were reportedly killed during the siege. Since then, violence has generally targeted individual officials and government offices rather than large groups of civilians. Attacks include: An August 1999 bombing of a shopping arcade and a September 1999 bombing of an apartment building in Moscow that killed sixty-four people. Two bombings in September 1999 in the Russian republic of Dagestan and southern Russian city of Volgodonsk. Controversy still surrounds whether these attacks were conclusively linked to Chechens. A bomb blast that killed at least forty-one people, including seventeen children, during a military parade in the southwestern town of Kaspiisk in May 2002. Russia blamed the attack on Chechen terrorists. The October 2002 seizure of Moscow's Dubrovka Theater, where approximately seven hundred people were attending a performance. Russian Special Forces launched a rescue operation, but the opium-derived gas they used to disable the hostage-takers killed more than 120 hostages, as well as many of the terrorists. Basayev took responsibility for organizing the attack, and three Chechen-affiliated groups are thought to have been involved. A December 2002 dual suicide bombing that attacked the headquarters of Chechnya's Russian-backed government in Grozny. Russian officials claim that international terrorists helped local Chechens mount the assault, which killed eighty-three people. A three-day attack on Ingushetia in June 2004, which killed almost one hundred people and injured another 120. Street fighting in October 2005 that killed at least eighty-five people. The fighting was in the south Russian city of Nalchik after Chechen rebels assaulted government buildings, telecommunications facilities, and the airport. An attack on the Nevsky Express, used by members of the business and political elite, in November 2009 killed twenty-seven people. In March 2010, two female suicide bombers detonated bombs in a Moscow metro station located near the headquarters of the security services, killing thirty-nine people. Islamist Chechen rebel leader Doku Umarov claimed responsibility for the bombing; he had also claimed responsibility for the derailment of the Nevsky Express. Two days after the metro station bombing in March 2010, two bombs exploded in the town of Kizlyar, in Russia's North Caucasus, killing at least twelve people. Are there links between Chechen groups and al-Qaeda? Experts say there are several ties between the al-Qaeda network and Chechen groups. A Chechen warlord known as Khattab is said to have met with Osama bin Laden while both men were fighting the 1979-89 Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. Alexander Vershbow, a U.S. ambassador to Russia, said shortly after September 11, 2001, \\"We have long recognized that Osama bin Laden and other international networks have been fueling the flames in Chechnya, including the involvement of foreign commanders like Khattab.\\" Khattab was killed in April 2002. Zacarias Moussaoui, who was convicted for his involvement in the September 11 attacks, was reported by the Wall Street Journal to be formerly \\"a recruiter for al-Qaeda-backed rebels in Chechnya.\\" Chechen militants reportedly fought alongside al-Qaeda and Taliban forces against the U.S.-backed Northern Alliance in late 2001. The Taliban regime in Afghanistan was one of the only governments to recognize Chechen independence. Russian authorities, including Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, have repeatedly stressed the involvement of international terrorists and Bin Laden associates in Chechnya--in part, experts say, to generate Western sympathy for Russia's military campaign against the Chechen rebels. Russia's former defense minister, Sergei Ivanov, claimed that a videotape of Khattab meeting with bin Laden had been found in Afghanistan, but Russia has not aired the tape publicly. Julia Jeffrey contributed to this report. |||||","response":"For many years, American presidents have avoided talking about Chechnya.

He knew that only through hard work, dedication, and perseverance could he achieve greatness and fill the boots of all those legendary names in the Everton history books. It was no easy task to live up to the expectations that came with the iconic jersey, but Kone was determined to prove his worth and make a name for himself at Goodison Park. As the season went on, Kone constantly pushed himself to improve, both on and off the field. Studying the intricacies of Everton's tactics and working tirelessly with the coaching staff to enhance his skills, he started to show glimpses of the player he could become. The fans gradually began to notice his development, and whispers of the number 9 shirt's potential future hero began to circulate around Goodison Park. Kone's first goal for the club was a turning point - the moment he truly began to write his name into the Everton history books. With each game that followed, he seemed to grow in confidence and, more importantly, in his ability to find the back of the net. He became a fan favorite through his determination, passion for the club, and, unmistakably, his natural talent for scoring goals. Throughout the remainder of the season, Kone went from strength to strength, scoring crucial goals in important matches that helped Everton maintain a strong league position and advance in cup competitions. With each goal, the fans' love for their new No. 9 grew, and they wholeheartedly embraced him as the successor to the likes of Dixie Dean, Graeme Sharp, and Joe Royle - the legendary players who had proudly worn the shirt before him. By the end of the season, Kone had etched his name into the annals of the club's history, having finished as the team’s top scorer and helping Everton secure a place in Europe. As they looked forward to participating in the UEFA Europa League, the fans hailed their new hero with admiration and respect, knowing that Kone had truly earned his place among the club's legendary No. 9s. As the years went on, Kone continued to delight Everton fans with his remarkable goal-scoring prowess, eventually breaking several club records and earning a place in the hearts of Goodison Park faithful. Though he faced numerous challenges along the way, including adapting to different managers and tactical styles, as well as overcoming injuries, Kone cemented his status as a true Everton great. In his final season for the club, Kone led Everton to long-awaited silverware - winning the FA Cup and bringing joy to the fans who had supported him from the beginning. On his last appearance at Goodison Park, he was given a hero's send-off, with the fitting recognition that he had truly lived up to the lofty expectations that came with the iconic No. 9 shirt. And so, the story of Kone's rise to greatness at Everton added a new chapter to the glorious history of the club's legendary No. 9s - proof that, with hard work, dedication, and the unyielding support of the fans, anything is possible."},{"question":"Solve 46*k - 51*k = 15 for k.","response":"To solve the equation 46*k - 51*k = 15 for k, follow these steps: Step 1: Firstly, we simplify the equation. Both terms on the left side of the equation have 'k' in common, so we can combine them. 46*k - 51*k = -5*k. So, the simplified equation is -5*k = 15. Step 2: To solve for 'k', we divide both sides of the equation by -5 to isolate 'k' on one side. So, -5*k / -5 = 15 / -5. After performing the division, we get: k = -3.

Article: When you choose a freezer, remember it's probably going to be with you for a long time. So it's important to know which freezer is right for your needs. First, decide if you want an upright or chest model. Uprights are more convenient. Their storage space is more accessible and they take up less floor area. However, chest models are more energy-efficient because less cold air escapes when they are open. If you are buying an upright, you'll have to choose between frostless or manual defrost . Chest freezers are always manual. Frostless freezers automatically defrost at present intervals and remove the water. Manual models must be defrosted by hand every few months or whenever frost pile up to about a quarter of an inch. To help your freezer reach a ripe old age, try to find a spot that's cool, dry, and away fromdrafts . Drafts and heat will raise the freezer's cabinet temperature, which makes it work harder to keep cool. That means wasted energy. That means wasted energy and a shortened life. Dry air is important because highhumidity can cause the freezer to rust outside and frost up inside. With proper care, a freezer can serve you for 15 years or more. Regular cleaning and simple maintenance will help it maintain a zero-degree temperature and keep it smelling fresh and looking almost new. Frostless models requires less care than manual defrost freezers. The inside of a frostless unit should be washed periodically with warm water and baking soda or a mild soap, rinse, and dried. Good habits go a long way toward a freezer that runs efficiently. To get the most from your freezer, check regularly to make sure it's providing a true zero-degree temperature. Keep the freezer at least three-quarters full. The emptier it get, the more energy is wasted.

If the same mass of wood were added to the fire in the form of small twigs, they would burn much more quickly. This is because the twigs provide a greater surface area than the log does. An increase in the surface area of a reactant increases the rate of a reaction. Surface area is larger when a given amount of a solid is present as smaller particles. A powdered reactant has a greater surface area than the same reactant as a solid chunk.

However, editing your text for proper capitalization is certainly possible. Your corrected query should read: \\"The problem with this approach?\\" Now, if you are referring to a particular approach or strategy in a given context such as business, education, technology, etc., the problems can vary widely based on the specific approach in use. Here are a few generic potential issues that can arise with any approach: 1. Lack of Flexibility: Any approach or strategy might not work in every situation. There could be unique instances or circumstances where a regular approach may fail to deliver the expected outcome. This is why any approach should be adaptable and flexible to cater to a range of scenarios. 2. Time and Resource Intensive: Some approaches might require significant time and resources for execution. This can be problematic, especially for small organizations or in cases where resources are limited. 3. Resistance to Change: In the implementation of any new approach, there can be resistance from stakeholders. This reluctance can hinder the implementation and ultimate success of the strategy. 4. Insufficient Analysis: Sometimes, in the rush to implement a new approach, adequate analysis may not be conducted. This lack of insight can lead to roadblocks down the line. 5. Not Measurable: The approach might lack specific, measurable goals. Without clear metrics, it might be difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of the approach. 6. One-size-fits-all: A standardized approach might not cater to the intricate individual needs of various situations or people involved. This can ultimately lead to a lack of efficacy in achieving desired targets. In conclusion, these are some of the potential problems with an approach, but the specific issues depend heavily on the context and the approach in question.

Last year the two leaders traded insults, with Trump calling Kim “rocket man,” and the North Korean leader calling the U.S. president a “dotard,” and they both threatened military action as tension rose over the North’s accelerated weapons testing to develop an operational nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile capability. But after North Korea successfully test-fired missiles it claimed could carry nuclear warheads capable of reaching the United States, Pyongyang pivoted to diplomacy by suspending further provocations and indicating a willingness to engage in denuclearization talks. Trump surprised allies and adversaries alike by immediately agreeing to meet with Kim, long before the specifics of a nuclear deal could be negotiated. Tuesday’s first meeting between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader produced a broad declaration to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons and develop a peace treaty to end the long standing hostiles between the U.S. and North Korea. Trump called the agreement “very comprehensive,” but it will be left to negotiators to later resolve differences between Washington’s call for complete and verifiable nuclear dismantlement before any sanctions relief is provided, and Pyongyang’s demand that concessions be linked to incremental progress. Some in South Korea remain skeptical that the broad commitment reached at the U.S.-North Korean summit in Singapore will lead to North Korea giving up its nuclear weapons program. “North Korea did not keep its promise in the past, even after signing the agreement. This is what I am disappointed and doubtful about,” said Shim Jae-yeon, a housewife who lives in Seoul. Others... Question: Following the summit, what does Trump likely believe about North Korea's intent to honor the new agreement? === The answer to the above question is Choose your answer from: -- not enough information -- that the agreement will definitely be broken at some point -- probably that North Korea intends to keep its promise and continue good faith negotiations -- that the agreement will not likely bear meaningful results The answer is:","response":"probably that North Korea intends to keep its promise and continue good faith negotiations. Following the summit, it is likely that Trump believes that North Korea intends to honor the new agreement. This belief is based on several factors, including what has transpired leading up to the historic summit and the messages conveyed during the summit itself. Prior to the summit, North Korea had demonstrated a shift in its approach to foreign relations, suspending further missile tests and expressing a willingness to engage in denuclearization talks. This change in attitude was significant enough for Trump to accept the offer to meet with Kim Jong Un. Furthermore, during the summit, the two leaders discussed the goal of a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula and committing to peace between their respective countries. The first meeting between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader resulted in a broad declaration to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons and develop a peace treaty aimed at ending long-standing hostilities between the U.S. and North Korea. Trump's description of the agreement as \\"very comprehensive\\" suggests that he is optimistic about the prospects for progress in the coming negotiations. While there is still some skepticism, particularly from those who recall past broken agreements, it is important to consider the strides that have been made thus far and the potential for progress as negotiations continue. It is likely that Trump has more confidence in the potential for success with this agreement, given the unprecedented nature of the summit and the direct talks between the two leaders. In conclusion, based on the information available, it is likely that Trump believes North Korea intends to keep its promises and continue engaging in good faith negotiations. However, the challenge lies in the implementation and resolution of differences on denuclearization and sanctions relief, which will require ongoing dialogue and sustained effort from both sides."},{"question":"Question: Answer the question based on the following text.

However, there is also an increased risk of loss of control in such conditions. This is especially so when taking into account the large number of riders who ride brakeless. These riders must brake entirely through the drivetrain. Ideally this is done by resisting the forward motion of the pedals, shedding speed while the bike is still moving. Alternatively, though far less efficiently, one can brake by stopping the motion of the pedals in mid-rotation, causing the rear wheel to lock in place, allowing the bicycle to skid and slow down from kinetic friction (see below).[22] Descending any significant gradient is more difficult as the rider must spin the cranks at high speed (sometimes at 170 rpm or more), or use the brakes to slow down. Some consider that the enforced fast spin when descending increases suppleness or flexibility, which is said to improve pedalling performance on any type of bicycle; however the performance boost is negligible compared to the benefits of riding a free wheel.[23] Two brothers had bike repair shops in neighboring towns. Bob's was located in a hilly area, with more precipitation and full of bike trails, so he had more people coming in, while Rob's was in the valley, near the parks. Which bike shop fixed more bike transmissions? A:","response":"It is likely that Bob's bike repair shop fixed more bike transmissions than Rob's shop. There are several factors contributing to this conclusion: 1. Hilly area: Bob's shop is located in a hilly area, which means cyclists in the vicinity might experience more wear and tear on their bike transmissions due to the constant shifts in gears needed to navigate the terrain. This could lead to more frequent repairs and adjustments for optimal performance. 2. More precipitation: Wet and slippery conditions can also affect a bike's transmission system, as moisture can cause lubricants to deteriorate or wash away, leading to friction and wear on the components. Additionally, muddy and gritty conditions can get into the chain and gears, causing further damage. Since Bob's shop is in an area with more precipitation, it is likely that the cyclists frequenting his shop would require more transmission maintenance and repairs. 3. Bike trails: With more bike trails in the area, Bob's shop caters to a larger population of dedicated cyclists. These cyclists typically ride more frequently and for longer distances, which may result in a higher rate of wear on their bike transmissions. This could require more consistent maintenance and repairs to avoid potential problems and ensure smooth and efficient riding. 4. Comparatively fewer customers in the valley: Rob's shop, on the other hand, is located in a valley near parks, which might attract more casual riders and families for leisure rides. These cyclists may not ride as frequently or put as much stress on their bike transmissions, resulting in less need for repairs or maintenance. Taking all these factors into account, it can be concluded that Bob's bike repair shop likely fixed more bike transmissions than Rob's shop due to its location in a hilly, high precipitation area with a larger number of dedicated cyclists using the nearby bike trails."},{"question":"Premise: \\"Who the hell is Jeffrey Goldberg, anyway?\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"Who is Jeffrey Goldberg and why should I care?\\" true?

(AP) — A Missouri man accused of sexually assaulting a 14-year-old schoolmate when he was 17 was charged Thursday with a misdemeanor child endangerment charge. The charge against 19-year-old Matt Barnett was filed in Nodaway County Court in Maryville. He is scheduled to be arraigned later Thursday. His lawyer, J.R. Hobbs, didn't immediately respond to a phone message seeking comment. Special prosecutor Jean Peters Baker has been re-examining Daisy Coleman's allegations that Barnett raped her at a January 2012 house party, when he was a Maryville High School senior and she was a freshman. Barnett says the sex was consensual. The Associated Press generally doesn't name alleged victims of sexual assault but is naming Daisy because she and her mother have granted public interviews. A spokesman for Baker, Mike Mansur, referred questions to a news conference planned for after the court hearing. Baker stepped in after the local prosecutor, Nodaway County prosecutor Robert Rice, was criticized for dropping the case. He alleged that Daisy's family had stopped cooperating — a claim Daisy and her mother, Melinda Coleman, deny. Before dropping the case, Rice had been pursuing the same misdemeanor child endangerment charge filed Thursday by Baker. Melinda Coleman says authorities didn't do enough to push the investigation forward, and she has alleged that Rice's decision to drop the case was politically motivated — Barnett's grandfather was a four-term Missouri state representative who was a state trooper for 32 years. Rice has denied the accusation. Coleman said her daughter was harassed mercilessly on social media sites and at school after going to the authorities, and that it forced the family to move back to Albany, about 40 miles west of Maryville. Barnett was a 17-year-old senior at Maryville High School on Jan. 8, 2012, when he and some other boys picked up Daisy and her 13-year-old friend from Daisy's house and took them to the home of one of the boys. The girls admitted drinking alcohol in Daisy's home before sneaking out of the house and leaving with the boys, some of whom were friends with her older brother. Daisy claimed that when she got to the party, she was given a clear liquid that she drank before being taken into a bedroom and raped while a second boy recorded the act on his cellphone. The 13-year-old was taken into a different room by a 15-year-old boy who forced her to have sex, something the boy admitted doing. His case was handled in the juvenile system and is not public record. Daisy said she blacked out and doesn't remember much after arriving at the boy's home. Melinda Coleman has said she believes her daughter was given a date-rape drug. Coleman said she awoke around 5 a.m. to a clawing sound at the front door and found her daughter shivering in sub-freezing temperatures. She said she was giving Daisy a bath to warm her up when she noticed signs that she had been assaulted. The case and resulting publicity shook the small college town of Maryville, which was deluged with negative reactions after The Star published the results of a seven-month investigation into claims made by the Colemans. Many people condemned the town on social media — and continue to do so — for seemingly abandoning sexual assault victims. The outcry led to a protest on Maryville's courthouse square in which a few hundred people showed up to show their support for Daisy and lambaste what they labeled as a \\"rape culture\\" that allowed the girl's assailant to go unpunished. The story gained national attention after The Kansas City Star published a lengthy account of Daisy's claims in October. ||||| — Two years and a day after an alcohol-infused house party led to sexual assault allegations, a 19-year-old Nodaway County man pleaded guilty Thursday to a charge of misdemeanor child endangerment. Matthew Barnett of Maryville also apologized to his victim, who was 14 at the time. Facing reporters after the 20-minute plea hearing, prosecutors said they did not have the evidence to file a felony sexual assault charge. There was insufficient evidence, said Jean Peters Baker, the Jackson County prosecuting attorney appointed special prosecutor in a case that has garnered international attention. In this case, and every case, it boils down to the evidence. Baker filed the endangerment charge Thursday morning, just hours before Barnett, accompanied by his parents, entered court to plead guilty. As part of a plea agreement, Barnett admitted that he endangered Daisy Coleman when he left her, barefoot and incoherent in freezing temperatures, in her front yard at 2 a.m. Jan. 8, 2012. She was found there three hours later. Her brother told Missouri Highway Patrol investigators that her face was blue, her hair was frozen and she didnt look alive. The incident, which Baker described as a horrible night, followed a party at Barnetts home, where he and Daisy had sex. Daisy has said she was so intoxicated at that time that she has no recollection of the encounter. Barnett maintains that the sex was consensual. Nodaway County Associate Circuit Judge Glen Dietrich sentenced Barnett on Thursday to 120 days of confinement but suspended the sentence and placed Barnett on two years of probation. Additionally, he ordered Barnett to avoid alcohol, bars and liquor stores, verbally apologize to Daisy, have no more contact with her, perform 100 hours of community service and reimburse Daisys family for her mental health treatment, a total not to exceed 1,800. Though the sentence was suspended, the conviction will remain on Barnetts permanent criminal record. Thursdays plea agreement had been under discussion for more than a month, Baker said. Baker met with Barnett, a student at the University of Central Missouri, before the hearing to receive the apology, which she will pass along to Daisy. This was the outcome we believe was the right and just outcome in this case, Baker said during a news conference after the hearing. Barnett sat quietly for much of the hearing, answering most of Dietrichs questions with a simple yes, sir or no, sir. His lawyer, J.R. Hobbs of Kansas City, did most of the talking on Barnetts behalf. Matthew Barnett accepts full responsibility for the conduct charged, Hobbs said afterward. To be clear, the misdemeanor charge ... accurately reflects the conduct for which he should be held accountable. The case generated outrage in October after The Kansas City Star published a detailed account of Daisy Colemans allegation that Barnett sexually assaulted her. Not long after the party, Barnett faced a felony sexual assault charge as well as a child endangerment misdemeanor count. Nodaway Countys prosecutor later dropped both charges. The endangerment charge Baker filed Thursday is the same count that Nodaway County Prosecutor Robert Rice dropped in the summer of 2012, citing lack of cooperation from the Coleman family. Without referring to Daisy or her mother, Melinda Coleman, by name, Baker said both supported this resolution of a case that focused a harsh light on teenage drinking and its too-often brutal consequences. Baker read a statement from Daisy that said: Today I am grateful that the defendant took responsibility by pleading guilty to the charges. I am ready to move forward. Daisy, now 16, was hospitalized in Kansas City earlier this week after a purported suicide attempt, a family friend told The Star. That friend, Robin Bourland, said Daisy ingested pills Sunday evening in an incident that stemmed from online harassment. She said Thursday that Daisy, though still hospitalized, was recovering well. A statement released Thursday from Daisys mother said: I hope that todays resolution of this criminal case brings some closure for my family, especially my children, and for the community. These last two years have been extremely painful. But today I hope somehow, some way that something good will come from this. Baker asked that the public give the victim an opportunity to heal and create a new narrative in her life. Court records filed Thursday gave this account of the incident: The defendant acted with criminal negligence in a manner that created a substantial risk to the life, body and health of D.C., a child less than 17 years old, by providing D.C. with alcohol until she was substantially intoxicated and impaired, and then leaving D.C. outside of her home in the below-freezing temperatures when D.C. was incapable of protecting or caring for herself. Daisy stayed on the lawn for about three hours, the records said, during a time that the temperature fell to 21 degrees. She was wearing only a T-shirt and yoga pants. Earlier, after Daisy had gone to the Barnett residence, she was provided vodka and was taunted by the other males present to drink from the bitch cup, which she did, the records said. After drinking from it, Daisy did not recall any subsequent events. (She) advised the next thing she remembered was waking up in her yard. About 8 a.m. that morning, more than six hours after she had been left in the cold, Daisys blood-alcohol content tested at 0.13 percent, court records said. A six-page Missouri Highway Patrol report summarized the agencys investigation of the case, which the patrol did at Bakers request. It includes parts of an interview with Daisy, during which she was asked whether Barnett could have been under the impression the reported sexual contact could have been consensual. According to the report, Daisy answered: He was drinking, too, so yeah, he could have. At the time, Barnett was on probation for driving while intoxicated. In the original Nodaway County sheriffs report, which was sealed following the dismissal of the original charges but obtained by The Star, multiple witnesses told authorities that Daisy  incapacitated, crying and unable to walk  had to be carried from the Barnett residence. She was driven home, where, two witnesses said, she was left on her lawn. According to two boys in the car, Barnett and a friend then talked about calling one of Daisys brothers and telling him they had found Daisy drunk at a party and had dropped her off at home. The goal, according to one of the youths, was to keep anybody from finding out theyd had sex with Daisy and her 13-year-old friend. A 15-year-old Nodaway County boy later admitted in juvenile court that he had sex with the 13-year-old, despite her protests. He spent two weeks in the custody of state juvenile authorities and was released for further treatment at home. A third youth initially faced a charge of sexual exploitation of a minor after admitting to taking a cell-phone video of Daisy and Barnett. Authorities never found the video. We tried to obtain the video, and without the video, there is no charge, Baker said Thursday. Local interest in the case was fed, in part, by a suspicion that political influence had played a part in Rices decision to drop the charges, an accusation Rice repeatedly has denied. Rice is a Republican. Barnett is the grandson of a once-prominent Nodaway County Republican state legislator. Baker is a Democrat, as is the judge who appointed her. Asked whether Thursdays court hearing vindicated Rice, she told reporters, That would be your analysis. Barnetts attorney responded more strongly. Two highly skilled prosecutors from two different jurisdictions have now independently concluded that felony charges are not appropriate in this matter, Hobbs said. Further, there is absolutely no evidence that political favoritism played a role in the decision of either prosecutor. |||||","response":"A Missouri man, Matt Barnett, was charged with a misdemeanor child endangerment after being accused of sexually assaulting a 14-year-old schoolmate when he, himself, was 17.

Authorities suspect Ruben Pestano Lavilla Jr. was behind the 2004 superferry bombing. Authorities in Bahrain arrested Ruben Pestano Lavilla Jr. last month, said Ricardo Blancaflor, undersecretary at the Department of Justice. Lavilla was deported Saturday to Manila, where police arrested him and briefly paraded him in front of local media crews before locking him inside police headquarters, Blancaflor said. Lavilla is one of the top ideologues in the Rajah Solaiman Movement, a group of former Christians who converted to Islam and claim affiliation with the al Qaeda-linked regional terrorist groups Jemaah Islamiyah and Abu Sayyaf, Blancaflor said. Blancaflor said authorities suspect Lavilla helped plot the bombing of a superferry near Manila on February 27, 2004, in which at least 116 people died. They believe Lavilla also helped plan the bombing of a bus behind the Intercontinental Hotel in Manila on February 14, 2005, an attack that killed at least four people and came to be known as the Valentine's Day Bombing. The bus bombing was part of a trio of attacks that happened that day. The two other blasts, both fatal, happened in the southern cities of General Santos and Davao. Blancaflor said he suspects Lavilla was also involved in the planning of several bomb attacks on the U.S. Embassy in Manila, all of which were thwarted by Philippine police. In describing Lavilla's arrest in Bahrain, Blancaflor said only that police there arrested him as they were enforcing U.N. Security Council resolution 1276, which imposed air travel and financial sanctions on the Taliban. Jemaah Islamiyah aims to create a Muslim \\"superstate\\" across much of Southeast Asia. Authorities blame the group for the Bali, Indonesia nightclub bombings of 2002, which killed more than 200 mostly Western tourists. The group is also suspected of subsequent attacks on the Australian Embassy and J.W. Marriott hotel, both in the Indonesian capital, Jakarta. The Abu Sayyaf group is one of several Islamic militant groups fighting the government in and around the southern Philippine island of Mindanao. CNN's Rory Suchet contributed to this report.

Italy had a small population, while Spain had a very large population. and a hint : In nature, when the population size is small, there is usually plenty of food and other resources for each individual. When there is plenty of food and other resources, organisms can easily reproduce, so the birth rate is high. As the population increases, the food supply, or the supply of another necessary resource, may decrease. When necessary resources, such as food, decrease, some individuals will die. Overall, the population cannot reproduce at the same rate, so the birth rates drop. This will cause the population growth rate to decrease. Please answer this question : Which country had a lower mortality? Answer:","response":"Based on the provided information, we can infer the following: 1. Italy has a small population and, as stated in the hint, having a smaller population typically means that there are plenty of resources like food available for the individuals. This leads to higher birth rates and potentially lower mortality rates. 2. Spain has a large population, which can lead to increased competition for resources such as food, causing some individuals not to have access to necessary resources and thus increasing the mortality rates.

What is the solution?","response":"To solve the equation -24 = 16*q - 22*q for q, you need to follow these steps: Step 1: Combine the like terms on the right side of the equation. The equation given is -24 = 16*q - 22*q. Since both 16*q and -22*q have the same variable (q), we can combine these like terms. 16*q - 22*q = (16 - 22)*q = -6*q Now the equation is -24 = -6*q. Step 2: Isolate the variable (q). To isolate q, we need to get rid of the coefficient -6 in front of it. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by -6. -24 / (-6) = -6*q / (-6) On the left side of the equation, we have: -24 / (-6) = 4 On the right side of the equation, the -6 in the numerator and denominator cancel out, leaving us with: q = 4 So, the solution to the equation -24 = 16*q - 22*q for q is q = 4."},{"question":"Determine if the sentence is true based on the text below: Small talk requires that you be aware.

A:","response":"Jamaica uses the Jamaican Dollar (JMD) as its official currency. The Jamaican Dollar is abbreviated as \\"J\\" to differentiate it from other dollar-denominated currencies, such as the US Dollar (USD), Canadian Dollar (CAD), and Australian Dollar (AUD). The Jamaican Dollar was introduced in 1969, replacing the Jamaican Pound, when the country decided to adopt the decimal currency system. The Jamaican Dollar is divided into 100 smaller units known as cents. However, due to the low value of cents, they are rarely used, and transactions typically occur in whole dollar amounts. The Central Bank of Jamaica is responsible for issuing and managing the Jamaican currency, which is available in both notes and coins. Coins currently in circulation include the following denominations: 1, 5, 10, and 20. The 20 coin was introduced in 2000 to commemorate the new millennium and quickly gained popularity as a commonly used denomination. On the other hand, the 1 cent, 10 cent, and 25 cent coins, previously circulated, have been gradually phased out and are now rarely used in everyday transactions. Banknotes are available in denominations of 50, 100, 500, 1,000, and 5,000. Each denomination features portraits of famous Jamaican historical figures and national symbols. For example, the 50 note features Samuel Sharpe, a Jamaican national hero who played a significant role in the abolition of slavery. The 100 note features the portrait of Sir Donald Sangster, the former Prime Minister of Jamaica. The 500, 1,000, and 5,000 notes feature the faces of Nanny of the Maroons, Michael Manley, and Hugh Shearer, respectively, all important individuals in Jamaica's history and politics. Jamaica is a popular tourist destination, so it is common for foreign currencies, particularly the US Dollar, to be accepted in various establishments, especially within the tourism industry. However, it is essential to understand the exchange rate when making transactions with foreign currency, as conversion rates can vary between businesses. Additionally, using Jamaican Dollars in local establishments and outside of major tourist hotspots is generally more convenient and cost-effective. In conclusion, Jamaica uses the Jamaican Dollar as its official currency, with coins in denominations of 1, 5, 10, and 20, and banknotes in denominations of 50, 100, 500, 1,000, and 5,000. It is important for travelers to familiarize themselves with the local currency and exchange rates to ensure smooth transactions during their visit to the country."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Do Phil Collins and Bobby Fuller have the same nationality?

The doctor diagnosed Victoria with diabetes and not Laura, due to the fact that","response":"Victoria exhibited more prominent symptoms and risk factors associated with the disease. Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects the way the body processes glucose, a type of sugar found in blood. There are two primary forms of diabetes: Type 1, which tends to appear in childhood or young adulthood, and Type 2, which is usually diagnosed in adults. Several key factors played a role in the doctor's decision to diagnose Victoria with diabetes and not Laura. First and foremost, Victoria's family history of diabetes was a significant factor. According to various medical studies, having a first-degree relative, such as a parent or sibling, with diabetes increases the likelihood of developing the disease. Victoria's mother had a history of Type 2 diabetes, whereas Laura's family had no such incidences. This crucial information led the doctor to pay closer attention to Victoria's symptoms and health indicators. Another contributing factor in the doctor's diagnosis was Victoria's weight and lifestyle. Victoria's body mass index (BMI) was in the obese range, putting her at a higher risk for developing Type 2 diabetes. In contrast, Laura maintained a healthy BMI, which decreased her chances of developing the disease. Furthermore, Victoria had a generally sedentary lifestyle, with long hours at the office and minimal physical activity. On the other hand, Laura engaged in regular exercise and physical activity, further reducing her risk of diabetes. Victoria also presented with noticeable symptoms associated with diabetes. She frequently complained of increased thirst and urination, known as polydipsia and polyuria, which are classical signs of high blood sugar levels. Her appetite was unusually high, despite consistent weight gain – another common symptom. Moreover, Victoria had been experiencing persistent fatigue, blurred vision, and slow-healing cuts and bruises, all of which pointed toward a possible diabetes diagnosis. Laura, however, did not exhibit any of these symptoms. In addition to the above factors, Victoria's medical tests provided more evidence of diabetes. Blood tests revealed elevated blood sugar levels and an alarming glycated hemoglobin (A1C) score, both of which are indicative of diabetes. These results were consistent with Victoria's symptoms, and the data further cemented the doctor's belief that she was dealing with diabetes. In contrast, Laura's blood tests returned normal results, and she did not display any abnormalities in her A1C score or glucose levels. Lastly, the doctor considered potential alternative explanations for Victoria and Laura's symptoms before concluding that Victoria had diabetes. They carefully reviewed their medical histories and carefully ruled out other potential causes for Victoria's symptoms, such as thyroid issues, medication side effects, or other health conditions. In the end, the doctor felt confident in diagnosing Victoria with diabetes, given the numerous supporting factors. In summary, the doctor diagnosed Victoria with diabetes and not Laura due to significant differences in their medical histories, lifestyles, symptoms, and test results. Victoria's strong family history of diabetes, higher BMI, sedentary lifestyle, and the presence of classic diabetes symptoms made her an ideal candidate for diagnosis. Additionally, blood tests confirmed Victoria's elevated blood sugar levels and A1C score, while Laura's results were normal. The doctor's careful consideration of all these factors ultimately led to a well-reasoned and accurate diagnosis for both patients."},{"question":"Tokyo: The world's oldest man, retired Japanese silkworm breeder Yukichi Chuganji, died in his home at the age of 114, on Monday.

The news highlights that in New Jersey, 84 percent of cell phone owners who participated in a telephone survey said they would support a state ban on the use of cell phones while driving. However, 42 percent of cell phone owners also admitted to using the devices \\"very often\\" or \\"sometimes\\" while driving. Although a majority of participants agreed that a ban would be favorable, only 38 percent believed such a ban would be easy to enforce. This suggests that there is a general consensus among a majority of Americans disliking the act of using cell phones while driving, leading to the idea that such a ban may be implemented in the future to address this issue. This idea is supported by the fact that a significant percentage of cell phone owners themselves would support a state ban on the use of cell phones while driving, despite some of them admitting to partaking in the behavior. However, the efficacy of such a ban might be questionable, given that only a small percentage of survey participants believe that it would be easy to enforce the ban. This could be due to the prevalence of the behavior and the difficulty in monitoring and penalizing drivers for using cell phones while driving. Nonetheless, the main idea presented in the news story is that using cell phones while driving will likely be banned due to most Americans' disapproval of the practice."},{"question":"Write an article based on this \\"Plan your delivery route of the tub from the curb to the foundation.

Have you ever seen a big, bubbly hot tub and wished you could have one too? Setting up a hot tub is like putting a giant puzzle together, and today I will explain how it's done! 1. Plan your delivery route First, we need to move the big, heavy tub from the curb (like the edge of the side street) to the foundation (the steady place where it will stay). Imagine you have a giant toy car, even bigger than you! You have to make a clear road for it to reach your play area. Think about the bumps, turns, and obstacles along the way. Can the rims and the giant toy car fit through your door? The same goes for the hot tub. We have to make sure there is a clear path for it to be moved without any issues. This might include moving some things out of the way or trimming trees and bushes. 2. Assemble the hot tub Now, it's time to put the hot tub together–like a giant Lego set! The hot tub has many parts, like the big tub, cover, steps, and control panel. With the help of some grown-ups, we need to follow the instructions and put each piece in the right place. Remember, sometimes it's better to ask for help when things get too heavy or tricky! 3. Hook up the electricity You know how your toys need batteries to make them work? The hot tub needs electricity too. But don't worry, there are special grown-ups called electricians who know how to safely give power to the hot tub. When everything is hooked up correctly, the hot tub can drive water into the jets, and it can warm it like a cozy bath! 4. Prepare the hot tub for use Finally, it's time to get the hot tub ready, like when you fill up a bubble bath. First, we add water to the hot tub–but not too much! We have to make sure to follow the level markings inside. Next, we need to add some special chemicals, like tiny, safe cleaning helpers. They make sure the water stays clean and safe to use. Grown-ups will help with this part, too. Last, we turn on the hot tub and let it warm up. Once it's ready, you can jump in for a super fun and splashy time! And that's it, little ones! Keep in mind that hot tubs can be very warm, so you should always have a grown-up nearby when you're in one. Safety is important, and we want you to have a bubbly good time! Now you know how a hot tub is set up. Next time you see one or even get to use one, you'll know about the exciting process it took to put it together. Happy splashing!"},{"question":"Will Donald Trump really build that wall? Here’s a new research tool for finding out which promises presidents keep. By Annelise Russell March 26 In a primary season filled with outlandish policy promises, one has stood out: Donald Trump’s pledge to strong-arm Mexico into paying for and building a wall to stop undocumented immigrants from crossing into the United States. Many observers view Trump’s remarks as nothing more than “cheap talk,” aimed at consolidating support during a competitive primary season. But say he gets elected in November. What happens when the public demands action? A new website by the Comparative Agendas Project, comparativeagendas.net, offers tools to answer this and other questions about how leaders actually govern. In policy areas such as immigration, CAP collects and categorizes policy data and solutions for researchers to analyze. The new online platform — a collaboration by global policy scholars and the University of Texas at Austin — includes a data repository and visualization tool that gives anyone the opportunity to compare previously unavailable policy data across political systems. Let’s look at immigration to get an example of how the database works. Republican immigration rhetoric might give the impression that immigration is the most important issue on the next president’s agenda. But historically, immigration has taken a very narrow slice of presidential attention. And that’s true not just in the United States. Despite increasing rhetoric about migration around the world, advanced democracies routinely ignore immigration, at least compared with the attention they give other policy areas. How do we know this? By analyzing the relative importance of immigration policy in presidential agendas. The Comparative Agendas Project measures executive priorities as expressed in State of the Union speeches. And there, the focus on immigration is pretty small. Here’s how we do it. The project goes through State of the Union speeches. In each sentence, it codes the policy area being discussed. Researchers categorize policy according to 20 major and 220 minor policy topics. The scheme is consistent across political systems and across the types of policy outputs — whether those be U.S. executive speeches, Belgian news coverage or Danish parliamentary questions. Many countries use executive speeches to highlight the upcoming legislative agenda. Using the project’s Web tool, we chart executive speeches in the United States and the United Kingdom for the period 1982 to 2014. Immigration, we find, never takes up more than 3 percent of a president’s State of the Union speech. And that’s even in recent years. For long periods from 1970 through the 1990s, immigration wasn’t even mentioned. The new CAP platform builds off the U.S. Policy Agendas Project, started by Bryan Jones and Frank Baumgartner in 1993 as a way to establish consistent and comparable measures of policy over time. CAP extends their policy-coding scheme beyond U.S. federal analyses to about 20 nations, enabling researchers to measure issues like immigration across a number of countries and governing systems. Looking at executive speeches across Europe, we find similarly scant mentions of immigration as a priority. Since 1990, immigration has never totaled more than 5 percent of executive speeches in the United States or the United Kingdom. Even so, look at the figure below to note the expansion of the topic during the past 20 years in both countries. Over a longer timespan, executives in the United States and the United Kingdom alike spend relatively few words on immigration in addresses to the nation. During the first decade of the 2000s, immigration rose dramatically on the agenda, revealing that the topic has grabbed a larger portion of the executives’ agendas. On the other hand, mentions have declined since 2009, perhaps because of the economic crisis. We can test that speculation by examining the focus on macroeconomics by political executives, but we also find increased interest as a percentage of statements for the United Kingdom, in particular, during the 1980s. Immigration may be a hot-button issue for U.S. candidates on the campaign trail — it is certainly “sexier” than interest rates or price controls — but in practice, immigration is not a traditional presidential agenda item in the United States or elsewhere. And any researcher who has a hunch or a question about whether some other subject is often more talked about than actually put on the agenda — or vice versa — is welcome to check the CAP project. Annelise Russell is a government PhD candidate at the University of Texas at Austin and director of undergraduate research and education for the U.S. Policy Agendas Project. What is a short summary of the above article?","response":"The Comparative Agendas Project (CAP) has developed a new tool to help predict which promises a president will keep.

He could perhaps be good if he learned to think along with his pummeling. Despite all of this, Hector is a hard worker on a Texas farm who does what he can to provide for his ailing mother which includes pulling in a few side dollars from small-time, illegal gambling fights. Tito, a \\"coyote\\" (a person who helps smuggle people across the border) spends his days as a snake catcher but at night, helps smuggle immigrants across the border. After winning a fight in a local mechanic's garage, Hector tries to get another fight but the entertainment is interrupted by Tito who scolds both Hector and the owner due to the fact that Tito could get into more trouble for illegal gambling fights as if smuggling illegals across the border isn't enough. Corralled, Hector goes to change but is followed in by another illegal; Maria. It soon becomes known that they grew up together as kids and it also becomes apparent that Hector dislikes her (mostly because of her sarcastic teasing). Tito hands Hector medicine for his mother and the three head back to the farm where they all work. After settling all of the immigrants in, Maria goes into her own suite with Hector and makes herself at home despite Hector being less than welcoming. Hector then goes to his mother Rosa to give her the medicine but it becomes apparent that she is getting worse. Hector begs her to not go out to the fields the next day but she declines stating \\"No work, no pay\\".

We had dance shows and baseball games in the street. In short, we had everything we ever needed because we had each other. I have come to realize that there are so many reasons that sisters make a difference to your life and I can give you a few here: They get you. Your sisters have grown up with you so they know the entire back story of your situation and everything leading to it. They may not agree with you all the time but they never wonder why you do what you do or say what you say. They have suffered with you through awful times. I know that when one of my sisters is unhappy, I am unhappy too. When some non-family member tries to hurt you, the claws of them will come out! They have cheered you on. Sisters do get jealous at times but, even so, they are happy that you are doing well. They _ at your new bonus as long as you take them out for drinks and fattening appetizers!

The passage focuses on the author's experiences growing up with sisters and the positive aspects of having sisters, but does not specifically give advice for those having upsets with their sisters."},{"question":"Question: Process: - Waste products are deposited in the blood - Blood is carried to the kidneys through the renal arteries - The kidneys contain filters inside - The filters capture the waste products - The waste is combined with water to make urine - The urine leaves the kidney and is collected in the bladder - The cleaned blood is returned to the body. suppose less water combined with waste to make urine happens, how will it affect LESS waste being removed from the body. Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","response":"The supposed perturbation is \\"indirectly impacting a step of the process\\". Explanation: Let's consider each step of the process in detail. You're suggesting a change in the amount of water combined with waste to make urine. This does not directly alter any of the individual steps; the steps all technically remain the same - waste products are still deposited in the blood, carried to the kidneys, filtered, captured, and combined with water to make urine. However, by changing the quantity of water that's combined with waste, the efficiency or outcome of the overall process is indirectly affected. Specifically, less water combined with the waste could potentially concentrate the urine more, causing LESS waste to be removed from the body. While the action of combining waste with water is still happening (thus it's not directly impacted), the overall balance and final outcome of the process is altered. This could potentially lead to different health outcomes for the organism in question. For example, highly concentrated urine could potentially lead to kidney stones. This makes the disturbance an indirect impact on the process."},{"question":"Given the question: Information: - In epistemology, rationalism is the view that \\"regards reason as the chief source and test of knowledge\\" or \\"any view appealing to reason as a source of knowledge or justification\\". More formally, rationalism is defined as a methodology or a theory \\"in which the criterion of the truth is not sensory but intellectual and deductive\\". - A capital market is a financial market in which long-term debt or equity-backed securities are bought and sold. Capital markets are defined as markets in which money is provided for periods longer than a year. Capital markets channel the wealth of savers to those who can put it to long-term productive use, such as companies or governments making long-term investments. Financial regulators, such as the Bank of England (BoE) or the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), oversee the capital markets in their jurisdictions to protect investors against fraud, among other duties. - Medicine (British English ; American English ) is the science and practice of the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease. The word \\"medicine\\" is derived from Latin \\"medicus\\", meaning \\"a physician\\". Medicine encompasses a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness. Contemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences, biomedical research, genetics, and medical technology to diagnose, treat, and prevent injury and disease, typically through pharmaceuticals or surgery, but also through therapies as diverse as psychotherapy, external splints and traction, medical devices, biologics, and ionizing radiation, amongst others. - The University of Siena (abbreviation: UNISI) in Siena, Tuscany is one of the oldest and first publicly funded universities in Italy. Originally called \\"Studium Senese\\", the institution was founded in 1240. It had around 20,000 students in 2006, nearly half of Siena's total population of around 54,000. Today, the University of Siena is best known for its Schools of Law and Medicine. - Latium is the region of central western Italy in which the city of Rome was founded and grew to be the capital city of the Roman Empire. Latium was originally a small triangle of fertile, volcanic soil on which resided the tribe of the Latins or Latians. It was located on the left bank (east and south) of the Tiber river, extending northward to the Anio river (a left-bank tributary of the Tiber) and southeastward to the Pomptina Palus (Pontine Marshes, now the Pontine Fields) as far south as the Circeian promontory. The right bank of the Tiber was occupied by the Etruscan city of Veii, and the other borders were occupied by Italic tribes. Subsequently, Rome defeated Veii and then its Italic neighbors, expanding Latium to the Apennine Mountains in the northeast and to the opposite end of the marsh in the southeast. The modern descendant, the Italian \\"Regione\\" of Lazio, also called \\"Latium\\" in Latin, and occasionally in modern English, is somewhat larger still, but not as much as double the original Latium. - Rome is a city and special \\"comune\\" (named \\"Roma Capitale\\") in Italy. Rome is the capital of Italy and of the Lazio region. With 2,870,336 residents in , it is also the country's largest and most populated \\"comune\\" and fourth-most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. The Metropolitan City of Rome has a population of 4.3 million residents. The city is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of Tiber river. The Vatican City is an independent country geographically located within the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason Rome has been often defined as capital of two states. - Marxism is a method of socioeconomic analysis that analyzes class relations and societal conflict using a materialist interpretation of historical development and a dialectical view of social transformation. It originates from the mid-to-late 19th century works of German philosophers Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. - Kantian ethics refers to a deontological ethical theory ascribed to the German philosopher Immanuel Kant. The theory, developed as a result of Enlightenment rationalism, is based on the view that the only intrinsically good thing is a good will; an action can only be good if its maximthe principle behind itis duty to the moral law. Central to Kant's construction of the moral law is the categorical imperative, which acts on all people, regardless of their interests or desires. Kant formulated the categorical imperative in various ways. His principle of universalizability requires that, for an action to be permissible, it must be possible to apply it to all people without a contradiction occurring. His formulation of humanity as an end in itself requires that humans are never treated merely as a means to an end, but always also as ends in themselves. The formulation of autonomy concludes that rational agents are bound to the moral law by their own will, while Kant's concept of the Kingdom of Ends requires that people act as if the principles of their actions establish a law for a hypothetical kingdom. Kant also distinguished between perfect and imperfect duties. A perfect duty, such as the duty not to lie, always holds true; an imperfect duty, such as the duty to give to charity, can be made flexible and applied in particular time and place. - Vatican City , officially Vatican City State or the State of Vatican City, is a walled enclave within the city of Rome. With an area of approximately 44 hectares (110 acres), and a population of 842, it is the smallest State in the world by both area and population, but formally it is not sovereign, sovereignty being held by the Holy See, the only entity of public international law that has diplomatic relations with almost every country in the world. - Friedrich Engels (or 28 November 1820 5 August 1895) was a German philosopher, social scientist, journalist, and businessman. He founded Marxist theory together with Karl Marx. In 1845, he published \\"The Condition of the Working Class in England\\", based on personal observations and research in Manchester. - Karl Marx (5 May 1818 14 March 1883) was a German-born scientist, philosopher, economist, sociologist, journalist, and revolutionary socialist. Born in Trier to a middle-class family, he later studied political economy and Hegelian philosophy. As an adult, Marx became stateless and spent much of his life in London, England, where he continued to develop his thought in collaboration with German thinker Friedrich Engels and published various works, the most well-known being the 1848 pamphlet \\"The Communist Manifesto\\". His work has since influenced subsequent intellectual, economic, and political history. - Capitalism is an economic system based on private ownership of the means of production and their operation for profit. Characteristics central to capitalism include private property, capital accumulation, wage labor, voluntary exchange, a price system, and competitive markets. In a capitalist market economy, decision-making and investment is determined by the owners of the factors of production in financial and capital markets, and prices and the distribution of goods are mainly determined by competition in the market. - Economic determinism is a theory that economic relationships (such as being an owner or capitalist, or being a worker or proletarian) are the foundation upon which all other social and political arrangements in society are based. The theory stresses that societies are divided into competing economic classes whose relative political power is determined by the nature of the economic system. In the version associated with Karl Marx, the emphasis is on the proletariat who are considered to be locked in a class struggle with the capitalist class, which will eventually end with the revolutionary overthrow of the capitalist system and the gradual development of socialism. Marxist thinkers have dismissed plain and unilateral economic determinism as a form of \\"vulgar Marxism\\", or \\"economism\\", nowhere included in Marx's works. - Economism is reduction of all social facts to economic dimensions. The term is often used to criticize economics as an ideology, in which supply and demand are the only important factors in decisions, and outstrip or permit ignoring all other factors. It is believed to be a side effect of neoclassical economics and blind faith in an \\"invisible hand\\" or \\"laissez-faire\\" means of making decisions, extended far beyond controlled and regulated markets, and used to make political and military decisions. Conventional ethics would play no role in decisions under pure economism, except insofar as supply would be withheld, demand curtailed, by moral choices of individuals. Thus, critics of economism insist on political and other cultural dimensions in society. - Law is a system of rules that are created and enforced through social or governmental institutions to regulate behavior. State-enforced laws can be made by a collective legislature or by a single legislator, resulting in statutes, by the executive through decrees and regulations, or established by judges through precedent, normally in common law jurisdictions. Private individuals can create legally binding contracts, including arbitration agreements that may elect to accept alternative arbitration to the normal court process. The formation of laws themselves may be influenced by a constitution, written or tacit, and the rights encoded therein. The law shapes politics, economics, history and society in various ways and serves as a mediator of relations between people. - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state. - Determinism is the philosophical position that for every event there exist conditions that could cause no other event. \\"There are many determinisms, depending on what pre-conditions are considered to be determinative of an event or action.\\" Deterministic theories throughout the history of philosophy have sprung from diverse and sometimes overlapping motives and considerations. Some forms of determinism can be empirically tested with ideas from physics and the philosophy of physics. The opposite of determinism is some kind of indeterminism (otherwise called \\"nondeterminism\\"). Determinism is often contrasted with free will. - Competition is, in general, a contest or rivalry between two or more organisms, animals, individuals, economic groups or social groups, etc., for territory, a niche, for resources, goods, for mates, for prestige, recognition, for awards, for group or social status, or for leadership and profit. It arises whenever at least two parties strive for a goal which cannot be shared, where one's gain is the other's loss (a zero-sum game). - The concept of universalizability was set out by the 18th-century German philosopher Immanuel Kant as part of his work \\"Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals\\". It is part of the first formulation of his categorical imperative, which states that the only morally acceptable maxims of our actions are those that could rationally be willed to be universal law. - A market economy is an economic system where decisions regarding investment, production, and distribution are based on the interplay of supply and demand, which determines the prices of goods and services. The major defining characteristic of a market economy is that investment decisions, or the allocation of producer good, are primarily made through capital and financial markets. This is contrasted with a planned economy, where investment and production decisions are embodied in an integrated plan of production established by a state or other organizational body that controls the factors of production. - A revolution (from the Latin \\"revolutio\\", \\"a turn around\\") is a fundamental change in political power or organizational structures that takes place in a relatively short period of time when the population rises up in revolt against the current authorities. Aristotle described two types of political revolution: Revolutions have occurred through human history and vary widely in terms of methods, duration, and motivating ideology. Their results include major changes in culture, economy, and socio-political institutions. - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency. - Ernesto Screpanti ( born 1948 , Rome ) is a professor of Political Economy at the University of Siena . He worked on the \`\` rethinking Marxism '' research programme , in the attempt to update Marxist analysis by bringing it in line with the reality of contemporary capitalism , on the one hand , and to liberate Marxism from any residue of Hegelian metaphysics , Kantian ethics and economic determinism , on the other . What is the relationship between 'ernesto screpanti' and 'economist'? The answer is:","response":"Ernesto Screpanti is a professor of Political Economy at the University of Siena, and his work focuses on rethinking Marxism and updating Marxist analysis in the context of contemporary capitalism. As a political economist, he examines economic systems, policies, and theories, which makes him closely related to the field of economics. Therefore, the relationship between Ernesto Screpanti and 'economist' is that he can be considered an economist, specializing in political economy and Marxism."},{"question":"Given the question: I went to eat in a restaurant, but I left because the person at the front wasn't what? A. drinking wine B. make reservations C. polite D. spit on me E. prepared to pay The best answer is The answer is:","response":"C. polite Step 1: Analyze the question for context and possible clues. The question states that the person left the restaurant because the person at the front wasn't \\"what\\". This implies a negative behavior or action that would cause someone to leave. Step 2: Evaluate each option based on the context. A. drinking wine - Drinking wine is not necessarily a negative action, and it's unlikely to make someone leave a restaurant solely because of that. B. make reservations - This option does not make sense grammatically, and making reservations is not something one would expect the person at the front to do for a customer. C. polite - This fits the context of a negative behavior that could make someone leave a restaurant. If the person at the front was rude or impolite, it could create an unpleasant atmosphere that would cause the person to leave. D. spit on me - Although this is quite a negative action, it is a bit extreme and uncommon, making it a less likely choice. E. prepared to pay - This option is irrelevant to the person at front's behavior and does not fit with the scenario of someone leaving a restaurant due to the person at the front. Step 3: Select the best answer based on the analysis. Option C. polite is the best answer because it matches the context and appropriately answers the question of why someone would leave a restaurant due to the person at the front's behavior."},{"question":"poland 's finance minister on friday rejected eu criticism of the country 's bloated budget deficit and accused the european commission of refusing to accept that the polish economy had improved .

A:","response":"Early humans, also known as hominids, first emerged in Africa around 6-7 million years ago, and from there, they gradually migrated to different regions of the world. As several stages in human evolution took place over millions of years, it helps to be more specific about the different stages of early humans to grasp the geographic distribution of their existence. 1. The first hominids, Ardipithecus, lived in Eastern Africa (Ethiopia) around 5.8 to 4.4 million years ago. They were bipedal and mainly dwelled in wooded areas. 2. Australopithecines, appearing around 4 million years ago, predominantly inhabited Eastern Africa in present-day countries such as Ethiopia, Kenya, and Tanzania. The famous \\"Lucy\\" specimen belongs to this group. They lived in both wooded and grasland areas, and were known for their small stature and different walking styles compared to modern humans. 3. Homo habilis, existing around 2.4 to 1.4 million years ago, were also found in Eastern Africa. They had more human-like features, such as larger brains and more advanced tools, which they used for various tasks like butchering meat. Homo habilis lived in both forests and grasslands. 4. Homo erectus emerged around 2 million years ago and marked the beginning of early human migration out of Africa. They lived in regions that are now part of Ethiopia, Kenya, South Africa, Georgia, Indonesia, and China. With their even larger brain, more advanced tools, and the ability to use fire, Homo erectus were a significant milestone in human evolution. 5. The Neanderthals, Homo neanderthalensis, first appeared around 400,000 to 40,000 years ago. They lived mainly in Europe and western Asia in regions corresponding to modern-day France, Spain, Germany, England, and Russia. Neanderthals were skilled hunters, adapted to cold climates, and had a complex cultural life. 6. Finally, Homo sapiens, which encompasses modern humans, originated in Africa around 315,000 years ago. Approximately 70,000 to 50,000 years ago, they began migrating out of Africa, gradually spreading throughout Europe, Asia, Australia, and the Americas. With advanced cognitive abilities and sophisticated tools, Homo sapiens were able to adapt to a multitude of habitats, including arctic, jungle, desert, and mountain environments. In conclusion, early humans lived in various parts of the world as they evolved and migrated across continents. Eastern Africa was the epicenter for many early hominid species, while Europe and Asia became homes to later-evolved species such as the Neanderthals and modern humans. Homo sapiens eventually spread throughout every continent, adapting to a plethora of environments and establishing themselves as the most developed and dominant species of early humans."},{"question":"In this task, you are given a conversation, and your task is to generate a summary from the information present in the given conversation.

A computer requires programs to function, and typically executes the program's instructions in a central processing unit. - Computer hardware is the collection of physical components that constitute a computer system. Computer hardware is the physical parts or components of a computer, such as monitor, keyboard, computer data storage, hard disk drive (HDD), graphic card, sound card, memory (RAM), motherboard, and so on, all of which are tangible physical objects. By contrast, software is instructions that can be stored and run by hardware. - A software engineer is a person who applies the principles of software engineering to the design, development, maintenance, testing, and evaluation of the software and systems that make computers or anything containing software work. - In computing , mechanisms and techniques for managing services often differ by operating system . Examples of operating system service management are : Service Control Manager - Used by Microsoft Windows launchd - Used by Apple OS X Systemd - Used by most Linux Upstart - Used by Google Chrome OS Service Management Facility - Used by Oracle Solaris Android init - Used by Google Android sysvinit - Used by older Unix - like operating systems cygserver - Used by Cygwin runit - Used by Void - An information system (IS) is any organized system for the collection, organization, storage and communication of information. More specifically, it is the study of complementary networks that people and organizations use to collect, filter, process, create and distribute data. - Information is that which informs. In other words, it is the answer to a question of some kind. It is thus related to data and knowledge, as data represents values attributed to parameters, and knowledge signifies understanding of real things or abstract concepts. As it regards data, the information's existence is not necessarily coupled to an observer (it exists beyond an event horizon, for example), while in the case of knowledge, the information requires a cognitive observer. - Computer science is the study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers. It is the scientific and practical approach to computation and its applications and the systematic study of the feasibility, structure, expression, and mechanization of the methodical procedures (or algorithms) that underlie the acquisition, representation, processing, storage, communication of, and access to information. An alternate, more succinct definition of computer science is the study of automating algorithmic processes that scale. A computer scientist specializes in the theory of computation and the design of computational systems. - Computing is any goal-oriented activity requiring, benefiting from, or creating a mathematical sequence of steps known as an algorithm e.g. through computers. Computing includes designing, developing and building hardware and software systems; processing, structuring, and managing various kinds of information; doing scientific research on and with computers; making computer systems behave intelligently; and creating and using communications and entertainment media. The field of computing includes computer engineering, software engineering, computer science, information systems, and information technology. - Software engineering (SWE) is the application of engineering to the development of software in a systematic method. - A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out an arbitrary set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. The ability of computers to follow a sequence of operations, called a \\"program\\", make computers very flexible and useful. Such computers are used as control systems for a very wide variety of industrial and consumer devices. This includes simple special purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls, factory devices such as industrial robots and computer assisted design, but also in general purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices such as smartphones. The Internet is run on computers and it connects millions of other computers. - Computer engineering is a discipline that integrates several fields of electrical engineering and computer science required to develop computer hardware and software. Computer engineers usually have training in electronic engineering (or electrical engineering), software design, and hardware-software integration instead of only software engineering or electronic engineering. Computer engineers are involved in many hardware and software aspects of computing, from the design of individual microcontrollers, microprocessors, personal computers, and supercomputers, to circuit design. This field of engineering not only focuses on how computer systems themselves work, but also how they integrate into the larger picture. - In electronic systems and computing, firmware is a type of software that provides control, monitoring and data manipulation of engineered products and systems. Typical examples of devices containing firmware are embedded systems (such as traffic lights, consumer appliances, remote controls and digital watches), computers, computer peripherals, mobile phones, and digital cameras.

Report the number of Quorans who consider themselves asexual based on this sample. The second question asks about viewing private Instagram accounts without following them. Comparing the two questions, it's clear they are asking different things. The first question focuses on the number of Quorans with a specific sexual orientation, while the second question revolves around accessing private Instagram content. So the answer to the question, \\"Are these two questions asking the same thing?\\" is: a). no"},{"question":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Immediately after , everyone crowded round the table , and started interrogating me about him . Why does she tell me about a lawyer ?","response":"It seems that she is telling you about the lawyer for a number of possible reasons. Below are a few potential explanations as to why she brought up the lawyer in this context. 1. Friendly match-making: She might be playing the role of a matchmaker, attempting to pair you up with someone she thinks may be a suitable partner for you. The fact that the lawyer seems \\"not bad\\", not attached, and presumably successful in his career may contribute to her belief that he could be a good match. She might be unaware of your current attachment and thought it would be helpful to suggest a potential romantic interest based on her assessment of the person. 2. Encouraging social connections: She might want you to expand your social circle, and mentioning the lawyer is simply an invitation for you to get to know someone new. She may believe that knowing more people, especially those in different professional fields, can provide enriching experiences or networking opportunities which could be beneficial in various aspects of life. 3. Comparison and gentle nudging: Another possibility is that she may want to understand more about your current attachment by indirectly prompting you to share details about the person you're involved with. By mentioning the lawyer, she is essentially creating an opportunity for you and others present to discuss your love interest and compare the two individuals. 4. Testing your commitment: She may be trying to gauge your commitment to your current romantic partner. Suggesting another potential partner, like the lawyer, is a way to see how confidently and assertively you defend your decision to be with the person you are attached to. This might provide her with insights into your feelings and the seriousness of the relationship. 5. Miscommunication or misunderstanding: Lastly, it is possible that the situation resulted from a miscommunication or misunderstanding on her part. She could have thought that you were open to meeting new people for romantic possibilities, or she might have mentioned the lawyer simply as a topic of conversation. In conclusion, there could be several reasons why she would mention the lawyer to you, ranging from friendly match-making to attempting to better understand your current romantic situation. It's important to consider the context and the relationship you have with her, as well as your personal feelings and preferences, in order to determine her underlying intentions in bringing up the lawyer."},{"question":"Survey Roundup: IT Pressed for Time on Breach Investigations A look at some recent surveys and reports dealing with risk and compliance issues.

Question: Who did Darwin see as savages comparable to animals Context: In December 1831, he joined the Beagle expedition as a gentleman naturalist and geologist. He read Charles Lyell's Principles of Geology and from the first stop ashore, at St. Jago, found Lyell's uniformitarianism a key to the geological history of landscapes. Darwin discovered fossils resembling huge armadillos, and noted the geographical distribution of modern species in hope of finding their \\"centre of creation\\". The three Fuegian missionaries the expedition returned to Tierra del Fuego were friendly and civilised, yet to Darwin their relatives on the island seemed \\"miserable, degraded savages\\", and he no longer saw an unbridgeable gap between humans and animals. As the Beagle neared England in 1836, he noted that species might not be fixed. A:","response":"From the context provided, Darwin saw the relatives of the three Fuegian missionaries in Tierra del Fuego as savages comparable to animals."},{"question":"Continue the following story. In order to clean his mess, the boy brought napkins and towels. However, the Pick your answer from: [a]. napkins were too weak.. [b]. towels were too weak..","response":"[b]. towels were too weak.. As he began to wipe down the spilled juice on the kitchen floor, he quickly realized that the towels were too weak for the job at hand. These weren't the usual sturdy towels he was accustomed to using; these were thin and began to disintegrate as soon as they encountered the sticky liquid. He frowned in frustration, not wanting to leave the kitchen a disaster. The boy deduced that these were likely bargain-brand towels, which lacked the same absorbing capabilities as a higher-quality towel. Desperate to clean the mess, he unearthed more towels from the cabinet underneath the kitchen sink, his frustration mounting as towel after towel shredded in his hands, leaving a trail of pulpy debris in the spilled juice. Realizing that weak towels alone would not suffice, the boy searched for alternative methods to clean the spill. He glanced around and noticed a mop and bucket in the corner of the room. Rushing over to them, he filled the bucket with warm water and added a few squirts of dish soap, creating a frothy mixture to aid in cleaning the mess. Pushing the mop into the slippery juice, the boy scrubbed the floor with as much vigor as he could muster, attending to even the smallest corners and spaces to ensure the entirety of the spill was addressed. He rinsed the mop in the bucket of soapy water periodically and wrung it out to avoid leaving new puddles behind. The cleaning process took considerably longer than he had hoped or anticipated; still, he remained persistent in the pursuit of cleanliness, determined to make the kitchen shine again. Nearly an hour had passed before the boy finally stood upright, his back aching slightly from the labor-intensive cleaning. Breathing a sigh of relief, he surveyed the now spotless kitchen floor, beaming with pride at his accomplishment. The once sticky, slippery mess was now but a distant memory in his mind, replaced by a surface so clean, one could imagine eating off it - though he wouldn't personally recommend that. Exhausted from his unanticipated venture, the boy gathered the destroyed towels, the mop, and the bucket of dirty water. He responsibly discarded the torn towels, rinsed the mop, and emptied the bucket outside. This experience, while frustrating at first, taught him a valuable lesson on the importance of quality cleaning supplies and perseverance in the face of adversity. Heading back inside, he took one last look at his now immaculate kitchen, satisfied that he had successfully turned the situation around. A faint, contented smile graced his lips as he left the room, leaving behind the once chaotic mess in favor of moving on to his next adventure. And, he reminded himself, the next time he encountered a spill, he would be better prepared with stronger, more durable towels."},{"question":"Premise: \\"An old man kneels upon the dock while he prepares his fishing pole for use.\\" Based on this premise, can we conclude that the hypothesis \\"The man is fishing for shark.\\" is true?

Chartwell is a country house near the town of Westerham, Kent in South East England. For over forty years it was the home of Winston Churchill. He bought the property in September 1922 and lived there until shortly before his death in January 1965. In the 1930s, when Churchill was excluded from political office, Chartwell became the centre of his world. At his dining table, he gathered those who could assist his campaign against German re-armament and the British government's response of appeasement; in his study, he composed speeches and wrote books; in his garden, he built walls, constructed lakes and painted. During the Second World War Chartwell was largely unused, the Churchills returning after he lost the 1945 election. In 1953, when again Prime Minister, the house became Churchill's refuge when he suffered a devastating stroke. In October 1964, he left for the last time, dying at his London home, 28, Hyde Park Gate, on 24 January 1965. The origins of the estate reach back to the 14th century; in 1382 the property, then called Well-street, was sold by William-at-Well. It passed through various owners and in 1836 was auctioned, as a substantial, brick-built manor. In 1848, it was purchased by John Campbell Colquhoun, whose grandson sold it to Churchill. The Campbell Colquhouns greatly enlarged the house and the advertisement for its sale at the time of Churchill's purchase described it as an \\"imposing\\" mansion. Between 1922 and 1924, it was largely rebuilt and extended by the society architect Philip Tilden. From the garden front, the house has extensive views over the Weald of Kent, \\"the most beautiful and charming\\" Churchill had ever seen, and the determining factor in his decision to buy the house. In 1946, when financial constraints forced Churchill to again consider selling Chartwell, it was acquired by the National Trust with funds raised by a consortium of Churchill's friends led by Lord Camrose, on condition that the Churchills retain a life-tenancy. After Churchill's death, Lady Churchill... Answer:","response":"The full name of the person from whom Winston Churchill bought Chartwell is not explicitly mentioned in the article.

Brian Epstein managed the Beatles from 1962 until his death in 1967. He had no previous experience managing artists, but he had a strong influence on the group's dress code and attitude on stage. Lennon initially resisted his attempts to encourage the band to present a professional appearance, but eventually complied, saying, \\"I'll wear a bloody balloon if somebody's going to pay me.\\" McCartney took over on bass after Sutcliffe decided to stay in Hamburg, and Best was replaced with drummer Ringo Starr; this completed the four-piece line-up that would remain until the group's break-up in 1970.

They recorded their debut album, Please Please Me, in under 10 hours on 11 February 1963, a day when Lennon was suffering the effects of a cold, which is evident in the vocal on the last song to be recorded that day, \\"Twist and Shout\\". The Lennon–McCartney songwriting partnership yielded eight of its fourteen tracks. With a few exceptions, one being the album title itself, Lennon had yet to bring his love of wordplay to bear on his song lyrics, saying: \\"We were just writing songs ... pop songs with no more thought of them than that – to create a sound.

Today, we are profoundly dismayed that you no longer represent a symbol of hope, courage, and the undying defence of human rights. Kumi Naidoo, Secretary General, Amnesty International Share this Twitter Facebook Email On 11 November, Amnesty International’s Secretary General Kumi Naidoo wrote to Aung San Suu Kyi to inform her the organization is revoking the 2009 award. Half way through her term in office, and eight years after her release from house arrest, Naidoo expressed the organization’s disappointment that she had not used her political and moral authority to safeguard human rights, justice or equality in Myanmar, citing her apparent indifference to atrocities committed by the Myanmar military and increasing intolerance of freedom of expression. “As an Amnesty International Ambassador of Conscience, our expectation was that you would continue to use your moral authority to speak out against injustice wherever you saw it, not least within Myanmar itself,” wrote Kumi Naidoo. “Today, we are profoundly dismayed that you no longer represent a symbol of hope, courage, and the undying defence of human rights. Amnesty International cannot justify your continued status as a recipient of the Ambassador of Conscience award and so with great sadness we are hereby withdrawing it from you.” Perpetuating human rights violations Since Aung San Suu Kyi became the de facto leader of Myanmar’s civilian-led government in April 2016, her administration has been actively involved in the commission or perpetuation of multiple human rights violations. Amnesty International has repeatedly criticized the failure of Aung San Suu Kyi and her government to speak out about military atrocities against the Rohingya population in Rakhine State, who have lived for years under a system of segregation and discrimination amounting to apartheid. During the campaign of violence unleashed against the Rohingya last year the Myanmar security forces killed thousands, raped women and girls, detained and tortured men and boys, and burned hundreds of homes and villages to the ground. More than 720,000 Rohingya fled to Bangladesh. A UN report has called for senior military officials to be investigated and prosecuted for the crime of genocide. Her denial of the gravity and scale of the atrocities means there is little prospect of the situation improving for the hundreds of thousands of Rohingya living in limbo in Bangladesh or for the hundreds of thousands of Rohingya who remain in Rakhine State. Kumi Naidoo, Secretary General, Amnesty International Share this Twitter Facebook Email Although the civilian government does not have control over the military, Aung San Suu Kyi and her office have shielded the security forces from accountability by dismissing, downplaying or denying allegations of human rights violations and by obstructing international investigations into abuses. Her administration has actively stirred up hostility against the Rohingya, labelling them as “terrorists”, accusing them of burning their own homes and decrying “faking rape”. Meanwhile state media has published inflammatory and dehumanizing articles alluding to the Rohingya as “detestable human fleas” and “thorns” which must be pulled out. “Aung San Suu Kyi’s failure to speak out for the Rohingya is one reason why we can no longer justify her status as an Ambassador of Conscience,” said Kumi Naidoo. “Her denial of the gravity and scale of the atrocities means there is little prospect of the situation improving for the hundreds of thousands of Rohingya living in limbo in Bangladesh or for the hundreds of thousands of Rohingya who remain in Rakhine State. Without acknowledgement of the horrific crimes against the community, it is hard to see how the government can take steps to protect them from future atrocities.” Amnesty International also highlighted the situation in Kachin and northern Shan States, where Aung San Suu Kyi has failed to use her influence and moral authority to condemn military abuses, to push for accountability for war crimes or to speak out for ethnic minority civilians who bear the brunt of the conflicts. To make matters worse, her civilian-led administration has imposed harsh restrictions on humanitarian access, exacerbating the suffering of more than 100,000 people displaced by the fighting. Attacks on freedom of speech Despite the power wielded by the military, there are areas where the civilian-led government has considerable authority to enact reforms to better protect human rights, especially those relating to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly. But in the two years since Aung San Suu Kyi’s administration assumed power, human rights defenders, peaceful activists and journalists have been arrested and imprisoned while others face threats, harassment and intimidation for their work. Aung San Suu Kyi’s administration has failed to repeal repressive laws – including some of the same laws which were used to detain her and others campaigning for democracy and human rights. Instead, she has actively defended the use of such laws, in particular the decision to prosecute and imprison two Reuters journalists for their work documenting a Myanmar military massacre. Aung San Suu Kyi was named as Amnesty International’s Ambassador of Conscience in 2009, in recognition of her peaceful and non-violent struggle for democracy and human rights. At the time she was held under house arrest, which she was eventually released from exactly eight years ago today. When she was finally able to accept the award in 2012, Aung San Suu Kyi asked Amnesty International to “not take either your eyes or your mind off us and help us to be the country where hope and history merges.” “Amnesty International took Aung San Suu Kyi’s request that day very seriously, which is why we will never look away from human rights violations in Myanmar,” said Kumi Naidoo. “We will continue to fight for justice and human rights in Myanmar – with or without her support.” ||||| Amnesty International has withdrawn a prestigious human rights award from Aung San Suu Kyi, following what it described as a “shameful betrayal” of the values she once stood for. It is the latest in a series of accolades to be withdrawn from Aung San Suu Kyi, including the US Holocaust Museum’s Elie Weisel award and Freedom of the City awards, which were revoked by Edinburgh, Oxford, Glasgow and Newcastle. Amnesty International said on Monday that Aung San Suu Kyi, now Myanmar’s civilian leader, was no longer a symbol of hope, and that it had withdrawn its highest honour, the ambassador of conscience award. It cited her “apparent indifference” to atrocities committed against the Rohingya and her increasing intolerance of freedom of speech. Aung San Suu Kyi received the ambassador of conscience award in 2009, while under house arrest, for her role in championing peace and democracy. She was described as “a symbol of hope, courage and the undying defence of human rights” by Irene Khan, Amnesty International’s then secretary general. Kumi Naidoo, the organisation’s current secretary general, said in a letter to Aung San Suu Kyi that her ambassador title could no longer be justified. “Our expectation was that you would continue to use your moral authority to speak out against injustice wherever you saw it, not least within Myanmar itself,” Naidoo wrote in the letter. Aung San Suu Kyi has been widely accused of being apathetic or complicit in the plight of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar, who, the UN has warned, continue to be targeted in an “ongoing genocide”. Who are the Rohingya and what is happening in Myanmar? Read more More than 700,000 Rohingya people remain in Bangladesh, having fled a brutal military crackdown that began in August 2017. UN investigators said that during the campaign, Myanmar’s military carried out killings and gang rapes with “genocidal intent”, and called for the commander-in-chief and five generals to be prosecuted for the gravest crimes under international law. Yanghee Lee, the UN special investigator on human rights in Myanmar, said she believed Aung San Suu Kyi was in “total denial” about accusations of violence. “Without acknowledgement of the horrific crimes against the community, it is hard to see how the government can take steps to protect them from future atrocities,” said Naidoo. Amnesty International added that Aung San Suu Kyi’s administration had stirred up hatred against Rohingya by labelling them “terrorists”, obstructed international investigations into abuses, and failed to repeal repressive laws used to silence critics. In September, Aung San Suu Kyi defended the imprisonment of two Reuters journalists who were given seven-year jail terms after investigating the massacre of Rohingya Muslims in Rahkine state. The sentences were widely condemned by international governments, human rights groups and the UN as a miscarriage of justice and a symbol of the major regression of freedom of expression in Myanmar. ||||| YANGON: Myanmar authorities and citizens leapt to the defence of Aung San Suu Kyi Tuesday (Nov 13) after Amnesty International stripped her of its top award over indifference to atrocities committed against Rohingya Muslims, doubling down on support for the civilian leader in the face of global ire. Aung San Suu Kyi's international reputation as a rights icon is in pieces and Amnesty's move is the latest in a string of rescinded accolades. Advertisement Canada revoked her honorary citizenship last month and the US Holocaust Museum in March took back an award named after concentration camp survivor Elie Wiesel. Institutions that once showered Aung San Suu Kyi with titles are rapidly distancing themselves from a leader they argue is doing little in the face of alleged genocide and ethnic cleansing against its Rohingya minority. Amnesty's Ambassador of Conscience Award was bestowed in 2009 and other recipients include Nelson Mandela, Malala Yousafzai and Ai Wei Wei. \\"Today, we are profoundly dismayed that you no longer represent a symbol of hope, courage, and the undying defence of human rights,\\" Amnesty International chief Kumi Naidoo said in a letter to Aung San Suu Kyi released by the group. Advertisement Advertisement \\"Amnesty International cannot justify your continued status as a recipient of the Ambassador of Conscience award and so with great sadness we are hereby withdrawing it from you.\\" But domestically, Aung San Suu Kyi remains popular across vast swathes of Myanmar and within her party, the National League for Democracy, which won elections in 2015 ending decades of military-backed rule. The stripping of awards not only harms the \\"dignity\\" of Aung San Suu Kyi, but also that of all NLD members, the party's spokesman Myo Nyunt told AFP, adding he thought this was all part of a wider conspiracy. \\"All these organisations are working for the Bengalis who have left the country in order to get citizenship,\\" he said, using a pejorative term for the Rohingya that is widely accepted in Myanmar and falsely implies they are illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. Deputy Minister for Information Aung Hla Tun told AFP he was personally sad and disappointed by Amnesty's announcement and said Aung San Suu Kyi was being treated \\"unfairly\\". Such moves would only \\"make the people love her more\\", he added. People on the street in Yangon were defiant. \\"Their withdrawal is pretty childish. It's like when children aren't getting along with each other and take back their toys,\\" 50-year-old Khin Maung Aye said. \\"We don't need their prize,\\" said Htay Htay, 60. More than 720,000 Rohingya were driven over the border to Bangladesh in a crackdown that started in August 2017, and refugees have detailed horrific testimony of murder, rape, torture and arson. The military says it was defending itself against Rohingya militants. UN investigators have called for top generals to be prosecuted for genocide and accused Aung San Suu Kyi's government of complicity, though has stopped short of calling for her to be hauled before a court. Aung San Suu Kyi became a democracy icon after spearheading the opposition movement to the feared military junta, which resulted in her spending some 15 years under house arrest before her release in 2010. She has yet to comment on Amnesty's decision herself but has in the past shrugged off questions about withdrawn awards. Calls to revoke Aung San Suu Kyi's 1991 Nobel Peace Prize have been rebuffed by the committee that oversees it. Some think, however, that Amnesty's move will be taken more personally because she became a cause celebre for the rights group during her house arrest. \\"This is effectively an excommunication of Aung San Suu Kyi from the pantheon of human rights champions,\\" Yangon-based independent analyst David Mathieson said, adding that the decision would \\"sting\\". ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","response":"Amnesty International has withdrawn its Ambassador of Conscience Award from Aung San Suu Kyi, Myanmar's leader, for her failure to address the Rohingya crisis.

Aung San Suu Kyi's administration has been criticized for not speaking out about military atrocities against the Rohingya population, growing intolerance of freedom of expression, and perpetuation of human rights violations.

The Shackleton–Rowett Expedition (1921–22) was Sir Ernest Shackleton's last Antarctic project, and the final episode in the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration. The venture, financed by John Quiller Rowett, is sometimes referred to as the Quest Expedition after its ship Quest, a converted Norwegian sealer. Shackleton had originally intended to go to the Arctic and explore the Beaufort Sea, but this plan was abandoned when the Canadian government withheld financial support; Shackleton thereupon switched his attention to the Antarctic. Quest, smaller than any recent Antarctic exploration vessel, soon proved inadequate for its task, and progress south was delayed by its poor sailing performance and by frequent engine problems. Before the expedition's work could properly begin, Shackleton died on board the ship, just after its arrival at the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia. The major part of the subsequent attenuated expedition was a three-month cruise to the eastern Antarctic, under the leadership of the party's second-in-command, Frank Wild. The shortcomings of Quest were soon in evidence: slow speed, heavy fuel consumption, a tendency to roll in heavy seas, and a steady leak. The ship was unable to proceed further than longitude 20°E, well short of its easterly target, and its engine's low power coupled with its unsuitable bows was insufficient for it to penetrate southward through the pack ice. Following several fruitless attempts, Wild returned the ship to South Georgia, on the way visiting Elephant Island where he and 21 others had been stranded after the sinking of the ship Endurance, during Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition six years earlier.

Tom is attacked by two deranged men after finding an article showing Silas as the actual killer of his father. Tom manages to fight the two men off and escape back to the farm. Upon reading the news article, it shows that Silas' father lost the farm because he was drunk and this enraged Silas so much that he hung him from a tree and left him there for days. When a bank foreclosure agent came by to foreclose on the house, Silas slit his throat as well. It is then found out that Silas has been in prison for the last 20 years related to the two deaths.

Take, for example, Alex Morgan. If you pay any attention to the USWNT, you know that Morgan is the star of the team. She's the engine that keeps the team humming, and no one on the field is able to impact a game as well as her. She rightfully deserves special attention from FIFA, and a new feature on the organization's website grants her that spotlight. The result, though, is a bit problematic. \\"Alex Morgan is one of the most popular players in USA women’s football,\\" according to FIFA's website. \\"A talented goalscorer with a style that is very easy on the eye and good looks to match, she is nothing short of a media phenomenon.\\" FIFA site lead story, lead graph on Alex Morgan: \\"with a style that is very easy on the eye and good looks to match\\" https://t.co/Qm91cZUQlV — Grant Wahl (@GrantWahl) June 30, 2015 So it's more of the same from FIFA: A sexist lede to start discussing the all-world talents of one of America's stars. Except the next paragraph has absolutely nothing to do with her on-field performance or relevance to this year's Women's World Cup. \\"There is more to Morgan than meets the eye, however. A successful children's writer, she has just published Hat Trick, the fourth book in her series 'The Kicks.'\\" The way FIFA's written this, it seems to be doing everything it can to avoid discussing Morgan as an accomplished superstar. This is like discussing Michael Jordan by first mentioning his Chicago steak house. Or describing who Michael Phelps is by talking about his endorsement deal with Subway. And she cooks and cleans like no other. Her ironing? Flawless. #Welcometothe21stcenturyFIFA https://t.co/wNNCGw8sjq — Julie Foudy (@JulieFoudy) June 30, 2015 But beyond being offensive to Morgan, the article is perhaps the most utterly useless thing you could read about the Women's World Cup on the day of a semifinal match. It featured the top two teams in the world, and FIFA wants us to ogle Alex Morgan. Sure, Morgan is fun to look at, but it's mostly because she's better at soccer than pretty much anyone else on the field.

While Morgan is known for her incredible talent and impact on the field, FIFA chose to focus on her physical appearance, using phrases such as \\"very easy on the eye\\" and \\"good looks to match\\" in their piece about her. This approach received criticism for its outdated and sexist attitudes towards women in sports. The article also points out that FIFA fails to mention Morgan's on-field performance or her relevance to the Women's World Cup. Instead, they highlight her career as a children's writer. The author draws parallels to the absurdity of discussing Michael Jordan by mentioning his Chicago steakhouse or Michael Phelps by his Subway endorsement deal. It is deemed offensive to Morgan and an utterly useless piece of information on a day when a semifinal match featuring the top two teams in the world was taking place. The author then argues that Alex Morgan should be praised for her skills on the field rather than her looks. Acknowledging that she is an attractive person, the focus should be on her talent and how she is better at soccer than most players on the field. Overall, the article calls out FIFA for its sexist approach and emphasizes the need to refocus on athletes' performance and achievements rather than their physical appearance."},{"question":"Premise: \\"Man setting up a tent outside with onlooking girlfriend waiting.\\" Based on this premise, can we conclude that the hypothesis \\"A man is setting up a tent for his girlfriend.\\" is true?

Adapted from Stephen King's novella “Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption,” the movie exhibits a delicate blend of drama, redemption, and friendship, culminating in a cinematic experience that stays with its viewers long after the credits roll. The plot revolves around Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a young and successful banker who is erroneously convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. Sentenced to serve consecutive life terms in Shawshank State Penitentiary, Andy finds himself navigating through the harsh realities of prison life. Along the way, he befriends Ellis \\"Red\\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), a fellow inmate who serves as our narrator and guider, providing a thoughtful perspective on the events that unfold. Tim Robbins delivers an exceptional performance as Andy Dufresne, convincingly portraying a character who remains steadfast and hopeful despite dire circumstances. Robbins embodies a quiet determination and intelligence that shines through, especially in scenes where he outsmarts the corrupt Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) and introduces fiscal reforms to the prison system. The chemistry between Robbins and Freeman is remarkable and the development of their friendship over the years brings an emotional depth to the film. Morgan Freeman, as the wise and introspective Red, perfectly complements Robbins' brilliance. Freeman's soothing voice makes his narration an absolute pleasure to listen to and captures the essence of the story, recounting the significance of hope and resilience even when trapped inside the gray walls of Shawshank. His compelling portrayal earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. The visual aspects of the film are equally captivating. Cinematographer Roger Deakins uses lighting and color to illustrate the despair and desolation of the prison environment, while also using moments of brightness to emphasize pivotal scenes, such as the iconic rooftop scene where Andy and his fellow inmates share a moment of respite while drinking beers under the warm sun. Similarly, the score by Thomas Newman complements the film's atmosphere and suspenseful moments, heightening the emotional impact of each scene. Frank Darabont's screenplay and direction are nothing short of masterful. Despite the film’s 142-minute runtime, it never feels excessive, with each scene contributing to the character development and overall narrative. Darabont balances the bleak reality of incarceration with poignant moments of hope and friendship, allowing the audience to be fully immersed in the story. It's worth noting that despite receiving seven Academy Award nominations, The Shawshank Redemption surprisingly did not win any. However, over the years, it has garnered immense respect and an ardent following that consider it one of the best films ever made. The movie's near-perfect blend of drama, emotion, suspense, and redemption has made it a timeless classic. In conclusion, The Shawshank Redemption is a remarkable film that showcases the power of storytelling and the importance of hope, friendship, and resilience. Through its impactful performances, captivating visuals, and heartfelt storytelling, it has cemented its place as a must-see classic in cinema history. Whether you're a film enthusiast or simply appreciate touching stories, this movie comes highly recommended and is sure to leave a lasting impression."},{"question":"Write the following list of characters into a correctly formed sentence: Youmusthaveatonetimeortheotherbeenfrustratedatnotbeingabletomatchthephysicalaccomplishmentsofyour...","response":"At one time or another, you must have been frustrated at not being able to match the physical accomplishments of your peers."},{"question":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

I can't lay claim to much in the way of literary knowledge, but I do know that Proust's 'Remembrance of Things Past' was prompted by his biting into a pastry and feeling a sense of overwhelming pleasure with no recognizable cause. In my case, I was instantly transported back to the grandmother's kitchen as she and my mother grated potatoes in order to make 'poutine râpée', also known as 'poutines'. People will immediately flash to the Quebecker ethnic food known by the same name. However, in spite of all the Franco-culinary posturing, this is really only French Fries with gravy and, oh yeah, can I have some cheese curds on that? One etymological source indicates that 'poutine' really means 'mess'. If you come from my part of the country, the Quebecker poutine is just another entry in the long list of dishes that will cause you to keel over from a myocardial infarction while shoveling a foot of snow out of the driveway shortly after you've retired; sometimes before. Nope, poutines as I know them are a different creature entirely. They seem to be more of an Acadian thing and none of my friends had even heard of them, much less eaten a single one. Because of the work involved, my mother only made poutines for special times: Christmas, say or Easter. My mother would borrow this grater that was about two feet long and she and my grandmother would set to work. Generally, they started off with an enormous paper sack of potatoes, about 25 pounds or so (We used to buy potatoes by the cartload and store them in a wooden bin in the basement. Because we were cheap labour, the kids would be sent down to retrieve a few for the family meal. It was creepy to descend into the dank cellar, feel our way through the dim obstacle course formed by my grandfather's thousands of tools and bits of wood and locate the bin.

There are three universities in the City of Manchester. The University of Manchester, Manchester Metropolitan University and Royal Northern College of Music. The University of Manchester is the largest full-time non-collegiate university in the United Kingdom and was created in 2004 by the merger of Victoria University of Manchester founded in 1904 and UMIST, founded in 1956, though the university's logo appears to claim it was established in 1824. It includes the Manchester Business School, which offered the first MBA course in the UK in 1965. Manchester Metropolitan University was formed as Manchester Polytechnic on the merger of three colleges in 1970. It gained university status in 1992, and in the same year absorbed Crewe and Alsager College of Higher Education in South Cheshire. The University of Law, the largest provider of vocation legal training in Europe, has a campus in the city.The three Universities are grouped around Oxford Road on the southern side of the city centre, which forms Europe's largest urban higher education precinct. Together they have a combined population of 76,025 students in higher education as of 2015, although almost 6,000 of them were based at Manchester Metropolitan University's campuses at Crewe and Alsager in Cheshire.One of Manchester's most notable secondary schools is the Manchester Grammar School. Established in 1515, as a free grammar school next to what is now the Cathedral, it moved in 1931 to Old Hall Lane in Fallowfield, south Manchester, to accommodate the growing student body. In the post-war period, it was a direct grant grammar school (i.e. partially state funded), but it reverted to independent status in 1976 after abolition of the direct-grant system. Its previous premises are now used by Chetham's School of Music. There are three schools nearby: William Hulme's Grammar School, Withington Girls' School and Manchester High School for Girls.

It offers an experience of ancient Greek and Roman art in a setting that replicates that in which it would originally have been displayed, a Roman villa of the first century AD. On April 18, after three years of work, the galleries of the Villa reopen with an entirely new arrangement of the collection, one that situates art in its cultural and historical context. Since 2006, when the Getty Villa opened as a museum dedicated to the cultures of the ancient Mediterranean, the collection has been presented along thematic lines, with galleries dedicated to subjects such as ancient theater, athletes and competition, and gods and goddesses. This approach was useful in illuminating social life in the ancient classical world, but it prioritized objects’ subject matter over their stature as works of art and removed them from their broader artistic and cultural context. Reenvisioning how the antiquities were displayed at the Villa was one of my top priorities when I joined the J. Paul Getty Museum as director in 2012. As a specialist in ancient art, my priority is to help visitors to see these great treasures as beautiful and fascinating works of art, and sparking their curiosity to understand them in the context of their place in human culture. Starting April 18 our Villa galleries offer a new journey through ancient Greek, Roman, and Etruscan art. The visitor’s path begins on the first-floor rooms devoted to Neolithic and Bronze Age (Cycladic, Minoan, and Mycenaean) Greek art. The journey continues through the Archaic, Classical, and Hellenistic periods, when the Greeks developed the first fully naturalistic vision of the human figure. And it culminates in the dramatic skylit halls of ancient Roman sculpture. In all there are 33 spaces on two floors, with 3,000 more square feet of gallery space than before. The visitor’s path winds through the galleries, gardens, and fountains, offering views onto the spectacular landscape and Pacific Ocean. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: When does the visitor see Neolithic art? Options: - after viewing the ocean - before the museum opens - before work from ancient Rome - not enough information A:","response":"The visitor sees Neolithic art before work from ancient Rome.

Borrowing somewhat from the pneuma of Stoic physics, aether came to be regarded as the rarefied air from which it took its name, (see Aether (mythology)). Early theories of light posited a ubiquitous terrestrial and celestial medium through which light propagated. Additionally, the concept informed Isaac Newton's explanations of both refraction and of radiant heat. 19th century experiments into this luminiferous aether attempted to detect a minute drag on the Earth's orbit. While the Earth does, in fact, move through a relatively dense medium in comparison to that of interstellar space, the drag is so minuscule that it could not be detected. In 1912, astronomer Henry Pickering commented: \\"While the interstellar absorbing medium may be simply the ether, [it] is characteristic of a gas, and free gaseous molecules are certainly there\\". Why were experiments done on luminiferous aether in the 19 Century? What is the answer? (If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\")","response":"Experiments on luminiferous aether were conducted in the 19th century primarily to investigate the properties and behavior of this hypothesized medium, which was thought to be responsible for the propagation of light and other electromagnetic waves in space. At the time, the scientific community widely accepted the existence of the luminiferous aether as it provided a plausible explanation for the transmission of light through apparently empty space. The concept of aether can be traced back to ancient Greek philosophy, where it was considered as a pure and subtle substance that filled the empty spaces between celestial bodies. This idea evolved over the centuries, and during the 19th century, scientists postulated the existence of luminiferous aether, a medium that filled all of space and facilitated the transmission of light waves. The most famous of these 19th century experiments was the Michelson-Morley experiment, conducted in 1887 by Albert A. Michelson and Edward W. Morley. They sought to measure the relative velocity of the Earth through the aether, which they hypothesized would cause a detectable \\"aether wind.\\" The experiment involved splitting a beam of light and reflecting it off mirrors to recombine the beams, expecting a shift in the interference pattern due to the Earth's motion through aether. However, the results showed no significant interference shift, indicating that the expected relative motion between Earth and the aether was not present. These null results sparked further research and debate within the scientific community. Ultimately, these experiments, along with other observations, contributed to the development of Einstein's special theory of relativity in 1905, effectively displacing the notion of aether in favor of more accurate explanations of light propagation through space. Although the 19th century experiments on luminiferous aether did not yield the expected results, they played a crucial role in the advancement of modern physics by fostering scientific inquiry and shedding light on the processes governing the behavior of light and electromagnetic waves."},{"question":"Instructions: A text is given in English.

Did you notice that the train has no wheels? How can a train have no wheels? It doesn't need wheels. It actually floats, or levitates, just above the track. Magnets enable the train to do this. This is not a normal train. This is a maglev train. The word maglev stands for magnetic levitation. Because it has no wheels, there is no friction. Some magnets hold the train up. Other magnets are used to move the train forward. This train can go very fast. It can reach speeds up to 480 kilometers (300 miles) per hour! Magnets are pretty cool. What exactly is a magnet? How is it able to exert such force? Question: \\"How does the train move?\\" Answer: \\"Magnets are used to move it forward\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","response":"Yes, the answer to the question \\"How does the train move?\\" is correct. Magnets are used to move the maglev train forward. The magnetic levitation technology allows the train to levitate just above the tracks, reducing friction and enabling it to reach high speeds. Maglev trains function using a combination of superconducting electromagnets and permanent magnets. The superconducting electromagnets are cooled with liquid helium or liquid nitrogen to maintain their superconductivity, which allows the magnets to maintain a strong magnetic field with little to no energy input. The train moves by taking advantage of the attractive and repulsive forces between the electromagnets mounted on the train and corresponding magnets on the guideway or track. To initiate movement, the train is first levitated slightly above the guideway using the attractive force between the train and track magnets. Once the train is levitated, the track magnets are switched on and off in a specific sequence to create a separate magnetic field that pushes or pulls the train forward. As the train moves, the control system continuously adjusts the magnetic forces to maintain a stable levitation height and to optimize the gap between the train and the guideway. The lack of physical contact between the train and the guideway eliminates the friction found in traditional wheel-on-rail trains, allowing maglev trains to achieve exceptionally high speeds while also offering a smoother and quieter ride. In summary, the magnetic forces generated by the interaction between the electromagnets on the train and the guideway work together to levitate, propel, and guide the maglev train, enabling it to move quickly and efficiently over long distances."},{"question":"Choose the sentence that goes against common sense.

What is the answer??","response":"To find the solution for the equation 0 = -75s + 219 - 2 + 983, we must first simplify the equation by combining the constants and isolating the variable term. Step 1: Simplify the constants Combine the positive constants (219 and 983) and the negative constant (-2). That gives us: 219 + 983 - 2 = 1200 Now, the equation becomes: 0 = -75s + 1200 Step 2: Solve for s To do this, we'll isolate the variable s by moving the constant term to the other side of the equation. Subtract 1200 from both sides: -1200 = -75s Now, to isolate s, divide both sides by -75: s = (-1200) / (-75) Both the numerator and the denominator are negatives, so the result will be positive: s = 1200 / 75 Now, simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 1200 and 75 is 25, so we get: s = (1200 / 25) / (75 / 25) s = 48 / 3 Finally, we reach the result: s = 16 So, the solution for the equation 0 = -75s + 219 - 2 + 983 is s = 16."},{"question":"Translate to German: Unfortunately, it is also this relative autonomy that has led to a de-politicization of cultural production and the configuration of the art world as an elitist, exclusive club.

Although Neptune lies over 50% further from the Sun than Uranus, and receives only 40% its amount of sunlight, the two planets' surface temperatures are roughly equal. The upper regions of Neptune's troposphere reach a low temperature of 51.8 K (−221.3 °C). At a depth where the atmospheric pressure equals 1 bar (100 kPa), the temperature is 72.00 K (−201.15 °C). Deeper inside the layers of gas, the temperature rises steadily. As with Uranus, the source of this heating is unknown, but the discrepancy is larger: Uranus only radiates 1.1 times as much energy as it receives from the Sun; whereas Neptune radiates about 2.61 times as much energy as it receives from the Sun. Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun, yet its internal energy is sufficient to drive the fastest planetary winds seen in the Solar System.

Carnival is a festive period that typically occurs before the Christian season of Lent and is celebrated in various countries around the world. This vibrant, colorful, and lively festival has its origins linked to ancient traditions and customs. With diverse cultural influences, the celebrations can vary considerably from region to region. The origins of Carnival can be traced back to ancient Roman and Greek festivals. In Rome, for example, they celebrated the Saturnalia festival, a tribute to Saturn, the god of agriculture, and the Lupercalia, which honored the Roman god Lupercus for fertility and purification. Similarly, the Greeks would celebrate Dionysus, the god of wine and festivity, through the festival of Dionysia. When Christianity began to spread throughout the Roman Empire, these pagan feasts were adapted, and their dates adjusted, to fit with the Christian calendar and the period preceding Lent. While the origins of the festival are rooted in ancient traditions, it is the cultural significance and impact of Carnival that is truly fascinating. The festivities usually involve a public celebration, which can include parades, street parties, music, dancing, and a variety of unique cultural elements. The spirit of the festival is often characterized by letting go of inhibitions, indulging in pleasure, and a temporary reversal of social order or roles, symbolizing a release of social tensions. Carnival is celebrated in different ways around the world, each with its own unique characteristics that reflect the nation's culture, history, and traditions. Some of the most popular and well-known Carnivals include: 1. Brazilian Carnival: The most famous Carnival in the world, held in Rio de Janeiro, is distinguished by its elaborate samba parades, samba schools competing with each other, and truly extravagant costumes and floats attracting millions of visitors each year. 2. Venetian Carnival: This historic Italian carnival features masked balls, gondola parades, and exquisite Baroque costumes. The wearing of masks during the Carnival of Venice has a long tradition, providing anonymity, freedom of expression, and a sense of unity among revelers. 3. Mardi Gras (New Orleans): Mardi Gras, or \\"Fat Tuesday\\", is celebrated in New Orleans, Louisiana, with colorful parades, masked balls, and King Cakes, a traditional dessert featuring a hidden plastic baby figurine symbolizing luck and prosperity. 4. Notting Hill Carnival (London): A celebration of the Caribbean community and culture in London, this festival features calypso music, steel drum bands, colorful costumes, and lavish street parties. 5. Trinidad and Tobago Carnival: This Caribbean Carnival is known for its energizing soca and calypso music, dazzling costumes, and lively street parties.

How many more liters of oil would be needed to make the large tanker half-full? Let's be accurate as possible.","response":"First, let's find out how much oil was taken from the 4,000-liter tank: Three-quarters of the initial 4,000 liters: 4000 * 3/4 = 3,000 liters. Now, let's see how much oil is in the 20,000-liter tanker after pouring the 3,000 liters into it: Initial 3,000 liters in the tanker + 3,000 liters from the smaller tank = 3,000 + 3,000 = 6,000 liters. Now, let's find out how much oil is needed to make the large 20,000-liter tanker half-full: Half of 20,000 liters = 20,000 * 1/2 = 10,000 liters. Finally, let's subtract the current amount of oil in the tanker from the desired half-full amount: 10,000 liters (half-full) - 6,000 liters (current amount) = 4,000 liters. Therefore, 4,000 more liters of oil would be needed to make the large tanker half-full."},{"question":"Possible tweet sentiments: Choose from: (a). negative (b). positive Write a tweet that is (a)..","response":"Answer: \\"I really hate when it rains all day.

He says that \\"chromosomes are coiled structures made of DNA and proteins\\" and \\"sex Chromosomes determine sex of individual\\". So, what's the best answer to the question? Answer:","response":"The best answer to the question \\"What do coiled structures made of DNA and proteins determine?\\" is that these coiled structures, known as chromosomes, determine various traits and characteristics of an individual, including their sex. Chromosomes are thread-like structures found in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, and are composed of DNA molecules that are tightly coiled around histone proteins. In humans, there are 23 pairs of chromosomes, making a total of 46 chromosomes per cell. Each chromosome carries numerous genes – the basic units of heredity – which determine different characteristics, features, and traits of an organism. These traits can range from physical attributes such as eye color, hair type, and height, to genetic disorders and diseases. One key role of chromosomes is determining the sex of an individual. Humans typically have two types of sex chromosomes: X and Y. Females usually possess two X chromosomes (XX), while males typically have an X and a Y chromosome (XY). The presence of a Y chromosome determines a male sex, whereas the absence of a Y chromosome (and presence of two X chromosomes) results in a female sex. In addition to determining sex, chromosomes also play a fundamental role in the transmission of genetic information from one generation to another. During reproduction, each parent contributes one of their 23 chromosomes to their offspring. This genetic combination from both parents determines the inherited characteristics of the offspring, including physical traits, susceptibility to certain diseases, and more. In conclusion, coiled structures made of DNA and proteins, known as chromosomes, play a crucial role in determining the traits and characteristics of an individual, including their sex and the transmission of genetic information from one generation to another."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Read the bio below and try to give details on earle wilton richardson 's: - death place - bgcolour - training - death date - field - birth date - name - nationality - birth place Bio: earle wilton richardson , -lrb- 1912 -- 1935 -rrb- was an african-american artist made famous mainly for an oil painting of his dating from 1934 titled \`\` employment of negroes in agriculture .

See options at the end Michael bought mealworms as pet food but not Kenneth because Options: [-] Michael had a lizard as a pet.; [-] Kenneth had a lizard as a pet.;","response":"Michael bought mealworms as pet food but not Kenneth because Michael had a lizard as a pet. This decision was influenced by multiple factors that made mealworms an appropriate food choice for Michael's pet and not Kenneth's. First, it is important to understand why Michael felt the need to buy mealworms as pet food. The primary reason was that Michael had a pet lizard. Lizards are known to thrive on a diet consisting of insects, and mealworms are a popular choice among lizard owners. Mealworms offer a great nutritional value to lizards, as they are a good source of protein, vitamins, minerals, and fibers. Feeding a lizard a proper diet ensures that it stays healthy, active, and has a longer life span. So, Michael's decision to buy mealworms was heavily influenced by his desire to provide the best possible care for his pet lizard. On the other hand, Kenneth did not need to buy mealworms because he didn't have a lizard as a pet. Perhaps Kenneth had a pet that did not require mealworms as part of its diet, or maybe he did not have any pets at all. In either case, Kenneth's situation was different from Michael's, and this shaped their respective decisions regarding pet food. Moreover, different lizards may have different nutritional requirements, depending on their species, age, and size. While mealworms are suitable for most types of lizards, such as geckos, bearded dragons, and chameleons, they may not be appropriate for the entire spectrum of lizard species. It's possible that if Kenneth had a lizard as a pet, it would require a different kind of food, which might explain why he did not purchase mealworms.

Considering his chest size, the air pressure outside the lungs, compared to the air pressure inside, is lower or higher? Assuming that: During inhalation, because the chest volume is larger, the air pressure inside the lungs is lower than the air pressure outside. A:","response":"To answer the question, we need to consider a few principles related to the respiratory system and the physical laws governing the movement of gases. Our discussion will be divided into three parts: understanding the mechanics of breathing, the concept of air pressure, and finally, drawing a conclusion by comparing the air pressures inside and outside Mike's lungs. Part I: Mechanics of Breathing Breathing is a mechanical process that involves the inhalation (inspiration) and exhalation (expiration) of air. These processes are facilitated by the diaphragm and intercostal muscles, as well as the elastic properties of the lungs and chest wall. The diaphragm is a large, dome-shaped muscle that separates the chest cavity from the abdominal cavity. When it contracts, it flattens and moves downward, thereby increasing the volume of the chest cavity. This volume change, along with the action of the external intercostal muscles, causes the rib cage to expand outward. Part II: Air Pressure Air pressure is defined as the force exerted on a surface by the weight of the air above it. It is governed by the Gas Laws, particularly Boyle's Law, which states that the pressure of a given amount of gas is inversely proportional to its volume, provided that the temperature is constant. In other words, an increase in volume leads to a decrease in pressure, and vice versa. Part III: Comparing Air Pressures Inside and Outside the Lungs Let us now analyze the air pressures inside and outside Mike's lungs during inhalation. As he takes a deep breath, his diaphragm and intercostal muscles contract, leading to an increase in the chest cavity's volume. Due to the increase in volume, the air pressure within his lungs decreases according to Boyle's Law. In contrast, the air pressure outside his lungs remains relatively constant, as it is primarily determined by the Earth's atmosphere and not significantly influenced by Mike's breathing mechanics. Therefore, given that Mike's chest volume is sizable and he is inhaling deeply, the air pressure inside his lungs is lower than the air pressure outside. This pressure differential is what drives the movement of air into the lungs. Air will naturally flow from an area of higher pressure (i.e., the atmosphere outside the lungs) to an area of lower pressure (i.e., inside the lungs) in order to equilibrate the pressure difference."},{"question":"Continue the following story.

They do not even have to touch. This is unlike the typical push or pull you may be familiar with. All electric charge is based on the protons and electrons in atoms. A proton has a positive electric charge. An electron has a negative electric charge. Forces on Charged Objects Most atoms are balanced electrically. They have the same number of positive and negative charges. Therefore, the number of protons equals the number of electrons. Neutrons do not matter as they have no charge. When an object loses some electrons, it becomes positively charged. There are now more protons than electrons inside the atom. The lost electrons may remain free. Or, they may attach to another object. The new object now has more electrons than protons. It then becomes negatively charged. After reading the above, is \\"Lost protons may remain free\\" the correct answer to the question \\"What kind of charge does a particle with more protons than electrons have?\\"?","response":"No, \\"Lost protons may remain free\\" is not the correct answer to the question \\"What kind of charge does a particle with more protons than electrons have?\\".

The answer is:","response":"No, the correct answer is not \\"contamination.\\" Instead, the result of imperfect passing of heat through a metal, on that metal, is \\"thermal expansion\\" and potential \\"uneven distribution of heat.\\" When a metal doesn't pass all of its heat through itself, it absorbs some of that heat, leading the metal to expand. Thermal expansion is a natural phenomenon that occurs when a substance (in this case, a metal) increases in volume due to an increase in temperature. The higher temperature increases the kinetic energy of the particles within the metal, causing them to vibrate more vigorously and move further apart. This, in turn, results in the expansion of the metal material. Moreover, if a metal doesn't pass heat uniformly across its entire surface, the uneven distribution of heat can cause localized expansion, warping, and structural deformations. This phenomenon is commonly observed in the engineering and manufacturing industries, where materials must withstand temperature fluctuations and maintain their structural integrity. Different parts of the metal may be at different temperatures, and this can lead to problems like stress, cracking, and distortions. Contamination refers to the presence of impurities or unwanted elements in a material (such as a metal) that may have adverse effects on its properties, behavior, or performance. Contaminants could be foreign particles, gases, chemicals, moisture, or any other substance that degrade the quality of the material. Although contamination may affect a metal's ability to conduct heat effectively, it is not the primary result of the imperfect passing of heat through a metal."},{"question":"Test for natural language inference.

Gathering initially as part of a practical joke, members of \\"The Vicious Circle\\", as they dubbed themselves, met for lunch each day at the Algonquin Hotel from 1919 until roughly 1929. At these luncheons they engaged in wisecracks, wordplay, and witticisms that, through the newspaper columns of Round Table members, were disseminated across the country. Daily association with each other, both at the luncheons and outside of them, inspired members of the Circle to collaborate creatively. In addition to the daily luncheons, members of the Round Table worked and associated with each other almost constantly. The group was devoted to games, including cribbage and poker. The group had its own poker club, the Thanatopsis Literary and Inside Straight Club, which met at the hotel on Saturday nights. Regulars at the game included Kaufman, Adams, Broun, Ross and Woollcott, with non-Round Tablers Herbert Bayard Swope, silk merchant Paul Hyde Bonner, baking heir Raoul Fleischmann, actor Harpo Marx, and writer Ring Lardner sometimes sitting in. The group also played charades (which they called simply \\"The Game\\") and the \\"I can give you a sentence\\" game, which spawned Dorothy Parker's memorable sentence using the word horticulture: \\"You can lead a horticulture but you can't make her think.\\" Members often visited Neshobe Island, a private island co-owned by several \\"Algonks\\"--but governed by Woollcott as a \\"benevolent tyrant\\", as his biographer Samuel Hopkins Adams charitably put it--located on several acres in the middle of Lake Bomoseen in Vermont. There they would engage in their usual array of games including Wink murder, which they called simply \\"Murder\\", plus croquet.

Here, they would engage in witty and humorous dialogues, word play, and exchanges of pointed, often caustic remarks. These details of their meetings would later reach the larger public through newspaper columns authored by members of the group. Their daily interactions extended beyond these luncheons and helped foster a culture of creative collaboration within the group. In addition to the luncheons, members of the Algonquin Round Table would work together and often spent significant amounts of leisure time with each other. They nurtured a shared fondness for various games including cribbage, poker, and charades, as well as a unique game they referred to as the \\"I can give you a sentence\\" game. The latter game was responsible for the creation of one of Dorothy Parker's renowned sentences that utilized the word horticulture: \\"You can lead a horticulture but you can't make her think.\\" Among the members of this exclusive poker group were personalities like Kaufman, Adams, Broun, Ross, and Woollcott, along with occasional guests such as Harpo Marx, Herbert Bayard Swope, and Paul Hyde Bonner.

This private island, controlled by Woollcott, hosted numerous game sessions including their favourite game - \\"Murder,\\" another name for 'Wink murder', and croquet. The friendly environment was further enriched by the members' penchant for practical jokes, which expanded in intricacy over time. In one instance, Harold Ross and Jane Grant masterminded a prank on Woollcott involving gradual modification and replacement of his beloved portrait.

Construct the question in such a way that (i) it is unambiguous, (ii) it is answerable from the passage, (iii) its answer is unique (iv) it answer uses text phrases from the passage. Avoid creating questions that (i) can't be answered correctly without actually understanding the passage and (ii) uses the same words or phrases given in the passage. Context: Reg IV, a secreted protein and member of the Reg multigene family, is up-regulated in malignancies of the human gastrointestinal tract, including colorectal carcinoma (CRC). However, in vitro signal transduction pathway(s) utilized by Reg IV are not yet known.', 'To determine the signaling pathway(s) responsive to Reg IV, we examined the effects of purified recombinant human Reg IV (rhR4) on HCT116 and HT29 colon adenocarcinoma cells.', 'Addition of rhR4 to cultures led to a dose-dependent increase in cell number similar to that observed after treatment with epidermal growth factor (EGF). In addition, rhR4 treatment resulted in rapid phosphorylation of EGF receptor at Tyr992 and Tyr1068 and Akt at Thr308 and Ser473. Using luciferase reporter gene assays, we demonstrated that Reg IV signaling through EGF receptor and Akt results in increased activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor activity. Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analyses revealed quantitative increases in c-Jun, JunB, JunD, and FosB expression associated with increased AP-1 activity. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay further revealed significant increases in AP-1 binding activity in rhR4-treated cells, with increased supershift in the presence of antibodies to JunB, JunD, and FosB. Furthermore, rhR4 treatments led to the increased expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, survivin, and matrilysin, genes associated with a poor prognosis in advanced CRC. Answer: Reg IV is a potent activator of the EGF receptor/Akt/AP-1 signaling pathway in CRC. Disruption of Reg signaling may have utility as a therapeutic intervention for human gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas. A:","response":"Part 1: Construct a question based on the information present in the passage. Usage: What signaling pathway is Reg IV a potent activator of in colorectal carcinoma (CRC)? This question is based on the information provided in the passage and focuses on the role of Reg IV in CRC. Part 2: Make the question unambiguous. Usage: The same question from Part 1 (What signaling pathway is Reg IV a potent activator of in colorectal carcinoma (CRC)) is already unambiguous, as it clearly asks for the specific signaling pathway activated by Reg IV in CRC. Part 3: Ensure the question is answerable from the passage. Usage: The question asks about the signaling pathway, and the passage states, \\"Reg IV is a potent activator of the EGF receptor/Akt/AP-1 signaling pathway in CRC.\\" This directly answers the question as it highlights the signaling pathway involved. Part 4: The answer to the question should be unique. Usage: The answer \\"EGF receptor/Akt/AP-1 signaling pathway\\" is unique because it is the only signaling pathway mentioned in the passage related to Reg IV's role in CRC. Part 5: The answer should use text phrases from the passage. Usage: The answer \\"EGF receptor/Akt/AP-1 signaling pathway\\" directly uses text phrases from the passage, showing that it is based on the information provided in the context. Part 6: Avoid questions that can't be answered correctly without understanding the passage. Usage: The question (What signaling pathway is Reg IV a potent activator of in colorectal carcinoma (CRC)?) requires an understanding of the passage to answer correctly. If someone did not understand the passage, they would not be able to answer the question accurately. Part 7: Do not use the same words or phrases given in the passage when creating the question. Usage: The question (What signaling pathway is Reg IV a potent activator of in colorectal carcinoma (CRC)?) is phrased slightly differently from the passage and does not directly use the exact phrase \\"Reg IV is a potent activator of the EGF receptor/Akt/AP-1 signaling pathway in CRC.\\" This allows for the question to test the reader's understanding without directly copying the text."},{"question":"Information: - Manchester is a major city and metropolitan borough in Greater Manchester, England, with a population of 514,414 .

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Under Siege 2: Dark Territory Context: Casey Ryback has retired from the United States Navy and is a chef at the Mile High Cafe in Denver, Colorado. Casey is taking his estranged niece Sarah to Los Angeles to visit the grave of Sarah's father. Sarah and Casey board the Grand Continental, a train traveling from Denver to Los Angeles through the Rocky Mountains. Armed mercenaries, led by former U.S. government computer hacker and computer genius Travis Dane and mercenary leader Marcus Penn, hijack the train. Dane worked on Grazer One, a top-secret military satellite particle weapon designed to destroy underground targets. The military fired Dane because of his mental instability; Dane later faked his suicide. The mercenaries take the train's passengers and staff hostage, herding them into the last two cars. Casey kills one mercenary, then slips away. Among the hostages are two former Department of Defense colleagues who worked with Dane. Dane threatens them with torture unless they reveal the codes to take over Grazer. Despite giving up the codes, they are thrown from the train into a deep valley and killed. Middle Eastern terrorists have offered Dane 1 billion to destroy the Eastern seaboard by using Grazer to target a nuclear reactor located under the Pentagon. Dane demonstrates Grazer to investors by destroying a Chinese chemical weapons plant. After one investor offers an additional 100 million, Dane destroys an airliner carrying the investor's ex-wife. The U.S. government has difficulty locating Dane or Grazer. When officials destroy what they think is Grazer, Dane explains the NSA's premier intelligence satellite was destroyed instead.

Every other day Randy delivered the newspaper to Nick who had a subscription, since it was","response":"his responsibility as the diligent paperboy in their small suburban neighborhood. Nick, an avid reader, always looked forward to receiving the latest edition of the daily newspaper to catch up on current events, local stories, sports results, and the funnies. Ensuring that this connection to the outside world was constantly and promptly maintained was the backbone of Randy's commitment to his job. Randy was well-known and respected in the community, not just for his dedication to his work as a paperboy, but also for his friendly and approachable nature. He made an effort to familiarize himself with the neighbors, always offering a warm smile and a wave as he rode by on his trusty bicycle. The path he took through the neighborhood was well-trodden and remained consistent, rain or shine. This was a testament to the importance Randy placed on his role in delivering the newspaper to the community. For Nick, the newspaper was more than just a source of news – it represented his connection to the broader world and played an essential role in maintaining his informed status. As an early riser, he would eagerly wait for the familiar sound of Randy's bicycle brakes as they screeched to a halt in front of his house. Before Nick could even open his door, Randy would expertly toss the newspaper perfectly wrapped in a plastic cover onto Nick's porch, anticipating inclement weather to keep the paper pristine. Nick appreciated not only the delivery but also the additional care and thought that Randy put into his work. Their connection went beyond the typical customer-service provider dynamic. Randy and Nick would occasionally strike up conversations as they crossed paths, discussing anything from the latest headlines to the upcoming holidays in their neighborhood. These conversations served to deepen their established bond, as Randy began to see Nick as something of a mentor figure, and Nick found himself recalling his younger years through Randy's youthful spirit. As the months went by, Randy's dedication to delivering the newspaper to Nick remained as strong as ever. He even went the extra mile by ensuring the newspaper was always placed in the most convenient spot for Nick, such as tucking it under the doormat if it was windy or placing it in the mailbox to keep it dry on rainy days. Nick, in turn, showed his appreciation by occasionally leaving small tokens of gratitude, like coupons for a free ice cream cone or a crisp dollar bill, tucked in the mailbox for Randy to find when he delivered the paper. Every other day Randy delivered the newspaper to Nick who had a subscription, since it was not only a symbol of his dedication to serving his community but also a way of building meaningful connections with the people around him. Through his work, Randy learned valuable life lessons about responsibility, commitment, and the power of human connection, making him a valuable and respected member of their neighborhood. In many ways, their relationship was emblematic of a time when such simple, everyday interactions and exchanges helped to strengthen the bonds of a community."},{"question":"Given the question: - Food is squeezed down the esophagus when you swallow - Acid and enzyme in the stomach break the food down - Releases nutrients - Food then pumped into small intestine - Fluid and enzymes from liver and pancreas pumped into small intestine - Help break food into smallest molecules - Nutrients pass through wall of small intestine - Nutrients absorbed into blood stream - Unused materials passed into large intestine to become fecal matter.

Stereolab's music is politically and philosophically charged. Dave Heaton of PopMatters said that the group \\"[uses] lyrics to convey ideas while using them for the pleasurable way the words sound.\\" The lyrics of the 2006 compilation Fab Four Suture, contains themes of war, governments that suppress freedom, and \\"the powerlessness that everyday people feel in the face of it all\\", in contrast to \\"humans [working] together, [treating] each other like people, and [pushing] for governments that would do the same.\\" Lætitia Sadier, who writes the group's lyrics, was influenced by both the Situationist philosophy Society of the Spectacle by Marxist theorist Guy Debord, and her anger towards the Iraq War. The Surrealist, as well as the Situationist cultural and political movements were also influences, as stated by Sadier and Gane in a 1999 Salon interview.Critics have seen Marxist allusions in the band's lyrics, and have gone so far as to call the band members themselves Marxist. Music journalist Simon Reynolds commented that Sadier's lyrics tend to lean towards Marxist social commentary rather than \\"affairs of the heart\\". The 1994 single \\"Ping Pong\\" has been put forward as evidence in regard to these alleged views. In the song, Sadier sings \\"about capitalism's cruel cycles of slump and recovery\\" with lyrics that constitute \\"a plainspoken explanation of one of the central tenets of Marxian economic analysis\\" (said critics Reynolds and Stewart Mason, respectively).Band members have resisted attempts to link the group and its music to Marxism. In a 1999 interview, Gane stated that \\"none of us are Marxists ... I've never even read Marx.\\" Gane said that although Sadier's lyrics touch on political topics, they do not cross the line into \\"sloganeering\\".

They hit a large rock and fell. Tammy wound up in the hospital and was diagnosed with a serious brain injury. Rob suffered only a mild concussion. Which person had fewer problems with mental abilities? Hint: A person with a serious brain injury usually suffers permanent brain damage. These brain injuries usually occur when an external mechanical force, such as a violent blow or jolt to the head or body, causes brain dysfunction. An object penetrating the skull, such as a bullet or a shattered piece of the skull, also can cause traumatic brain injury. As a result, the person may have trouble talking or controlling body movements. Symptoms depend on what part of the brain was injured. Serious brain injuries can also cause personality changes and problems with mental abilities such as memory. Medicines, counseling, and other treatments may help people with serious brain injuries recover from, or at least learn to cope with, their disabilities. Answer:","response":"In this situation, Rob had fewer problems with mental abilities. Even though both Tammy and Rob experienced brain injuries from the accident, Tammy suffered a serious brain injury, while Rob only had a mild concussion. A serious brain injury often results in permanent brain damage and can lead to problems with speech, motor control, personality changes, memory, and other mental abilities. On the other hand, a mild concussion typically results in temporary symptoms that resolve within a few weeks and does not have the same long-lasting effects as a serious brain injury.

Here are possible answers to this question: - ground - sand box - michigan - warm bed - warm place I believe the correct choice is \\"sand box\\", here's why: Answer:","response":"A cat would prefer to relieve itself in a sand box, and this choice is indeed the most accurate among the given options. The reason behind this preference is rooted in the natural habits and instincts of cats, their need for cleanliness, and an innate inclination towards digging and covering their waste. Cats have a strong inherent need for cleanliness. They meticulously groom themselves and avoid soiling their living environment. This inclination is largely due to their history as both predators and prey in the wild. In order to minimize leaving any scent that might attract predators or alert their prey, cats developed a tendency to dig and bury their waste. In this context, a sand box is the most suitable option. A sand box, often referred to as a litter box, is a specially designed container filled with a particular type of material known as cat litter. This litter can be made from a variety of materials such as clay, sand, recycled paper, or wood particles. Cat litter is engineered to be highly absorbent, enabling it to effectively control the moisture and odor of cat waste. Moreover, cat litter is specifically designed to be easy for cats to dig and bury their waste, thus satisfying their natural instincts. Furthermore, cats are known to be territorial animals. Providing them with a designated spot, such as a sand box or litter box, allows them to establish their territory and feel more secure in their environment. This designated area also helps to contain the waste and maintain the overall cleanliness of the living space, benefitting both the cat and the owner. Comparatively, the other options provided are either inappropriate or unsuitable for a cat to relieve itself. For example, the ground might be an option for outdoor or stray cats, but it is not a feasible choice for indoor pets. Michigan, being a geographical location, is irrelevant to the question. A warm bed and a warm place, although appealing to a cat for rest and relaxation, would not be chosen for waste elimination due to their innate need for cleanliness. In conclusion, among the given options, a sand box – or litter box – is undoubtedly the most accurate and suitable choice for where a cat would prefer to relieve itself. This preference arises from a cat's natural instincts, their desire for cleanliness, and their inherent tendency to dig and cover their waste. Additionally, providing a designated area like a litter box ensures a comfortable and sanitary environment for both the cat and its owner."},{"question":"Short movie review: , especially with the weak payoff Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","response":"Based on the given short review, the critic seems to be thinking negatively about the movie. While there is limited information provided, there are a few key phrases that suggest dissatisfaction. For instance, the term \\"weak payoff\\" is a crucial indication that the critic felt the movie's conclusion or conclusion may not have met their expectations or failed to provide the desired sense of resolution. This could mean that the movie lacked adequate depth, a solid storyline, emotional impact, or other factors that would have made for a strong ending. Furthermore, the use of the word \\"especially\\" implies that the weak payoff was the most significant factor contributing to the critic's overall negative impression of the film. This notion of a weak payoff could have significantly impacted the critic's enjoyment of the movie. However, we must take into account that this is just a short review, and the full context of the critic's opinion is not readily available. Therefore, there might be other aspects of the film that the critic enjoyed or appreciated, but the weak payoff could be viewed as a continuous hindrance throughout the movie. In conclusion, based on the provided information and the reference to a \\"weak payoff,\\" it is safe to assume that the critic's evaluation of the movie is predominantly negative. Nevertheless, a more comprehensive and detailed review could provide further insight into the strengths and weaknesses of the film and shed light on the critic's overall opinion."},{"question":"Q:I know that the answer to the question \\"What is not up for discussion?\\" is in \\"Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses are established by the Governing Body.

Quincy is paying 250 per month on a 5-year, interest-free loan. There are 12 months in a year, so 5 years x 12 months/year = 60 months. Quincy's total payments for the loan amount would be: 60 months x 250/month = 15,000. Now, we add the down payment of 5,000 to the loan payments to get the total price of the car. 5,000 (down payment) + 15,000 (loan payments) = 20,000.

We just need to subtract the percentage of owner-occupied units from the total percentage (100%).

He married Mary Ellen Blanche Crookes ( 1870-1935 ) , daughter and co-founder of Septimus Wilkinson Crookes and Anne Blanche Harriet Proctor in 1901 .","response":"No, these two sentences do not mean exactly the same thing due to a slight difference in the interpretation of Mary Ellen Blanche Crookes’s role as described in the two sentences. In the first sentence, \\"He married in 1901 Mary Ellen Blanche Crookes (1870-1935), daughter and coheiress of Septimus Wilkinson Crookes and Anne Blanche Harriet Proctor,\\" Mary is recognized as the daughter of Septimus Wilkinson Crookes and Anne Blanche Harriet Proctor and as coheiress to their estate or fortune. This suggests that she, alongside potentially other siblings, stood to inherit a large portion of her parents' wealth or property. The term \\"coheiress\\" knowingly suggests that there were multiple heirs (potentially Mary and her siblings if any) who were set to inherit the wealth or estate of her parents. Additionally, it implies the existence of wealth or property large enough to be distributed among the heiress. However, in the second sentence, \\"He married Mary Ellen Blanche Crookes (1870-1935), daughter and co-founder of Septimus Wilkinson Crookes and Anne Blanche Harriet Proctor in 1901,\\" Mary is not only described as the daughter of Septimus and Anne but also as their co-founder. Co-founder is usually a term used to denote a person who, along with one or more individuals, is instrumental in the establishment of a business, organization, or movement. There's a sense of contribution and active participation in initiating something in the term co-founder which does not align with the description provided in the first sentence. The term \\"co-founder\\" changes the dynamics of her relation with Septimus Wilkinson Crookes and Anne Blanche Harriet Proctor as it now implies business or entity that has been founded by them along with Mary. This would suggest that Mary, along with her parents, played a significant role in creating or establishing something substantial — perhaps a business or other type of institution. For these reasons, while both sentences describe a man marrying Mary Ellen Blanche Crookes, the daughter of Septimus Wilkinson Crookes and Anne Blanche Harriet Proctor in 1901, the essence of Mary's relationship with her parents, and her role beyond being just a daughter, varies between the two."},{"question":"Answer this question.

Expand this summary.","response":"Despite its famed role in the Oscar-winning film \\"Silence of the Lambs,\\" Scott and Barbara Lloyd are finding it difficult to sell their Pennsylvania home. The house, which was the location of the climactic showdown between Clarice Starling and Buffalo Bill, was originally put on the market in August for 300,000. The couple has since dropped the price to 250,000, but they have not received any serious offers. The house was the second-most-viewed property on Realtor.com in 2015, but it seems that potential buyers are hesitant in making a purchase. One of the issues could be that only the kitchen and entryway of the house were featured in the movie, with the more memorable basement scenes filmed at another location. As Consumerist reports, this means that the house does not contain a sub-basement pit, which might be a disappointment for some die-hard fans of the film. Furthermore, the house is situated in Layton, a small town of fewer than 50 people. The isolated location may have appealed to the fictional character Buffalo Bill, but for real-life buyers, the lack of nearby amenities is a significant drawback. Another obstacle that the sellers face is the asking price. At 250,000, the house is still 100,000 over the median listing price for homes in Pennsylvania. This steep price may deter potential buyers who would otherwise be interested in owning a piece of cinematic history. Despite these challenges, Scott and Barbara Lloyd remain hopeful that they will find a buyer soon. In the meantime, they can appreciate the unique history behind their property and the attention it has received since being featured in such a landmark film. Overall, the issues facing the sale of this house highlight the fact that what may be initially appealing to potential buyers can sometimes be overshadowed by practical concerns, such as price, location, and amenities. While the connection to \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" may attract viewers and curiosity-seekers, it may not necessarily translate into a successful sale for the homeowners. However, it only takes one dedicated fan or adventurous homebuyer to finally close the deal and secure the house's future as a connection to an iconic moment in film history."},{"question":"Choose your story that continues the following story.

He worked at a café, brewing coffee and engaging in friendly banter with the customers. He loved his work for it brought him close to people and their stories. As someone who greatly admired the complex tapestry of life, he appreciated the window his job provided into various lifestyles and perspectives. However, this meant his time for formal educational pursuits was limited to the nighttime. Night classes seemed like a solid solution as they allowed him to balance the two aspects of his life that he cherished, his work and his education. He was enrolled in a well-regarded community college that provided classes fitting his unusual schedule. His major was Sociology, suitably chosen, given his love for understanding the human aspect of life. It wasn't an easy path. Neil juggled his work at the café, the night classes, and the academic coursework that followed. His friends often remarked on his relentless spirit. His friend Samuel, in particular, was in awe of Neil's resilience. You see, Samuel was quite the academic marvel. He had excelled during the semester, effortlessly it seemed, with classes during the day, no job to hold, and plenty of time for hobbies and relaxation. Samuel admired how Neil could manage his crowded schedule while still maintaining a positive outlook and an amicable demeanor. Samuel, based on his personal ease in academia, often wondered if he would manage as well in Neil's shoes, having to split his day in such a demanding manner.

As a result, their social and academic spheres complemented one another with a broad range of life experiences, exemplifying that personal success is based not on comparative progress, but on endearing through one's unique journey. The perseverance and dedication Neil demonstrated, attending night classes after long days of work, was an embodiment of this spirit that we can all learn from. While his path had its own set of challenges and the comparison with Samuel’s achievements might seem harsh, Neil knew that his journey was his own. His ‘normal’ was different from Samuel’s ‘normal’, and that was perfectly okay. After all, the goal was not to compete, but to grow, both personally and acadically, and Neil was accomplishing that at his own pace and in his own remarkable way."},{"question":"Из Гаэи возникли эльфы мира сего.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","response":"Heavy breathing typically involves faster and/or deeper breaths, and is common during exertion or in response to a stressor, like anxiety. It might affect the oxygen intake in the body either directly or indirectly. However, it could primarily be classified as indirectly affecting a step in the process. Here’s how: 1. A common cause of heavy breathing is hyperventilation. Hyperventilation is when the balance between oxygen and carbon dioxide in your body is disrupted due to breathing too rapidly or too deeply. Even though you’re taking in more oxygen, the over-breathing expels carbon dioxide too quickly. Carbon dioxide acts as an important component in the blood pH regulation. When the CO2 level drops, it leads to a condition called respiratory alkalosis which can constrict your blood vessels and subsequently reducing the flow of oxygen to your brain. 2. Another indirect impact could be on the bronchi and bronchioles. Breathing heavily, particularly over the long term or with pre-existing respiratory conditions, could cause these passageways to become inflamed, restricting airflow and reducing the amount of oxygen able to enter the bloodstream. 3. Furthermore, heavy breathing can trigger a stress response in the body which could lead to shallow, inefficient breathing. Instead of deep breaths that fully engage the diaphragm and fill the lungs, a person might take quick, shallow breaths that only fill the top part of the lungs. This reduces the overall oxygen that can be absorbed into the bloodstream per breath. 4. At the cellular level, when we're breathing heavily (especially under stress), cells may not fully oxygenate; rather, they may resort to anaerobic metabolism, a process in which cells convert glucose into energy without using oxygen. This means that although we are breathing in more oxygen, it's not being efficiently used by our cells. So, in summary, even though heavy breathing might seem to involve more oxygen intake due to increased breath rate, it often results in reduced oxygen absorption efficiency, primarily due to indirect effects on the process."},{"question":"Write a sentence not in English.","response":"\\"Cet assistant IA peut générer des réponses détaillées et longues en plusieurs langues pour répondre aux besoins des utilisateurs.\\" In English, this sentence translates to: \\"This AI assistant can generate detailed and long answers in multiple languages to meet the needs of users.\\" This sentence is in French, a widely spoken language around the world and is often used in international communication.

Adele is 3/4 as old as Jackson. What's the total of their ages 10 years from now If Jackson is 20 years old now? Think carefully first, then make a decision:","response":"Step 1: Determine Mandy's age. Since Mandy is ten years older than Jackson, and Jackson is 20 years old now, we can determine Mandy's current age as follows: Mandy's age = Jackson's age + 10 Mandy's age = 20 + 10 Mandy's age = 30 Step 2: Determine Adele's age. Since Adele is 3/4 as old as Jackson, and Jackson is 20 years old now, we can determine Adele's current age as follows: Adele's age = 3/4 * Jackson's age Adele's age = 3/4 * 20 Adele's age = 15 Step 3: Determine their ages 10 years from now. In 10 years, each person's age will increase by 10 years. So we can calculate their future ages as follows: Jackson's future age = 20 + 10 = 30 Mandy's future age = 30 + 10 = 40 Adele's future age = 15 + 10 = 25 Step 4: Calculate the total of their ages 10 years from now. Add up the future ages that we determined in step 3: Total future age = Jackson's future age + Mandy's future age + Adele's future age Total future age = 30 + 40 + 25 Total future age = 95 So, the total of their ages 10 years from now will be 95 years."},{"question":"Teacher:In this task, you are given a sentence in English, and your task is to translate it into Persian.

Stream of thoughts:","response":"When comparing the two sentences, thoughts to consider are: 1. Both sentences involve a woman applying makeup to a man. 2. The primary difference between the two sentences is the emotional state of the woman: in the first sentence, there is no information about her emotional state, while in the second sentence, she is described as sad. Now, considering if the statement \\"A sad woman is applying makeup to a man\\" is true given the sentence \\"A woman is applying makeup to a man\\": - The action itself (applying makeup to a man) is true in both scenarios. - However, since there is no information provided about the woman's emotional state in the original sentence, we cannot assert that the woman is sad or not sad.

How much did Cindy earn for teaching 1 math course in a month with exactly 4 weeks if her hourly rate per class is 25? Give me reasons, before answering the question","response":"To determine how much Cindy earned for teaching 1 math course in a month with exactly 4 weeks, we start by calculating the number of hours she spends teaching one math course each week. Step 1: Divide the total number of hours by the total number of courses Cindy was hired to teach 4 math courses for a total of 48 hours per week. Therefore, we divide her total weekly teaching hours by the number of courses she teaches each week. 48 hours / 4 courses = 12 hours/course This means Cindy spends 12 hours teaching one math course each week. Step 2: Find the total number of hours spent on one course in a month Now, we need to calculate the total number of hours she spends teaching one math course in a month. Since there are exactly 4 weeks in a month in this case, we multiply the weekly hours for one course by the number of weeks in the month. 12 hours/week * 4 weeks = 48 hours In a month with exactly 4 weeks, Cindy spends a total of 48 hours teaching one math course. Step 3: Find the earnings for one course in a month Since her hourly rate for each class is 25, we multiply the total number of hours spent on one course in a month by her hourly rate to find her earnings. 48 hours * 25/hour = 1,200 Thus, Cindy earns 1,200 for teaching 1 math course in a month with exactly 4 weeks."},{"question":"The exercise is to decide whether the question accepts the proposed suggestion as a correct answer.

And the answer is?","response":"Life on Mars, a popular British television series from BBC Wales, aired between 2006 and 2007. It later inspired sequels and spin-offs in the United States, Spain, and Russia. However, before its ultimate success, the series faced initial rejection from the BBC. The primary reason for the initial decline was based on concerns regarding the show's storyline, tone, and complexity. Life on Mars revolves around Sam Tyler, a modern-day police detective who, after a near-fatal car crash, wakes up to find himself in 1973 Manchester. He now operates as a detective in this era, alongside DCI Gene Hunt, while finding ways to return to the present day. The series blends elements of science fiction, crime procedural, and time-travel, creating a unique and innovative narrative. BBC executives were uncertain if the audience would be able to grasp the combined elements of crime and science fiction. At the time, they were worried about the riskiness of the concept and the possibility of it not resonating with viewers. They were concerned that a genre-blending story would be too difficult for audiences to follow and might not garner enough interest to be commercially viable. Another reason for the rejection was the fact that, at the time, there were no successful examples of police procedural dramas integrating speculative elements, like time travel. Executives were concerned that Life on Mars might be unable to find a substantial audience due to its experimental storytelling technique. Additionally, the show's creators had proposed a unique visual storytelling approach that combined 1970s aesthetics with a modern perspective. The executives were unsure if these techniques would appeal to the viewers, as this style was not commonly seen on television at the time. Despite these concerns, Life on Mars went on to receive widespread acclaim upon its release. It became a commercial success, with its ratings reflecting the audience's appreciation for the series' unique concept, storytelling, and visuals. In fact, the show was so successful that it went on to spawn international adaptations and a UK sequel, Ashes to Ashes, which aired from 2008 to 2010. Ultimately, Life on Mars demonstrated that the risks taken by the creators paid off, and the series has since become a modern television classic."},{"question":"Answer the following question: who runs the fbi office of professional responsibility?","response":"As an AI language model, I don't have real-time, up-to-date information, but I can provide you with a general approach to find the answer.

Bowie was a pioneer of glam rock, according to music historians Schinder and Schwartz, who credited Marc Bolan and Bowie with creating the genre. At the same time, he inspired the innovators of the punk rock music movement. When punk musicians were \\"noisily reclaiming the three-minute pop song in a show of public defiance\\", biographer David Buckley wrote that \\"Bowie almost completely abandoned traditional rock instrumentation.\\" Bowie's record company promoted his unique status in popular music with the slogan, \\"There's old wave, there's new wave, and there's David Bowie\\".Musicologist James Perone credited Bowie with having \\"brought sophistication to rock music\\", and critical reviews frequently acknowledged the intellectual depth of his work and influence. The Human League founder Martyn Ware remarked that he had lived his life \\"as though he were an art installation.\\" The BBC's arts editor Will Gompertz likened Bowie to Pablo Picasso, writing that he was \\"an innovative, visionary, restless artist who synthesised complex avant garde concepts into beautifully coherent works that touched the hearts and minds of millions\\". U2 lead singer Bono commented, \\"I like Bowie when he’s evenly pulled in the direction of being a pop star and Picasso, where he's right down the middle. That’s usually my favorite, when the songwriting is disciplined but the recording is not. I love when he's pulled equally in the directions of art and populism.\\"Broadcaster John Peel contrasted Bowie with his progressive rock contemporaries, arguing that Bowie was \\"an interesting kind of fringe figure... on the outskirts of things\\". Peel said he \\"liked the idea of him reinventing himself... the one distinguishing feature about early-70s progressive rock was that it didn't progress. Before Bowie came along, people didn't want too much change\\".

Answer:","response":"The full name of the person who Martyn Ware remarked had lived his life \\"as though he were an art installation\\" is David Bowie. David Bowie was a renowned British singer, songwriter, and actor, celebrated for his unique and influential contributions to the world of music, particularly rock music in the 20th century. He was known for his distinctive voice and eclectic mix of musical styles that spanned across different genres, including glam rock, pop, electronica, and new wave. His progressive approach to creating music and his penchant for reinvention, as noted by Ware, left an indelible mark in the history of music. With his artistry and ability to meld avant garde concepts with accessible pop music, Bowie was often perceived as someone who transcended the boundary between \\"art\\" and \\"populism\\", as Bono, the lead singer of U2, pointed out. His stagecraft and penchant for reimagining himself echoed the ethos of an \\"art installation\\", living his life as a persistent and ever-evolving work of art."},{"question":"Sentiment possibilities Select from the following.

I don't know,\\" Riley said. \\"Can you imagine a prescription drug getting out on the market that didn't go through the approval process?\\" asked Dr. Steven Nissen, the chief of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic, who's testified to Congress about device safety problems. \\"Devices need to be regulated more vigorously. This is really disturbing.\\" In a statement, Olympus said it didn't think needed the FDA's permission to sell the device, but now at the request of the agency, it has applied for that permission. That application is still pending. Outbreak started at UCLA Seven hospital patients at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center were infected with the deadly superbug CRE -- also known as carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae -- from October to January, according to hospital officials. Two of those patients died. The patients caught CRE after routine endoscopic treatments. Hospital officials believe two medical scopes that still carried the deadly bacteria even after disinfection guidelines were followed were the cause of the superbug outbreak. The medical center has contacted 179 others who had endoscopic procedures between October and January and is offering them home tests to screen for the bacteria. Four other patients at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles have also been infected with the superbug linked to a contaminated duodenoscope, according to a statement released by the hospital. The medical scope was used in all four patients, between August and January 2015. Sixty-four other patients who had a duodenoscope procedure with that particular scope are being informed by mail, \\"out of an abundance of caution.\\" Not safer According to FDA rules, a manufacturer must seek clearance for a new model if it includes changes that \\"could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device.\\" The elevator channel of a duodenoscope is cleaned at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center. The TJF-Q180V duodenoscope, used to check out ducts in the gastrointestinal system, includes a modification to the exact part of the device that's been implicated in the superbug outbreaks. With this new model, Olympus sealed up that part of the device, known as the elevator channel, hoping to make it more impervious to infection. \\"The company clearly made these modifications to make the device safer, but it seems to be that it wasn't safer,\\" Riley said. Last year, at the FDA's request, Olympus applied for permission to sell the scope. That application is still pending. Riley emphasized that duodenoscope procedures can be lifesaving, so the agency doesn't want to take them off the market. \\"More than 500,000 of these procedures are done every year in the U.S., and the risk of bacterial transmission is actually really very, very low,\\" she said. \\"We believe the benefits outweigh the risks.\\" In its statement, Olympus wrote: \\"The emergence of drug-resistant microorganisms is a challenge to the entire health care community. Olympus is working with relevant medical societies and our customers in research of this emerging issue and the development of additional safeguards to prevent infection associated with [duodenoscope procedures].\\" Riley noted that the other two duodenoscope manufacturers, Pentax and Fujifilm, did apply for and were granted clearance to market models similar to Olympus' TJF-Q180V. Not clean enough Now the FDA is asking all three companies to submit evidence that the scopes can be thoroughly cleaned -- and so far it's not going well. Riley said twice the companies have submitted data that failed to show that cleaning could get rid of 99.9999% of all microbes on the scope -- the FDA's standard for disinfection. \\"We're still working with them to get good data,\\" she said. Riley said she doesn't know if the FDA will penalize Olympus for selling the device without permission. Diana Zuckerman, a device safety expert, said they should. \\"It's like with kids. How do you teach your children to behave if there are no consequences when they misbehave?\\" she said. ||||| LOS ANGELES (CBSLA.com) — The superbug bacteria blamed for a deadly outbreak last month at UCLA Medical Center has been linked to four patients infected at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, hospital officials said Wednesday. Cedars-Sinai officials have reached out to those four patients and 67 others who underwent endoscopic procedures any time between August of last year through this February. They’re offering free home-testing kits to determine whether they may have been infected with CRE, a bacteria resistant to the antibiotic carbapenem. One of the four patients infected with CRE has since died, but Cedars-Sinai says that person died from an “underlying disease and not from CRE, as their CRE infection had cleared.” The duodenoscope that was used on the patients has been located and is no longer in use. The hospital is also utilizing enhanced sterilization techniques on the scopes used in their endoscopic procedures. The FDA has acknowledged that the devices can be hard to clean, but says pulling the devices off the market would prevent people from getting life-saving procedures. Dr. Diana Zuckerman, of the National Center for Health Research, told KNX 1070 NEWSRADIO the cases point to underlying issues with the medical devices, which are commonly used in hospitals. “Number one is, the process is much too easy and devices are allowed to be sold that haven’t been really proven to be safe or effective,” Zuckerman said. “The second problem is that even when a company gets caught not properly testing its products…the company just gets away with it.” UCLA officials announced last month that seven of its patients had been infected with the superbug from a similar medical device, and two had died. The hospital also notified 179 other patients that they may have been exposed. UCLA also announced they’d be stepping up their endoscope sterilization procedures beyond manufacturer’s standards.

Interested in ? Add as an interest to stay up to date on the latest news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest Seven people have become infected with the drug-resistant \\"superbug\\" known as CRE at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center after undergoing endoscopy procedures, and CRE may have played a role in two of those patients' deaths, hospital officials said in February, adding that 179 people were exposed to the germ at UCLA. The scopes -- called duodenoscopes, which are inserted by mouth to access patients' small intestine, the pancreas and the liver -- were new and had only been in use since June, health officials said last month. Officials added that the scopes were cleaned in accordance with manufacturer guidelines. The hospital said it traced the bacteria back to two endoscopes manufactured by Olympus Corporation of the Americas. According to the Food and Drug Administration, Olympus had tweaked the design of its duodenoscopes and sold them without seeking clearance from the FDA to do so. Manufacturers are supposed to notify the FDA of design changes 90 days before marketing an altered device, according to the FDA website. It was not immediately clear what Olympus changed about the scopes' design or whether that change could have made the scopes more likely to harbor bacteria or more difficult to clean and sanitize -- and the FDA was not immediately able to clarify. In March 2014, the FDA notified Olympus that it needed the additional clearance before selling the altered devices, but the manufacturer did not submit the request for clearance until October, the FDA told ABC News. The submission is still \\"pending\\" because the FDA asked for more data. Olympus said in a statement that it was working with the FDA. “Olympus modified our 510(k)-cleared duodenoscope in 2010 and determined that the resulting TJF-Q180V did not require a new 510(k) application according to the FDA policy,” the company said in its statement to ABC News. “The FDA subsequently requested a 510(k) notification with information regarding the modified device. Olympus submitted a 510(k) to the FDA and the company continues to cooperate with the agency.” The FDA noted two other companies make duodenoscopes, and FDA spokeswoman Karen Riley told ABC News, \\"It's important to understand that we have received reports of infections associated with the duodenoscopes manufactured by all three device companies.\\" The Food and Drug Administration told ABC News last month that it has been aware of cleaning issues and bacterial transmissions associated with duodenoscopes for more than a year. \\"The CDC first alerted the FDA to a potential association of multi-drug resistant bacteria and duodenoscopes in fall 2013,\\" an agency spokesperson told ABC News. \\"The FDA has been actively working with federal partners, manufacturers and other stakeholders to better understand the issues that contribute to the infections and what can be done to mitigate them.\\" The FDA issued a safety communication about the duodenoscopes following the UCLA CRE cases, explaining that duodenoscopes are used in about 500,000 procedures a year, but meticulous cleaning and disinfecting \\"may not entirely eliminate\\" the risk of transmitting infection. From January 2012 through December 2014, the FDA received reports of 135 patients suspected of contracting germs from reprocessed duodenoscopes, the agency said. According to the CDC, almost every state has had a confirmed case of CRE, but state health departments are not required to notify the CDC about CRE infections. Duodenoscope-related CRE outbreaks similar to the one at UCLA have occurred recently in Chicago, Pittsburgh and Seattle. ||||| Four people developed a drug-resistant infection after a procedure at Cedars-Sinai, officials said. Dr. Bruce Hensel reports on the NBC4 News at 5 p.m. on March 4, 2015. (Published Wednesday, March 4, 2015) Four people were infected with a drug-resistant bacteria spread by a device used in medical procedures and another 71 are at risk because they were exposed to the same scope, officials with Cedars-Sinai hospital said Wednesday. The device is used in some endoscopic procedures. In a written statement, officials with the hospital said they have linked the bacterial infection to one device, and have increased the level of disinfection required between patient uses. The hospital initially said 68 people would be receiving notification that they had been exposed to the bacteria that causes the infection, but changed that number to 71. The hospital will be provided at-home kits for self-testing to those people to determine if they have the infection. A similar device was traced back to an outbreak of the \\"superbug\\" at Ronald Reagan-UCLA Medical Center last month. Two people died as a result of that outbreak. The devices are difficult to sterilize completely, and even feature warnings from the manufacturer. The bacteria exists naturally in many people’s intestines and will not affect them, but once it enters the bloodstream it can be deadly. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","response":"A medical device called a duodenoscope, used in procedures to help doctors look inside small intestine, pancreas, and liver, was found to be spreading a dangerous drug-resistant bacteria called CRE to some patients. This has caused infections and even some deaths. The company that makes these devices, Olympus, made changes to the design without getting permission from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). People are now worried that these changes could be the reason the device is spreading the bacteria.

As the southernmost of the three Nubian kingdoms, Alodia was the last to be converted to Christianity. According to John, the Alodian King was aware of the conversion of Nobadia in 543 and asked him to send a bishop who would also baptize his people. The request was granted in 580, leading to the baptism of the King, his family and the local nobility. Thus, Alodia became a part of the Christian world under the Coptic Patriarchate of Alexandria. After conversion, several pagan temples, such as the one in Musawwarat es-Sufra, were probably converted into churches. The extent and speed with which Christianity spread among the Alodian populace is uncertain. Despite the conversion of the nobility, it is likely that Christianization of the rural population would have proceeded slowly, if at all.Between 639 and 641, Muslim Arabs conquered Egypt from the Byzantine Empire. Makuria, which by this time had been unified with Nobadia, fended off two subsequent Muslim invasions, one in 641/642 and another in 652. In the aftermath, Makuria and the Arabs agreed to sign the Baqt, a peace treaty that included a yearly exchange of gifts and socioeconomic regulations between Arabs and Nubians. Alodia was explicitly mentioned in the treaty as not being affected by it. While the Arabs failed to conquer Nubia, they began to settle along the western coast of the Red Sea. They founded the port towns of Aydhab and Badi in the 7th century and Suakin, first mentioned in the 10th century. From the 9th century, they pushed further inland, settling among the Beja throughout the Eastern Desert. Arab influence would remain confined to the east of the Nile until the 14th century. answer the following question: What kingdom converted to Christianity before Alodia?","response":"The kingdom that converted to Christianity before Alodia was Nobadia. Alodia was the southernmost of the three Nubian kingdoms, and it was the last to be converted to Christianity. Nobadia's conversion occurred in 543, preceding the conversion of Alodia, which took place in 580."},{"question":"Premise: For Many conservatives have seized on the Boskin report as a club with which to beat all those liberals who have been whining about declining incomes and increasing poverty in America. Hypothesis: Declining incomes are due to liberals whining. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","response":"Alright, let's break this down like we're explaining it to a 5-year-old. A premise is like a starting thought or idea. In this case, the premise is that some people (conservatives) are using the Boskin report to argue against other people (liberals) who say that there's less money for people and more poverty in America. A hypothesis is like a guess about why something is happening. In this case, the hypothesis is saying that the reason for less money and more poverty is because of the liberals whining. So, the question is asking if the starting idea (premise) means the guess (hypothesis) is true. The answer is no, the premise does not necessarily mean the hypothesis is true. Just because people are arguing about something, it doesn't mean their arguments cause the problem.

In 2009, he became world champion in nordic combined. - Gunder Gundersen (12 September 1930 2 June 2005) was a Norwegian nordic combined skier and sports official. - The 1988 Winter Olympics, officially known as the XV Olympic Winter Games, was a Winter Olympics multi-sport event celebrated in and around Calgary, Alberta, Canada between February 13 and 28, 1988. The host city was selected in 1981 over Falun, Sweden and Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy. Most events took place in Calgary while several skiing events were held in the mountain resorts of Nakiska and Canmore, west of the city. - Northern Europe is the northern part or region of Europe. Although no definitive borders or definition exists for the term, geographically, Northern Europe may be considered to consist approximately of all of Europe above the 52nd parallel north; which includes (from west to east) most or all of: Iceland, the Republic of Ireland, the Isle of Man, the United Kingdom, the Faroe Islands, the Netherlands, northern Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, northern Poland, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and northwest Russia. However, narrower definitions may also be used based on other geographical factors, such as climate and ecology. Greenland, geographically a part of North America, is politically a part of the Kingdom of Denmark, and may be included depending on the definition. - At the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2009 in Liberec , Czech Republic , four Nordic combined were held . It also showed the biggest format changes since the introduction of the Gundersen method at the 1985 World Championships in Seefeld , Austria . In addition of the 10 km mass start event , there were changes in the Gundersen - based individual events . The 7.5 km sprint event was changed to a 10 km individual large hill event while the 15 km individual event was changed to a 10 km individual normal hill event with both being approved in September 2008 . These changes also affected the Nordic combined program for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver though the mass start was excluded . The United States , which had two medals in Nordic combined prior to this championships ( Johnny Spillane : gold in 7.5 km sprint at Val di Fiemme in 2003 and Bill Demong : silver in 15 km individual at Sapporo in 2007 ) , won a total of four medals with three golds and a bronze .

This was the fourth time these championships were hosted either in the Czech Republic or in Czechoslovakia, having done so at Janské Lázn (1925) and Vysoké Tatry (in both 1935 and 1970). - Tino Edelmann (born 13 April 1985) is a retired German Nordic combined skier who has competed since 2001. He won a bronze medal in the 4 x 5 km team event at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver and six silver medals at the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships. - A winter sport or winter activity is a recreational activity or sport which is played during cold weather months. Most such sports are variations of skiing, ice skating and sledding. Traditionally such sports were only played in cold areas during winter, but artificial snow and artificial ice allow more flexibility. Artificial ice can be used to provide ice rinks for ice skating, ice hockey and bandy in a milder climate. - The Nordic combined events have been contested at the Winter Olympic Games since 1924. The first competition involved 18 km cross-country skiing, followed by ski jumping. Whoever earned the most points from both competitions won the event. At the 1952 Winter Olympics, the ski jumping was held first, followed by 18 km cross-country skiing. The cross-country skiing portion was reduced to 15 km at the 1956 Winter Olympics. The ski jumping styles would change over the years as well, from the Kongsberger technique after World War I to the Daescher technique in the 1950s to the current V-style from 1985 onwards. The cross-country skiing technique would switch from classical to freestyle for all competitions beginning in 1985, but the biggest change would occur at the 1988 Winter Olympics in the scoring with the Gundersen method, meaning the 15 km cross country portion would go from an interval start race to a pursuit race, so that whoever crossed the finish line first won the event. The team event with a 3 x 10 km cross country relay started at the 1988 Winter Olympics, changing to the current 4 x 5 km cross-country relay at the 1998 Winter Olympics. The 7.5 km sprint event was added at the 2002 Winter Olympics. Nordic combined remains a men's only event as of the 2010 Winter Olympics. For the 2010 Winter Games, the 15 km Individual Gundersen which consisted of 2 jumps from the normal hill followed by 15 km cross country will be replaced by a 10 km individual normal hill event which will consist of one jump from the individual normal hill following by 10 km of cross country using the Gundersen system while the 7.5 km sprint will be replaced by the 10 km individual large hill event. - The 2008/09 FIS Nordic Combined World Cup was the 26th world cup season, a combination of ski jumping and cross-country skiing organized by FIS.

The southernmost point in Germany is located in the municipality. - The FIS Nordic Combined World Cup is a Nordic combined competition organized yearly by FIS, representing the highest level in international competition for this sport. It was first arranged for the 1983/84 season. Team event was first time held in 1999/00 season. The FIS race director is a Norwegian ex ski jumper and ex world record holder Lasse Ottesen. - The Vancouver Organizing Committee for the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games (VANOC) was the non-profit organization responsible for planning, organizing, financing and staging the 2010 Winter Olympics and 2010 Winter Paralympics. Established on September 30, 2003, about four months after the 2010 games were awarded to Vancouver, British Columbia, it performed these roles with \\"the mandate to support and promote the development of sport in Canada.\\" - The Gundersen method is a method in the Nordic combined developed by Gunder Gundersen, a Nordic combined athlete from Norway, that was first used in the 1980s. This technique turned the cross country skiing part of the Nordic combined from a point-based system where all athletes ski in an interval start manner and whoever earned the most points with the ski jumping part of the Nordic combined won the event to a pursuit race for the cross country skiing part where whoever crossed the finish line first in the cross country skiing part of the Nordic combined event won the competition. This parallels the modern pentathlon in which the start times of the final event (a cross-country run) are also staggered so that the first to cross the finish line is the winner of the entire event. - Ski jumping is a form of Nordic skiing in which athletes descend a specially constructed takeoff ramp (known as the \\"inrun\\"), jump from the end of it (the \\"table\\") with as much power as they can generate, and \\"fly\\" as far as possible down a steeply sloped hill. Points are awarded for distance and style by five judges, with competition sanctioned by the International Ski Federation (FIS). To enable the athletes (who are known as \\"ski jumpers\\") to effectively glide such long distances and land safely, the skis they use are considerably wider and longer than their cross-country and alpine skiing counterparts. Ski jumping is predominantly a winter sport and has been part of the Winter Olympic Games since its inception in 1924 for men and since 2014 for women. Since 1954 it is possible to ski jump in summer on artificial surfaces made from plastic. Along with cross-country skiing, ski jumping is one of two sports which form the Nordic combined discipline. Holmenkollbakken in Oslo is the holy place of this sport, which is most popular in Austria, Germany, Finland, Japan, Norway, Poland and Slovenia. - The 1972 Winter Olympics, officially known as the (French: Les \\"XIes Jeux olympiques d'hiver\\"), were a winter multi-sport event which was held from February 3 to February 13, 1972, in Sapporo, Hokkaid, Japan. It was the first Winter Olympics to be held outside Europe and North America, and only the third game (summer or winter) held outside those regions over all, after Melbourne (1956 Summer Olympics) and Tokyo (1964 Summer Olympics). - The 2010 Winter Olympics, officially known as the XXI Olympic Winter Games (French: Les \\"XXIes Jeux olympiques d'hiver\\") and commonly known as Vancouver 2010, informally the 21st Winter Olympics, were a major international multi-sport event held from February 12 to 28, 2010, in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, with some events held in the surrounding suburbs of Richmond, West Vancouver and the University Endowment Lands, and in the nearby resort town of Whistler. Approximately 2,600 athletes from 82 nations participated in 86 events in fifteen disciplines. Both the Olympic and Paralympic Games were organized by the Vancouver Organizing Committee (VANOC), headed by John Furlong. The 2010 Winter Olympics were the third Olympics hosted by Canada and the first by the province of British Columbia. Previously, Canada hosted the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Quebec, and the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta. Vancouver is the largest city to host the Winter Olympics. Given the information, choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'sport'. Answer:","response":"Subject: Nordic combined Object: Winter sport"},{"question":"She quirks the edge of a wry smile and then she looks back to Shaelynn directly , \\" You have control ... when you feed . Will I ? I mean ... I do n't want to have to kill people to live . \\" Why might she have to kill people so she can live ?","response":"The phrase \\"you have control... when you feed\\" suggests that the speaker is discussing a scenario in which individuals need to feed on others to survive. This context, coupled with Shaelynn's response about not wanting to \\"kill people to live,\\" points to the possibility that the characters are involved in a supernatural or fantastical situation. One likely explanation is that they are discussing vampirism, where individuals must consume human blood to sustain their existence. If the speaker is indeed referring to vampires, then the reason why the character might have to kill people to live could be based on the traditional lore surrounding these creatures. Vampires are typically described as undead beings who require the consumption of human blood to maintain their immortality, strength, and other supernatural abilities. In most vampire mythologies, there is a concern about feeding on humans, as doing so could lead to the death of the human victim, thereby tainting the vampire's moral compass. In this context, Shaelynn's concern appears to be about maintaining control over her instincts and actions while feeding. Vampires are often depicted as having a strong, primal urge to feed, which can override their self-control. This could lead them to take more blood than they need, harming or killing their victims as a result. Thus, she fears that if she becomes a vampire or is in the process of becoming one, she might lose control and kill humans during feeding. Another possible interpretation of this scenario might involve a different supernatural creature or a metaphorical situation where an individual must harm others for their survival. For example, a werewolf could be the creature in question, or it could be a discussion about a form of addiction where the characters need to hurt others to maintain their well-being or protect their secret. Regardless of the specific lore or context, the primary concern for Shaelynn appears to be maintaining her humanity and ensuring that she does not have to kill people to live. Whether this involves learning to control her supernatural urges or finding an alternative means of sustaining her existence, the primary focus of the conversation seems to be centered around morality, self-control, and the potential consequences of actions taken in the name of survival."},{"question":"Article: Choose a ribbon color that goes well with your towel.

Answer:","response":"The last time the Houston Rockets made it to the NBA Finals was during the 1994-1995 season. The team was led by Hall of Famer Hakeem \\"The Dream\\" Olajuwon and then-head coach Rudy Tomjanovich. During the playoffs, the Rockets entered as the 6th seed in the Western Conference and faced a difficult road to the NBA Finals. In the first round, the Rockets defeated the Utah Jazz in a closely contested five-game series (3-2). The second round saw them face the Phoenix Suns, which was a rematch of the previous year's playoff series. Houston managed to pull through once again, winning the series in seven games (4-3). In the Western Conference Finals, the Rockets went up against the top-seeded San Antonio Spurs, led by MVP David Robinson. Despite being the underdogs, the Houston Rockets won the series in six games (4-2), showcasing their resilience and determination to make it back to the NBA Finals. The 1995 NBA Finals featured the Houston Rockets against the Orlando Magic, who were making their first NBA Finals appearance. The Magic had a young and talented roster, which included a prime Shaquille O'Neal and a rising star in Anfernee \\"Penny\\" Hardaway. However, the Rockets' experience and exceptional play from Hakeem Olajuwon proved to be too much for the Magic. The Rockets swept the series, winning 4-0, and securing their second consecutive NBA Championship. Since that triumph in 1995, the Houston Rockets have had various levels of success in the NBA, but they have not made it back to the NBA Finals. However, they have remained a competitive franchise and have had notable postseason runs, including a recent appearance in the 2018 Western Conference Finals, where they lost to the Golden State Warriors in seven games (3-4)."},{"question":"In this task, you are given two facts, and a multiple-choice question.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"Darwin was hard at work on his \\"big book\\" on Natural Selection, when on 18 June 1858 he received a parcel from Wallace, who stayed on the Maluku Islands (Ternate and Gilolo). It enclosed twenty pages describing an evolutionary mechanism, a response to Darwin's recent encouragement, with a request to send it on to Lyell if Darwin thought it worthwhile. The mechanism was similar to Darwin's own theory. Darwin wrote to Lyell that \\"your words have come true with a vengeance, ... forestalled\\" and he would \\"of course, at once write and offer to send [it] to any journal\\" that Wallace chose, adding that \\"all my originality, whatever it may amount to, will be smashed\\". Lyell and Hooker agreed that a joint publication putting together Wallace's pages with extracts from Darwin's 1844 Essay and his 1857 letter to Gray should be presented at the Linnean Society, and on 1 July 1858, the papers entitled On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection, by Wallace and Darwin respectively, were read out but drew little reaction. While Darwin considered Wallace's idea to be identical to his concept of natural selection, historians have pointed out differences. Darwin described natural selection as being analogous to the artificial selection practised by animal breeders, and emphasised competition between individuals; Wallace drew no comparison to selective breeding, and focused on ecological pressures that kept different varieties adapted to local conditions. Some historians have suggested that Wallace was actually discussing group selection rather than selection acting on individual variation.\\"?

Based on the review you provided, the chances of buying the product may be decreased for several reasons. Here's a detailed analysis of the product review: 1. Negative sentiment: The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with the product, using strong negative language like \\"I hated this camera\\". This indicates that their experience with the product was not positive. 2. Image quality concerns: The review points out that the photographs taken by the camera are often fuzzy if not held perfectly still. This is a significant issue, as the primary function of a camera is to capture high-quality images. It implies that the camera may necessitate additional equipment, such as a tripod, to achieve good results. 3. Complexity: The reviewer mentions that the camera has many features (referred to as \\"bells & whistles\\"), which, in some instances, may be favorable. However, complex functions with a steep learning curve can be a drawback for users who prefer a simpler, more user-friendly experience or those who may not fully utilize the additional features. 4. Price-to-value comparison: The review highlights that a different camera – the Kodak mentioned – was both cheaper and produced better quality photographs compared to the product in question. This suggests that there might be better alternatives within the same price range or even at a lower price point, offering greater value for money. In conclusion, the provided review is likely to decrease the chances of buying the product, as it raises concerns about the image quality, complexity, and potentially better alternatives available.

The view is built with extremely fine brushwork and shows a number of highly detailed buildings and hills before snowcapped mountains.A lance rests against the shoulder of a youthful-looking St. Michael. Michael is dressed in elaborately jewelled and coloured armour, his left arm holding his helmet, while his right hand rests on the shoulder of the donor as he is presented to Mary. The donor kneels in prayer before the Virgin, with his hands held upwards as if in prayer, although they are not clasped. He wears a gold ring on his right small finger, and is dressed in a long olive-green houppelande, at the time the height of fashion and an indicator of status within the Burgundian court. The gown has a fur-lined high collar and deep baggy sleeves, also lined with fur.

Eyeglasses are a good option for correcting astigmatism. They help to correct the irregular curve of your cornea and allow your retina to focus properly. Your optometrist will determine your glasses prescription so you can buy glasses to correct the astigmatism. Go to an eyeglasses store and try on glasses in person. Make sure the glasses feel comfortable when they sit on your nose and that they complement, rather than overwhelm, your face. You should feel confident when you wear them. If you want to buy eyeglasses online, you will need your prescription. Use a virtual try-on tool to see how the glasses will look on your face before you order them. Some eyeglass companies will offer to send you free samples of their frames so you can find the right one for you. Spray an eyeglass cleaner on the lenses and wipe them down with a smooth, dry cloth. Clean your glasses once a day, or several times a day, so your vision is not obscured by dust or dirt when you wear them. Keep your glasses in good condition by getting the screws in the arms tightened when needed. Your glasses should always sit flush against the sides of your face, with the arms on the glasses straight and even. Store your eyeglasses in a hard shell case to protect them and keep them in good repair. To correct astigmatism, you will need special toric contact lenses, rather than standard contact lenses. They are a good option if you don’t like wearing glasses all the time and you are comfortable putting contact lenses in your eye. Your optometrist may recommend contact lenses if you play a lot of sports or are very active and do not want to have to worry about wearing eyeglasses. Children 12 years and older can wear contact lenses. However, they may need the help of a parent to put them in. Wash your hands and then remove the contact from the case. Place it on your index finger. Pull your upper and lower eyelids away from your eye with the other hand. Carefully place the contact on your eye. Release your eyelid and blink to keep the contact in place. If you have trouble putting in the contact lenses, speak to your optometrist for guidance. It may take some practice to get the hang of it. Use a hard shell case to store the contact lenses and keep them in specialized cleaning solution. Look for cleaning solution made specifically for contact lenses at a medical supply store or online. Replace the cleaning solution every time you use the lenses so they stay clean. Get a new hard shell case every 3 months to ensure the lenses do not get dirty.

Being an active listener means reading in between the lines. Sometimes it means knowing what the other person feels or is thinking before they do. If you're an active listener, you might know who your friend likes before they do. Know when not to talk. There's an old saying out there: The dumb person talks; the wise person listens. While that's definitely an overstatement, it has some truth in it. Begin to feel comfortable just being with your bestie, not constantly having to talk to fill the silence.

Article: So many of us expect everything we do to be successful. We look forward to success to show us our value or to be the top of the group wherever we are. How many times in our schooling did we hope for a high mark? We want it and then feel like a failure when we don't achieve what we want. Even when we succeed we still pass that and go onto the next success and then the next. We are not often taught how to face failures. For me, failure taught me more than success did. Success is of the moment and temporary but failure means we have ever done. It makes me stop and think. It opened my eyes and brain to different possibilities. Failure is just a choice in redoing not in giving up. Experiencing failure,I looked deeper and further. I have a grandson who plays hockey and as all players do,he went through a _ . So I saw he was unhappy with himself. Then I said to him, \\"Why don't you think of it differently rather than being unhappy?\\" And I asked, \\"Scoring is your goal, right?\\" He answered,\\"Of course.\\" \\"Why aren't you scoring now? Do you need a readjustment ?\\"All of a sudden he calmed down--he was thinking of what I had just said. So in the next game I saw him trying different things to do better. Later he started scoring. Now when something is wrong, he takes the time to think it over rather than just keeping the \\"failure\\" mode . Look at failure differently. Failure is what gives us power to try a different way of doing things. It teaches us to rethink, redo, and then success will come about. Don't give up but learn to use a different way.

The chances of doing so was tabulated by a DePaul University math professor to be one-in-9.2 quintillion. The prospect of someone taking home the billion dollar prize took a big hit after the very first game of the tournament. About 84 percent of contestants incorrectly picked Ohio State to beat Dayton in the opener. The biggest upset, by far, was Mercer’s win over Duke.

(Associated Press) A second day of upsets ended any chance of someone having a perfect NCAA tournament bracket in Warren Buffet's 1 billion challenge. It was a favorite that provided the first blemish on the final three people's brackets in the Quicken Loans contest on the Yahoo Sports website. All three had ninth-seeded George Washington beating Memphis. The Tigers won 71-66. \\"If Warren Buffett wants to donate the (billion) to our university, we will take it and use it in good company,\\" Memphis coach Josh Pastner said. \\"We'll find a way.\\" It only took 25 games for everyone to be eliminated. Then again most of brackets were knocked out on the tournament's first full day. The number of unblemished brackets kept dwindling after third-seed Duke, sixth-seed UMass and seventh-seed New Mexico lost Friday. Only 16 people remained perfect after 10th-seeded Stanford topped New Mexico. Then Tennessee routed UMass, leaving only six people with a chance of beating the 9.2 quintillion-to-1 odds. Gonzaga's victory over Oklahoma State cut that down to the final three. Even though no one won the 1 billion, the top 20 scores will still each get 100,000. Quicken Loans, which is sponsoring and insuring the Buffet contest, said on its Twitter feed that it wouldn't reveal the number of entrants to the challenge. The pool was supposed to be capped at 15 million entries. It probably wouldn't have mattered if they had let more people join. At CBSSports.com, only 0.03 percent of entrants were still perfect after Mercer upset Duke. They didn't last much longer as Tennessee's rout of UMass wiped out all the remaining unblemished entries. It took 21 games to end everyone's hope of perfection this year. Last season it took 23 games and 24 in 2012. A year ago, not a single person of the 11 million who entered on ESPN's website was perfect after a first day filled with upsets. Just four got 15 out of 16 right. This year people lasted a little longer.

The film tells the story of middleweight boxer Rubin \\"The Hurricane\\" Carter, who was convicted of committing a triple murder in a bar in Paterson, New Jersey. His sentence was set aside after he had spent nearly 20 years in prison. The film concentrates on Rubin Carter's life between 1966 and 1985. It describes his fight against the conviction for triple murder and how he copes with nearly 20 years in prison. A parallel plot follows Lesra Martin, an underprivileged Afro-American youth from Brooklyn, now living in Toronto. In the 1980s, the child becomes interested in Carter's life and circumstances after reading Carter's autobiography. He convinces his Canadian foster family to commit themselves to Carter's case. The story culminates with Carter's legal team's successful pleas to Judge H. Lee Sarokin of the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. In 1966, Rubin \\"The Hurricane\\" Carter was a top-ranked middleweight boxer, expected by many fans to become the world's greatest boxing champion. When three victims, specifically the club's bartender and a male and a female customer, were shot to death in a bar in Paterson, New Jersey, Carter and his friend John Artis, driving home from another club in Paterson, were stopped and interrogated by the police. Although the police asserted that Carter and Artis were innocent and thus, \\"were never suspects,\\" a man named Alfred Bello, a suspect himself in the killings, claimed that Carter and Artis were present at the time of the murders. On the basis of Bello's testimony, Carter and Artis were convicted of the triple homicide in the club, Carter was given three consecutive life sentences.

This time, though, I smiled. In a few days, I’d be on the other side of that polyester divide, finding out what really goes on among the business consultants, rock stars and — I’m guessing — bejeweled countesses that sit up there. It’s not every day that a frugal traveler, let alone the Frugal Traveler, sits in business, so first a brief explanation. A credit card offer had netted me over 100,000 nearly free British Airways miles (mostly through a sign-up bonus), and I planned to use them to fly from New York to New Zealand and back via its partner Qantas, for the standard 80,000 miles. But British Airways miles are legendarily difficult to redeem, and this time was no exception. When I called the airline last October, I offered to fly any day in March — the off-season — with a flexible return time. To my astonishment, nothing was available. The next best alternative was to fly New York to Auckland, then back to Los Angeles, wait four days, and pay 25,000 extra miles (which I had, barely) to fly the rest of the way back to New York on another partner, American. There was a twist: only a business class seat was available. In my many years of flying, I had never sat in business class. Here, finally, was my chance. So, on a sunny April Friday at Los Angeles International Airport, I headed to my gate and right into the business class line, more excited, for once, to get on a plane than to get off. The advantages became apparent before boarding even started, when I was pointed not toward the regular, jampacked security line, but upstairs and into a disconcertingly friendly and rapid process. “Hello, how are you today, sir?” said a disturbingly smiley man, checking my ticket. “Have a wonderful flight.” I did still have to take off my shoes, but there was next to no line. I eased right through. A few paces down, our business class passenger tributary flowed into the rushing river of the harried coach classes. At the gate, another luxury: I’d be able to board early, before even the families traveling with small children and passengers needing special assistance. Was that a glint of jealousy I spotted in a toddler’s eye as I waltzed past him onto the ramp? I had never felt so alive. The seat: I was not expecting some masterpiece of design — this wasn’t Emirates or Singapore Airlines, after all — and indeed, it was not a thing of beauty. But it was big, with a luxuriously winged headrest, a mini-table in addition to the awkward fold-out tray table, and controls to move the seat every which way. I sat down and stretched my legs out … and out … and out some more until I practically fell off the seat. This was a morning flight, and though I don’t generally drink in the a.m. hours, there’s always room for an exception. Whom do you have to bribe to get some 11 a.m. Champagne around here? No one, it turns out: it arrived within moments. I sipped as I read the menu. Thai curry shrimp with couscous? Sounded good. Glenlivet Scotch? Nice, though a bit too high proof for this early in the day. I noticed we would soon be served “warm mixed nuts” – I had never thought of mixed nuts as heatable. I was a bit concerned that there was no screen, let alone a 15-inch LCD one, built into the seat in front of me. But no problem – we business-classers soon each received a Samsung tablet preloaded with plenty of movies, television shows and many other options I didn’t end up taking advantage of. An announcement came over the system: food was available for customers in coach. And yes, you could pay for that brisket sandwich with a credit card. Ah, how adorable, paying for food delivered in disposable plastic packaging. I envisioned my Thai curry shrimp arriving on actual china with actual silverware on an actual tablecloth. As it turned out, I underestimated American: it came on two tablecloths. The shrimp was just spicy enough, and it paired nicely with the chardonnay (lucky guess). The best part, however, was what came next – a choice between Ben & Jerry’s ice cream with marshmallows for dessert, or a cheese plate. I chose the ice cream. I would have asked for both, but that seemed like overkill, especially considering what came toward the end of the flight: warm cookies and cold milk. I was too stuffed to accept — but did anyway. Though I didn’t need to go to the bathroom, I was still excited to see what might be in store for me in the business class lavatory. Cinnamon-scented potpourri? Antique silver fixtures? Extra-plush Charmin? Alas, it was strikingly similar to the coach class lavatories, with one delightful exception: those in economy class weren’t allowed to use it, making for shorter lines. Most business class passengers must be as happy to land at their destination as those in coach. Not me. Might heavy air traffic force us to circle J.F.K. long enough to call for another round of Ben & Jerry’s? No. As a consolation prize, my ragged, ripped rolling suitcase, a priority tag contrasting with worn stickers from Turkish and Brazilian bus carriers, emerged first on the belt. On the subway ride home, I concluded that I saw the appeal: Roomy seats, smiling service, no lines, warm cookies. But what if I had been paying for a regular ticket? Later, I checked the prices on American’s Flight 40 over the next few weeks. The one-way coach price bounced around a bit, averaging 300. Business class was almost always 1,710. Some companies and wealthy people think that extra 1,410 is worth it; I’d guess most of the rest of us think it’s loony. A middle ground of fliers use miles they could use for additional free flights to upgrade to double-tablecloth land. To that, I say to each his own. I did, though, think back to a moment soon after our flight was aloft. Just as I was settling in to my new, temporary life of luxury, a flight attendant up ahead pulled shut the curtains separating my new friends in business class not from coach but from the real high rollers, in first class. What, what in the world, could be going on up there?","response":"The Frugal Traveler discovered the appeal of business class during a flight with partner airlines British Airways, Qantas, and American, having accrued over 100,000 nearly-free miles through a credit card offer. After experiencing the significant difference between coach and business class services—including priority security lines, early boarding, spacious seats, preloaded Samsung tablets, and two-tablecloth catering—the author concluded that while some might find the 1,410 price difference worth it and others may consider it excessive, there's no denying the appeal of the business class experience."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Who directed the film that was a remake of the 1920 silent film of the same name,starring A popular supporting player of the late 1930s?

No such luck this time, songs in this album are totally brainless and idealess mess, and the stupid talks included seems to confirm that they have declined back to childhood level again.This is very sad, since Return to paradise was extremely strong comeback and live album, but they totally failed to carry on after that.

Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: Evil Dead II Movie plot: The film begins with a simplified recap of the events of the first film. Ash Williams and his girlfriend Linda take a romantic vacation to a seemingly abandoned cabin in the woods. While in the cabin, Ash plays a tape of an archaeology Professor Knowby, the cabin's previous inhabitant, reciting passages from the Necronomicon Ex-Mortis (or Book of the Dead), which he has discovered during an archaeological dig. The recorded incantation unleashes an evil force that kills and later possesses Linda. Ash is then forced to decapitate his girlfriend with a shovel in self-defense, and buries her near the cabin. The film then picks up where the first film left off, where a spirit is seen hunting for Ash. Ash becomes briefly possessed by the demon, but when day breaks the spirit is gone, and Ash returns to normal. Ash finds little chance of safety, however, as the bridge leading to the cabin is destroyed. Linda's revived head attacks Ash by biting his hand. Ash brings Linda's severed head to the shed, where her headless body attacks him with a chainsaw. Ash gains the upper hand and slashes the relentless zombified Linda to death, killing her a second and final time. Later, Ash is forced to sever his bitten right hand, which has become possessed. While Ash deals with this force, the professor's daughter, Annie, and her research partner, Ed Getley, return from the dig with more pages of the Necronomicon in tow, only to find the destroyed bridge. They enlist the help of Jake and Bobby Joe to guide them along an alternate trail to the cabin. The four of them find an embattled Ash, who is, seemingly, slowly being driven insane due to his encounter with the demon, such as hallucinating that the room comes to life and begins laughing hysterically at him. At first, he is mistaken for a murderer by the four people because he shoots at them through the door (mistaking them as the Evil Force), but they find out the truth after listening to a recording of Annie's father, Professor Knowby, that talked about how his wife Henrietta...

The extra lumbar and thoracic vertebrae account for the cat's enhanced spinal mobility and flexibility, compared to humans. The caudal vertebrae form the tail, used by the cat as a counterbalance to the body during quick movements. Between their vertebrae, they have elastic discs, useful for cushioning the jump landings.

From the age of six and for the rest of his life Saint-Saëns composed mélodies, writing more than 140. He regarded his songs as thoroughly and typically French, denying any influence from Schubert or other German composers of Lieder. Unlike his protégé Fauré, or his rival Massenet, he was not drawn to the song cycle, writing only two during his long career – Mélodies persanes (\\"Persian Songs\\", 1870) and Le Cendre rouge (\\"The Red Ash Tree\\", 1914, dedicated to Fauré). The poet whose works he set most often was Victor Hugo; others included Alphonse de Lamartine, Pierre Corneille, Amable Tastu, and, in eight songs, Saint-Saëns himself: among his many non-musical talents he was an amateur poet. He was highly sensitive to word setting, and told the young composer Lili Boulanger that to write songs effectively musical talent was not enough: \\"you must study the French language in depth; it is indispensable.\\" Most of the mélodies are written for piano accompaniment, but a few, including \\"Le lever du soleil sur le Nil\\" (\\"Sunrise over the Nile\\", 1898) and \\"Hymne à la paix\\" (\\"Hymn to Peace\\", 1919), are for voice and orchestra. His settings, and chosen verses, are generally traditional in form, contrasting with the free verse and less structured forms of a later generation of French composers, including Debussy.Saint-Saëns composed more than sixty sacred vocal works, ranging from motets to masses and oratorios. Among the larger-scale compositions are the Requiem (1878) and the oratorios Le déluge (1875) and The Promised Land (1913) with an English text by Herman Klein. He was proud of his connection with British choirs, commenting, \\"One likes to be appreciated in the home, par excellence, of oratorio.\\" He wrote a smaller number of secular choral works, some for unaccompanied choir, some with piano accompaniment and some with full orchestra. In his choral works, Saint-Saëns drew heavily on tradition, feeling that his models should be Handel, Mendelssohn and other earlier masters of the genre. In Klein's view, this approach...

Embarrassed, he gets back up, picks up his groceries and carries them into his apartment with his head down. After putting his groceries away, he notices that although both of his knees are scraped, only his left knee is warm to the touch. His right knee feels cool when he puts his hand on it. Is more blood flowing to the right or left knee? Hint: The body's second line of defense against pathogens includes the inflammatory response. If bacteria enter the skin through a scrape, the area may become red, warm, and painful. These are signs of inflammation. Inflammation is one way the body reacts to infections or injuries. Inflammation is caused by chemicals that are released when skin or other tissues are damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand. This increases blood flow to the damaged area, which makes the area red and slightly warm. The chemicals also attract white blood cells called neutrophils to the wound and cause them to leak out of blood vessels into the damaged tissue. Answer:","response":"In this situation, more blood is flowing to Ryan's left knee. The reason behind this is the inflammatory response of the body to potential pathogens. Since his left knee is warm to the touch, it indicates that the blood vessels have dilated, or expanded, due to the release of chemicals as part of the body's second line of defense. The increased blood flow to the damaged area, in this case, Ryan's left knee, makes it red and slightly warm. Meanwhile, Ryan's right knee feels cool, indicating that it does not exhibit the same level of inflammation and increased blood flow as the left knee. The purpose of this increased blood flow is to carry more immune cells, such as white blood cells called neutrophils, to the site of injury to help prevent infections and facilitate healing."},{"question":"Tweet: another boring night of whabs getting drunk in store for me...

The answer to this question is:","response":"Title: Fair for the Basics Review: I recently downloaded the com.google.android.gms app and have been using it for some time now. While the app provides a decent user experience, it hasn't exactly blown me away. I'd rate it 3 stars out of 5. The overall performance of the app is fairly good, and it does carry out its core functions as expected. I like its clean and simple interface, but sometimes it feels too basic, lacking some innovative features that can be found in alternative apps in the market. The location services and syncing capabilities are consistent and work as intended, which is a plus for sure. However, the app sometimes becomes unresponsive and consumes more battery life than I'd like it to. Additionally, I've experienced some random crashes, which disrupts my use of the app and can be frustrating. I also feel that the app could benefit from better integration with other third-party applications, particularly in the map and navigation functions. As a user who appreciates a seamless experience, I've also noticed that updates haven't been too frequent. While this may not be a dealbreaker for some, it does indicate that improvements and bug fixes are not the top priority for the developers. In conclusion, the com.google.android.gms app is sufficient for those looking for a basic experience and essential functions. However, it may disappoint users seeking a polished, innovative, and high-quality application. I hope that the developer takes these concerns into consideration and addresses them in future updates."},{"question":"Here's a question: Where is all compost found?

Here is a comprehensive step-by-step guide to help you achieve that perfect cup of coffee: 1. Choose the right coffee beans: The first step to making perfect coffee is selecting high-quality beans. Look for freshly roasted, single-origin beans from reputable coffee roasters. Coffee beans from different regions have unique flavor profiles, so you may want to experiment with different beans to find the taste you prefer. 2. Store your beans properly: Store your coffee beans in an airtight container, away from direct sunlight, heat, and moisture. Avoid storing beans in the fridge or freezer, as it can cause condensation, affecting the flavor. 3. Invest in a good coffee grinder: Grind your coffee beans just before brewing to ensure maximum freshness and flavor. Using a good-quality burr grinder is important because it provides a consistent grind size, which is crucial for proper extraction. 4. Determine your preferred grind size: The grind size affects the extraction of coffee flavors from the beans. Coarser grinds work well for French press and cold brew, while medium grinds are suitable for drip coffee makers and pour-over techniques. Fine grinds are ideal for espresso machines and AeroPress. 5. Measure your coffee and water accurately: To achieve consistent results, always use a scale to measure your coffee and water. Start with a standard coffee-to-water ratio of 1:15 or 1:17 (1 gram of coffee for every 15 or 17 grams of water). Adjust the ratio according to your personal taste preference. 6. Use fresh and filtered water: Use filtered water to make your coffee, as tap water can contain impurities that affect the overall taste. Also, ensure the water is at the right temperature, which is usually between 195°F to 205°F (90°C to 96°C), for optimal flavor extraction. 7. Select the best brewing method for you: Different brewing methods lead to varying results in flavor and texture. Here are a few popular brewing methods to consider: - French Press: Immersion brewing method, great for full-bodied and robust coffee. - Pour-over (e.g., Hario V60, Chemex): Results in a cleaner and lighter-bodied cup, highlighting the coffee's unique flavor characteristics. - AeroPress: A versatile brewing method that can produce smooth and rich coffee or espresso-like coffee, depending on the technique used. - Drip coffee maker: Convenient, automatic brewing option for a classic coffee taste. - Espresso machine: Provides a concentrated and intense coffee experience. 8. Pre-wet your coffee filter (if applicable): If you're using a method that requires a coffee filter (e.g., pour-over, drip coffee maker), rinse the filter with hot water before brewing to remove any potential paper taste. This also preheats your brewing device. 9. Bloom your coffee: Pour a small amount of hot water (around double the coffee's weight) onto your coffee grounds, ensuring they're evenly saturated. Let the coffee bloom for about 30 seconds. This allows the coffee to release CO2, making the extraction process more effective. 10. Brew your coffee: Follow the brewing instructions specific to your chosen brewing method. Pay attention to brew time and technique for the best results. 11. Serve and enjoy your coffee promptly: Coffee tastes at its best soon after brewing, so enjoy your coffee while it's fresh. You can also experiment with different serving styles, such as black coffee, with milk, or specialty coffee drinks. By paying attention to and perfecting each step along the way, you'll consistently make an amazing cup of coffee that suits your personal preferences. Keep experimenting with different beans, ratios, and brewing methods until you find what works best for you and enjoys the perfect coffee every time."},{"question":"Answer the following question: For the past few weeks I have been talking about the merits of the Mediterranean Diet. However, I have to acknowledge that no diet is perfect for every single person and Mediterranean diet is no exception to that rule. The Mediterranean Diet is not for everyone. There may be some people who find that they have negative reactions to some of the foods on the diet – others may find that it simply is not suitable for their lifestyle. However, it is an excellent choice for most people because the health benefits are tremendous. Lower blood pressure, reduced cholesterol levels, reduced risk of diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, diabetes and much more. The diet is based on consuming wholesome fresh foods in their natural state and by cooking them in a healthy ways. Red meats are eaten only on occasion; sugar, processed foods filled with additives, fast foods, and junk food, which are the cause of so many illnesses in today’s world are simply not eaten. It should not be news that most health problems in the US can be attributed to a poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle. The Mediterranean diet solves both problems, if you let it. It provides the healthy nutritious foods your body needs for energy and well-being; plus, it incorporates exercise to solve the sedentary lifestyle issue. Let’s look at some of the potential difficulties. 1. The diet can be expensive. When you eat primarily fish, fresh (preferably organic) fruits and vegetables, nuts, etc. you will find that they are more expensive than grabbing a cheeseburger from a fast food joint or buying junk food from the vending machine at work.

Odd and volatile characters such as Nate (Jonathan Loughran), Lou (Luis Guzmán), and Chuck (John Turturro) startle him. Buddy pushes Dave hard until Dave actually starts shouting. At the end of the meeting, Buddy says Dave needs to be there. He also arranges for him to pair up with eccentric Chuck for mutual support.As Dave prepares for a romantic evening with Linda, Chuck turns up on his doorstep and insists Dave fulfill his support duties. They go to a restaurant, Chuck picks a fight for no reason ... and Dave ends up back in court on charges of assaulting a waitress and a blind man (Harry Dean Stanton). Judge Daniels orders Dave to step up his therapy or wind up in jail.

M: Could you tell me when you became interested in gardening? W: Well, I was always interested in wild flowers and then in 1980 I read Margery Fish's book Cottage Garden Flowers, which is full of practical advice and personal opinions. But I was reading about plants that I didn't know, so I started to read as much as I could and get different writers' advice. I also used to visit Kew Gardens a lot. That was when we lived in Harrow, West London. I learned a lot from my visit. By the way, Dorset is one of England's three most beautiful towns, the other two being Wiltshire and Somerset.

Imagine that the given text is a social media post, and you have to write the title of the post, so the users can decide to read the main text or not. Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: This might be a long one, guys... So, September 2018, my mother was involved in a fatal car accident. My father (Who never married my mother and had custody of me) and I were the first people called, as my aunt and older brother were unavailable. My aunt and I never were really close, I would only see her when she, her boyfriend, and my cousins came to my mom's house when I was there. We rarely, if at all talked over social media. That night/morning at like 1AM, she messaged me 'Don't post it on facebook', I agreed because it was...a sensitive time for me. Plus, I don't really use social media, especially facebook. The next day, I'm online checking on how everyone is doing, and I see my aunt has posted about my mother. This definitely rubbed me the wrong way. My mother left behind four younger siblings- the oldest 13, and the youngest 6. They couldn't live with their biological father for reasons I will not mention here (This is not my dad, my dad and their dad are different,) and seeing is my Aunt was the only next of kin, she decided to take my siblings in. Things are hectic, but quiet for the next few months. We have a private memorial service where I see my aunt and siblings, everything seems okay. Then, December rolls around. I plan a trip up to their house, which is two hours away from mine. We're driving my brother home and I ask, \\"Are you going to keep the kids?\\" She says no. Honestly? I was livid- but I understood. My siblings' father was a horrible man; they watched him and learned from him. They're very difficult to deal with, to the point where my mother couldn't even find babysitters because they just caused so many problems. It's not their fault, they're just kids, but they are...hard to deal with (One of my siblings sliced another open with a boxcutter once). Additionally, my Aunt already has a kid of her own, and she works third shift, AND her boyfriend was going to leave her if the kids stayed. I was angry, but I understood the stress that was put on her. I ask her to keep me updated, I message her every week or so, asking about the kids, I get vague responses. And then, a few months later, I get a letter. It's from CPS. My siblings were being placed in foster care. My aunt didn't tell me, she didn't let me know, she didn't tell me where they were going and how I can contact them. I just got a copypaste letter telling me my siblings were placed in foster care. And my aunt wants to come to my high school graduation. I only get four tickets. She has never been in my life, she has never gone out of her way to message me until my mom's death, and she didn't tell me what was happening with my siblings.

It comprises the eastern half of the island of Timor; the nearby islands of Atauro and Jaco; and Oecusse, an exclave on the northwestern side of the island surrounded by Indonesian West Timor. The country's size is about 15,410 km (5,400 sq mi). - Bushrangers were originally escaped convicts in the early years of the British settlement of Australia who had the survival skills necessary to use the Australian bush as a refuge to hide from the authorities. By the 1820s, the term \\"bushranger\\" had evolved to refer to those who abandoned social rights and privileges to take up \\"robbery under arms\\" as a way of life, using the bush as their base. Bushranging thrived during the gold rush years of the 1850s and 1860s when the likes of Ben Hall, Frank Gardiner and John Gilbert led notorious gangs in the country districts of New South Wales. These \\"Wild Colonial Boys\\", mostly Australian-born sons of convicts, were roughly analogous to British \\"highwaymen\\" and outlaws of the American Old West, and their crimes typically included robbing small-town banks and coach services. In other infamous cases, such as that of Dan Morgan, the Clarke brothers, and Australia's best-known bushranger, Ned Kelly, numerous policemen were murdered. The number of bushrangers declined due to better policing and improvements in rail transport and communication technology, such as telegraphy. Kelly's capture and execution in 1880 effectively represented the end of the bushranging era. - Vanuatu (or ; Bislama ), officially the Republic of Vanuatu (Bislama: \\"Ripablik blong Vanuatu\\"), is a Pacific island nation located in the South Pacific Ocean.

These techniques are meant to provide basic necessities for human life which include water, food, and shelter. The skills also support proper knowledge and interactions with animals and plants to promote the sustaining of life over a period of time. Survival skills are often basic ideas and abilities that ancients invented and used themselves for thousands of years. Outdoor activities such as hiking, backpacking, horseback riding, fishing, and hunting all require basic wilderness survival skills, especially in handling emergency situations. Bushcraft and primitive living are most often self-implemented, but require many of the same skills. - A gold rush is a new discovery of gold that brings an onrush of miners seeking their fortune.

During 1852 as Captain Melville he was alleged to have led a large band of bushrangers on the roads in the Black Forest between Melbourne and Ballarat , and gained a folkloric reputation through the boldness of his outrages and the chivalry he showed to many , especially women . His name was associated with the Nelson robbery and St Kilda Road robberies , probably without foundation as in reality he seems to have spent most of his time bailing up diggers around Mount Macedon , either on his own or with one or two mates . On Christmas Eve 1852 , when under the alias of Thomas Smith , he and fellow bushranger William Robert Roberts were arrested at a brothel in Corio Street , Geelong , and eventually faced Judge Redmond Barry at the Geelong Circuit Court on 3 February 1853 on three counts of robbery . Barry sentenced both men to twelve , ten and ten years on each count , respectively -- in Melville 's case to be served consecutively . Although employed in chains on the roads of Victoria by the time of the Melbourne Private Escort Robbery of 20 July 1853 , Captain Melville 's name has become associated with it over the years because of the coincidence of one of the Escort robbers , George Melville , using the same surname as his alias . In 1854 he was one of a party of prisoners based on the prison hulk Success in Port Phillip Bay who attempted to seize and escape in a boat , during which a warder was killed .

New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area.

Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney. - The Victorian gold rush was a period in the history of Victoria, Australia approximately between 1851 and the late 1860s. - Brothers Thomas (c. 1840 25 June 1867) and John Clarke (c. 1846 25 June 1867) were Australian bushrangers from the Braidwood district of New South Wales. They were responsible for a series of high-profile robberies and murders which led to the embedding of the \\"Felons' Apprehension Act (1866)\\", a law that introduced the concept of outlawry and authorised citizens to kill bushrangers on sight. Active in the southern goldfields from 1865, Thomas, John, their brother James and several other relations were responsible for a reported 36 hold-ups and the deaths of five policemenfour of them bounty hunters looking to bring them in. Some modern-day writers have described the Clarkes as the most bloodthirsty bushrangers of all. They were captured during a shoot-out in April 1867 and hanged two months later at Sydney's Darlinghurst Gaol.

To establish the meaning in context, these judicial bodies may review the preparatory work from the negotiation and drafting of the treaty as well as the final, signed treaty itself. Now answer this question: In addition to the preparatory work from the drafting and negotiation of a treaty, what might arbiters review when resolving a dispute over the interpretation of a treaty?","response":"In addition to the preparatory work from the drafting and negotiation of a treaty, arbiters might review several other sources and factors when resolving a dispute over the interpretation of a treaty. These may include: 1. Treaty text: Examining the text of the treaty itself is fundamental in treaty interpretation. Arbiters will review the specific language and wording to determine the plain meaning of the provisions in question, taking into account the object and purpose of the treaty. 2. Rules of treaty interpretation: Arbiters must adhere to the customary rules of treaty interpretation established under international law. The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT) establishes general rules for treaty interpretation in Articles 31-33. These rules require interpreting a treaty in good faith, taking into account its context, object, and purpose, as well as utilizing subsequent agreements and state practice as supplementary means of interpretation. 3. Context of negotiation and drafting: Understanding the historical and political context surrounding the drafting and negotiation of a treaty can help clarify its intended meaning. This may encompass reviewing records of meetings, speeches, statements by negotiators, or any documents that reveal the negotiating parties' intentions. 4. Subsequent agreements and state practice: Arbiters might examine any subsequent agreements related to the treaty, such as protocols, amendments, or notes exchanged among the contracting parties. State practice – the actions and interpretations of treaty provisions by the parties over time – is also an essential source for understanding the evolving interpretation of treaty provisions. 5. Decisions and opinions of judicial bodies: Arbiters often consider relevant decisions and opinions rendered by international courts or tribunals on similar cases or provisions. By analyzing the principles applied and their reasoning, arbiters can ensure consistency in the interpretation of international law. 6. Expert opinions and scholarly commentary: Arbiters might refer to expert opinions or scholarly commentary to understand better the meaning and purpose of treaty provisions. Experts in international law may provide valuable insights into the interpretation of specific provisions from both a legal and policy perspective. 7. Customary international law: Arbiters may take into account customary international law rules applicable between the parties, which can be used to interpret treaty provisions in accordance with existing international norms and practices. 8. General principles of law: In some cases, general principles of law recognized by civilized nations might be relevant for interpreting the treaty. These principles, such as good faith, equity, and estoppel, can play a role in resolving disputes by reflecting widely-accepted legal concepts. 9. Analogous provisions in other treaties: Arbiters might look into similar provisions contained in other international treaties and conventions to determine the best interpretation practice, especially when dealing with provisions that are ambiguous or unclear. 10. Impact on third parties: When interpreting a treaty, it is essential to consider the possible implications it may have on third parties and the international community. Seeking a balanced and just interpretation of the treaty provisions is vital when resolving a dispute between parties. In conclusion, arbiters have a wide range of resources available to them when resolving disputes over treaty interpretations. Beyond the preparatory work from the drafting and negotiation of a treaty, arbiters will examine the treaty text, adhere to customary rules of treaty interpretation, consider the context of negotiation and drafting, review subsequent agreements and state practice, consider prior decisions of international judicial bodies, refer to expert opinions and general principles of law, and analyze analogous provisions in other treaties. They must also consider the impact of their interpretation on third parties and the broader international community. All these sources help ensure a comprehensive and consistent approach to treaty interpretation."},{"question":"Женщина, которая была убита, была жительницей гор, сельской жительницей.

If you repeatedly beat a woman, you'll probably get the same fine. In 2001, county judges heard 98 Protection From Abuse cases, finding the defendant guilty in 48 percent of those cases, either after a hearing or through a technical violation or plea. Of those found guilty, the majority were ordered to pay court costs, plus a 100 fine. No defendants were ordered to pay more than a 250 fine for violating the court order. In 27 percent of the cases, the charges were dismissed or the defendant was found not guilty. In the rest of the cases, charges were withdrawn or the matter is not yet resolved. Sarah T. Casey, executive director of Schuylkill Women in Crisis, finds it disturbing that in most cases, the fine for violating a PFA is little more than the fine someone would get for cruelty and abuse toward an animal. \\"In most of the counties surrounding Schuylkill County, the penalties given for indirect criminal contempt are much stiffer than those in Schuylkill County,\\" Casey said. \\"What kind of message are we sending those who repeatedly violate Protection From Abuse orders? That it's OK to abuse women in Schuylkill County, because you'll only get a slap on the wrist?\\" Under state law, the minimum fine for contempt of a PFA is 100; the maximum fine is 1,000 and up to six months in jail. Like others who are familiar with how the county's legal system does and doesn't work for victims of domestic violence, Casey believes some changes are in order. Valerie West, a manager/attorney with Mid-Penn Legal Services, with offices in Pottsville and Reading, regularly handles domestic violence cases. She finds fault with the local requirement that a custody order must be established within 30 days after a PFA is filed. West said she feels a custody order should be allowed to stand for the full term of the PFA - up to 18 months - as it does in many other counties in the state. \\"It places an undue burden on the plaintiff, in terms of cost, finding legal representation and facing their abuser - not to mention a further burden on the system to provide those services,\\" West said. \\"It may be difficult for the parties to reach an agreement so soon after violence has occurred. Question: \\"What solution is West offering and how is it different for a plaintiff from what is already being practiced?\\" Answer: \\"OK to abuse women in Schuylkill County, because you'll only get a slap on the wrist\\" Is this answer correct?","response":"Answer: No, the provided answer is not correct. Correct answer: Valerie West, a manager/attorney with Mid-Penn Legal Services, offers a solution that involves allowing a custody order to stand for the full term of the PFA (Protection From Abuse) order, which is up to 18 months, as practiced in many other counties in the state. This is different from the current requirement in Schuylkill County, which mandates that a custody order must be established within 30 days after a PFA is filed. West believes her proposed solution would alleviate the undue burden on the plaintiff in terms of costs, finding legal representation, and facing their abuser, as well as reduce the strain on the system to provide those services.

There may be different aspects to consider when selecting the best makeup artist for a wedding, such as: 1. Experience: Choose a makeup artist who has experience working with brides and bridal parties. This ensures that they are familiar with the unique requirements of a wedding, including makeup that lasts and photographs well. 2. Style: Find a makeup artist who specializes in the style you desire for your wedding, be it natural, glam, vintage, or another distinct look. 3. Portfolio: Look at their portfolio to see examples of their previous work and gauge if it aligns with what you are looking for. Brides should feel comfortable and confident in their makeup artist's abilities. 4. Reviews and recommendations: Seek out reviews from previous clients, or get recommendations from friends or family members who were satisfied with their makeup artist's work. 5. Budget: Consider your budget when selecting a makeup artist for your wedding. Keep in mind that high-quality makeup services may come at a higher price, but the overall result could be worth the investment. 6. Availability: Make sure the makeup artist is available on your wedding date, and it is important to book well in advance to secure their services. 7.

It marks another success story for production company Blumfeld, which has already made the highly profitable but low budget films The Purge, Ouija and The Boy Next Door. At the other end of the scale, Tom Hardy's Soviet thriller Child 44 took just 600,000 (£402,000) across 510 cinemas. With a budget of 50m (£33.5m) it means the film could be one of the year's biggest flops. Rounding out the weekend's top five were Home with 10.3m (£6.9m) and The Longest Ride with 6.9m (£4.6m). According to box office tracker Rentrak and studio estimates, top film Furious 7 has already taken almost 300m in the US and Canada alone. Rentrak's Paul Dergarabedian said the film \\"set a new standard\\" for this time of year, adding: \\"These are summer-style numbers in April.\\" He said Furious 7 had \\"truly become part of movie folklore with its record setting numbers, strong reviews, spectacular word-of-mouth and of course the outpouring of support for late star Paul Walker\\".

Over time, the cat will get used to your voice and scent and will be less afraid of being touched. Don’t worry if the cat won’t let you touch them very often at first, this is normal behaviour for a stray cat. If the cat won’t let you touch them, continue to talk softly to it until it is ready to let you stroke it. Many stray cats will interpret direct eye contact as threatening. Look briefly at the cat and then close your eyes or shift your gaze away. This will help the cat to feel safe and calm in its new environment. Over time, slowly increase the amount of eye contact that you give your cat. If you accidentally stare at the cat, simply shut your eyes for a few seconds and slowly turn your head away. Feed your cat at the same time each day. This demonstrates to your cat that you are a trustworthy source of food and will help it to bond with you. If the cat won’t eat the food you give it, try different cat food brands until you find one that it likes. Your cat will be calmer and less erratic with a regular feeding schedule. If you have multiple pets in your home, the stray cat may feel overwhelmed. Bring 1 animal into the cat's room at a time to allow them to slowly get acquainted.

The International intended to fight \\"by all available means, including armed force, for the overthrow of the international bourgeoisie and for the creation of an international Soviet republic as a transition stage to the complete abolition of the State.\\" - In political and social sciences, communism (from Latin \\"\\", \\"common, universal\\") is the philosophical, social, political, and economic ideology and movement whose ultimate goal is the establishment of the communist society, which is a socioeconomic order structured upon the common ownership of the means of production and the absence of social classes, money, and the state. - The Communist Party of the Soviet Union, abbreviated in English as CPSU, was the founding and ruling political party of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR or Soviet Union). The CPSU was the sole governing party of the Soviet Union until 1990, when the Congress of People's Deputies modified the article of the constitution which granted the CPSU a monopoly over the political system. The party was founded in 1912 by the Bolsheviks (the majority faction of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party), a revolutionary group led by Vladimir Lenin which seized power in the aftermath of the October Revolution of 1917. The party was dissolved on 29 August 1991 on Soviet territory soon after a failed coup d'état and was completely abolished on 6 November 1991 on Russian territory. - The Revolutionary Communist Party of Argentina ( Spanish : Partido Comunista Revolucionario de la Argentina ) is a Maoist communist party from Argentina . - Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov, better known by the alias Lenin ( 21 January 1924), was a Russian communist revolutionary, politician, and political theorist. He served as head of government of the Russian Republic from 1917 to 1918, of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic from 1918 to 1924, and of the Soviet Union from 1922 to 1924. Under his administration, Russia and then the wider Soviet Union became a one-party socialist state governed by the Russian Communist Party. Ideologically a Marxist, he developed political theories known as Leninism. Born to a wealthy middle-class family in Simbirsk, Lenin embraced revolutionary socialist politics following his brother's execution in 1887. Expelled from Kazan Imperial University for participating in protests against the Russian Empire's Tsarist regime, he devoted the following years to a law degree. He moved to Saint Petersburg in 1893 and became a senior figure in the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP). In 1897, he was arrested for sedition and exiled to Shushenskoye for three years, where he married Nadezhda Krupskaya. After his exile, he moved to Western Europe, where he became a prominent party theorist through his publications. In 1903, he took a key role in a RSDLP ideological split, leading the Bolshevik faction against Julius Martov's Mensheviks. Encouraging insurrection during Russia's failed Revolution of 1905, he later campaigned for the First World War to be transformed into a Europe-wide proletarian revolution, which as a Marxist he believed would cause the overthrow of capitalism and its replacement with socialism. After the 1917 February Revolution ousted the Tsar and established a Provisional Government, he returned to Russia to play a leading role in the October Revolution, in which the Bolsheviks overthrew the new regime. Lenin's government was led by the Bolsheviksnow renamed the Communist Partywith some powers initially also held by elected soviets. The new government called elections for the Constituent Assembly and... - A communist party is a political party that advocates the application of the social and economic principles of communism through state policy. The name originates from the 1848 tract \\"Manifesto of the Communist Party\\" by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. According to Leninist theory, a Communist party is the vanguard party of the working class (proletariat), whether ruling or non-ruling, but when such a party is in power in a specific country, the party is said to be the highest authority of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Vladimir Lenin's theories on the role of a Communist party were developed as the early 20th-century Russian social democracy divided into Bolshevik (meaning \\"\\"of the majority\\"\\") and Menshevik (meaning \\"of the minority\\") factions. Lenin, leader of the Bolsheviks, argued that a revolutionary party should be a small vanguard party with a centralized political command and a strict cadre policy; the Menshevik faction, however, argued that the party should be a broad-based mass movement. The Bolshevik party, which eventually became the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, took power in Russia after the October Revolution in 1917. With the creation of the Communist International, the Leninist concept of party building was copied by emerging Communist parties worldwide. - Social democracy is a political, social and economic ideology that supports economic and social interventions to promote social justice within the framework of a capitalist economy, and a policy regime involving a commitment to representative democracy, measures for income redistribution, and regulation of the economy in the general interest and welfare state provisions. Social democracy thus aims to create the conditions for capitalism to lead to greater democratic, egalitarian and solidaristic outcomes; and is often associated with the set of socioeconomic policies that became prominent in Northern and Western Europeparticularly the Nordic model in the Nordic countriesduring the latter half of the 20th century. - The October Revolution, officially known in the Soviet literature as the Great October Socialist Revolution , and commonly referred to as Red October, the October Uprising or the Bolshevik Revolution, was a seizure of state power instrumental in the larger Russian Revolution of 1917. It took place with an armed insurrection in Petrograd on 25 October (7 November, New Style) 1917.

Blood Sugar Sex Magik was released on September 24, 1991, the same day as Nirvana's breakthrough album Nevermind. It was certified gold just over two months later on November 26, 1991, and certified platinum on April 1, 1992; since then it has gone seven times platinum in the United States. The album peaked at number 3 on the Billboard 200. Originally, \\"Give it Away\\" did not fare well in the mainstream; several of Warner Bros.' target radio stations refused to air it, telling the band to \\"come back to us when you have a melody in your song\\". KROQ (of Los Angeles), however, began to play the single several times daily, and that, according to Kiedis, \\"was the beginning of the infusion of 'Give It Away' into mass consciousness.\\" The single ultimately peaked at number 9 on the UK Top 40 and number 73 on the Billboard Hot 100. Blood Sugar Sex Magik has sold over 13 million copies worldwide.Due to the success of \\"Give it Away\\", the band did not foresee \\"Under the Bridge\\" as being equally viable. Warner Bros. sent representatives to a Chili Peppers' concert in order to figure out what would ultimately be the next single. When Frusciante began playing \\"Under the Bridge\\", Kiedis missed his cue; the entire audience began singing the song, instead. Kiedis was initially \\"mortified that I had fucked up in front of Warner's people ... I apologized for fucking up but they said 'Fucking up? Are you kidding me?

Answer: Cats sleep more than humans because they have different sleep patterns and energy conservation needs. As natural predators with a strong hunting instinct, cats have evolved to sleep for long periods to conserve energy for quick bursts of activity when hunting their prey. Additionally, their sleep-wake cycles are different from humans, adapting to both day and night environments, leading to more frequent and shorter sleep durations.

While saying that youthful drinking should not condemn a person for life, Ludington said he was concerned about Kavanaugh's statements under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee. \\"I have direct and repeated knowledge about his drinking and his disposition while drunk. And I do believe that Brett's actions as a 53-year-old federal judge matter,\\" Ludington said. \\"If he lied about his past actions on national television, and more especially while speaking under oath in front of the United States Senate, I believe those lies should have consequences. It is truth that is at stake, and I believe that the ability to speak the truth, even when it does not reflect well upon oneself, is a paramount quality we seek in our nation's most powerful judges.\\" Ludington also wrote about an occasion he and Kavanaugh socialized where it allegedly landed a mutual friend in jail. \\"On one of the last occasions I purposely socialized with Brett, I witnessed him respond to a semi- hostile remark, not by defusing the situation, but by throwing his beer in the man's face and starting a fight that ended with one of our mutual friends in jail,\\" Ludington said. Meanwhile, FBI agents on Sunday interviewed one of the three women who have accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct as Republicans and Democrats quarreled over whether the bureau would have enough time and freedom to conduct a thorough investigation before a high-stakes vote on his nomination to the nation's highest court. The White House insisted it was not \\"micromanaging\\" the new one-week review of Kavanaugh's background but some Democratic lawmakers claimed the White House was keeping investigators from interviewing certain witnesses. President Trump, for his part, tweeted that no matter how much time and discretion the FBI was given, \\"it will never be enough\\" for Democrats trying to keep Kavanaugh off the bench. CBS News In speaking to FBI agents, Deborah Ramirez detailed her allegation that Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a party in the early 1980s when they were students at Yale University, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to publicly discuss details of a confidential investigation. Kavanaugh has denied Ramirez's allegation. The person familiar with Ramirez's questioning, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity, said she also provided investigators with the names of others who she said could corroborate her account. But Christine Blasey Ford, a California professor who says Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers, has not been contacted by the FBI since Mr. Trump on Friday ordered the agency to take another look at the nominee's background, according to a member of Ford's team. Kavanaugh has denied assaulting Ford. Late Sunday, the Senate Judiciary Committee made public a previously unreleased interview with Kavanaugh from Sept. 26, before Ford and Kavanaugh openly testified Thursday. Kavanaugh denied all allegations against him and committee Democrats declined to ask questions, pointing out that the FBI should investigate. Speaking to the issue of the scope of the FBI's investigation, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said White House counsel Don McGahn, who is managing Kavanaugh's nomination, \\"has allowed the Senate to dictate what these terms look like, and what the scope of the investigation is.\\" \\"The White House isn't intervening. We're not micromanaging this process. It's a Senate process. It has been from the beginning, and we're letting the Senate continue to dictate what the terms look like,\\" Sanders said. White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said the investigation will be \\"limited in scope\\" and \\"will not be a fishing expedition. The FBI is not tasked to do that.\\" Senate Judiciary Committee member Jeff Flake, R-Arizona, requested an investigation last Friday -- after he and other Republicans on the panel voted along strict party lines in favor of Kavanaugh's confirmation -- as a condition for his own subsequent vote to put Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court. Another committee member, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, said Sunday that testimony would be taken from Ramirez and Kavanaugh's high school friend Mark Judge, who has been named by two of three women accusing Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct. \\"I think that will be the scope of it. And that should be the scope of it,\\" Graham said. Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, called on the White House and the FBI to provide the written directive regarding the investigation's scope. In a letter Sunday, she also asked for updates on any expansion of the original directive. Sen. Susan Collins said Sunday she is confident in the investigation and \\"that the FBI will follow up on any leads that result from the interviews.\\" The Maine Republican supports the new FBI investigation and is among a few Republican and Democratic senators who have not announced a position on Kavanaugh. Republicans control 51 seats in the closely divided 100-member Senate and cannot afford to lose more than one vote on confirmation. Collins and Flake spoke throughout the weekend. Senate Republicans discussed the contours of the investigation with the White House late Friday, according to a person familiar with the call who was not authorized to discuss it publicly. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, had gathered Judiciary Committee Republicans in his office earlier. At that time, the scope of the investigation was requested by Flake, Collins and Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, said McConnell's spokesman Don Stewart. Murkowski is not on the committee, but also has not announced how she will vote on Kavanaugh's confirmation. Republicans later called the White House to discuss the scope of the probe, the person said. McConnell's office declined to elaborate Sunday on which allegations would be investigated, reiterating only that it would focus on \\"current credible allegations.\\" Stewart said the investigation's scope \\"was set\\" by the three GOP senators Friday and \\"has not changed.\\" But Democratic Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, a Judiciary Committee member, doubted how credible the investigation will be given the time limit. \\"That's bad enough, but then to limit the FBI as to the scope and who they're going to question, that -- that really -- I wanted to use the word farce, but that's not the kind of investigation that all of us are expecting the FBI to conduct,\\" she said. Mr. Trump initially opposed such an investigation as allegations began mounting but relented and ordered one Friday. He later said the FBI has \\"free rein.\\" \\"They're going to do whatever they have to do, whatever it is they do. They'll be doing things that we have never even thought of,\\" Mr. Trump said Saturday as he departed the White House for a trip to West Virginia. \\"And hopefully at the conclusion everything will be fine.\\" He revisited the \\"scope\\" question later Saturday on Twitter, writing in part, \\"I want them to interview whoever they deem appropriate, at their discretion.\\" Sanders said Mr. Trump, who has vigorously defended Kavanaugh but also raised the slight possibility of withdrawing the nomination should damaging information be found, \\"will listen to the facts.\\" At least three women have accused Kavanaugh of years-ago misconduct. He denies all the claims. The third woman, Julie Swetnick, accused Kavanaugh and Judge of excessive drinking and inappropriate treatment of women in the early 1980s, among other accusations. Kavanaugh has called her accusations a \\"joke.\\" Judge has said he \\"categorically\\" denies the allegations. Swetnick's attorney, Michael Avenatti, said Saturday that his client had not been contacted by the FBI but was willing to cooperate with investigators. Ford also has said Judge was in the room when a drunken Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her. Judge has said he will cooperate with any law enforcement agency that will \\"confidentially investigate\\" sexual misconduct allegations against him and Kavanaugh. Judge has also denied misconduct allegations. ||||| That description was challenged by Chris Dudley, a former N.B.A. player and close friend of Judge Kavanaugh’s who attended Yale and played basketball with Mr. Ludington. Mr. Dudley said he was certain that he “never, ever saw Brett Kavanaugh black out” from drinking, and “never, ever saw him act inappropriately toward any woman in the 35 years that I’ve known him.” The dueling statements emerged as the political combat around Judge Kavanaugh’s confirmation process intensified. Democrats lashed out over the size and shape of the inquiry, saying it threatened to become a sham that would deepen, rather than help heal, the country’s divisions about Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination. Senator Mazie K. Hirono, a Hawaii Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, said on ABC’s “This Week” that any investigation that limits whom the F.B.I. can interview and which leads agents can follow would be a “farce.” Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat who is also on the committee, described what she said was micromanaging from the White House: “You can’t interview this person, you can’t look at this time period, you can only look at these people from one side of the street from when they were growing up.” “I mean, come on,” she said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” Democrats were to some degree in the dark about the inquiry’s parameters. In a letter to Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel, and Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee asked for a copy of the directive sent by the White House to the bureau laying out the scope of the investigation. “If the F.B.I. requests any expansion beyond the initial directive, please provide the names of any additional witnesses or evidence,” the Democrat, Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, wrote in the letter. It is not unusual for the White House to specify the scope of a request for additional background information on a nominee. No evidence has emerged that the White House has forbidden any investigative steps, and President Trump has said he wants agents “to interview whoever they deem appropriate, at their discretion.” |||||","response":"A Yale classmate of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, Charles Ludington, has alleged that Kavanaugh was a \\"frequent and heavy drinker\\" during their time at Yale and has been untruthful about his past drinking habits.

The statement comes amidst the ongoing FBI investigation into Kavanaugh's background, following accusations of sexual misconduct by multiple women.

Question: What does Kai need to do before this? Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context? A: have their lights on B: have their lights broken C: drive in front of the park A:","response":"To answer the question, let's break it down step by step: 1. The context is that Kai turned their lights away from the house because they didn't want to wake anyone inside. This implies that Kai's lights were shining towards the house initially. 2. We need to determine what Kai needed to do before turning the lights away. 3. Now, let's analyze the options given: A: have their lights on B: have their lights broken C: drive in front of the park 4. Considering the context, we can eliminate option B (have their lights broken) because broken lights wouldn't be shining towards the house. 5. Option C (drive in front of the park) seems unrelated to the context. 6. Option A (have their lights on) seems the most logical and accurate based on the context because Kai couldn't turn their lights away without having them on initially. So, according to the context given, the best answer to the question is: A: have their lights on"},{"question":"Marine pollution is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles. The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter. Two farms were situated on opposite banks of a large river flowing into the ocean. Hill farm practiced conventional agriculture, while Dew farm practiced permaculture design within the context of organic farming. Which farm generated more marine litter?","response":"To determine which farm generated more marine litter, we need to compare the practices of both Hill farm and Dew farm and assess their potential impact on marine pollution. Step 1: Understand the farming practices of both farms - Hill farm: Conventional agriculture - Dew farm: Permaculture design within the context of organic farming Step 2: Analyze how the two farming practices may contribute to marine pollution - Conventional agriculture (Hill farm): - Tends to use synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, which can contribute to nutrient pollution when they run off into nearby rivers and eventually reach the ocean - Erosion and sedimentation can occur from tilling the soil, which can lead to increased sediment in rivers that can disrupt aquatic ecosystems and contribute to marine pollution - Livestock waste may not be managed effectively, increasing the potential for waste to enter water systems - Permaculture/organic farming (Dew farm): - Avoids synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, reducing the potential for nutrient pollution - Permaculture practices usually involve prevention of soil erosion and improved water management through techniques like crop rotation, cover cropping, and swales - Organic farming tends to emphasize effective waste management, such as composting and recycling of plant and animal waste, leading to reduced chances of waste entering water systems Step 3: Identify which farm is more likely to generate more marine litter Based on the comparison of practices, Hill farm (conventional agriculture) is more likely to generate more marine litter due to its use of synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, and potentially less effective management of waste and soil erosion. Dew farm's permaculture and organic farming practices aim to minimize pollution and promote sustainable resource use, therefore contributing less marine litter."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Title: water is leaking, not good Product review: Length:: 1:46 Minsmy wife go it for me for Christmass, so since yesterday I have made about 5 coffee...

A train 150 m long running at 72 kmph crosses a platform in 25 sec. What is the length of the platform? Options: (A) 33 (B) 87 (C) 350 (D) 88 (E) 277","response":"To find the length of the platform, let's follow these steps: Step 1: Convert the speed of the train from km/h to m/s. 1 km = 1000 meters 1 hour = 3600 seconds (72 km/h) * (1000 m/km) / (3600 s/h) = (72 * 1000) / 3600 m/s = 20 m/s Now, we know that the train is running at 20 meters per second. Step 2: Calculate the total distance covered (train length + platform length). The train takes 25 seconds to completely cross the platform. During these 25 seconds, it travels at a constant speed of 20 m/s. Total distance covered = Speed × Time Total distance covered = 20 m/s * 25 s = 500 meters Step 3: Subtract the train length from the total distance to find the length of the platform. Total distance (500 m) = Train length (150 m) + Platform length Platform length = 500 m - 150 m = 350 m So, the correct option is (C) 350. The length of the platform is 350 meters."},{"question":"Given the background: The Gaia hypothesis states that the biosphere is its own living organism.

Step 2: Analyze the review content 1. \\"Anyone who is familiar with the think-oustide-the-box genre of self-improvement and creativity books will find very little new or inspiring here.\\" - This statement has a negative tone, as it acknowledges the lack of new or inspiring material in the book. 2. \\"And despite the title, the book also has very little to do with Einstein.\\" - This remark is negative as it criticizes the book for not delivering on its title's promise. 3. \\"A deeper analysis of the great thinker's intellectual history would have been more useful than the largely recycled do's and dont's that dominate the book.\\" - This statement suggests that the book's content is largely rehashed and less valuable compared to what the reviewer believes could have been included, which is again negative. 4. \\"The points presented here, however, are hardly without merit, especially the tips on brainstorming and free association.\\" - This line has a slightly positive tone since it acknowledges some value in the author's tips on brainstorming and free association but still emphasizes they are nothing extraordinary. Conclusion: While the review mentions some positive aspects, the overall focus is on the lack of new content and the book's failure to live up to its title. Thus, the tone of this product review is mostly negative."},{"question":"Choose the next sentence for this paragraph.

Cedric looked over from where he was sitting on a lab stool, chewed thumbnail between his teeth. His shoulder length blond hair was coated with the shine of someone who has only wet their hair down and not washed. His red streaked eyes were a sure sign of his having been recently woken up. He watched Dorian backing his way through the doors pulling a gurney behind him. \\"Dorian,\\" Cedric said, then immediately fell silent as Dorian turned around. There was panic in Dorian's eyes and a waxy pallor beneath the stubble on his face that betrayed a lack of sleep. \\"Dorian,\\" Cedric said again, that one word betraying multiple emotions: a layer of fear spread over top concern for his friend, concern for his own wellbeing, and simple anger at letting himself become involved in this. \\"Hook her up,\\" Dorian said before moving to a lab stool of his own and sliding a keyboard across the table to rest in front of him, his fingers impatiently tapping the spacebar while he waited for the monitor to respond. With a hiccup of light the screen became active making Dorian's face even more hollow with its sickly glow. He was normally a handsome man with short brown hair that was always perfectly combed. Tonight, though, it was full of unruly licks and his white lab coat, which usually added to his presence as the overall leader of their research team, was cast by the computer's light into awkward shades of green and blue. A large coffee stain down the front appeared to still be wet.

Chloe had totally transformed herself since he'd last seen her. She wore a wig for starters, and a very good one. It was light brown and shoulder length. It looked so natural that if he didn't know she had much shorter hair, he would have guessed that she had dyed it. But it was the outfit that made the change. She wore a well-tailored, very professional, gray woman's skirt/blazer combo with a yellow silk blouse. Her wrist sported what looked to Paul's uneducated eye like an expensive and fashionable gold lady's watch from which he thought he detected a glint of diamond. In short, she looked just like the high priced lawyer she was supposed to be. She was certainly the best-dressed person in the room. Chloe reached across the table to shake Greg's hand, stretching forward as she did so. Paul watched Greg glance down at her cleavage while he shook her hand. \\"I'm Rachel Roth, here on behalf of Mr. Paul Reynolds.\\" \\"Hi,\\" said Greg. \\"I'm Greg Driscol, and this is...\\" \\"I know the rogues gallery here,\\" said Chloe cutting Greg off and looking around at the assembled board members. \\"I've learned all about you gentlemen.\\" Marie stood up and shook Chloe's hand. \\"Marie Cooper, from Johnson, Myers, and Wick,\\" she said. \\"Nice to meet you,\\" she said. \\"Ok, we've got the intros down, shall we get on with the dirty business?\\" \\"Um, sure,\\" Greg said as he sat back down. \\"I was just about to turn things over to Marie.\\" The plan was now in action, and so far so good. But Paul knew that this was a crucial moment. Chloe didn't really know the law - just a few points that her friend had helped her out with. She couldn't let the real lawyer take over the meeting.

Soon after moving to Hamburg, Essabar met Binalshibh and the others through a Turkish mosque. Essabar turned extremist fairly suddenly, probably in 1999, and reportedly pressured one acquaintance with physical force to become more religious, grow a beard, and compel his wife to convert to Islam. Essabar's parents were said to have made repeated but unsuccessful efforts to sway him from this lifestyle. Shortly before the 9/11 attacks, he would travel to Afghanistan to communicate the date for the attacks to the al Qaeda leadership. Mounir el Motassadeq, another Moroccan, came to Germany in 1993, moving to Hamburg two years later to study electrical engineering at theTechnical University. A witness has recalled Motassadeq saying that he would kill his entire family if his religious beliefs demanded it. One of Motassadeq's roommates recalls him referring to Hitler as a \\"good man\\" and organizing film sessions that included speeches by Bin Laden. Motassadeq would help conceal the Hamburg group's trip to Afghanistan in late 1999. Abdelghani Mzoudi, also a Moroccan, arrived in Germany in the summer of 1993, after completing university courses in physics and chemistry. Mzoudi studied in Dortmund, Bochum, and Muenster before moving to Hamburg in 1995. Mzoudi described himself as a weak Muslim when he was home in Morocco, but much more devout when he was back in Hamburg. In April 1996, Mzoudi and Motassadeq witnessed the execution of Atta's will. During the course of 1999, Atta and his group became ever more extreme and secretive, speaking only in Arabic to conceal the content of their conversations. 87 When the four core members of the Hamburg cell left Germany to journey to Afghanistan late that year, it seems unlikely that they already knew about the planes operation; no evidence connects them to al Qaeda before that time. Witnesses have attested, however, that their pronouncements reflected ample predisposition toward taking some action against the United States. In short, they fit the bill for Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM. Going to Afghanistan The available evidence indicates that in 1999, Atta, Binalshibh, Shehhi, and Jarrah decided to fight in Chechnya against the Russians. What question would one ask from this paragraph?","response":"One possible question to ask from this paragraph could be: How did the extremist beliefs and affiliations of Zakariya Essabar, Mounir el Motassadeq, and Abdelghani Mzoudi contribute to the formation and activities of the Hamburg cell prior to the 9/11 attacks?"},{"question":"Write a title for this article: The Swiss attorney general’s office announced Friday it is opening a criminal investigation into outgoing FIFA president Sepp Blatter on suspicion of criminal mismanagement and misappropriation of FIFA funds. In a news release, the attorney general’s office said its investigators interrogated Blatter on Friday following a meeting of FIFA’s executive committee. Investigators also conducted a search of Blatter’s office at FIFA headquarters in Zurich and seized data. The investigation is focused on two transactions: — A 2005 contract with the Caribbean Football Union that was “unfavorable for FIFA” and one in which Blatter allegedly “violated his fiduciary duties and acted against the interest of FIFA.” Jack Warner, the head of the Caribbean Football Union at the time and a longtime Blatter supporter, was one of a number of FIFA officials to be indicted by the U.S. Department of Justice earlier this year. He is currently fighting extradition from his native Trinidad. “That is believed to relate to the television contract unearthed by Swiss broadcasters that showed Blatter had agreed to sell TV rights to the disgraced former Fifa heavyweight Jack Warner at below the market rate,” the Guardian writes. As reported by the Mirror earlier this month, a Swiss television network has published a contract signed by Blatter that awarded the television rights to the 2010 World Cup in South Africa and the 2014 World Cup in Brazil to the Caribbean Football Union for 600,000, well below their market rates. Warner then sub-licensed those rights to his own Cayman Islands-registered company, J & D International, at a profit of 11 million. “FIFA’s deal with the CFU included an agreement for a 50 per cent share of any profits from sub-contracting the rights but few if any payments from profit share were ever made by Warner and in July 2011, a month after he resigned from FIFA following bribery allegations, FIFA terminated its contract with the CFU,” the Mirror writes. — “A disloyal payment” of just more than 2 million made to UEFA President Michel Platini for work performed between January 1999 and June 2002. They payment was made in February 2011. Platini, who once was a close ally of Blatter but has since become one of his fiercest critics, is the front-runner to replace Blatter in a special election to be held in February. In the wake of a American and Swiss investigations into FIFA corruption, Blatter announced in June that he would step down as FIFA president once the election took place. Swiss investigators also interviewed Platini on Friday. Blatter was scheduled to speak with reporters following Friday’s executive committee meeting in Zurich, but it was first delayed and then abruptly canceled without explanation. In a statement released Friday, FIFA said it “has complied with all requests for documents, data and other information.” Richard Cullen, Sepp’s U.S.-based attorney also released a statement on Friday: “Mr. Blatter is cooperating and we are confident that when the Swiss authorities have a chance to review the documents and the evidence they will see that the contract was properly prepared and negotiated by the appropriate staff members of FIFA who were routinely responsible for such contracts, and certainly no mismanagement occurred.” The U.S. Department of Justice is conducting its own investigation into corruption at FIFA. In comments made last month, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said she anticipates “being able to bring additional charges against individuals and entities” related to the investigation into a 150 million bribery and racketeering conspiracy.

He says that the Eskimos called the creature \\"bushman,\\" the Colville Indians \\"Sasquatch,\\" and the Hoopas \\"Om-mah,\\" but is most commonly known as Bigfoot. Marx's brother-in-law takes him to the land of petrified wood, showing him rock carvings of creatures with big hands and feet. The carvings tell the story of the creature stealing children, causing a village to be abandoned. Marx finds large tracks in the snow and later a dead bear with similar tracks nearby. He finds strange hair between the bear's teeth and sets out to track the creature. He finds tracks in the mud beside a river and something moving nearby. He intends to inform others but rain washes the tracks away. Marx investigates tracks in several states only to find they're not bigfoot tracks. He visits the Oh-mah bigfoot redwood statue in northern California and the Oregon coast, continuing to search. Marx takes a job in Washington state to film a Cinnamon bear. While there, he films Bigfoot walking through a field. He mentions that his footage of Bigfoot has been questioned by science and used by others on lecture circuits to make money. Marx shows footage of an injured squirrel, goats eating dirt, and glaciers melting. He mentions the Trans-Alaska Pipeline and visits Yukon Frida, who paints pictures of Bigfoot. Marx travels above the Arctic circle, showing footage of the Northern lights while relating Bigfoot tales. He visits an Eskimo who promises he'll see Bigfoot. Later in the evening, he films what he describes \\"the shining eyes\\" of the creature, but when dawn comes, he says Bigfoot disappeared behind a rainbow. Marx shows footage of salmon spawning, geese migrating, caribou, and Alaska moose defending their territory. He searches from a plane and films a young Bigfoot near a river.

Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms. Because of the increased use of roughage and the, on-average, lower milk production level per cow, some research has connected organic milk production with increases in the emission of methane.Animal welfare issues vary among dairy farms and are not necessarily related to the way of producing milk (organically or conventionally). Robert and his brother Dale are both dairy farmers that primarily produce milk products. Both Robert and Dale have farms that approximately the same size. Dale prefers to produce milk conventionally, as he likes the way that conventional milk tastes. Robert, on the other hand, decided to switch to organic milk production after reading an article online about it. Whose farm, Robert's or Dale's, will produce lower emissions of methane? Answer:","response":"To determine whose farm, Robert's or Dale's, will produce lower emissions of methane, we must examine the factors affecting methane emissions in organic and conventional dairy production. 1. Comparing production practices: Organic milk production: - Uses lower level of concentrates given to cows. - Has a lower milk production level per cow. - Increased use of roughage. Conventional milk production: - Uses a higher level of concentrates given to cows. - Has a higher milk production level per cow. - Less emphasis on roughage. 2. Analyzing the effects on methane emissions: Research has connected organic milk production with increases in the emission of methane due to the increased use of roughage and lower milk production level per cow. As a result, it is likely that Robert's organic dairy farm will produce higher methane emissions. On the other hand, Dale's conventional dairy farm may produce lower methane emissions because of the higher level of concentrates given to cows, resulting in a higher milk production level per cow and lesser reliance on roughage. Conclusion: Based on the current information, it is more likely that Dale's conventional dairy farm will produce lower emissions of methane compared to Robert's organic dairy farm. However, it is essential to note that methane emissions can also depend on various other farm management practices, which were not discussed in the given context."},{"question":"Given the question: - The lungs remove oxygen from the air - Oxygen diffuses from alveoli in the lungs to the bloodstream - Hemoglobin in red blood cells attaches to the oxygen - Red blood cells carry oxygen all around the body - Oxygen diffuses into cells from capillaries.

Article: Happiness is contagious , as researchers reported on Thursday. People with the most social connections -- spouses, friends, neighbors and relatives -- were also the happiest, the data showed. \\"Each additional happy person makes you happier,\\" Christakis said. \\"Imagine that I am connected to you and you are connected to others and others are connected to still others. It is this fabric of humanity, like an American patch quilt.\\" Each person sits on a different colored patch. \\"Imagine that these patches are happy and unhappy patches. Your happiness depends on what is going on in the patch around you,\\" Christakis said. \\"It is not just happy people connecting with happy people, which they do. Above and beyond, there is this contagious process going on.\\" And happiness is more contagious than unhappiness, they discovered. \\"If a social contact is happy, it increases the likelihood that you are happy by 15 percent, \\" Fowler said. \\"A friend of a friend, or the friend of a spouse or a sibling , if they are happy, increases your chances by 10 percent,\\" he added. A happy third degree friend -- the friend of a friend of a friend -- increases a person's chances of being happy by 6 percent. \\"But every extra unhappy friend increases the likelihood that you'll be unhappy by 7 percent,\\" Fowler said. The finding is interesting and it is useful, too, Fowler said. \\"Among other benefits, happiness has been shown to have an important effect on reduced mortality , pain reduction, and improved cardiac function. So better understanding of how happiness spreads can help us learn how to develop a healthier society,\\" he said. The study also fits in with other data suggested in 1984 that having 5,000 extra increased a person's chances of becoming happier by about 2 percent. \\"A happy friend is worth about 20,000,\\" Christakis said. Question: What does Christakis mean by saying \\"A happy friend is worth about 20,000\\"? Answer: Answer:","response":"Christakis means that the happiness a happy friend brings to your life has a similar impact on your overall happiness as receiving an extra 20,000 would.

U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel visited China's sole aircraft carrier on Monday in an unprecedented opening by normally-secretive Beijing to a potent symbol of its military buildup. A U.S. official said the visit to the carrier the Liaoning, at a port in the northern city of Qingdao, lasted about two hours. No other details were immediately available. The official believed Hagel was the first official visitor from overseas to be allowed on board the Liaoning in a sign that China is responding to U.S. criticism over it's lack of transparency regarding its growing weapons programme. The secretive visit comes days after the United States promised to send two missile defence ships to Japan to counter the growing threat from both North Korea and China. Lone mission: Escorted by Chinese military personnel, U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel arrives at Qingdao International Airport in Qingdao. Growing power: The 60,000-tonne Liaoning, a Soviet-era vessel bought from Ukraine in 1998 and re-fitted in a Chinese shipyard, is seen as a symbol of China's growing naval power and ambition for greater global influence. Hagel's carrier visit, at the start of his three-day trip to China, was quietly approved by Beijing at Washington's request, the U.S. official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Hagel arrived in Qingdao after a trip to Japan. Warm welcome: Hagel, left, is welcomed by Rear Admiral Guan Youfei, Director of Foreign Affairs Office of the Chinese Defense Ministry and U.S. Ambassador to China, Max Baucus. The carrier has yet to become fully operational, however, and military experts say it could be decades before China catches up to the far superior and larger U.S. carriers - if ever. Early this year the Liaoning completed. sea trials in the South China Sea. The official Xinhua News Agency said. the carrier tested its combat system, conducted a formation practice and 'attained the anticipated objectives.' Reporters travelling with Hagel did not accompany him on the vessel, in what is a rare visit to a sensitive Chinese military site. 'It's a sign of openness, of sincerity, that China has nothing to hide and wants to improve military relations with the United States,' said Ni Lexiong, a naval expert at the Shanghai University of Political Science and Law. 'It will also be a good opportunity for the Americans to see the difference between the Liaoning and their aircraft carriers,' Ni said, referring to the technological gulf between the two countries. Chinese military brass are no strangers to U.S. warships, including aircraft carriers. Officers from the People's Liberation Army are routinely flown to U.S. aircraft carriers en route to occasional port stops in Hong Kong, according to U.S. military officials. Their U.S. counterparts provide tours of the ship and flight deck during operations - efforts U.S. diplomats say are geared to nudging China towards greater transparency about its capabilities. Ian Storey, a Singapore-based regional security expert, said earlier that Hagel's visit would be 'long on symbolism but short on actual operational capabilities'. 'By showing him a vessel that was built in Ukraine in the 1980s and remains only a training platform that is still not fully operational, the Chinese will be keeping him away from their more sensitive capabilities, such as their missile programmes or submarine fleets,' said Storey, of Singapore's Institute of South East Asian Studies. Waging diplomacy: Hagel is on a 10-day trip to the Asia Pacific region and was leaving Japan today to travel to China. He is scheduled to meet with senior Chinese leaders before traveling to Mongolia, then returning home. China is building submarines, surface ships and anti-ship ballistic missiles, and has tested emerging technology aimed at destroying missiles in mid-air. The carrier visit came a day after. Hagel said he would use his first trip to China as defense secretary to. press Beijing to use its 'great power' wisely and respect its. neighbours, who have been put on edge by the country's growing. assertiveness in Asia's disputed waters. China. claims 90 per cent of the 1.35 million sq mile South. China Sea, which is believed to be rich in oil and gas. The. Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan all claim parts of. those waters. China has a. separate dispute with Japan in the East China Sea over uninhabited. islets that are administered by Japan. China's decision in November to. declare an air defence identification zone in the area that includes. those islands sparked protests from the United States, Japan and South. Korea. The Liaoning would serve as a training platform rather than a fighting weapon, some Chinese experts have said. Considerable. doubt also remains over when it will be fully operational. Earlier. estimates of two or three years had grown rubbery, with some hints. internally that it could stretch to a decade, some experts say. Early. this year the Liaoning completed sea trials in the South China Sea.

According to Neil Strauss of New York Times, during his few live performances with the band, Corgan says \\"is still a work in progress.\\" The lineup was completed with guitarist David Pajo and bassist Paz Lenchantin. The band had two distinct incarnations, the primary approach being an upbeat rock band with a three-guitar-driven sound, the second, a folk and gospel inspired acoustic side with live strings. The quintet performed throughout 2002, and their debut album, Mary Star of the Sea, was released in early 2003 to generally positive reviews. In the midst of their supporting tour for the album, mounting conflict between Corgan and Chamberlin, and the other band members led to the cancellation of the rest of the tour as the band entered an apparent hiatus, formally announcing a breakup in September 2003. In 2004 Corgan began writing revealing autobiographical posts on his website and his MySpace page, blaming Iha for the breakup of the Smashing Pumpkins, calling Wretzky \\"a mean spirited drug addict,\\" and criticizing his former Zwan bandmates' fixation with \\"indie cred\\" and calling them \\"filthy\\", opportunistic, and selfish. On September 17, 2003, Billy first presented his poetry at the Art Institute of Chicago's Rubloff Auditorium. In late 2004, Corgan published Blinking with Fists, a book of poetry. Despite mixed reviews, the book debuted on the New York Times Best Seller list. Around this time, he began posting autobiographical writings online under the title The Confessions of Billy Corgan. Also in 2004, he began a solo music career, landing on an electronic/shoegaze/alternative rock sound for his first solo album, TheFutureEmbrace, co-produced and arranged by Bon Harris of Nitzer Ebb. Released on June 21, 2005, through Reprise Records, it garnered mixed reviews from the press and only sold 69,000 copies. Corgan toured behind his solo album with a touring band that included Linda Strawberry, Brian Liesegang and Matt Walker in 2005. This tour was not as extensive as previous Smashing Pumpkins or Zwan tours. Prior to recording TheFutureEmbrace, Corgan had recorded some 72 songs inspired by Chicago history for the largely acoustic ChicagoSongs project, which have yet to be released.

Not only does he want to say it well, but he wants it to be something that has not been said before. He hopes that the public will listen and understand ----he wants to teach them, and he wants them to learn from him. What visional artists like painters want to teach is easy to make out but difficult to explain, because painters translate their experience into shapes and colors, not words. They seem to feel that a certain choice of shapes and colors, out of the countless billions possible, is very interesting for them and worth showing to us. Without their work we should never have noticed these particular shapes and colors, or have felt the delight which they brought to the artists. Most artists take their shapes and colors from the world of nature and from human bodies in movement and at rest; their choices show that these aspects of the world are worth looking at, that they contain beautiful sights. Modern artists might say that they only choose subjects that provide an interesting pattern, that there is nothing more in it. Yet even they do not choose totally without thinking about the character of their subjects. If one painter chooses to paint a decaying leg and another a lake in moonlight, each of them is directing our attention to a certain aspect of the world . Each painter is telling us something, showing us something, emphasizing something - all of which means that, consciously or unconsciously, he is trying to teach us.

What starts out as a poorly produced but ultimately harmless concert turns into a dreadful combination of overdone remixes and embarrassing para para dancing. Ishida Yoko does fine with the singing, but everything else was just cringe-inducing. Shame too, because she is one of my favorite Japanese singers. Is this product review negative? The answer is:","response":"Yes, this product review is predominantly negative. The reviewer begins by indicating that the DVD was purchased years ago and was recently rediscovered on their shelf. Although they acknowledge that the concert starts as \\"poorly produced but ultimately harmless,\\" they go on to describe it as a \\"dreadful combination of overdone remixes and embarrassing para para dancing.\\" This clearly indicates dissatisfaction with the overall content and production of the DVD. Despite praising Ishida Yoko's singing performance, the reviewer repeatedly underscores the negative aspects of the DVD, describing it as \\"cringe-inducing\\" and expressing disappointment. The fact that Ishida Yoko is one of the reviewer's favorite Japanese singers further contributes to their frustration with the DVD, as it fails to live up to their expectations. From the detailed account provided by the reviewer, it is evident that their dissatisfaction isn't limited to one particular aspect but encompasses multiple elements of the DVD. Terms and phrases such as \\"dreadful,\\" \\"embarrassing,\\" and \\"cringe-inducing\\" amplify the negative tone of the review, and it is therefore safe to conclude that this product review is negative in nature."},{"question":"Sentiment possibilities (I). negative; (II). positive;.

One day, Timmy asked Leo a question. Timmy: \\"Leo, why do lions roar?\\" Leo: \\"Well Timmy, lions roar to communicate with each other. Just like how you talk to your friends to share what you're feeling or to tell them important things, we roar to let other lions know how we're feeling or if there's danger nearby.\\" Timmy: \\"Wow, that's so cool! What other things do lions do to talk to each other?\\" Leo: \\"We also use body language, Timmy. For example, we can use our tails to signal different things. If we flick our tail quickly, it can mean we're excited or ready to play. But if we move it slowly, it can mean we're relaxed.\\" Timmy: \\"I didn't know that! Can you teach me how to roar like a lion?\\" Leo: \\"Sure, Timmy! Just take a deep breath, then open your mouth wide and let out a big roar, like this: ROOOAAAARRRR!\\" Timmy tried his best, letting out a small but mighty roar. Leo: \\"Great job, Timmy! You're a fast learner. With a little more practice, you'll sound just like a lion!\\" And from that day on, Timmy and Leo had lots of fun together learning about the wonderful world of lions while also teaching each other new things.
