She was held at a house in the capital, Sanaa, after being traced through a phone number left with a cargo company. Her mother was also detained. Dubai and UK officials say the bombs had the hallmarks of al-Qaeda. US media quote officials as saying a Saudi-born bomb-maker, Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri, is their prime suspect. He is believed to be one of the leading figures in Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and the organiser of a suicide attack by his brother last year on the Saudi intelligence chief, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef. The prince survived. UK Prime Minister David Cameron said the device found in Britain was designed to go off on the aircraft. The two packages were addressed to synagogues in the Chicago area. Both bombs, discovered on Friday, were inserted in printer cartridges. 'Quiet student' The Yemeni suspect, detained on Saturday, has been named by rights groups as Hanan al-Samawi, 22. The authorities initially described her as a medical student, but later reports said she was studying computer engineering at the University of Sanaa and had no known Islamist links. \\"Her acquaintances tell me that she is a quiet student and there was no knowledge of her having involvement in any religious or political groups,\\" her lawyer, Abdel Rahman Burman, told Reuters news agency. \\"I'm concerned the girl is a victim because it doesn't make sense that the person who would do this kind of operation would leave a picture of their ID and their phone number.\\" Analysis AQAP is known to have been developing advanced and inventive bomb-making techniques. It came close to killing the Saudi interior minister with one device and to bringing down an airliner on Christmas Day with another. The exact way in which these devices were to be detonated is not clear. This is another sign of growing creativeness allied to ongoing ambition. Attacking cargo planes has also long been anticipated as a potential tactic. Militant groups regularly look for any weak spots in security and aviation remains a prime target. Creativeness and ambition Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh said the US and the United Arab Emirates had provided Yemen with information that helped identify the woman, and he pledged that his country would continue fighting al-Qaeda \\"in co-operation with its partners\\". \\"But we do not want anyone to interfere in Yemeni affairs by hunting down al-Qaeda,\\" he added. Further investigations in Yemen are likely to focus on AQAP, which has its stronghold in the remote Shabwa province in the south of the country, the BBC's Jon Leyne reports from Cairo. Mr Saleh's remarks on interference are presumably a message to Washington to hold off military strikes inside Yemen, our correspondent says. Media caption David Cameron: \\"We believe the device was designed to go off on the aeroplane\\" But he says Washington has been impressed by the speed and determination the Yemeni authorities have shown in their response. Our correspondent says this latest attempted bomb attack will only underscore fears about the security threat from Yemen, where al-Qaeda is taking advantage of weak government, wild geography and huge political social and economic problems that have no clear solutions. The New York Times quoted US officials as saying the sophistication of the devices pointed to al-Qaeda involvement. It quoted one official as saying: \\"The wiring of the device indicates that this was done by professionals. It was set up so that if you scan it, all the printer components would look right.\\" Cargo changes The Yemeni authorities have closed down the local offices of the US cargo firms UPS and FedEx, who have already suspended all shipments out of the country and pledged full co-operation with investigators. Prime Minister Cameron said the authorities had immediately banned packages coming to or through the UK from Yemen, and was considering further steps. UK Home Secretary Theresa May pledged to review air freight security. \\"Certainly, we have to look at our processes of searching and how we detect these devices,\\" she told the BBC. ||||| WASHINGTON — The powerful bombs concealed inside cargo packages and destined for the United States were expertly constructed and unusually sophisticated, American officials said Saturday, further evidence that Al Qaeda ’s affiliate in Yemen is steadily improving its abilities to strike on American soil. As investigators on three continents conducted forensic analyses of two bombs shipped from Yemen and intercepted Friday in Britain and Dubai, American officials said evidence was mounting that the top leadership of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, including the radical American-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, was behind the attempted attacks. Yemeni officials on Saturday announced the arrest of a young woman and her mother in connection with the plot, which also may have involved two language schools in Yemen. The two women were not identified, but a defense lawyer who has been in contact with the family, Abdul Rahman Barham, said the daughter was a 22 year-old engineering student at Sana University. Yemen’s president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, said Saturday night during a news conference that Yemeni security forces had identified her based on a tip from American officials, but he did not indicate her suspected role. Investigators said that the bomb discovered at the Dubai airport in the United Arab Emirates was concealed in a Hewlett-Packard desktop printer, with high explosives packed into a printer cartridge to avoid detection by scanners. “The wiring of the device indicates that this was done by professionals,” said one official involved in the investigation, who like several officials spoke on condition of anonymity because the inquiry was continuing. “It was set up so that if you scan it, all the printer components would look right.” The bomb discovered in Britain was also hidden in a printer cartridge. The terror plot broke publicly in dramatic fashion on Friday morning, when the two packages containing explosives and addressed to synagogues or Jewish community centers in Chicago were found, setting off an international dragnet and fears about packages yet to be discovered. It also led to a tense scene in which American military jets escorted a plane to Kennedy International Airport amid concerns — which turned out to be unfounded — that there might be explosives on board. On Saturday, in news conferences in London and Yemen, and from interviews with investigators here and abroad, the contours of the investigation began to emerge, along with new details of the frantic hours leading to the discovery of the packages. American officials said their operating assumption was that the two bombs were the work of Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri, Al Qaeda in Yemen’s top bomb-maker, whose previous devices have been more rudimentary, and also unsuccessful. Mr. Asiri is believed to have built both the bomb sewn into the underwear of the young Nigerian who tried to blow up a trans-Atlantic flight last Dec. 25, and the suicide bomb that nearly killed Saudi Arabia’s intelligence chief, Mohammed bin Nayef, months earlier. (In the second episode, American officials say, Mr. Asiri hid the explosives in a body cavity of his brother, the suicide bomber.) Just as in the two previous attacks, the bomb discovered in Dubai contained the explosive PETN, according to the Dubai police and Janet Napolitano, the secretary of homeland security. This new plot, Ms. Napolitano said, had the “hallmarks of Al Qaeda.” The targets of the bombs remained in question. Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain said on Saturday that the parcel bomb intercepted in England was designed to explode while the plane was flying. The country’s home secretary, Theresa May, said that British investigators had also concluded the device was “viable and could have exploded.” “The target may have been an aircraft, and had it detonated, the aircraft could have been brought down,” she said. But earlier in the day, Representative Michael McCaul of Texas, the ranking Republican on the House homeland security intelligence subcommittee, said that federal authorities indicated to him that the packages were probably intended to blow up the Jewish sites in Chicago rather than the cargo planes, since they do not carry passengers. Based on a conversation with Ms. Napolitano, he said that authorities were also leaving open the possibility that other packages with explosives had not yet been found. On Saturday, Deputy Commissioner Paul J. Browne, the New York Police Department’s chief spokesman, said that no specific threats had been made against synagogues or Jewish neighborhoods in the city, but that officers were watching them more closely as a precaution. It was a call from Mr. bin Nayef, the Saudi intelligence chief, on Thursday evening to John O. Brennan, the White House senior counterterrorism official and former C.I.A. station chief in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, that set off the search, according to American officials. They said Mr. bin Nayef also notified C.I.A. officials in Riyadh. Saudi Arabia has sometimes been a reluctant ally in America’s global campaign against radical militants. But it sees Yemen, its impoverished next door neighbor, as a different matter. The Saudis consider the Qaeda branch in Yemen its biggest security threat and Saudi intelligence has set up both a web of electronic surveillance and spies to penetrate the organization. |||||Summary:","response":"Some security forces in a place called Yemen caught a female student who they think was involved in sending bombs to other countries. The girl and her mother were found at their house because the people who caught her found her phone number when they were looking through stuff for a cargo company. The bombs were found in Dubai and the UK, and people think a group called al-Qaeda made the bombs. The girl they caught might not be guilty, though, because her lawyer says she's just a quiet student and didn't have any bad connections. The fact that they found her phone number so easily also made them question if she really did anything wrong. The leaders of Yemen say they're going to keep fighting against al-Qaeda, but they don't want other countries interfering in their business."},{"question":"Sam Farragut is a sociopathic business executive in Southern California who forces a team of advertising agency employees to embark on a dangerous dirtbike trip to the Baja California desert in order to compete for his business .

Second question: To keep its funding for other services, why doesn't Planned Parenthood stop doing abortions, as President elect Trump wants ? Are these two questions asking the same thing? Select from the following. -no -yes","response":"First question: How does the Genius Bar in Apple check my device's battery when I say the battery isn't working and ask for a replacement? When you bring your device to the Apple Genius Bar with a battery issue, the technicians follow a number of steps to diagnose the problem and determine whether a battery replacement is necessary. The general evaluation process typically includes the following steps: 1. Visual Inspection: The technician will first perform a visual inspection of your device, checking for any external signs of damage or mishandling, such as water exposure, broken parts, or other physical factors that could affect battery performance. 2. Device History: The technician may ask you about the device's usage history, including charging habits, software updates, or any known hardware issues. This information helps the technician understand the circumstances and factors that may be causing the battery problem. 3. Internal Check: The technician will perform various diagnostic tests on the device to gather more information about its performance and battery health. This includes checking the battery's charge cycles, capacity, temperature, and voltage. Apple has proprietary diagnostic software and tools designed specifically for this purpose. 4. Battery Health Evaluation: Based on the information gathered, the technician will evaluate the overall health of the battery. They will consider factors such as age, usage, charge cycles, and capacity to determine whether the battery is performing within acceptable parameters or if it's experiencing significant degradation. 5. Recommendation and Replacement: If the technician determines that the battery is indeed experiencing significant degradation or malfunction, they will recommend a battery replacement. If your device is within warranty or covered by AppleCare+, the replacement will likely be done free of charge. If it is out of warranty, you will be provided with a cost estimate for the replacement. Second question: To keep its funding for other services, why doesn't Planned Parenthood stop doing abortions, as President elect Trump wants? Planned Parenthood provides a wide range of healthcare services, with abortion services accounting for a small percentage of their overall services. Their mission, as an organization, is to provide comprehensive reproductive healthcare and education to women, men, and young people. Abortion is considered an essential part of that mission, as it is a legal medical procedure that enables women to have control over their reproductive choices. There are a few reasons why Planned Parenthood does not simply stop providing abortion services in order to appease political figures and maintain funding: 1. Upholding their mission: Planned Parenthood is committed to ensuring reproductive healthcare access and the right to choose. By discontinuing abortion services, the organization would be neglecting a crucial aspect of the comprehensive care they provide. 2. Patient Needs: For many women, Planned Parenthood is the only accessible provider of abortion services. Discontinuing this service would leave these women without access to safe, legal abortions, ultimately resulting in negative health and socioeconomic consequences for them. 3. Separating Funding: Planned Parenthood already segregates its funding, ensuring that federal funds are not used for abortion services. Instead, federal funding goes toward other essential healthcare services like cancer screenings, STD testing, and birth control. Discontinuing abortion services would not necessarily guarantee continued federal funding for its other services. 4. Political and Ideological Opposition: Opposition to abortion services is mainly based on ideological and political disagreements rather than concerns about the quality of care. By discontinuing services, Planned Parenthood would only be acquiescing to political pressure instead of focusing on providing the best possible healthcare for its patients. To answer your last question, these two questions are not asking the same thing. They address distinct topics - one is about the technical process of evaluating a device battery, and the other is about the reasons why a healthcare organization continues to provide a specific service despite political pressure. Therefore, the answer is - no."},{"question":"A friend asked me to answer this question: Which person put makeup on their eye to make it look like a \\"black eye\\"?, using the article: Jennifer Stanton is a rebellious teen who constantly argues with her parents.

Records, the Chili Peppers began looking for a suitable producer. One in particular, Rick Rubin, stood out, as he was more broadminded than people the band had worked with in the past, even though Rubin had turned down the chance to produce their 1987 album The Uplift Mofo Party Plan due to the drug problems of Kiedis and guitarist Hillel Slovak (who would die of a heroin overdose a year later). Unlike the Peppers' previous producers, Rubin was someone the band felt confident in to ask for guidance and input during times of difficulty. He would often help arrange drum beats, guitar melodies and lyrics.The band sought to record the album in an unconventional setting, believing it would enhance their creative output. Rubin suggested the mansion magician Harry Houdini once lived in, to which they agreed. A crew was hired to set up a recording studio and other equipment required for production in the house in Los Angeles. The Peppers decided they would remain inside the mansion for the duration of recording, though according to Kiedis, Smith was convinced the location was haunted, and refused to stay. He would, instead, come each day by motorcycle. Smith himself disputes this account, and instead claims the real reason he did not stay at The Mansion was because he wanted to be with his wife. Frusciante, however, disagreed with Smith, and said \\"There are definitely ghosts in the house,\\" and Frusciante felt they were \\"very friendly. We [the band] have nothing but warm vibes and happiness everywhere we go in this house.\\"Frusciante, Kiedis, and Flea each had their own rooms in the house. When not recording with the band, Frusciante would spend his time painting, listening to music, reading and recording songs he'd written. Due to the seclusion, Kiedis ended up recording all his vocals in his room, as it was large enough to accommodate the recording equipment. For more than 30 days, the Chili Peppers worked inside the house; Kiedis felt it was an accommodating and resourceful environment..., what would be the answer ?

This melted material, rich in minerals and heated to extremely high temperatures, returns to a molten state similar to the initial magma from which the entire rock cycle began. At this point, the process starts over, creating a continuous cycle of rock formation and transformation that can occur over millions of years. Once the magma is formed, it may eventually rise towards the Earth's surface, driven by buoyancy and pressure from tectonic events. When conditions are suitable, the magma can accumulate in magma chambers beneath the surface. Over time, this magma may either cool slowly beneath the crust to form intrusive igneous rocks, such as granite, or be erupted onto the Earth's surface through volcanic activity to form extrusive igneous rocks, such as basalt and pumice. The erupted volcanic material also contributes to the formation of volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks, like tuff, when volcanic ash and debris accumulate and compact. As the new igneous rocks undergo weathering, erosion, and deposition, they will eventually be transformed into sedimentary rocks through the processes of lithification, which includes compaction and cementation. Sedimentary rocks can be organic, clastic, or chemical in origin, and they can include limestone, sandstone, and shale, among others. These rocks often bear the hallmarks of the environments in which they were formed and contain valuable information about the history and evolution of the Earth's surface. Further along in the cycle, if these sedimentary rocks are subjected to heat and pressure, they can undergo metamorphism, changing their mineralogical composition, texture, and structure. Depending on the degree of metamorphism and the original rock type, metamorphic rocks like slate, schist, gneiss, and marble can be formed. This metamorphic transformation can take place at convergent plate boundaries, where two tectonic plates are colliding, or in the vicinity of a heat source such as a magma chamber. If the metamorphic rocks are subjected to even greater heat and pressure, they will eventually cross the melting point and return to a molten state, becoming magma once again. This signifies the completion of the rock cycle and sets the stage for the process to repeat itself over vast geological timescales. Through this complex and dynamic process, the Earth's lithosphere constantly evolves, shaping the planet's surface and providing resources for human use."},{"question":"How might one describe the sentiment of this review? I was pleasantly surprised with my recent stay at the Mirage and would gladly stay at this hotel again. LOVES: 1) LOCATION: Located on the strip, closer to the North end. As any of you regular Vegas goers know, location is everything! For this particular Vegas trip the majority of our plans had us at the North end of the strip which made it convenient for us to get around by foot or taxi. 2) FRONT DESK/LOBBY AREA: I love love love the pretty (and huge) aquarium situated right behind the front desk. It runs the length of the front desk area, so as you're waiting in the long line to check in or check out at least you've got a lovely view of the pretty aquarium to keep you entertained. 3) ROOM RATES: I usually book MGM or the Gold Coast for Vegas trips because of their bargain rates, but when fellow Yelper Ingrid R told me about the good rates at the Mirage I checked it out. Our room rates for our stay were as follows: Fri 12/21 72 Sat 12/22 72 Sun 12/23 56 However, keep in mind as with any other hotel in Vegas the above room rates did not include the daily 25 resort fee nor the 12% room tax. So including all the fees and taxes the entire stay came to 309. 4) ROOMS: Although me and my boyfriend's room was all the way at the end of the hall, we scored a corner room that was slightly larger than our other friends' rooms and had better views because of the semi wraparound windows. My favorite part about the room was the abundance of mirrors they had, aside from the mirror in the bathroom. As soon as we walked in, I noticed a full length mirror to my left (absolute must have in any Vegas hotel room); the mirrored closet; and a rather large hanging mirror on the wall next to the bathroom door. Regardless of who was in the bathroom and how long the bathroom was in use, the mirrors came in handy for the other one to still get ready. Enough about the mirrors lol, the rest of the room was nice: simple modern decor; comfy bed; large flat screen tv; etc. Although the bathroom was pretty small compared to other hotels I've stayed at. 5) BLT: You'll have to read my BLT review for more details, but what a great find and soooooo convenient!!! Good food & awesome shakes!!! The group of us ended up eating here multiple times during our Vegas trip. Aside for the small bathroom in our room, there really isn't anything to dislike about the Mirage.

Nutrition is a critical aspect of health and development. Better nutrition is linked to improved health at all ages, a lower risk of chronic disease, and longevity. Good nutrition is about getting the right amount of nutrients from healthy foods in the right combinations. The key principles of nutrition involve maintaining an appropriate energy balance and consuming a wide variety of foods to ensure the consumption of essential nutrients. 1. Balanced Diet: Consuming a variety of nutrient-rich food and beverages in balance with the intake of energy is essential. A balanced diet includes carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals. It is essential to strike a balance between these components to abide by the healthy standard of good nutrition. 2. Adequacy: A diet must provide adequate amounts of all nutrients required by the body. This depends on the nutrient density of foods, which is the ratio of the nutrient content to the total energy content. 3. Portion Control: Controlling portion sizes helps regulate caloric intake and prevent overeating. Over time, excessive nutrient intake can lead to obesity, metabolic diseases, coronary heart disease, and certain types of cancer. 4. Moderation: It is key to not over-consume any one type of food or nutrient, particularly fat and sugar. High sugar consumption can contribute to obesity, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease. Similarly, high fat consumption, particularly of saturated and trans fats, can lead to high cholesterol and heart disease. 5. Regular Physical Activity: Nutritional wellness can only be achieved in combination with regular physical activity. Activity helps in maintaining a balance between calorie intake and calorie expenditures. 6. Hydration: Water is an essential nutrient that is vital for health and survival. Being well-hydrated improves skin health, maintains the balance of body fluids, regulates body temperature, and aids in digestion. 7. Personal Preference: Diet should be palatable and culturally appropriate. It should consist of foods that one enjoys eating and those that are readily available in one's local environment in sustainable and ethical ways. Each nutrient serves a particular function in the body. When we don't get enough, deficiencies can occur, leading to health problems. Carbohydrates, for example, are the main energy source for the body, consuming them in the right amount maintains the body's energy levels. Proteins are essential for growth, maintenance, and repair of the body. Fats, contrary to the common belief, are also necessary as they provide energy, maintain body temperature, and cushion vital organs. Vitamins and minerals are multifunctional; they play a role in metabolism, immune system, bone health, and more. All of these principles of good nutrition contribute to overall health in various ways. Good nutrition helps in maintaining an ideal body weight, reduces the risk of chronic diseases like diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases, boosts immune function, enhances mental well-being, and promotes healthy growth and development in children. Therefore, understanding and implementing the principles of good nutrition is vital for maintaining optimal health."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: In Yemen, you always see one type of vehicle on the road: the water truck.They travel mountain roads and cross deserts to bring Yemenis the goods more valuable than oil.It is one that only the rich can afford, with the supply regularly being cut off.Others must rely on scarce rain or charity to fight thirst. Experts say Yemen is going to be the first country in the world to run out of water.The capital, Sanaa, will run out of drinking water as early as 2025,says a report by the World Bank. Hannan, an 18yearold from Lahej, said that only the rich could prepare for cuts in supply.\\"In a good week we'll have a water supply all week but then the following week there will be water only for a day or two, \\" she said. She and her husband, a factory worker, pay 3,000 riyals (99yuan) for a week's supply of water from a touring water truck when the taps run dry.With an income of only 20,000 riyals (660yuan) a month,this means the family often spend half their money on water. \\"There are a lot of people who can't afford it and they have to rely on their neighbors to help,\\" she said. The average person in Yemen survives on onefifth of what the World Health Organization considers to be enough water. In Taiz, in the south,tap water is available only once every 45 days.In the mountainous Malhan district in the north,women and children climb a 1,500m mountain to collect water from a spring, often in the small hours to avoid long queues. Yemen is located in Southwest Asia,bordering the Arabian and Red Sea.Yemeni people have lived on scarce water supplies for thousands of years but that problem has been made serious by conflict in the area,the fastgrowing population and the use of water to grow a drug called qat.With one of the world's highest rates of population growth--3.46 percent, Yemen is the poorest Arab country.

The song was written by James Mtume and Reggie Lucas, two former members of Miles Davis' band, who were members of Flack's band at the time. Produced by Atlantic Records, the song was released on Flack's 1977 album \\"Blue Lights in the Basement\\", and as a single in 1978. It became a major crossover hit, becoming Flack's biggest commercial hit after her success with her 1973 solo single, \\"Killing Me Softly with His Song\\". Originally set as a solo-single, Flack's manager, David Franklin, suggested a duet with Hathaway, which resulted in the finished work. - Roberta Cleopatra Flack (born February 10, 1939) is an American singer and musician. She is best known for her classic #1 singles \\"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\\", \\"Killing Me Softly with His Song\\" and \\"Feel Like Makin' Love\\", and for \\"Where Is the Love\\" and \\"The Closer I Get to You\\", two of her many duets with Donny Hathaway. - Donny Edward Hathaway (October 1, 1945 January 13, 1979) was an American jazz, blues, soul and gospel singer, songwriter, arranger and pianist. Hathaway signed with Atlantic Records in 1969 and with his first single for the Atco label, \\"The Ghetto\\", in early 1970, \\"Rolling Stone\\" magazine \\"marked him as a major new force in soul music.\\" His enduring songs include \\"The Ghetto\\", \\"This Christmas\\", \\"Someday We'll All Be Free\\", \\"Little Ghetto Boy\\", \\"I Love You More Than You'll Ever Know\\", signature versions of \\"A Song for You\\" and \\"For All We Know\\", and \\"Where Is the Love\\" and \\"The Closer I Get to You\\", two of many collaborations with Roberta Flack. \\"Where Is the Love\\" won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals in 1973. At the height of his career Hathaway was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and was known to not take his prescribed medication regularly enough to properly control his symptoms. On January 13, 1979, Hathaway's body was found outside the luxury hotel Essex House in New York City; his death was ruled a suicide. - MPEG-1 and/or MPEG-2 Audio Layer III, more commonly referred to as MP3, is an audio coding format for digital audio which uses a form of lossy data compression. It is a common audio format for consumer audio streaming or storage, as well as a de facto standard of digital audio compression for the transfer and playback of music on most digital audio players and computing devices. - Compact disc (CD) is a digital optical disc data storage format released in 1982 and co-developed by Philips and Sony. The format was originally developed to store and play only sound recordings but was later adapted for storage of data (CD-ROM). Several other formats were further derived from these, including write-once audio and data storage (CD-R), rewritable media (CD-RW), Video Compact Disc (VCD), Super Video Compact Disc (SVCD), Photo CD, PictureCD, CD-i, and Enhanced Music CD. Audio CD players have been commercially available since October 1982, when the first commercially available CD player was released in Japan. - Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century, first as books of individual 78rpm records, then from 1948 as vinyl LP records played at rpm. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though in the 21st century album sales have mostly focused on compact disc (CD) and MP3 formats. The audio cassette was a format used from the late 1970s through to the 1990s alongside vinyl. - The LP (from \\"long playing\\" or \\"long play\\") is an analog sound storage medium, a vinyl record format characterized by a speed of rpm, a 12 or 10 inch (30 or 25 cm) diameter, and use of the \\"microgroove\\" groove specification. Introduced by Columbia in 1948, it was soon adopted as a new standard by the entire record industry. Apart from a few relatively minor refinements and the important later addition of stereophonic sound, it has remained the standard format for vinyl albums. - Oasis was Roberta Flack 's first solo album of newly recorded songs since 1982 's I 'm the One . It was released in 1988 and features the number - one U.S. singles , \`\` Oasis '' ( R&B ) , and \`\` Uh - uh Ooh - ooh Look Out ( Here It Comes ) '' ( Dance / Club Play ) . - \\"Killing Me Softly with His Song\\" is a song composed by Charles Fox with lyrics by Norman Gimbel. The song was written in collaboration with Lori Lieberman, who recorded the song in late 1971. In 1973 it became a number-one hit, in US and Canada, for Roberta Flack, also reaching number six in the UK Singles Chart. The song has since been covered by numerous artists, including a version by the Fugees that won the 1997 Grammy for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. - A book is a set of written, printed, illustrated, or blank sheets, made of paper, parchment, or other materials, fastened together to hinge at one side, with text and/or images printed in ink. A single sheet within a book is a leaf, and each side of a leaf is a page. A set of text-filled or illustrated pages produced in electronic format is known as an electronic book, or e-book. - \\"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\\" is a 1957 folk song written by British political singer/songwriter Ewan MacColl for Peggy Seeger, who later became his wife, to sing. At the time the couple were lovers, although MacColl was married to someone else. Seeger sang the song when the duo performed in folk clubs around Britain. During the 1960s, it was recorded by various folk singers and became a major international hit for Roberta Flack in 1972, winning the Grammy Awards for Record and Song of the Year. \\"Billboard\\" ranked it as the No. 1 song of the year for 1972.

After playing an editor and a murderer, he's now a crime-scene investigator. This week Mr. Danson, 63, returned to network television, poring over evidence as the head investigator on CBS's \\"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.\\" Just a few years ago, Mr. Danson seemed to be happily retired. His sitcom \\"Becker,\\" about a cranky doctor in the Bronx, was canceled in 2004. Afterward, he made a few cameos in cable shows and films—he and his wife Mary Steenburgen occasionally play fictionalized versions of themselves on HBO's \\"Curb Your Enthusiasm\\"—but mostly lived comfortably in Los Angeles and Martha's Vineyard. Then, in 2007, Mr. Danson got the role of Arthur Frobisher, a sociopath CEO engulfed in an Enron-like scandal in \\"Damages,\\" then on FX and now on DirecTV. \\"After years of doing half-hour comedies, I'd become this nice, accommodating actor who wanted to make sure everything was right,\\" Mr. Danson says. He hired an acting coach. \\"This coach got me to be a little more arrogant,\\" he says. \\"I didn't do anything I didn't want to do, which fit this billionaire narcissist I was playing.\\" The role put Mr. Danson back on the map—and helped him land the starring role in one of the biggest hits on TV world-wide. Now entering its 12th season, \\"CSI,\\" the original series in Jerry Bruckheimer's sleek billion-dollar crime franchise, airs in 200 countries or territories. Last season in the U.S. it attracted 13.7 million viewers nightly. That's down from its peak of 26 million in 2003, but it still beats popular drams like ABC's \\"Grey's Anatomy\\" and CBS's \\"The Good Wife.\\" See a clip of Ted Danson, the former star of \\"Cheers,\\" in the newest season of CSI. The fictional Clark County forensics unit has had its share of staff changes. William Petersen originally played night-shift entomologist Gil Grissom. In 2009, Laurence Fishburne joined as investigator Ray Langston. Mr. Danson will step in as D.B. Russell, night supervisor of the Las Vegas Crime Lab. The scientific jargon in \\"CSI\\" appealed to Mr. Danson, who has spent two decades as an activist focused on marine conservation. His father, in his hometown of Flagstaff, Ariz., was a museum director and archeologist. \\"There were always scientists crawling in and out of our house,\\" Mr. Danson says. The Wall Street Journal: Why did you decide to do \\"CSI\\"? Twenty-two episodes a season is a big commitment. Mr. Danson: I tend to back into things in life. They seem to miraculously land in my lap and as time goes on I find out how lucky I am. That happened with \\"Damages\\" and \\"Bored to Death.\\" They were teeny little parts in the pilot but turned out to be these great things for me. The same thing has happened here with \\"CSI.\\" I knew I wanted to be home in L.A. One of our daughters is pregnant, so the idea of making a show nine months out of the year and knowing where I'd be appealed to me. I started off by going to Las Vegas and I rode along with real CSI people. I went to the coroner's office and watched four autopsies. It was like being shot out of a cannon. I kept thinking, \\"Wow, maybe I'm not the right person for this.\\" Most of my life I look for the joy, the happiness, the joke, the humor. How can you immerse yourself in this dark side of life, with death and with that tiny percentage of our population that goes around killing each other? How can I fit into that world as an actor? Did you want to do a drama rather than another network sitcom? I love comedy, but it's hard. It's really, really hard. I joke that you can show up in a drama drunk, depressed, divorced, and as long as you're in the moment, the camera loves you. Drama is created by the writer, director and editor, whereas comedy is the writer and actor that are doing the work. Hence my wife saying I'm off to the spa every day. Most viewers don't like it when their favorite TV characters change. Is it a lot of pressure to replace a beloved character on the world's most watched TV drama? You pretend it's just another job but even though you try to ignore it, your body feels this is what it is, which is a billion-dollar franchise. Talk to me a year from now. Did Larry David write your character on \\"Curb Your Enthusiasm\\" or was that improvised? If you're writing a comedy show, a normal \\"Cheers\\" or \\"Seinfeld,\\" the process is you spend months pitching the stories, break it down on a chalkboard beat by beat by beat, and one of the last things you do is you hand that outline to a writer to write the dialogue. So Larry spends months working on the outlines but then doesn't write the dialogue. It's very well thought out but the dialogue is improvised. But like all improvisation, half of it is crap, so by the end [of improvising in rehearsals] you've almost improvised the script. The other half of what you see is coming out of people's mouths for the first time. Was it frustrating that for decades after \\"Cheers\\" you were typecast as a sitcom actor? The good news is some part came along that was so well known that you're typecast, so it's one of those good news-bad news things. You may never be famous again like you are for that original type. But if you let go of that and let go of the big money that comes from people hiring you to just stay in your type, and get around creative people doing really different work, you can spring loose from that type. That's what happened to me with \\"Damages.\\" There's a scene in the first season when I'm in the back seat of an Escalade snorting coke with a hooker and order someone to kill someone else. At that moment Sam Malone went flying out the window.

But parents are usually the ones buying the phones. According to a July 2012 study, 56% of parents of children aged 8 to 12 have given their children a cellphone. The number goes up with age. The study just proves what many people already guessed: many kids, if not most, have their own cellphones. According to a recent survey, 12 is the magic number. It is the most common age for kids to get their first cellphone. But 13% of children aged 6 to 10 already have one. People who are for kids' using cellphones, including many parents, notice that cellphones help kids keep in touch with their friends and families. They believe that cellphones are an important tool in a dangerous situation. Kids can reach their parents at all times. And some people say having a cellphone helps teach kids to be responsible. Some cellphones designed for kids can be set to only work when parents approve . What's the harm in that? But other people are worried about the health and safety effects of kids' cellphones. They believe that kids with cellphones will spend less time playing outside with friends, and that sending text messages or making phone calls while doing homework makes it difficult for kids to concentrate. They say that kids are spending too much time texting instead of talking to each other. \\"Our brains developed to communicate face to face,\\" says Gary Small, a teacher at the UCLA School of Medicine, in California. \\"A lot of this is lost with texting.\\" Another worry is cyber bullying , which is on the rise as more kids use e-mail and text messages to communicate.

Choose from: a. yes b. it is not possible to tell c. no","response":"Based on the premise, \\"but they need to pay for it too because they couldn't do that somewhere else,\\" it is not possible to tell whether the hypothesis \\"They need to pay for the international debt too\\" is true. So, the correct answer is: b. it is not possible to tell Explanation: The premise provided is rather ambiguous, offering limited information about the context, the parties involved, the nature of \\"it\\" they need to pay for, and the relationship between the obligation to pay for \\"it\\" and the inability to do so elsewhere. Without a clear understanding of these key aspects, it is not possible to determine if the hypothesis regarding international debt obligations is accurate or relevant. For example, the term \\"international debt\\" usually refers to the money owed by one country to another, typically in the form of government bonds, financial instruments, or loans from international financial institutions such as the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund. However, the wording of the premise does not provide any indication that the parties involved are countries or governments, which makes drawing a connection to international debt uncertain. Moreover, the phrase \\"they couldn't do that somewhere else\\" implies that there may be unique circumstances or reasons why the obligation to pay for \\"it\\" is necessary, but the lack of specificity about what \\"it\\" represents or what those circumstances are further complicates the matter. For instance, \\"it\\" could refer to a specific service, resource, or asset, which may or may not have a relationship to international debt. On the other hand, the word \\"too\\" in the hypothesis could be interpreted as confirming that there are additional obligations or responsibilities aside from those noted in the premise. However, the absence of context regarding the obligations discussed in the premise prevents us from conclusively determining whether the international debt hypothesis fits within that framework. In summary, because of the ambiguities and missing information present in the premise, it is not possible to ascertain the truthfulness of the hypothesis concerning international debt obligations. More information would be needed to offer a more definitive answer on the matter."},{"question":"Falls das Installationsprogramm nicht automatisch startet, suchen Sie im Verzeichnis Arbeitsplatz Ihr CD-ROM Laufwerk und klicken Sie mit der linken Maustaste doppelt auf CloneDVD™ 2.

Fact 2: Fats are known as lipids. Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"What are steroid hormones made of?\\" with the following options: - bacteria - fats - sugar - muscle - H 2 O - sunlight - the Sun - SO2 A:","response":"Given Fact 1 and Fact 2 provided, steroid hormones are made of lipids, such as phospholipids and cholesterol, and fats are known as lipids. Therefore, the answer to the question \\"What are steroid hormones made of?\\" is - fats. Steroid hormones are a class of hormones that are derived from cholesterol and are essential for several vital functions in the body, such as regulating metabolism, inflammation, immune function, salt and water balance, and development of sexual characteristics. These hormones are synthesized primarily in the adrenal glands and the gonads (i.e., ovaries and testes). Some examples of steroid hormones include cortisol, aldosterone, testosterone, and estrogen. Cholesterol acts as the starting material for the synthesis of steroid hormones. Enzymes in the cells of the adrenal and gonadal glands modify the cholesterol molecule to produce different steroid hormones, each with specific biological functions. While cholesterol is a type of lipid, it is essential to note that not all lipids are cholesterol. Lipids are a broad class of organic molecules that include fats, oils, waxes, phospholipids, and cholesterol. They are all characterized by being insoluble in water and soluble in organic solvents like ether, chloroform, and acetone. Lipids are an essential component in living organisms, providing energy storage, cellular signaling, and maintaining the structural integrity of cell membranes. In conclusion, based on the facts provided and the clarification of the relationship between lipids and fats, we can confirm that the answer to the given question is that steroid hormones are made of fats (a subgroup of lipids)."},{"question":"Write an article based on this \\"You can view the full set of prize-winning images at www.worldpressphoto.org.\\"","response":"Title: Explore the Stunning World of Visual Journalism with the World Press Photo Awards Introduction Every year, talented photojournalists from around the world come together to participate in the prestigious World Press Photo Awards.

Given the context: How would Riley feel as a result? Possible answers: uncaring and mean, proactive and caring, uncaring and cruel Answer:","response":"Based on the given context, Riley would most likely feel that Austin is being proactive and caring. The statement \\"Austin decided it was time and took Riley to see a doctor\\" implies that Austin recognized that Riley required medical attention and prioritized Riley's well-being by taking them to a healthcare professional. This action demonstrates Austin's concern for Riley's health and is indicative of a caring nature. When someone takes the initiative to ensure the wellbeing of another, it typically evokes feelings of gratitude and reassurance. Riley's emotions in this situation would be positively influenced by Austin's proactivity and care, as they have directly contributed to addressing their health needs. It is highly unlikely that Riley would perceive Austin as uncaring, mean, or cruel given the context, as these adjectives are not aligned with someone who actively seeks help for another person, especially in regard to their health. Additionally, the proactive aspect of Austin's behavior might resonate with Riley. The fact that Austin perceived it was \\"time\\" to consult a doctor suggests that they were monitoring Riley's condition and assessing the situation carefully. The decision to finally seek medical advice would likely instill a sense of trust in Riley, appreciating that Austin is acknowledging the importance of addressing their health concerns promptly. Furthermore, Austin's proactivity contributes to the perception of responsibility, demonstrating that they are committed to maintaining Riley's wellbeing.

Background on False Widow Spiders: False widow spiders, or Steatoda nobilis, are a species of spiders that closely resemble the black widow in appearance. Although their bite is less toxic than the black widow's, it can still cause localized pain, swelling, and, in severe cases, fever and vomiting. The spiders are native to Madeira and the Canary Islands but have been observed in the UK since the late 19th century due to global commerce. Reasons for Closure: The schools' closure has been implemented as a precautionary measure to protect the health and safety of both students and staff members. The infestation has raised concerns about the possibility of students and faculty being bitten by the spiders, leading the school authorities to assess the situation and initiate pest control efforts. Pest Control Efforts: Pest control professionals have been called upon to inspect the affected schools and determine the best course of action to eliminate the spiders. These experts will use both chemical and non-chemical treatments, as well as incorporate preventive measures to ensure that the spiders do not return. The process could take several days, depending on the level of infestation and the success of the treatment plan. Impact on the Community: The closure of the schools has disrupted the normal routines for families in the affected areas, as parents have to make alternate arrangements for childcare and education during the cleanup and prevention process. Understandably, parents are concerned about the safety of their children and have expressed their support for the schools' swift action to address the infestation. Conclusion: The closure of the two east London primary schools due to the false widow spider infestation is a reminder of the importance of maintaining a safe and healthy environment for students and staff. As pest control professionals continue to work on eliminating the spiders and preventing future outbreaks, it is vital that the schools and local communities come together to ensure the safety of everyone involved and minimize the disruption caused by the closures."},{"question":"Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: I was a student nurse at the time. I was assisting in the delivery of an infant. My specific task was to work with the rather over-excited father-to-be. He was an absolute delight to work with…very solicitous of his wife all throughout, very cooperative with the staff, and very appreciative of the help we were giving the mother-to-be. The background was that after 7 years of marriage, and 2 tragic miscarriages, THIS pregnancy had come to full term, and the child—deliberately they did NOT want to know the gender—was healthy, and both “mom” and “dad” were excited about the upcoming birth. The child finally emerged, the MD held up the child, and “dad” blurted out “It’s a girl!! You wanted a girl!!! Oh my God, she’s beautiful!!” Then he buried his face on his wife’s shoulder and was sobbing for pure joy. The MD quickly put him to work…he was to cut the umbilical cord. “I’m not going to hurt her, am I??” MD assured him no, he wouldn’t. He made the cut, and came immediately over to the wife…”Honey…are you all right?? I didn’t hurt you??”” While the his daughter was being bathed and checked out by the APGAR nurse, he excited called out the various observations—she as healthy..she was pinking up…she was so beautiful “I can’t believe it.” When the nurse returned the little girl to “mom”, the three of them cuddled together, tears just pouring from his eyes…and we in the birthing suite were all getting teary-eyed ourselves. That was 30 years ago, and I still get tears just thinking about what I consider the most beautiful moment of my life, one that I was lucky to share with these two wonderful people.

Hypothesis: The volume of letters that non-households send is shown in table 121. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","response":"To perform the task, I will examine both the premise and the hypothesis carefully, analyze the information in them, and compare this information to see if one can be logically derived from the other. Step1: Understand the premise The premise states that \\"The volume of letters sent by non-households can also be calculated from Table 1 by adding NHH-to-HH and NHH-to-NHH volumes.\\" Here it's clearly stated that the data for calculating the volume of letters sent by non-households is found in Table 1 and can be determined by adding two subsets of data: NHH-to-HH and NHH-to-NHH. Step2: Understand the hypothesis The hypothesis states that \\"The volume of letters that non-households send is shown in table 121.\\" This implies that the information about the volume of letters sent by non-households can be found in a table labeled \\"121\\". Step3: Compare the premise and hypothesis Upon comparing the specific details in the premise and in the hypothesis, I find that the tables mentioned are different. While the premise talks about data from Table 1, the hypothesis refers to data from table 121. Unless it's specified that these tables contain the same data or table 121 is a derivative of table 1, it's difficult to claim that the premise logically leads or entails to the hypothesis. Step4: Conclusion Based on the evaluation, I conclude that the premise does NOT entail the hypothesis, since they attribute the source of the volume of letters sent by non-households to different tables. In the premise, this information can be generated from Table 1, while the hypothesis shows this information is present in Table 121."},{"question":"Select your answer: Which is this about?

He was the first to write ballades and scherzi as individual concert pieces. He essentially established a new genre with his own set of free-standing preludes (Op. 28, published 1839). He exploited the poetic potential of the concept of the concert étude, already being developed in the 1820s and 1830s by Liszt, Clementi and Moscheles, in his two sets of studies (Op. 10 published in 1833, Op. 25 in 1837).\\"?

The controls for this train set allow him to make it go faster or slower and it even has a rail switch to make it travel on different tracks branching off to the left or right. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Will making the train switch to a different track be considered acceleration, yes or no. Hint: Acceleration is a measure of the change in velocity of a moving object. It measures the rate at which velocity changes. Velocity, in turn, is a measure of the speed and direction of motion, so a change in velocity may reflect a change in speed, a change in direction, or both. Both velocity and acceleration are vectors. A vector is any measurement that has both size and direction. People commonly think of acceleration as in increase in speed, but a decrease in speed is also acceleration. In this case, acceleration is negative and called deceleration. A change in direction without a change in speed is acceleration as well. Answer:","response":"Yes"},{"question":"Some question: Three 6 faced dice are thrown together. The probability that exactly two dice show the same number on them is Options: (A) 5/54 (B) 5/12 (C) 5/17 (D) 5/18 (E) 5/14 Some stream of consciousness:","response":"To find the probability that exactly two dice show the same number when three 6-faced dice are thrown together, we will look at different combinations of outcomes and the total number of possible outcomes. There are 6 sides on each dice, so there are 6^3 = 216 possible outcomes when we throw three dices together. We can break down the problem into two separate events: Event A is when exactly two dices have the same number, and Event B is when all three dices have different numbers. 1. Calculate the probability of Event A (exactly 2 dices have the same number): There are three possibilities in this case: either the first two dices have the same number, the first and third dices have the same number, or the second and third dices have the same number. Scenario 1: First two dices have the same number: - There are 6 different numbers that the first and second dice can show together (1-1, 2-2, 3-3, 4-4, 5-5, or 6-6). - Since the third dice must show a different number, it has 5 options (6 - 1 = 5). - Thus, in this scenario, there are 6 * 5 = 30 possible outcomes. Scenario 2: First and third dices have the same number: - This case is symmetrical to Scenario 1. Thus, there are 30 possible outcomes. Scenario 3: Second and third dices have the same number: - This case is also symmetrical to Scenario 1. Thus, there are 30 possible outcomes. The total number of outcomes when exactly two dices have the same number is 30 + 30 + 30 = 90. Probability of Event A = number of favorable outcomes (90) / total outcomes (216) = 90/216. 2. Calculate the probability of Event B (all three dices have different numbers): For this event, all three dices must show a different number. - The first dice can show any number from 1 to 6 (6 options). - The second dice must show a different number than the first one (5 options left). - The third dice must show a different number than both the previous ones (4 options left). The total number of outcomes when all three dices have different numbers is 6 * 5 * 4 = 120. Probability of Event B = number of favorable outcomes (120) / total outcomes (216) = 120/216. 3. Calculate the probability that exactly two dices show the same number: To find the probability that exactly two dices show the same number, we subtract the probability of all three dices having different numbers (Event B) from the probability of two or three dices having the same number (Event A). Since there are no other possible outcomes, these two events cover all possibilities. Probability = Probability of Event A - Probability of Event B = (90/216) - (120/216) = -30/216. Now, the negative probability does not make sense. However, there's another way to look at the problem, which we may have misinterpreted. Instead of finding the probability where two or three dices have the same number, we can consider getting the probability of exactly two dices having the same number, and the third one being different. In this case: Probability = Probability of Event A - Probability of Event B = (90/216) - (-30/216) = 120/216 = 5/9. Hence, the correct answer will be: (E) 5/9 However, this option is not available in your provided choices. As probabilistic problems can be approached in many different ways, we request you to recheck your given options and/or the problem statement to ensure clarity."},{"question":"Q: I heard that Kai had worked really hard and was able to get his masters in English.

Translate to English","response":"I would like to emphasize the complementary nature of the five reports as well and note that they indeed represent a unified and comprehensive background of the parliamentary position. In essence, the five reports on various aspects of a given subject matter work together to not only provide a broader understanding of the context at hand but also to establish a well-rounded foundation for the parliamentary stance. By examining these reports collectively, we can appreciate the intricate weave of information, research, and analysis that underpins the development of a sound and holistic parliamentary position. Each of the five reports may tackle different aspects of an issue, such as the legislative background, stakeholder opinions and concerns, potential impacts, and possible solutions. This multi-pronged approach is helpful in shedding light on the full spectrum of challenges and opportunities related to the matter being discussed in parliament. The legislative background report, for instance, might provide an overview of the current laws and regulations that apply to the subject in question, as well as any previous attempts at reform or amendments. This enables members of parliament to grasp the historical context and understand the legal framework within which they are working. The stakeholder report, on the other hand, deals primarily with the views and concerns of various parties who may either directly or indirectly be affected by the proposed measures. By collecting and analyzing opinions from different stakeholders, parliamentarians can gain deeper insight into the public sentiment and thereby make better-informed decisions. The impact report delves into the potential consequences, both positive and negative, of any proposed changes. This can include financial projections, environmental considerations, or social implications, to name a few. By weighing the costs and benefits, decision-makers can chart the most promising course of action. A fourth report might focus on best practices and case studies from other jurisdictions or countries that have faced similar issues. This comparative analysis can offer valuable insights into the adoption or adaptation of successful measures, as well as the pitfalls to avoid. Finally, the policy proposals report consolidates all available evidence and analyses, incorporating the findings from the other four reports to develop a set of recommendations for the parliamentary decision-making process. In summary, the five complementary reports serve as a cohesive whole, informing and influencing parliamentary positions on various levels. This comprehensive approach helps parliamentarians, policy-makers, and stakeholders in making well-informed decisions that reflect the multifaceted realities of the complex issues they confront."},{"question":"Thomasin \\"Tom\\" McKenzie (born 2000) is a New Zealand teen actress.

Johnson is expected to be released from prison soon, CNN reports. This marks Trump's sixth act of clemency since taking office. Kardashian tweeted her excitement over the news this afternoon. \\"BEST NEWS EVER!!!\\" she posted. BEST NEWS EVER!!!! 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼 https://t.co/JUbpbE1Bk0 — Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) June 6, 2018 Here's what you need to know Johnson's case: Johnson was serving a life sentence. The 63-year-old great-grandmother was given a life sentence in prison for a nonviolent drug-related crime and was not eligible for parole. Johnson was convicted in 1996 on eight criminal counts stemming from a Memphis-based cocaine trafficking operation involving more than a dozen people. She was sentenced to life in prison in 1997. Today, she's spent more than two decades behind bars. As one of Johnson's lawyers, Brittany Barnett, told The Daily Mail, \\"The message to the president is that Alice Johnson, the 21 years she has been in prison, represents a punishment that more than pays her debt to society and that to keep her prison the rest of her life is morally and economically unjustifiable.\\" I am honored to accompany @KimKardashian to The White House today to advocate on behalf of Alice Marie Johnson. Kim has spent her time, money & energy for this incredibly worthy cause. Please give credit where credit is due. — Shawn Holley (@theshawnholley) May 30, 2018 Johnson became \\"involved in drug trafficking\\" during a difficult period in her life. Johnson became \\"involved in drug trafficking as a way to make ends meet following a particularly rough period in her life: She lost her job at FedEx, where she had worked for 10 years, due to a gambling addiction; she got divorced; and then her youngest son died in a motorcycle accident,\\" Mic reports. According to Johnson, this series of events led her become involved with drugs. As she told Mic: \\"I felt like a failure... I went into a complete panic and out of desperation, I made one of the worst decisions of my life to make some quick money. I became involved in a drug conspiracy.\\" Memphis attorney Michael Scholl, who filed the latest court documents appealing for Johnson's sentence reduction, said she wasn't the leader of the cocaine operation. Instead, Bustle reports, \\"Johnson gradually became involved in a drug trafficking operation in Memphis, Tennessee. She says that she never brokered any deals or handled drugs, but was responsible for relaying coded messages over the phone.\\" The meeting with Trump, which was initially reported by @VanityFair, marks the culmination of months of @KimKardashian West's behind-the-scenes efforts to free #AliceMarieJohnson. pic.twitter.com/EyGwQ2vct1https://t.co/We2L0m6bFV — Mic (@mic) May 30, 2018 This was Johnson's first offense, but she was given a life sentence without the chance of parole. Even though her arrest in 1993 was her first offense, Johnson received a life sentence, which she began serving in 1996. During the trial ten of her co-defendants testified against her in exchange for a reduced or dropped charges, Mic reports. Johnson, however, did not receive the same mercy, despite having not previous drug charges. Johnson's children have long petitioned for her release. Speaking in a video for Mic, Johnson's daughter, Tretessa, said of her mother, \\"She’s made some serious mistakes in her life, but she is not this monster. I mean, she’s really turned a very negative situation to as positive of a situation as she can.\\" Of Kardashian's involvement in the situation, Tretessa told BBC News, \\"We are praying for mercy in my mom's case… that this nightmare is finally coming to an end.\\" Johnson's family and supporters say she's a \\"model inmate\\" who's active in \\"many programmes including working at the prison hospice,\\" BBC News reports. Amy Povah, who founded the organization CAN-DO Clemency, started advocating for Johnson in 2014, and even collected a \\"letter of support from the retired warden of Johnson's prison\\" on her character, which will be given to Trump. Povah told BBC News that Johnson has \\"always stood out to me as being exceptional. She's not bitter or angry, she's this ray of sunshine.\\" Johnson submitted an application for clemency to the Obama Administration on three occasions. President Obama pardoned 231 individuals in December 2016, \\"many of whom had similar drug-related charges,\\" Mic reports, but Johnson was not one of them. According to BBC News, Johnson \\"fit all of the criteria\\" for the former president's clemency project, but was rejected just days before Obama's term ended. The reason why is unclear. Johnson told Mic, \\"When the criteria came out for clemency, I thought for sure—in fact, I was certain that I’d met and exceeded all of the criteria.\\" Kardashian has hired a new team of lawyers on behalf of Johnson. Back in November, Kardashian's Los Angeles-based attorney, Shawn Holley, told New York Daily News, \\"Kim asked me several weeks ago how she could help Alice Johnson in her fight for justice. We then began corresponding with Alice and her team of lawyers.\\" Holley is a renowned celebrity attorney whose past clients include O.J. Simpson, Michael Jackson, and Lindsay Lohan, according to TMZ. Kardashian visited the White House on Johnson's birthday. The reality star made the announcement on Twitter just hours before meeting with President Trump in Washington. Happy Birthday Alice Marie Johnson. Today is for you 🙏🏼✨ — Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) May 30, 2018 One of Johnson's lawyers, Brittany Barnett, told The Daily Mail, \\"Today's her birthday, so no greater gift than freedom on her birthday.\\" Kardashian met with Donald Trump regarding prison reform. Kim had been speaking with Jared Kushner, the president's senior advisor and son-in-law, regarding Johnson's case for months. Kushner has been working on The Prison Reform and Redemption Act which aims to reduce the rate of recidivism, and prepare prisoners to reintegrate into society. Hours after the reality star being spotted walking into the White House, POTUS tweeted a photo with her in the Oval Office. \\"Great meeting with @KimKardashian today, talked about prison reform and sentencing,\\" he wrote. The president didn't clarify if he will grant clemency to Johnson as a result of his meeting with Kim.

She said: \\"There are no words strong enough to express my deep and heartfelt gratitude. Ms. Kardashian, you are quite literally helping to save my life and restore me to my family. I was drowning and you have thrown me a life jacket, and given me hope that this life jacket I'm serving may one day be taken off.\\" Kardashian and her legal team hope that Johnson's case will start a wider conversation about prison reform. Johnson's lawyer, Barnett, told CBS News, \\"We are grateful that Kim is using her platform to raise awareness and hope that everyone looks beyond Kim and sees that there is a woman about to die in prison.\\" Barnett added that Kardashian \\"was not only moved to tears, but moved to action\\" after she watched a Mic interview about Johnson.

The subject of their evaluation? Rhinestone and sequin-embellished marketing displays for her perfume line—branded “The Voluptuous New Fragrance”—which was being promoted on a Season 10 episode of The Apprentice. On Wednesday, Kim paid a visit to Trump’s new quarters for a wholly different type of tete-a-tete: this time to request a pardon for Alice Marie Johnson, a 62-year-old woman serving a life sentence for a first time drug offense. While it’s unclear how receptive Trump was to Kardashian’s plea, there’s no shortage of precedent when it comes to his profoundly discerning take on her appearance. “Does she have a good body? No. Does she have a fat ass? Absolutely,” he said in a 2013 interview with radio personality Howard Stern. Trump added, “At the word ‘Kim’ they’d say, ‘Wow, I don’t wanna go out with her.’” During Kardashian’s pregnancy that same year, Trump, unprompted to speak about her looks, told a reporter, “She’s gotten a little bit large. I would say this, I don’t think you should dress like you weigh 120 pounds.” In another interview with Stern a year later, Trump maintained his stance on Kardashian’s lower body. “It’s record setting,” he said. “In the old days, they’d say she’s got a bad body.” All of this comes after Trump’s harsh 2009 firing of Kim’s sister Khloe Kardashian from Celebrity Apprentice. “She is a fat piglet. Why did we get the ugly Kardashian?” sources from the show have recalled Trump complaining at the time. In apparent reference to Kim, he reportedly added, “We can’t even get the hot one?” Aesthetic preferences aside, two former reality television stars assembling at the White House to confer about criminal justice reform might seem like a bizarre scenario all on its own. But the summit takes on an added level of irony when considering what connected Trump and the Kardashians in the first place: Trump’s close friendship with O.J. Simpson, whom Kim’s father Robert Kardashian helped defend in court. Lest we forget, it was Simpson’s murder trial that thrust the Kardashian patriarch into the limelight to begin with, with the rest of his now-notorious family keeping up not far behind. More than 10 years after O.J., who is also Kim’s godfather, was miraculously acquitted of murder, Kim Kardashian is advocating for a very different exoneration. Although Alice Johnson went to prison more than 21 years ago, Kardashian took up Johnson’s cause after coming across her story on Twitter earlier this year. In an interview this month, Kardashian expounded upon the discovery and her decision to support Johnson in requesting an official pardon. “Where I’m at in my life right now, just like, to go and spend my money buying material things just doesn’t satisfy me the way that it used to,” Kardashian said. “To save someone’s life and do that once a year, then that would make my heart fuller.” On Wednesday, that once-yearly day apparently came. “Happy Birthday Alice Marie Johnson,” Kardashian tweeted. “Today is for you.” ||||| Write a summary.","response":"Kim Kardashian met with President Donald Trump to discuss prison reform and the case of Alice Marie Johnson, a 63-year-old great-grandmother serving a life sentence without parole for a nonviolent drug-related crime.

His father, William Johnston Burr (1889-1985), was a hardware salesman; his mother, Minerva Annette (nee Smith, 1892-1974), was a pianist and music teacher who was born in Chicago, Illinois. Burr's ancestry included Lebanese, Irish, English, Scottish, and German. When Burr was six, his parents divorced. Context: In 1985, Burr was approached by producers Dean Hargrove and Fred Silverman to star in a made-for-TV movie, Perry Mason Returns. The same week, Burr recalled, he was asked to reprise the role he played in Godzilla, King of the Monsters! (1956), in a low-budget film that would be titled Godzilla 1985. \\"When they asked me to do it a second time, I said, 'Certainly,' and everybody thought I was out of my mind,\\" Burr told Tom Shales of The Washington Post. \\"But it wasn't the large sum of money. It was the fact that, first of all, I kind of liked 'Godzilla,' and where do you get the opportunity to play yourself 30 years later? So I said yes to both of them.\\" He agreed to do the Mason movie if Barbara Hale returned to reprise her role as Della Street. Hale agreed, and when Perry Mason Returns aired in December 1985, her character became the defendant. The rest of the principal cast had died, but Hale's real-life son William Katt played the role of Paul Drake, Jr. The movie was so successful that Burr made a total of 26 Perry Mason television films before his death. Many were filmed in and around Denver, Colorado. By 1993, when Burr signed with NBC for another season of Mason films, he was using a wheelchair full-time because of his failing health. In his final Perry Mason movie, The Case of the Killer Kiss, he was shown either sitting or standing while leaning on a table, but only once standing unsupported for a few seconds. Twelve more Mason movies were scheduled before Burr's death, including one scheduled to film the month he died. As he had with the Perry Mason TV movies, Burr decided to do an Ironside reunion movie. The Return of Ironside aired in May 1993, reuniting the entire original cast of the 1967-75 series. Like many of the Mason movies, it was set and filmed in Denver. Question: What was wrong with his health? Answer:","response":"Raymond Burr had some health problems towards the end of his life. Although specific details about his health issues are not mentioned, we know that he was using a wheelchair full-time because of his failing health.

Such feelings are generally perceived as unfavorable or unpleasant by the audience. The negative sentiment derived from this sentence may stem from several aspects of the movie. It could reflect upon the plot, where the primary characters or groups are pitted against each other, resulting in a story full of confrontation and friction. In this context, the reviewer may be expressing their opinion that this hostile environment is not enjoyable or suitable for the intended purpose of the film. Alternatively, the sentiment could refer to the off-screen dynamics between actors or other individuals involved in the movie's production. A hostile environment behind the scenes can potentially lead to a disjointed or tense on-screen atmosphere, which the audience may find off-putting. In this case, the sentiment could imply that the negative dynamics hinder overall enjoyment or detract from the film's intended purpose. From a cinematic perspective, the phrase might also suggest that the different elements of the movie, such as the plot, direction, acting, and visual aspects, do not harmoniously align, creating mounting tension or disagreement within the film. A film that presents disharmony or disunity between its various aspects may be perceived negatively by the reviewer. Regardless of the context or specific aspect of the movie that the reviewer references with this phrase, the sentiment of \\"at hostile odds with one another\\" expresses a strong negative impression. This sentiment suggests that the movie does not align with the expectations, preferences, or desires of the reviewer, and as such, the audience may want to consider this negative assessment when deciding whether or not to watch the film."},{"question":"NFL Scouting Combine preview: Scrutiny to come down on Vontaze Burfict - NFL News Updated Feb 22, 2012 11:26 AM ET Now that the NFL playoffs and Super Bowl are finally over and out of the way, it’s time to focus on what really matters — the NFL draft. This year’s draft has more juicy storylines, more interesting characters, and more intriguing hypothetical questions to bat around than, arguably, any draft of the past 10 years. With the new collective-bargaining agreement making first-round picks suddenly affordable and sensible investments, expect aggressive trading up in the first round, strategic front office maneuvers over the course of the first three rounds, and teams focusing on the draft in April instead of rampant free-agent spending in March. The 2012 draft class is incredibly deep with talent, but also swamped with question marks. Several of these questions will be addressed and scrutinized at this week’s NFL Scouting Combine. On the surface, the combine is one of the sports world's biggest anomalies. Much of the seven-day event involves players standing in shorts and tank tops, coaches and scouts sitting hundreds of feet away in the stands kibitzing, and behind-closed-doors meetings and evaluations. And yet, it makes for compelling TV. As Barry Jackson of the Miami Herald reported last year, 5.2 million American homes watched the combine on the NFL Network in March 2010. Those TV ratings were better than any numbers Major League Baseball got on ESPN during any given regular-season week of the 2010 baseball season, despite ESPN being in 43 million more homes than the NFL Network. This year, the NFL Network is sending an estimated 24 on-air announcers to Indianapolis, roughly 22 more than what’s probably necessary. For the first time ever, fans will be in attendance at this year's combine, as well. According to the NFL, tickets to the combine are free for 250 fans, but those tickets won’t be issued on a first-come, first-served basis. Instead, fans are encouraged to write a \\"short essay\\" on why they should be selected to attend. Essays! If the NFL were smart (or cruel), it would post these essays on NFL.com. “I’ve always regretted not being in the building when Mike Mamula ran his 40 . . .\\" ”Oh, to have seen Kyle Boller throw his 60-yard spirals in person. What I would have done . . . ” \\"My clock is better than Tom Coughlin's. To have the chance to use it, in person, well, golly . . . \\" Who should you be watching this week? Which players have the most on the line? Which drills are the most important? Here’s a viewers guide to this week’s 2011 NFL Scouting Combine: 1. The Luck vs. RGIII debate This one has been steadily brewing for quite some time, formulating deep under the surface, but is bound to boil over after Griffin III wows scouts this week in Indy. Andrew Luck has been the “no-brainer” first pick of the draft since he decided to return to Stanford for his junior campaign last January, and though he’s done nothing but help solidify his draft stock the past 13 months, there are more and more good things emerging from the Griffin camp. With the immediate impact Cam Newton made on the Carolina Panthers last season (with an abridged offseason, mind you), and the incredible turnaround Baylor football had in the four years Griffin served as its quarterback, there’s reason to believe RGIII has the bigger “upside” than Luck. Griffin is the more athletic player, might throw a better deep ball and has many of the same leadership qualities that Luck is so roundly lauded for. The amazing irony is that these two almost played together in college. As I first shared in my column from this year’s Heisman ceremony, then-Stanford coach Jim Harbaugh recruited both men to play together at Stanford. Griffin, after briefly considering a Thunder and Lightning duo, decided he wanted to be “the guy” right away, and working in some sort of quarterback platoon wasn’t what he had in mind for his collegiate career. He turned down offers from Stanford, Miami, and Texas, declined an offer to play at Harvard, and committed to Art Briles at Houston. When Briles made the move to Baylor before Griffin’s freshman season, he followed the coach who recruited him and promised him playing time right away. In his four years in Waco, he didn’t disappoint. Griffin turned Baylor from a national laughingstock to a respected program, overcame what could have been a career-altering injury and somehow got better, and won a Heisman Trophy. Griffin III makes his teammates better and his coaches look smarter. Whereas Luck could be the next Peyton Manning, Robert Griffin III could be Cam Newton version 2.0. Both are tantalizing possibilities. He’s going to dazzle in workouts, he’s going to wow in interviews and, if he measures up as listed, there are going to be teams that rank Griffin over Luck. The size issue matters. I’ve spoken to some NFL folks who insist Griffin is closer to 5 feet 11, 205 pounds than 6-2, 220. We’ll see. The rumor out in Indianapolis during the Super Bowl was that the Polians — Bill and Chris — both had RGIII rated higher than Andrew Luck on their early draft boards. Whether true or not, it’s something to consider. Trust me, they’re not the only ones. If Griffin blows everyone out of the water this week? Buckle up, folks. 2. Star receiver or \\"Fat Alshon?\\" In my mock draft on FOXSports.com before the NFL playoffs started, I had South Carolina receiver Alshon Jeffery slotted to go seventh overall to the Jacksonville Jaguars. Jeffery is a dangerous deep threat with good physical tools, and I had him as the second wide receiver on my board. Jacksonville has a dire need for a wideout, he’s a tremendous talent and I assumed it made for a good fit. I had no idea of the negative reaction I would get. I got the emails. I got the text messages. I got the direct messages on Twitter. “Check the game tape . . .” Well, I still didn't see it. Jeffery had some off games in 2011, but he didn’t exactly have Joe Montana throwing him passes, either. I saw him destroy Nebraska in one half of action in a bowl game, I saw him dominate the Southeastern Conference in 2010 and I saw him score eight touchdowns for a bad passing offense in 2011. I needed more reasons, more proof, as to why I was being clobbered for having a superb receiving threat — when a superb receiving threat is absolutely necessary in today’s NFL — going in the top 10. Then I saw the picture. It came to me in the form of five different emails from readers, and you would think it was of him doing something illegal. This shot, from a photo taken in August, shows a noticeable belly on Jeffery. Were his numbers drastically worse in 2011 because of the team’s quarterback play? Or was it because he was an out-of-shape schlub? Which Alshon Jeffery shows up this week? We’ll see. I’ve seen him compared to Terrell Owens. But if he’s not in shape and those concerns are real, he could be another Mike Williams. And that’s not a good thing. It’s certainly not top-10 pick worthy. In the few games I watched Arizona State play the past few years, I always came away thinking the linebacker, No. 7, was the best player on either side of the ball. Vontaze Burfict was always good for a punishing hit, a high-impact tackle, and at least one “Whoa, did you see that?!” play. He was also always “good” for one back-breaking penalty. Then I watched Arizona State’s bowl game versus Boise State. Burfict was invisible. He had one tackle. The more research and film work I’ve done on the linebacker, the more I’ve cooled on him. His instincts aren’t great. He’s not as physically imposing as I recall him being, and he’s consistently out of position. When it’s him — one on one with a running back or quarterback — there may be no one better in this draft. When he has to fight to make a play, he too often fails to succeed. Oh, and from what I’m told by numerous sources, he’s a bit of a head case. Burfict’s going to be under a hot lamp his entire time in Indy. Teams are going to grill him on his defensive intelligence, his temper and his desire. Perception’s a crummy thing, sometimes. He has an uphill battle ahead. The past five years, an average of six offensive linemen have been taken in the first round. They're rarely the flashiest picks, but there’s a commonly held belief in NFL circles that taking a big tackle or guard is the safest, most risk-averse move in the first round. Jason Smith went second overall a few years back; Robert Gallery went second overall a few years before that. The point? Though there are some home runs on the offensive line, they’re not exactly sure bets, either. After USC’s Matt Kalil (whom some scouts aren’t doing flips over, either), the offensive linemen in this year’s draft are a bit of a crapshoot. Stanford’s Jonathan Martin and Iowa’s Riley Reiff are considered the second- and third-best tackles in the crop, but neither was particularly dominant in college. Guards David DeCastro (Stanford) and Cordy Glenn (Georgia) are getting a lot of attention, but I like center Peter Konz (Wisconsin) a bit more. There’s a small-school guy nobody’s talking about (yet) — Amini Silatolu out of tiny Midwestern State — who may be better than the whole lot. The Combine will help sort these guys — and several small school prospects — out on draft boards. Watching the tape and talking to scouts, I believe you can make the argument that Alabama tailback Trent Richardson’s the top running-back prospect to come out of college since Adrian Peterson. I repeat: the best. That includes Chris Johnson, Ray Rice and Darren McFadden. That includes his college teammate and the only running back to go in the first round last year, Mark Ingram. But what’s that mean anymore? Does that make Richardson a lock for the top five in this year’s draft? Hardly. The top 10? I don’t know. In recent years, we’ve seen undrafted guys like Arian Foster lead the league in rushing, undrafted guys like LeGarrette Blount lead all rookies in rushing and undrafted tandems like Danny Woodhead and BenJarvus Green-Ellis get more playing time than second-round picks. Is a running back — even if he’s supremely talented — ever worth a top pick? When Ingram slipped to 28th last year, pundits broke out the same shocked “Why is he slipping?” routine, and that goes as expected. But it’s an antiquated and inappropriate reaction. Running backs are very rarely worth first-round picks, and even when they are, they can be gotten later than expected. Watching where Richardson — a “surefire” top-10 guy for a lot of draftniks — ends up will be fascinating. 1. Amini Silatolu, OG, Midwestern State: Never heard of Silatolu? It’s OK, you’re not alone. Whether it has been Jahri Evans (Bloomsburg) or Mike Iupati (Idaho), it appears as though offensive guard is a spot where small-school talent has risen to the top in recent years. Silatolu’s stock could skyrocket after a string of fantastic workouts this week. A 6-3, 320-pound mauler at left tackle in college, he’s best suited for the inside at the next level. He’s likely a second-day pick now. But after a breakout week, he could sneak into the first round. 2. Akiem Hicks, DE, Regina (Canada): The correct pronunciation of Hicks’ school will make his fellow draft brethren snicker, but his 84-inch wingspan will shut them up awfully quickly. A transfer from LSU, Hicks is an athletic freak with tremendous size and strength. Listed at 6-6, 320 pounds, he has surprisingly nimble feet and good on-field awareness. He never put up big numbers in college — at any level — but he has all the physical tools that scouts salivate over. Which teams hit it big with their staff changes? John Czarnecki with his 10 biggest offseason moves. 3. Tim Benford, WR, Tennessee Tech: Another small-school guy with big dreams, Benford stood out at East-West Shrine Game practices by showing surprising strength for his 200-pound frame. Tennessee Tech's Watson Brown coached Roddy White in college. Brown says Benford has all the goods to make it on the next level. \\"Tim's just got enough of the pieces,\\" Brown told the Chattanooga Times Free Press last week. \\"He needed to have a good (senior) year, he needed to work harder and he did all of the things that I asked him to do.\\" Not a huge speed burner and “under-sized” at 5-11, 200 pounds, Benford might not be a first- or second-day pick. With a great week of workouts, however, he can solidify his place in that Day 2 conversation. 4. Ladarius Green, TE, Louisiana-Lafayette: The new breed of tight end is enormous, impossible to cover and a first-rate target in a big, passing offense. Jimmy Graham, Rob Gronkowski, Jermichael Finley — meet Ladarius Green. At 6-6, 240 pounds, Green actually played in the slot in the Louisiana-Lafayette offense. He’s an athletic freak who needs to put some more muscle on that frame. He will. Just wait until the scouts see him in the flesh in Indy. With a big week at Lucas Oil Stadium, Green could end up going in the second or third round. 5. B.J. Coleman, QB, Tennessee-Chattanooga: Every few years, there’s a tall quarterback prospect from a relatively small school who intrigues and tantalizes the scouts. Meet B.J. Coleman — this year’s Joe Flacco/John Skelton. After backing up Jonathan Crompton for two years at Tennessee, the 6-6 Coleman transferred to Chattanooga, where he led the Mocs for three years as their quarterback. Big body, big arm, surprisingly mobile — scouts are interested in Coleman’s potential. 1. The 40-yard dash: A player’s career can be made, or destroyed, in a flash. My favorite 40-yard-dash story involves Deion Sanders’ run in 1989. Back before the Combine was televised or even all that much covered by the media, Sanders reportedly showed up late and did just one drill — and only once. As the story goes, Sanders ran a 4.29 in the 40 and then jogged right into the Hoosier Dome tunnel and out the building. Without breaking stride, he hopped into a limousine and took a trip to the airport, where he boarded a plane and flew home. 2. Bench press: How many times can a player put up 225 pounds in one sitting? Can't fake this one. 3. The gauntlet: A wide receiver or a tight end gets a pass from a coach, catches the ball and drops it. He then runs across the field and catches five passes in a row from five different quarterbacks across the field. It’s all hand-eye coordination. 4. The speed-turn drill: A defensive back starts at the line of scrimmage, backpedals 5 yards, runs forward 5 yards and then is told to run in a certain direction. At about 15 yards, the defensive back is asked to look up and locate a football. What kind of ball skills do you have? The speed-turn drill gives an indication. 5. Three-cone drill: Three cones are placed in an L shape. Players go 5 yards to the first cone and back, then to the second cone and back and then run a loop around the third cone, switch direction and come back around the second cone. Got all that? A shifty running back/wide receiver can usually do a three-cone drill in 6.5-7.0 seconds. 1. Vontaze Burfict, LB, Arizona State: He’ll be answering a lot of questions this week. Nothing criminal off the field to address, just a bunch of lingering question marks about his behavior, smarts, and judgment. Some teams won’t even have him on their boards. 2. Chris Rainey, RB, Florida: A speed demon and a track star, sure, but a big character question mark, too. Rainey was arrested in 2010 and charged with aggravated stalking. According to Gainesville Police, Rainey sent the woman he dated on and off for three years a text message that read \\"Time to die, b----\\" after leaving her home. So, yeah, there’s that. 3. Janoris Jenkins, CB, North Alabama: The third-rated cornerback on a lot of pundits’ boards, Jenkins will be asked about his time at Florida and his eventual dismissal from the team last season. Booted from the squad for being caught with marijuana, some teams will want to go beyond the game tape on Jenkins this week. 4. Michael Floyd, WR, Notre Dame: It’s rare you see the words “character red flags” and Notre Dame in the same sentence, but Michael Floyd will be forced to address multiple off-the-field issues this week, Floyd had three separate alcohol-related offenses, including a March 2011 arrest on a drunken-driving charge, in a three-year span at South Bend. 5. Janzen Jackson, DB, McNeese State: Considered the top defensive back on the roster heading into the Vols’ 2011 season, Jackson was dismissed from the team in late August for off-the-field offenses. Jackson, a second-team All-Southeastern Conference performer while at Tennesseee, battled substance-abuse issues during his time in Knoxville and eventually was dismissed after failing to live up to coach Derek Dooley’s zero-tolerance policy. 1. St. Louis Rams: The Rams hold a lot of the cards in this year’s draft. With the second pick overall and no need for a quarterback, look for St. Louis to trade down with a team in hot pursuit of either Robert Griffin III or Andrew Luck. With success and quarterback-starved teams in Miami, Washington and Cleveland, look for St. Louis to fetch a rich combo of young players and picks for that second selection. 2. Cleveland Browns: It’s a commonly held belief around the league’s media circles that the Browns are going to make an aggressive move for Griffin. I’m not so sure about that. Brad Childress was just hired as offensive coordinator, Pat Shurmur’s a West Coast offense guy and Griffin’s not that kind of quarterback. With the Browns holding the fourth pick and Atlanta’s selection at 22nd overall, it’ll be interesting to see the moves they make in the first round. A guy to watch for the Browns? Ryan Tannehill, the Texas A&M quarterback prospect. 3. Cincinnati Bengals: Thanks to the Carson Palmer trade, the Bengals not only have their own pick (the 21st), but the Raiders’ 17th overall selection, too. 4. New England Patriots: The Patriots have four of the first 63 picks. With New Orleans’ first rounder and Oakland’s second, in addition to their own first- and second-round picks, New England has a lot of juice in the first two rounds. Traditionally a team to trade down and stockpile picks, do the Patriots package a few of their selections and move up into the first half of the first round this go-around? 5. Seattle Seahawks: If Tannehill’s still on the board when the Seahawks are on the clock, it will be very interesting to see whether Pete Carroll rolls the dice on a quarterback with just a year-and-a-half of real college quarterback experience. Find coverage of the 2012 Senior Bowl at As much as the combine can highlight the best physical qualities of certain players, it can put a spotlight on the shortcomings of others. Here are five accomplished college players who might not “wow” at the combine: 1. Kellen Moore, QB, Boise State: The NCAA all-time wins record holder, Moore failed to wow scouts at the Senior Bowl and has question marks about his size and arm strength. He also looks about 11 years old. Will he be a leader at the next level? Is he Drew Brees or just another great college quarterback who makes little impact at the next level? 2. Case Keenum, QB, Houston: In a similar vein as Moore, Keenum’s a familiar name who might slip further than most fans would expect. The sixth-year senior out of Houston, Keenum came back from a devastating knee injury to shatter NCAA records and lead Houston to the Ticket City Bowl last season. Is that knee up to snuff? Are his best days behind him? 3. Brandon Weeden, QB, Oklahoma State: The scouts I speak with love Weeden. The obvious red flag is his age. At 28, he’s not exactly a spring chicken. Is that necessarily a bad thing? Danny Watkins was 26 years old and went in the first round last year. The argument, there, was that he was a fresh 26 — the body of a 20-something, with the maturity of a man. Can the same be said for Weeden? Or is the guy who was traded from the Yankees to the Dodgers for Kevin Brown — yes, that Kevin Brown — just too damn old to draft with an early round pick? 4. Rueben Randle, WR, LSU: One of the biggest high-school recruits of the ’09 class, Randle never put up big numbers at LSU. Was that a reflection of him not living up to expectations or did he play in an offense that hardly focused on the pass? Scouts will have their eyes peeled on Randle, a guy several NFL draftniks were surprised declared for the draft and left school early. 5. Jared Crick, DE/DT, Nebraska: No player benefited from Ndamukong Suh double and triple teams two years ago quite like Crick. The past two years, though, the Nebraska defensive lineman has seen his production dip. A result of various injuries? Or was he merely the benefactor of Suh’s dominance in 2009? 1. Robert Griffin III puts on an absolute show in Indy, sizes up at 6-2 and makes a lot of quarterback-hungry teams think long and hard about their quarterback draft boards. 2. Griffin’s Baylor teammate, wideout Kendall Wright, solidifies himself as a first-round selection with an outstanding workout. He's only 5-11, so there are questions about Wright’s size. With outstanding hands, balance, speed and route running ability, he’ll emerge as a first-round prospect in Indy. 3. Talk of Alabama All-American Dre Kirkpatrick making the move from cornerback to safety will heat up after the combine this weekend. With outstanding size and skills and a draft devoid of many premier safety prospects, Kirkpatrick might make more sense as a safety than a corner. 4. Cordy Glenn, the 6-5, 350-pound guard out of Georgia, will show off a surprising athletic ability and dominate the strength drills. He’ll solidify himself as a top-20 pick this week. Versatile, smart, and dynamic — he could jump into the top 10. 5. Zach Brown, the North Carolina linebacker, will leave scouts dragging their jaws off the carpet after his 40-yard dash. It’s rare that you see linebackers run 4.4 40s. Brown will do just that, solidifying his status as a first-rounder.

Yahoo Serious has talked.","response":"To determine if we can draw the conclusion that \\"Yahoo Serious has talked\\", here are the steps I will consider: 1. Review the given information about Yahoo Serious. 2. Examine the roles and responsibilities of an actor, director, and score composer. 3. Make inferences based on the findings. Step 1: Analyzing the given information - Born on 27 July 1953 as Greg Gomez Pead - Changed his name to Yahoo Serious in 1980 - Australian film actor, director, and score composer - Best known for his 1988 film \\"Young Einstein\\" - Created \\"Reckless Kelly\\" in 1993 and \\"Mr. Accident\\" in 2000 - Writes, directs, produces, stars in, and composes scores for his movies Step 2: Examining the roles and responsibilities in the film industry - An actor is required to perform and communicate emotions through dialogue, facial expressions, and body language. - A director is responsible for guiding actors, discussing lines, and conducting meetings with the cast and crew, which necessitates effective communication skills. - A score composer is not directly required to talk during their work, but collaborating with others on a project often involves some level of verbal communication. Step 3: Making inferences based on findings Considering that Yahoo Serious is an actor and director, it is quite reasonable to infer that he has talked. Acting typically requires delivering lines, and directing involves communicating with others during the filmmaking process.

My intention is to create a negative review for this movie. Step 2: Provide a brief synopsis of the movie \\"Disaster Hour\\" follows a group of friends who set out on a vacation when they find themselves amid a series of catastrophic events, trying to survive and save the world from imminent doom and chaos. Step 3: Discuss the movie's cast and their performances The first aspect that warrants criticism is the ensemble cast, which includes some promising actors. Unfortunately, their talents are grossly underutilized in \\"Disaster Hour\\". The lead actors, John Doe and Jane Smith, became mere caricatures of their potential selves. Their subpar performances seem like a result of either weak direction or an inadequate understanding of their characters. Step 4: Analyze the plot One of the most disappointing aspects of \\"Disaster Hour\\" is its plot. It unfolds in a predictable and clichéd manner, leaving very little for the audience to be excited about. Every development can be seen from a mile away, and, as a consequence, the storyline fails to evoke any sense of thrill or surprise. The movie attempts to tap into every known disaster trope, diluting its overall impact instead of building tension. Step 5: Bring up the visual effects and cinematography Even though the film advertises itself as having groundbreaking visual effects, it falls flat in delivering impressive scenes. The CGI is often unconvincing and takes away from the viewing experience. In contrast, the cinematography is far from memorable, using bland shots that do nothing to heighten the story's emotional connection or intensity. Step 6: Comment on the directing, pacing, and other shortcomings The direction lacks vision and clarity, resulting in a haphazardly put-together film that leaves viewers feeling indifferent. The pacing is one of the biggest issues: the movie drags in several places and rushes through what could have been interesting moments, never quite maintaining the right balance. The film also suffers from severe lack of character development, making it difficult for the audience to care about the characters' fate and decisions. Step 7: Conclude the review with a summarizing statement In conclusion, \\"Disaster Hour\\" fails to live up to its potential on multiple fronts. The talented cast is hampered by a lackluster script, clichéd plot devices, and poor direction, while the visuals underwhelm. The movie misses the mark on crucial elements of pacing and character development, resulting in a forgettable and chaotic cinematic experience."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Given this review: \\"Aaah WHY THIS GAME IS ALWAYS CRASHED?!!

Article: BEIJING, Sept. 29 (Xinhua) -- Commander-in-chief of China's manned space program Chang Wanquan announced Thursday night that the launch of Tiangong-1 space lab module is successful. China's first space lab module Tiangong-1 blasted off at 9:16 p.m. Beijing Time (1316 GMT) Thursday from Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest desert area. The unmanned module, carried by Long March-2FT1 rocket, will test space docking with a spacecraft later this year, _ the way for China to become the third country in the world to operate a permanent space station around 2020. The Tiangong-1 will orbit the Earth for about one month to await Shenzhou-8 unmanned spacecraft. Once the two vehicles successfully rendezvous , they will conduct the first space docking at a height of 340 kilometers above Earth surface. After two docking tests, Tiangong-1 will await Shenzhou-9 and Shenzhou-10 in the next two years, according to a plan of China's manned space program. The 8.5-tonne Tiangong-1, with a length of 10.4 meters and maximum diameter of 3.35 meters, provides a room of 15 cubic meters for two to three astronauts to live and work. Zhang Shancong, deputy chief designer of the Tiangong-1, told Xinhua that the module carries special cameras which will take hyperspectral images of China's vast farmlands to detect heavy metal pollution and pesticide residue as well as plant disease. Moreover, scientists on the ground will also conduct experiments on photonic crystal , a new material expected to revolutionize information technology, in the low-gravity environment inside the Tiangong-1 as these experiments would be extremely difficult to conduct on Earth's surface. \\"China is clearly becoming a global power and its investments in areas like technology and space exploration reflect this,\\" said Peter Singer, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Brookings Institution. \\"It is a natural result of the growth in political and economic power and is to be expected,\\" said Zhou Jianping, chief designer of China's manned space program,...

The Jets would get on the board with kicker Mike Nugent getting a 35-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Cleveland responded with Anderson completing a 4-yard TD pass to WR Braylon Edwards. The Jets would reply with Nugent kicking a 41-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, the Browns increased their lead with kicker Phil Dawson getting a 49-yard field goal. New York would creep closer with QB Kellen Clemens getting a 1-yard TD run (with a failed 2-point conversion), while Nugent kicked a 38-yard field goal. However, Cleveland sealed the win with Lewis getting a 31-yard touchdown. The Jets would end the game with Nugent nailing a 35-yard field goal.

Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter. and the situation: Croatia and Italy were two countries of similar size and population located on opposite shores of the same sea. Croatia based its economy on tourism and fishing, while Italy based its economy on conventional agriculture. Both countries had thriving economies, but they both polluted the sea in different ways. Answer the following question: Which country caused the formation of fewer dead zones? Answer:","response":"Based on the given background and situation, it is likely that Croatia caused the formation of fewer dead zones compared to Italy. Croatia's economy is primarily based on tourism and fishing, which typically generate less pollution in the form of agricultural, livestock, and human waste. These waste materials are the primary sources of oxygen-depleting chemicals that lead to hypoxia and the formation of dead zones. In contrast, Italy's economy relies on conventional agriculture, which typically involves the use of fertilizers and chemicals. These substances can easily enter water bodies, such as rivers and eventually the ocean, leading to a higher concentration of hazardous pollutants. The agriculture-generated waste in Italy ultimately contributes to more instances of hypoxia and the creation of dead zones in the shared sea. However, it is important to note that both countries contribute to marine pollution in different ways, and neither is completely free from causing harm to the environment. Marine debris, such as litter from tourism and fishing practices in Croatia, also has negative impacts on the marine ecosystem, although it may not directly contribute to the formation of dead zones."},{"question":"Triple: Antwerp International Airport OPERATING_ORGANISATION Flemish Government; Antwerp International Airport ELEVATION 12.0 What is a sentence that describes this triple?","response":"The Antwerp International Airport, which is operated by the Flemish Government, has an elevation of 12.0 meters."},{"question":"Question: Remy leaves one in a better mood after kissing her boyfriend on the lips.

The United Kingdom, one of the very few stable nations with a functioning government, is deluged by asylum seekers fleeing the chaos and war which have taken hold around the world. In response, the UK has become a militarized police state as British government forces round up and detain immigrants. Theo Faron, a former activist turned cynical bureaucrat, is kidnapped by the Fishes, a militant immigrants' rights group. They are led by Theo's estranged wife, Julian Taylor, from whom he separated after their son Dylan's death during a 2008 flu pandemic. Julian offers Theo money to acquire transit papers for a young refugee named Kee, which Theo obtains from his cousin Nigel, a government minister who runs a state-sponsored collection of salvaged art from around the world. The transit papers require that the bearer must be accompanied, so Theo agrees to escort Kee in exchange for a large sum. Luke, a Fishes member, drives them and former midwife Miriam towards the coast to a boat. They are ambushed by an armed gang, and Julian is killed. Luke kills two police officers who stop their car, and they bury Julian in the forest as Theo breaks down crying over her death, as the group ditches their car for another to escape to a Fishes safe house. Kee reveals to Theo that she is pregnant, as Julian had told her to trust only Theo.

In how many days they together will do the same work? Options: (A) 1 (B) 6 (C) 7 (D) 5 (E) 43 Now, let's think a bit. Some random thoughts:","response":"To find out how many days A and B will take to complete the work together, we can use the formula for combined work rates. The work rate of A is 1/10 (as A completes one work in 10 days), and the work rate of B is 1/15 (as B completes one work in 15 days). Then, we can add their individual work rates to find out their combined work rate: Combined work rate: (1/10) + (1/15) To add these fractions, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 10 and 15, which is 30. Therefore, let's rewrite the fractions with a common denominator of 30: (3/30) + (2/30) Adding these fractions, we have: (3/30) + (2/30) = (3+2)/30 = 5/30 = 1/6 So, their combined work rate is 1/6. This means they complete one work in 6 days.

On the left-hand side (LHS), we have two terms containing g: -646g and -831g. Let's combine these terms: LHS = (-646 - 831) * g = -1477 * g = -1477g On the right-hand side (RHS), we have two terms containing g, -458g and 1383g. Let's combine these terms too: RHS =(-458 + 1383) * g + 33628 = 925 * g + 33628 = 925g + 33628 Now, the given equation becomes: -1477g = 925g + 33628 Step 2: Move all terms containing g to one side of the equation. To isolate g, we will move the 925g term from RHS to LHS by subtracting 925g from both sides of the equation: -1477g - 925g = 33628 Combine the terms containing g on the LHS: (-1477 - 925) * g = -2402 * g = -2402g Now, the equation becomes: -2402g = 33628 Step 3: Solve for g by dividing both sides by the coefficient of g, which is -2402. g = 33628 / -2402 g ≈ -14 So the solution to the equation -646*g - 831*g = -458*g + 1383*g + 33628 for g is g ≈ -14."},{"question":"Article:The Reds recorded an unprecedented nine away wins as they finished fourth in National Two South last season. \\"One of the measures for us as a group of players is how we win on the road and how many we win on the road,\\" Churcher told BBC Radio Cornwall. \\"We've got to carry that form forward this year.\\" Churcher added: \\"If we finish anywhere near where we did last year that will be brilliant and that's a really good sentiment for the club.\\" He only took on the role a fortnight ago after Steven Larkins stepped down because of work commitments, but says their close relationship means taking over was not a difficult job. \\"We work together day in and day out at Truro College, so the transition for me to take over is pretty easy,\\" continued Churcher. \\"I did a lot of the coaching last year and Steve would just oversee it, so we sung off the same hymn sheet so it was quite a natural progression and one that I'm happy to step in and do.\\" For the latest rugby union news follow @bbcrugbyunion on Twitter.

The only notable difference between the two sentences is the titles given to Mr. Jeffrey. In the first, he's referred to as 'General Jeffrey', while in the second, he's referred to as 'Maj-Gen Jeffery'.

He found it's better to compare them if he needs to learn more about their characteristics. To make things easier, he labeled the weather of his city as char A. Then he labeled the climate of this city as char B. Once finished with learning their characteristics, Rob focused on climate change issues. For that, he labeled the climate of present time as char C and climate just before industrial revolution as char D. But I can use this background: Weather conditions include air temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and precipitation. Weather is temporary. People in many states have the joke, \\"if you don't like the weather, wait five minutes and it will change.\\" One way to change the weather is to have a different air mass move over the region. Interactions between air masses bring about a lot of weather. For example, thunderstorms and tornadoes form along a front. A front is where air masses meet. Fronts can bring about blizzards, thunderstorms, tornadoes and other types of weather. Weather prediction is much better than it was in past years. This is due in part to information from satellites. Climate is the long-term average of weather. The climate of a location depends on its latitude, position relative to the atmospheric circulation cells, position on a continent, altitude, and position relative to mountains. Areas with roughly the same climate make up a climate zone. The organisms that live within a climate zone create a unique biome. Earth's climate has changed throughout the planet's history. Earth was frigid at the end of the Pleistocene ice age, but has been warming since then. Since the Industrial Revolution the pace of warming has increased. In the past few decades the rate has really intensified. This is related to greenhouse gas emissions, primary from fossil fuel burning. The destruction of forests also increasing warming. The effects of global warming are already being seen. Treaties and voluntary actions are needed to reduce emissions to lessen the amount of global warming that will take place in the future. What is an answer for this question: Does char A represent longer or shorter time period than char B? A:","response":"Char A represents a shorter time period than char B. This is because char A refers to the weather of Rob's city, and weather is a temporary state of the atmosphere, typically varying over short periods such as minutes, hours, or days. Weather conditions include air temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and precipitation, which can change rapidly due to factors like the movement of air masses and fronts. On the other hand, char B represents the climate of Rob's city, which is the long-term average of weather conditions in a particular area. Climate takes into account weather patterns and their averages over a longer period, typically spanning across years or even decades. The climate of a location depends on factors like its latitude, position relative to atmospheric circulation cells, position on a continent, altitude, and position relative to mountains.

Smetana saw this as an opportunity to write and stage opera that would reflect Czech national character, similar to the portrayals of Russian life in Mikhail Glinka's operas. He hoped that he might be considered for the theatre's conductorship, but the post went to Jan Nepomuk Maýr, apparently because the conservative faction in charge of the project considered Smetana a \\"dangerous modernist\\", in thrall to avant garde composers such as Liszt and Wagner. Smetana then turned his attention to an opera competition, organised by Count Jan von Harrach, which offered prizes of 600 gulden each for the best comic and historical operas based on Czech culture. With no useful model on which to base his work—Czech opera as a genre scarcely existed—Smetana had to create his own style. He engaged Karel Sabina, his comrade from the 1848 barricades, as his librettist, and received Sabina's text in February 1862, a story of the 13th century invasion of Bohemia by Otto of Brandenburg. In April 1863 he submitted the score, under the title of The Brandenburgers in Bohemia. At this stage in his career, Smetana's command of the Czech language was poor. His generation of Czechs was educated in German, and he had difficulty expressing himself in what was supposedly his native tongue. To overcome these linguistic deficiencies he studied Czech grammar, and made a point of writing and speaking in Czech every day. He had become Chorus Master of the nationalistic Hlahol Choral Society soon after his return from Sweden, and as his fluency in the Czech language developed he composed patriotic choruses for the Society; The Three Riders and The Renegade were performed at concerts in early 1863. In March of that year Smetana was elected president of the music section of Umělecká Beseda, a society for Czech artists. By 1864 he was proficient enough in the Czech language to be appointed as music critic to the main Czech language newspaper..., what would be the answer ? Answer:","response":"The answer is: Smetana had become Chorus Master of the nationalistic Hlahol Choral Society after returning from Sweden."},{"question":"Q:I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

With this information, Michael asks Torgo to let him and his family stay the night, despite objections from both Torgo and Margaret.Inside the home, the family sees a disturbing painting of a dark, malevolent-looking man and a black dog with glowing eyes; the man it depicts is the Master. Margaret becomes frightened upon hearing an ominous howl; Michael investigates, retrieving a flashlight and revolver from his car, and later finds Peppy lying dead on the ground. Torgo reveals his attraction to Margaret and tells her that, although she is doomed to become yet another bride of The Master, he intends to keep her for himself.

The premise states that the vehicle in question is a \\"Victorian steamer Gondola,\\" implying that the Gondola is an older, Victorian-era vessel powered by steam, not petroleum. While it is possible that some Gondolas on lakes are powered by petroleum, the specific Gondola mentioned in the premise is not. The Victorian era (1837 - 1901) was a period of great innovation and change in terms of transportation technology. While steam power was the dominant form of energy for vehicles on land and water, the use of petroleum (and its derivatives for powering engines) was still in its early stages. Steam-powered engines generally relied on the combustion of coal or wood to heat water and generate steam, which would then drive the engine's pistons, generating the motion necessary to propel the vehicle. The Gondola mentioned in the premise is a Victorian steamer or a steam-powered vessel from this era, possibly designed with a paddlewheel propulsion system and a steam engine. This style of Gondola lacks any reference to using petroleum as a power source, which is a more contemporary approach to fueling engines. Additionally, utilizing petroleum as a fuel source would not have been representative of the Victorian period Gondola and could potentially disregard the historical accuracy and the authentic experience that the vessel may provide to passengers. In summary, based solely on the premise given, we cannot support the hypothesis that the Gondolas on the lakes are powered by petroleum. The Victorian steamer Gondola, as described, would likely be powered by steam rather than petroleum, aligning with the technology and practices during the Victorian era. While it is not impossible that other Gondolas on lakes are petroleum-powered, the specific Gondola mentioned in the premise is not."},{"question":"please contact us, if you have problems or questions regarding your conference call.

Answer:","response":"The design on the New England Patriots' 50-yard line is a combination of multiple elements that represent the team's identity and the NFL as a whole. It is important to note that the specific design may vary slightly depending on the particular season, special events, or changes in branding. However, there are a few key characteristics that can generally be found in the design at the 50-yard line of the Patriots' home field, Gillette Stadium, in Foxborough, Massachusetts. 1. NFL Shield Logo: Positioned at the exact center of the 50-yard line, you will find the NFL Shield Logo. This iconic emblem is widely recognized and represents the National Football League. The shield features a gridiron football, eight stars symbolizing the league's eight divisions, and the letters \\"NFL\\" placed prominently in the center. The NFL Shield Logo is present on every team's field in the league to signify the unity and professional affiliation of the teams. 2. The Flying Elvis: Another prominent design element found at the Patriots' 50-yard line encompasses the team's primary logo, known as the \\"Flying Elvis.\\" This modern depiction of a minuteman or patriot features a silver, stylized face with a prominent red, white, and blue tricorn hat. The tricorn hat's distinctive design includes a flowing, elongated tail behind the head, which resembles a stylized stripe. The Flying Elvis logo has been the official logo for the New England Patriots since 1993, when it replaced the original logo known as \\"Pat Patriot.\\" 3. Field Markings: Surrounding the NFL Shield Logo and the Flying Elvis are important field markings that help to create a visually defined space for gameplay. The 50-yard line is marked by a line that runs across the width of the field, bisecting it into two equal halves. The field markings also consist of yardage numbers placed on either side of the field at 10-yard increments, hash marks, and team-specific end zones, which showcase the team's name and additional thematic designs, colors, and branding. 4. Special Event and Commemorative Designs: Occasionally, you may find additional design elements on the Patriots' 50-yard line during special events or commemorations. For example, the team may use a custom design to celebrate milestones, anniversaries, or championship seasons. In recent years, they have added the Super Bowl LIII Championship logo at the 50-yard line, acknowledging the team's victory during the 2018 season. In conclusion, the design on the New England Patriots' 50-yard line is a diverse mixture of elements that encapsulates the identity and spirit of the team, as well as their connection to the NFL. The combination of the NFL Shield Logo, The Flying Elvis, field markings, and occasional special event designs create a unique visual experience that showcases their presence and accomplishments in professional football."},{"question":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Context: Manny had Bob Marley cranking on the stereo, his van was full of passengers, and the air conditioning was working after a long week of giving him trouble. The sun beat down on the wet-looking asphalt road that ran along the harbor, next to the concrete waterfront. It curved along in front of the brightly colored Dutch Colonial warehouses of Charlotte Amalie, which were now converted restaurants and jewel shops. Tourists in day-glo shirts and daubs of sunscreen rubbed over peeling skin crowded both sides of the waterfront road. Manny slowed somewhat, keeping an eye on them. On the sidewalk by the shops a tall black man stood by a food cart. The hand-painted wooden sign hanging from the cart's side had faded letters. The man wore a grand suit with tails, like an orchestra conductor, and a top hat perched on his shaved head. A cigar burned in his mouth. For a brief second he held Manny's attention. Then the food cart's owner stepped forward and the strangely dressed man disappeared. Manny looked at the other side of the road. A white girl with oval shaped sunglasses and pink leather pants stepped off the sidewalk into the road in front of his van. He slammed on the brakes, trying to dodge her, but the van couldn't respond that fast. Her ponytail flew up towards the windshield and her head struck the star-shaped hood ornament. She bounced along the asphalt. Manny weaved the van to a stop, with swearing from the passengers in the back. He opened the door and stepped out into the heat.

The workers got along well, said Caren Halbfinger of the county health department. “These are all professionals who are used to responding to emergencies,” she said. But at each cooling tower, they took two samples, she said: one for the city and one for the state. Differing city and state responses to the outbreak were on display Monday as Mayor Bill de Blasio and Gov. Andrew Cuomo, both Democrats, spoke at separate, simultaneous news conferences, where each touted his administration’s response to the outbreak but declined to comment on the other’s. Two more people died from Legionnaires’ disease, officials said Monday, and additional sites tested positive for the bacterium that causes the disease. The death count is now 12, up from 10 this weekend, and the total number of cases is 113. Mr. de Blasio said two more sites tested positive for the bacterium, while Mr. Cuomo identified three, which he said were outside the “impact area that was initially tested.” At the end of the day, the state and city said 18 sites tested positive for the bacterium, both in and outside the impact zone. The city had sent 46,600 robocalls to households, Mr. de Blasio said. A spokesman for Mr. Cuomo on Monday said that the state had canvassed more than 500 buildings and people Sunday and 1,500 Monday. State workers also distributed a state-produced flier with facts about the disease—distinct from the flier that city health department workers had distributed earlier. Mr. de Blasio declined to comment on the state’s response to the outbreak. Mr. Cuomo, answering questions after a criminal justice-related news conference, declined to comment on the city’s. “I am not in a position to comment on what the city has done,” he said. Both agreed that cooling towers, which have been blamed for the outbreak, should be regulated, and both had different plans to do so. Mr. de Blasio pushed City Council legislation, which he said would pass Thursday. “The City of New York obviously takes responsibility for our own people,” he said. “We’re going to pass the rules and laws we need to pass.” He added: “We’re not sure when Albany is going to treat the matter.” Mr. Cuomo said the state would regulate the buildings and that such regulation wouldn’t require legislative approval. Asked how his approach would differ from the city’s, he said, “I don’t know what the city’s protocol is, so I don’t know how it would be different.” The mayor and governor’s offices had a fight Friday night after remarks that an aide to the mayor made questioning the state’s response to Legionnaire’s disease, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Cuomo was upset and made it known to the mayor’s office, these people said. Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr. issued his own statement, which noted that he proposed legislation last month. “When it became clear that such outbreaks of Legionnaires’ disease could be prevented through regular inspections, I proposed that the City Council move to create such legislation as quickly as possible,” he said. Meanwhile, those in the Bronx said there remained continual worry about the disease and the official response. “If this was the Upper East Side, this wouldn’t be an issue,” said Ed Garcia Conde, a local activist and blogger. A spokeswoman for City Councilwoman Vanessa Gibson, who represents affected Bronx neighborhoods, said she was concerned that differing numbers and information could cause wider worry among residents. Teams from both the state and city tested cooling towers in the Bronx over the weekend. Thirty-nine buildings in the affected area of the South Bronx have a cooling tower of the type associated with this outbreak, city officials said. Mr. Cuomo said Sunday that the state that day would test 62 buildings at the city’s request. Both Mr. Cuomo and Mr. de Blasio said they were collaborating on the testing. City officials had targeted the Opera House Hotel as a likely place where the disease originated, a senior official said. Tests were due back later this week, the official said. Of the 12 who have died of the disease, 11 were older adults with existing conditions, while one person was under 40. The last day someone became sick with Legionnaires’ was Aug. 3, which shows the outbreak continues to taper off, Mr. de Blasio said. City and state officials Monday identified 11 sites that tested positive for the bacteria in what they are now calling the impact zone: Concourse Plaza, the Opera House Hotel, Lincoln Medical Center, Streamline Plastics Co., two courthouses, a Verizon building, a nursing home, a post office, a Department of Homeless Services intake center and a high school. An additional four buildings are outside of this zone: another Verizon building, a police department, and buildings at 1201 Lafayette Ave. and 230 East 123rd St. —Erica Orden contributed to this article.

Options: - answering questions - talk too much - teach children - to start lunch - open boxes Let's think step by step:","response":"1. Answering questions: It is unlikely that answering questions would prompt a teacher to yell at her students as it is a normal part of the learning process. 2. Talk too much: This could be a possible reason for the teacher to yell, as excessive talking can be disruptive to the class and the learning process. 3. Teach children: This is the main role of a teacher, so it is highly improbable that this would prompt her to yell at her students. 4. To start lunch: While it may be possible that the teacher wanted to move on to lunch, it is an unlikely reason for her to yell at her students. 5. Open boxes: This reason doesn't seem relevant to a typical classroom scenario or a reason for a teacher to yell at her students. Therefore, the most likely situation that prompted the teacher to yell at her students is that they were talking too much, creating a disruptive environment."},{"question":"Given the question: You are considering whether to buy a product.

So do markets. Perhaps the most disturbing aspect of Lehman Brothers' (nyse: LEH - news - people ) fall is that it comes almost seven years to the day after 9/11. That day was supposed to teach us humility. The fall of Lehman, coming six months after the collapse of Bear Stearns and coupled with Merrill Lynch's (nyse: MER - news - people ) disappearance as an independent company, are the result of a complete lack of humility on the part of those executives charged with leading the world's most important purveyors of capital in the post-9/11 world. For all the talk of pulling together in the wake of the terrorist attacks that shook America to the core and that supposedly set our priorities straight, Wall Street rushed headlong back to its mindless pursuit of profits and speculation without consideration for the consequences of its actions. Now, the chickens have come home to roost. In April 2008, our firm, Hegemony Capital Management, published a controversial essay entitled \\"How to Fix It,\\" in which we outlined our (unsolicited) recommendations for how to correct the excesses that led to the credit crisis that began in mid-2007 and brought us to these historic days.

Click here for a free trial of Forbes-Lehmann Income Securities Investor with new recommended buys of bank preferred stocks offering double-digit yields. Our key recommendations, which seemed much more radical in April than they do today, were the following: --Improve financial industry regulation and replace substance over form in the regulation we have. --Place absolute leverage limitations on financial institutions at much lower levels than the 30:1 levels that led to this crisis. --Place an absolute limitation on hedge fund leverage. --Regulate Wall Street compensation by basing it on multiple years' performance, adding claw-backs and high-water marks and limit cash compensation that weakens these firms' balance sheets. --Tax private equity firms' carried interests at ordinary interest rates rather than capital gains rates and restrict private equity firms' ability to go public. --Re-institute the uptick rule with respect to short selling. Finally, we made the point that too much economic activity in the U.S. was aimed at speculation rather than production. For example, the equity markets are increasingly dominated by quantitative investment strategies that are driven by considerations that are totally divorced from considerations of fundamental value. At the same time, the credit markets are increasingly utilized to finance change-of-control transactions for private equity firms that are done simply because low-cost financing is available, not because a project is going to add to the productive capacity or capital account of the nation. As we wrote in that April issue, \\"At some point, society has to figure out that the way an investor earns his money is even more important than the amount of money he makes. This is why human beings were vested with moral sentiments, so they could distinguish the quality of human conduct from the quantity of its results.\\" These changes cannot and will not be effected simply by legislative fiat. It is incumbent upon the gatekeepers of capital, the fiduciaries that make the decisions about allocating capital, to bring discipline to the system. This will require a rethinking of their priorities and a willingness to add to their investment calculus considerations that exceed their own narrow interests about short-term investment returns.

Our system requires a new concept of fiduciary duty that encompasses systemic as well as single-firm interests, and that focuses to a greater degree on risk-adjusted returns than raw numerical returns. Obviously the forces that led to current events have been building for many years, and the changes needed to fix the system will not be made overnight, but we should not let this occasion pass to reflect on what has occurred. It is clear to us that the Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury are not underestimating the enormity of the crisis. AIG (nyse: AIG - news - people ) is a much larger systemic threat than Lehman Brothers ever was, so this situation is profoundly serious. In our judgment, investors should not try to pick a bottom in today's or this week's market. The market is going to experience extraordinary volatility in the immediate future. Play the market at your own risk and only with money you can afford to lose. The indexes are heading significantly lower, as we have previously forecast. Gold, short-term U.S. Treasuries, short-term Swiss and German government paper, the Swiss franc and certain Asian currencies like the Singapore dollar are the safest places to park your cash for the moment. The U.S. dollar continues to be debased (less against the euro, which remains compromised, than against Asian currencies and the Swiss franc), particularly by the startling and historic decision by the Federal Reserve to accept equity securities at its discount window. If nothing else, that decision alone suggests the enormity and depth of the crisis we are facing. We never thought we'd live to see the day that the American central bank would accept equity as collateral for loans. We have to admit that took us by surprise and made us very nervous. Michael E.

Choose from: - yes - it is not possible to tell - no","response":"To determine the truth of the hypothesis \\"The rich have a head start when it comes to saving,\\" based on the given premise, we can follow these steps: 1. Analyze the premise: \\"When people compete by saving, the rich have a head start.\\" This statement suggests that in a scenario where people are competing to save money, those who are already rich have an advantage. 2. Consider the wording of the hypothesis: \\"The rich have a head start when it comes to saving.\\" This statement makes a more general claim, stating that the rich have an advantage in saving money, regardless of whether there is a competition. 3. Compare the premise and hypothesis: Both statements imply that the rich have an advantage in saving money; however, the premise specifically addresses a competitive context, while the hypothesis extends the idea to all contexts. 4. Determine if the hypothesis is true based on the premise: Since the hypothesis aligns with the basic idea presented in the premise (that the rich have an advantage in saving money), it would be reasonable to state that the hypothesis is true.

The ruling comes days after presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump called to block non-citizen Muslims from entering the U.S. following the Orlando nightclub massacre. Even before the attack, Americans were divided, mostly along party lines, on the issue of refugees from war-torn countries in the Middle East. A survey conducted in late May by the Brookings Institution found of those polled, just 38 percent of Republicans supported taking in refugees from Syria and the Middle East, compared with 77 percent of Democrats. But among Trump supporters, an overwhelming 77 percent said they oppose taking in refugees. So who are these people who cause such a divide among Americans, triggering feelings of dread and suspicion in some and feelings of empathy and hospitality in others? Millions have been forced to flee the bloody conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Libya and other Middle Eastern nations. In 1951 the United Nation's Refugee Convention defined a refugee as someone who \\"owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality, and is unable to, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country.\\" By the end of 2014, there were 19.5 million refugees worldwide, according to the United Nations, 14.4 million of whom were under the mandate of the United Nations Human Rights Council. This was an increase of 2.9 million from 2013. The remaining 5.1 million refugees were registered with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency. However, there are an estimated 59.5 million forcibly displaced persons around the world, according to United Nation's Global Trends report.

This year, Kyle can lift 60 more pounds than he could last year. 2. The amount he can lift this year is 3 times the amount he could lift last year. Let x represent the amount Kyle could lift last year. Then, we can create a simple equation to express this problem: x + 60 = 3x Now, we will solve the equation for x (the amount he could lift last year): 60 = 3x - x 60 = 2x x = 30 So, Kyle could lift 30 pounds last year. Now, we find the total weight Kyle can lift this year. Since he can lift 60 more pounds this year, we can simply add that to the weight from last year: Total weight this year = last year's weight + increase in weight Total weight this year = 30 + 60 Total weight this year = 90 pounds Conclusion: Kyle can now lift a total of 90 pounds."},{"question":"Ancak kısa bir süre önce deneyimli gazeteci ve akademisyen Cengiz Çandar tarafından kaleme alınan ve Türkiye Ekonomik ve Sosyal Etüdler Vakfı (TESEV) tarafından yayınlanan, \\"Dağdan İniş: PKK nasıl silah bırakır?\\" adlı raporda, KCK'nın yapısı ve ideolojisi ayrıntılı bir şekilde ele alınıyor.

This report, published by the Turkish Economic and Social Studies Foundation (TESEV), carries the title \\"Descent from the Mountain: How does the PKK lay down arms?\\", and it focuses on a deep-dive analysis of the KCK's structure and ideology. The report is significant because the KCK (Kurdistan Communities Union) is a political grouping with significant influence and the PKK (The Kurdistan Workers' Party) is a prominent armed organization operating within the regions of Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Syria, both representing a faction of the Kurdish political movement that champions the rights and self-determination of the Kurdish people in the region. This report thus potentially provides important insights into their operations, ideology, and potential mechanisms for ceasefire and disarmament. Cengiz Çandar, the author of the report, is a highly regarded journalist and academic, implying that the report will be meticulous and credible. The Turkish Economic and Social Studies Foundation (TESEV), who published the report, is an influential and independent Turkish think-tank, focusing on issues related to democratization and social development. Therefore, the publication of this report by TESEV adds to its overall importance and relevance. In conclusion, this piece of text announces the publication of a crucial report that thoroughly investigates the ideology and structure of the KCK, aiming to provide insights and potentially inform strategies for PKK's disarmament. The significance of the report is elevated by the reputation of its author, Cengiz Çandar, and its publisher, TESEV."},{"question":"Article: When the swim season began, my 11-year-old daughter, Elizabeth, and I cut a deal. She would go to practice three times a week and try really hard, and I wouldn't make her compete in the swim meets because on the day of a meet, she would be nervous all day. Her nerves rooted from the possibility that she would do something horribly wrong and let everyone down. Recently, they had a T-shirt relay, which works like this: one person from each relay team puts on a T-shirt and a pair of socks, swims 50 meters, and gets out of the pool. She takes off the clothes and puts them on the next person, who then swims 50 meters. This continues until everyone on the team has completed a lap. By the last leg, Elizabeth's team had built up a moderate lead. Then it was Elizabeth's turn to swim. She seemed to swim faster in the T-shirt and socks than when she wasn't wearing them. Approaching the halfway mark, she was still in the lead. Then one of Elizabeth's socks fell off and was floating in the pool. \\"She has to get that sock on before the end of the race,\\" a swimming official told her team, \\"or you will be disqualified.\\" Everybody on her team started screaming, \\"Elizabeth! Elizabeth! Stop! Get the sock!\\" But she couldn't hear them. As she started her last 25 meters, a girl in Lane 2 was gaining on Elizabeth. It was time for desperate measures. A girl on my daughter's team jumped in the pool, grabbed the sock, and swam after Elizabeth. She grabbed Elizabeth's foot. \\"You have to put the sock on,\\" the girl screamed. Elizabeth continued swimming while her teammate put on the sock. By now, the girl in Lane 2 was about to pass Elizabeth. With the sock finally on, Elizabeth swam her heart out for the last 15 meters. It was close, but Elizabeth beat the other girl to the wall for the victory. On the ride home, she relived her moment of glory again and again. She told me that if the T-shirt relay was an Olympic event, her team would win the gold medal. I told her that in my professional opinion, she was absolutely right.

One day, Greg decided to start reading about natural selection. His friend Frank decided to read more about populations that displayed natural selection more sparingly. They both learned lots of new interesting facts. and a hint : New species develop naturally through the process of natural selection . Due to natural selection, organisms with traits that better enable them to adapt to their environment will tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers. Natural selection causes beneficial heritable traits to become more common in a population and unfavorable heritable traits to become less common. For example, a giraffe’s neck is beneficial because it allows the giraffe to reach leaves high in trees. Natural selection caused this beneficial trait to become more common than short necks. Please answer this question : Which friend learned less about animals that reproduce in greater numbers? A:","response":"To answer the question, let's first summarize what Greg and Frank studied: - Greg studied natural selection. - Frank studied populations that displayed natural selection more sparingly.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"Insect respiration is accomplished without lungs. Instead, the insect respiratory system uses a system of internal tubes and sacs through which gases either diffuse or are actively pumped, delivering oxygen directly to tissues that need it via their trachea (element 8 in numbered diagram). Since oxygen is delivered directly, the circulatory system is not used to carry oxygen, and is therefore greatly reduced. The insect circulatory system has no veins or arteries, and instead consists of little more than a single, perforated dorsal tube which pulses peristaltically. Toward the thorax, the dorsal tube (element 14) divides into chambers and acts like the insect's heart. The opposite end of the dorsal tube is like the aorta of the insect circulating the hemolymph, arthropods' fluid analog of blood, inside the body cavity.:61–65 Air is taken in through openings on the sides of the abdomen called spiracles.\\"? The answer to this question is:","response":"Based on this passage, there are multiple possible questions that can be framed to test the comprehension and analytical ability of students. Here are few suggestions: 1. \\"How does the insect respiratory system function without lungs?\\" Students should explain that the insect respiratory system works through an internal network of tubes and sacs. Gases either diffuse or are actively pumped through these systems, therefore delivering oxygen directly to the tissues that need it through their trachea. 2. \\"What role does the circulatory system play in the respiration process in insects?\\" The insect’s circulatory system is not used to carry oxygen and is thus greatly reduced. Due to the direct delivery of oxygen to the tissues, the insect's circulatory system does not possess veins or arteries, but consists of a perforated dorsal tube. 3. \\"What structures function similar to the heart and the aorta in the insect circulatory system and what are their roles?\\" The dorsal tube in the thorax region of the insect acts like the heart and the opposite end functions like the aorta. The dorsal tube divides into chambers acting like the insect's heart and the opposite end circulates the hemolymph, arthropods' fluid analog of blood, inside the body cavity. 4. \\"Describe the function and structure of an insect's circulatory system as outlined in the passage.\\" This should entail an explanation about there being no veins or arteries present in insect's circulatory system and detail how it consists mainly of a single, perforated dorsal tube. This tube divides into chambers towards the thorax and acts like the insect's heart. The other end is similar to the aorta, circulating 'hemolymph', the blood analogue in arthropods, within the body cavity. 5. \\"How do insects intake air for respiration?\\" According to the passage, insects take in air for respiration through the spiracles, which are openings located on the sides of an insect’s abdomen. These questions test the students' understanding of the insect respiratory and circulatory system, the role of different components, as well as the way in which oxygen is transported to tissues. Every answer must be supported by evidence from the passage to ensure that students are not using any information from outside the given text. The answers should also demonstrate the students’ ability to understand and analyze scientific text."},{"question":"Read the article and select the best answer. Article: To live forever was the dream of many emperors in ancient China.People were ordered to call them Wansui,which means 10,000 years,but no human could live that long.How long can humans really live? According to the latest scientific discovery,humans are able to live up to the age of 120 or perhaps even longer. Several recent studies showed that our life span can be extended far beyond normal limits.Cynthia Kenyon,a professor at the University of California in San Francisco doubled the life of a worm from two weeks to a month.By changing the function of a single gene,known as daf-2,the scientist not only added extra days to the worm's life but also kept it a healthy as worms which were half its age. There are two similar genes in the bodies of mammals.By changing the function of on gene,scientists extended the life of a mouse by 1 8 per cent(or 4.5 months).Another gene is called IGF-1.Researchers still don't know how it affects our body.But by reducing its functions the life of a mouse increases by 33 per cent for 8.6 months).The average life span of a mouse is 26 months. In the experiment of extending life,an ancient saying,\\"you are what you eat.\\" also seems to be true.Vegetables contain fewer calories than meat,and help to prolong life,scientists say. Research has found that taking in fewer calories affects our lives in a similar way to reducing IGF-1. US biologist John Phelan suggests low calorie diets could increase human life span,but there is no proof yet. Researchers are still waiting for the results of a study started in 1987.Monkeys are fed with low calorie food to see what happens.A monkey's typical life span is 40 years,so there is a little while to wait.

The boy's uncle and aunt were kissing.","response":"Yes, the sentence \\"The boy's uncle and aunt were kissing\\" is both syntactically and semantically acceptable. From a syntactic perspective, the sentence follows the basic structure of a standard English sentence, comprising a subject, verb, and object. It adheres to the Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order, which is predominant in English. The subject is \\"The boy's uncle and aunt,\\" the verb is \\"were kissing,\\" and no explicit object is mentioned, but the action of kissing implies an object (each other) even if it is not explicitly stated. Specifically, the syntax can be broken down as follows: 1. \\"The boy\\" functions as a determiner phrase and modifies \\"uncle and aunt.\\" 2. The genitive \\"'s\\" (the possessive form of the noun \\"boy\\") shows the relationship between the boy and his uncle and aunt. 3. \\"Uncle and aunt\\" is a compound noun and serves as the subject of the sentence. 4. \\"Were,\\" an auxiliary verb, is used for indicating past continuous tense. 5. \\"Kissing,\\" the main verb, describes the action taking place. From a semantic perspective, the sentence is also acceptable as it conveys a clear and coherent meaning. The sentence tells us that the uncle and aunt, who are related to a specific boy, engaged in an act of kissing. The context in which this action takes place is not provided by the sentence, so we cannot infer much further information about the situation. However, the act of kissing is a common expression of affection, love, or greeting among family members or couples, depending on the culture and situation. Therefore, the sentence appears to be conveying a meaningful scenario that readers can understand."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Here is a review left by a customer on a product.

The unnamed 25-year-old victim caught a train to Birmingham from his home in London in June this year in the belief Aziz wanted to start a relationship with him. He took a seat on a bench in parkland near a fly-over in Hockley, Birmingham, expecting to meet Aziz for a date. Instead, Hussain - who has a gold tooth - appeared from behind and punched and headbutted the defenceless victim. He then held a meat cleaver to his face and demanded his phone and cash. The court heard how Aziz laughed as she watched the attack and even waded in by kicking the man in the groin. The pair later sent texts to the victim mocking him for falling for their set-up. West Midlands Police launched an investigation. The pair were found through phone and social media enquiries. They were charged with robbery and both found guilty at Birmingham Crown Court.

It derived from Congolese rumba in the 1960s and gained popularity in the 1980s in France. Although often used by journalists as a synonym for Congolese rumba, both the music and dance currently associated with soukous differ from more traditional rumba, especially in its higher tempo, longer dance sequences. Notable performers of the genre include African Fiesta, Papa Wemba and Pépé Kallé. - Canción (\\"song\\") is a popular genre of Latin American music, particularly in Cuba, where many of the compositions originate. Its roots lie in Spanish popular song forms, including tiranas, polos and boleros; also in Italian light operetta, French romanza, and the slow waltz. Initially, even when written by the creole population of Cuba, who opposed the ruling hierarchy, the music retained its European style of \\"intricate melodies, and dark, enigmatic and elaborate lyrics\\" (Orovio). - The term Afro-Cuban refers to Cubans who mostly have West African ancestry, and to historical or cultural elements in Cuba thought to emanate from this community. The term can refer to the combining of African and other cultural elements found in Cuban society such as race, religion, music, language, the arts, and class culture. - Cuba, officially the Republic of Cuba, is a country comprising the island of Cuba as well as Isla de la Juventud and several minor archipelagos. Cuba is located in the northern Caribbean where the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Atlantic Ocean meet. It is south of both the U.S. state of Florida and the Bahamas, west of Haiti, and north of Jamaica. Havana is the largest city and capital; other major cities include Santiago de Cuba and Camagüey. Cuba is the largest island in the Caribbean, with an area of , and the second-most populous after Hispaniola, with over 11 million inhabitants. - Antoine Wendo Kolosoy ( April 25 , 1925 -- July 28 , 2008 ) , known as Papa Wendo , was a Congolese musician . He is considered the \`\` Father '' of Congolese rumba , also known as soukous , a musical style blending son cubano , beguine , waltz , tango and cha - cha . - Pépé Kallé, sometimes written as Pepe Kalle (November 15 November 30 1998) was a soukous singer, musician and bandleader from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Pépé Kallé was born Kabasele Yampanya in Kinshasa (then Léopoldville) in the Belgian Congo, but later assumed his pseudonym in hommage to his mentor, Le Grand Kallé. - Son cubano is a style of music and dance that originated in Cuba and gained worldwide popularity during the 1930s. Son combines the structure and feel of the Spanish canción with Afro-Cuban traits and percussion. The Cuban son is one of the most influential and widespread forms of Latin-American music: its derivatives and fusions, including salsa, have spread across the world.

Does it follow that \\"The government never has to borrow money.\\"? Pick from: 1). yes. 2). it is not possible to tell. 3). no.","response":"3). No. The statement \\"The government never has to borrow money\\" does not necessarily follow from the given premises. To better understand why, let's dive deeper into some key concepts and factors influencing government borrowing. Governments often borrow money to finance various projects, address budget deficits, and stimulate economic growth. The main reasons for borrowing are: 1. Funding public services: Governments may need to borrow money to fund essential public services such as healthcare, education, infrastructure development, and defense. 2. Stimulating economic growth: Borrowing can help governments stimulate economic growth by investing in infrastructure projects, promoting research and development, and creating a favorable business environment. By doing so, they aim to increase the nation's productive capacity and, ultimately, boost tax revenues. 3. Managing economic downturns: During economic downturns, governments may borrow money to help stabilize the economy. This can involve increased spending on public services and social protection, as well as implementing policies and programs designed to boost employment and consumer spending. 4. Addressing budget deficits: When a government's expenses exceed its revenues, it may need to borrow money to fill the budget gap. Borrowing helps maintain government operations and public services during times of financial strain. 5. Controlling inflation: In some cases, governments may borrow money to control rising inflation rates. By issuing debt securities, governments can absorb excess liquidity from the market, limiting the amount of money available to the public and thus, slowing inflation. Despite these reasons for borrowing, there might be some instances where governments do not need to borrow money, at least in the short term. For example, governments with budget surpluses or significant financial reserves may not need to borrow to finance their expenditures. Furthermore, some countries benefit from abundant natural resources or a strong economy with high tax revenues, reducing the need for borrowing. However, to assert that \\"the government never has to borrow money\\" would overlook the complexity of economic factors and the broad range of circumstances that could necessitate government borrowing. In reality, most governments do borrow money at some point, even if it's to a lesser extent or under different circumstances than others. In conclusion, the answer is no; the statement \\"The government never has to borrow money\\" does not necessarily follow from the given premise. It is essential to consider the broad range of economic factors and circumstances that might influence a government's decision to borrow money."},{"question":"Translate to Finnish: When it comes to the issue of taxation development in Europe, the Commission has made progress on the matter of harmonising the tax base within the framework of business taxation. Finnish:","response":"Kun kyse on verotuksen kehittämisestä Euroopassa, komissio on edistynyt yritysverotuksen puitteissa veropohjan yhdenmukaistamisen osalta. Verotuksen kehitykseen Euroopassa liittyen, komissio on saavuttanut edistystä yritysverotuksen alalla toimivassa veropohjan harmonisoinnin suhteen. Tämä tarkoittaa sitä, että Euroopan komissio pyrkii yhdenmukaistamaan eri maiden verotusmenetelmiä, jotta voidaan helpottaa rajat ylittävää liiketoimintaa ja varmistaa verotuksen oikeudenmukaisuus kaikkien maiden kesken. Veropohjan yhdenmukaistaminen tarkoittaa käytännössä sitä, että eri maiden tulisi ottaa käyttöön yhteiset säännöt ja menettelytavat verotuksen perusteiden määrittelyssä. Tällöin yritysten tulisi maksaa samoja veroja samanlaisista voitoista riippumatta siitä, missä Euroopan maassa ne toimivat. Tämä vähentäisi yritysten mahdollisuuksia vältellä veroja siirtämällä varojaan matalamman verotuksen maihin, ja samalla se loisi tasavertaiset kilpailuolosuhteet kaikille yrityksille. Komissio on tehnyt useita ehdotuksia veropohjan yhdenmukaistamiseksi, kuten esimerkiksi yhteisen yhtenäistetyn yhtiöveropohjan (CCCTB) käyttöönottoa, joka luo yhden yhteisen yhtiöveropohjan EU:ssa. Tämä tarkoittaisi sitä, että kaikkien EU-alueella toimivien yritysten tulisi noudattaa samoja yhtiöverosääntöjä riippumatta siitä, missä maassa ne toimivat. Vaikka komission ehdotukset ovat herättäneet keskustelua ja ne ovat osin saaneet tukea jäsenmailta, niiden täytäntöönpano on edennyt hitaasti. Tämä johtuu osittain siitä, että verotukseen liittyvät päätökset vaativat yksimielisen hyväksynnän EU:n jäsenmaiden kesken, ja useat maat ovat huolissaan siitä, että veropohjan yhdenmukaistaminen saattaisi vaikuttaa kielteisesti niiden verotulojen määrään. Eri maiden verotulojen turvaaminen ja veropohjan yhdenmukaistaminen ovatkin tärkeitä kysymyksiä, joita tulee jatkossakin käsitellä Euroopan verotusta kehitettäessä. On tärkeää löytää tasapaino eri intressien välillä ja varmistaa, että verojärjestelmä toimii tehokkaasti ja oikeudenmukaisesti kaikkien maiden ja yritysten kannalta."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: When an ant dies, other ants move the dead insect out. Sometimes, the dead ant get moved away very soon--within an hour of dying. This behavior is interesting to scientists, who wonder how ants know for sure--and so soon--that another ant is dead. One scientist recently came up with a way to explain this ant behavior. Dong-Hwan Choe is a biologist. Choe found that Argentine ants have a chemical on the outside of their bodies that signals to other ants, \\"I'm dead--take me away.\\" But there's a _ to Choe's discovery. Choe says that the living ants--not just the dead ones--have this death chemical. In other words, while an ant crawls around, perhaps in a picnic or home, it's telling other ants that it's dead. What keeps ants from dragging away the living ants?Choe found that Argentine ants have two additional chemicals on their bodies, and these tell nearby ants something like, \\"Wait--I'm not dead yet.\\" So Choe's research turned up two sets of chemical signals in ants: one says, \\"I'm dead,\\" and the other set says, \\"I'm not dead yet.\\" Other scientists have tried to figure out how ants know when another ant is dead. If an ant is knocked unconscious, for example, other ants leave it alone until it wakes up. That means ants know that unmoving ants can still be alive. Choe suspects that when an Argentine ant dies, the chemical that says \\"Wait-I'm not dead yet\\" quickly goes away. Once that chemical is gone, only the one that says \\"I'm dead\\" is left. \\"It's because the dead ant no longer smells like a living ant that it gets carried to the graveyard, not because its body releases new unique chemicals after death,\\" said Choe. When other ants detect the \\"dead\\" chemical without the \\"not dead yet\\" chemical, they drag away the body. Understanding this behavior may help scientists figure out how to stop Argentine ants from invading new places and causing problems. Choe would like to find a way to use the newly discovered chemicals to spread ant killer to Argentine ant nests. The ants' removal behavior is important to the... Question: Why is it important to remove dead individuals? Options: A: Because it is easier to manage the living. B: Because it can save money to deal with the waste.

[The WHO's International Agency for Research on Cancer] itself has said that the risk from processed meat remains small,\\" she said. Ms Strong added that the average daily consumption of processed meat was 17 grams, which meant that on average people would need to eat \\"three times their current levels to increase their risk\\" of developing cancer.

The answer is:","response":"The Afghanistan National Institute of Music (ANIM) is a music school located in a country that has been war-torn since the late 1970s. Afghanistan has experienced a series of internal and external conflicts, starting with the Soviet invasion in 1979 and continuing with the civil war in the 1990s, the Taliban regime, and the ongoing instability caused by insurgent groups. The Afghanistan National Institute of Music was founded in 2010 by Dr. Ahmad Sarmast, an Afghan-Australian ethnomusicologist and musician, with the objective of reviving and preserving the rich musical heritage of Afghanistan while fostering a new generation of musicians. Situated in the capital city of Kabul, the school provides a safe and nurturing environment for students to study and practice music, both traditional Afghan and Western classical styles. The institution is supported by the Afghan Ministry of Education, as well as numerous international organizations, governments, and private donors. ANIM offers a comprehensive curriculum, including both theoretical and practical music education, for students aged 10 to 20 years old. The school aims to provide a well-rounded education for its students by integrating music lessons with core academic subjects, such as mathematics, science, and language studies. This holistic approach is designed to not only train talented musicians but also empower the youth with transferable skills and knowledge, contributing to the nation's development. One of the priorities of ANIM is to promote social inclusion and gender equality in a country where opportunities in the arts, especially for girls and women, are limited. The school offers outreach programs to orphanages, internally displaced persons camps, and disadvantaged communities in Kabul, providing access to music education for vulnerable and marginalized children. Furthermore, the school has a policy to maintain a 50/50 gender balance in admissions, ensuring equal access to opportunities irrespective of their gender. The institution has a strong focus on fostering cultural diplomacy and international partnerships. The orchestra at ANIM, which includes both male and female musicians playing together, has performed in various international events and venues, showcasing Afghanistan's rich cultural heritage. These performances not only provide the students with valuable experiences but also challenge international perceptions of Afghanistan and build cultural bridges through the universal language of music.

Daily Mail Reporter. PUBLISHED:. 15:08 EST, 19 September 2013. |. UPDATED:. 15:08 EST, 19 September 2013. It is one of the world's most successful companies built on it's famous motto 'Don't be evil'. But a report by Business Insider says rather than peace and love, Google is filled with fierce relationships that would not be out of place in Game of Thrones. Behind the modern glass doors of the internet giant's California headquarters are complex stories of sex and intrigue. One member of staff told Business Insider: 'Inside Google, it's a Game of Thrones.' A report suggests Google is filled with sex scandal and political intrigue that would not be out of place in Game of Thrones, starring Peter Dinklage as Tyrion Lannister. Google's headquarters in Mountain View, California, where insiders say bosses are trying to clamp down on in-fighting. Former staff told the website that the politicking that goes on behind the scenes is reminiscent of the secret networking in the famous book and television series. According to sources quoted by Business Insider, co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin actively encouraged loud and angry debate among their subordinates. But divisions within the company's various strands have now reportedly become so deep, that bosses are now trying to stamp out the in-fighting that was once so encouraged. Business Insider said that during a conference in Napa Valley in February, Page told senior executives that the warring had to stop and there would be 'zero tolerance for fighting.' The alleged change in stance comes after rumoured rivalries between the likes of former search and product executive Marissa Mayer, who is now CEO of Yahoo, and Salar Kamangar, CEO if YouTube. It was not only the networking and politicking that has been likened to Game of Thrones, in which mythical aristocracy and royalty battle for the crown. One member of staff said: 'Inside Google, it's a Game of Thrones'. Pictured: Court meddlers Petyr 'Littlefinger' Baelish (right) and Varys (left) Google co-founder Sergey Brin was involved in a recent sex scandal after it emerged he was dating Google worker Amanda Rosenberg. The book and series' sex and dangerous liaisons also has similarities to life at Google, according to insiders. The. most famous recent 'scandal' involved married Google co-founder Sergey. Brin who, it emerged last month, had an affair with Google Glass. employee Amanda Rosenberg. She had also previously dated Google executive Hugo Barra, according to reports. Although Google has a written code of conduct involving relationships with colleagues, staff say bosses mostly turn a blind eye. The internet giant's code states: 'If a romantic relationship does create an actual or apparent conflict it may require changes to work arrangements or even the termination of employment of either or both individuals involved. ‘When faced with a potential conflict of interest, ask yourself: Would this activity harm my reputation, negatively impact my ability to do my job at Google or potentially harm Google? Google co-founders Sergey Brin, left, and Larry Page, actively encouraged fierce debate among staff, according to the report. ‘Would this activity embarrass Google or me if it showed up on the front page of a newspaper or blog? If the answer to any of these questions is “yes”, the relationship or situation is likely to create a conflict of interest and you should avoid it.’ However, as Business Insider states, in Douglas Edwards' book about the launch of the company 'I'm Feeling Lucky: The Confessions Of Google Employee Number 59' relationships with co-workers were common. Mr Edwards quotes HR worker Heather Cairns as saying: 'hormones were flying and not everyone remembered to lock their doors.' But as one Google worker told Business Insider: 'In a place like Google, which has strong technical talent as well as business talent, it's very natural that people are going to be attracted to one another.' Google did not immediately respond to a request for a comment.","response":"This article says that Google is a very famous and successful company. But, people working there sometimes have arguments and disagreements, just like in the story called \\"Game of Thrones.\\" The big bosses at Google, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, used to let people have these arguments because they thought it was good for them to share their ideas. But now, they want to stop the fighting and make everyone work together nicely. Also, the article talks about romantic relationships between people who work at Google.

Options: - to be alone - believe in god - enjoy themselves - face each other - group together Explain why a human would choose \\"enjoy themselves\\" to answer the question above: A:","response":"A human would choose \\"enjoy themselves\\" as the answer to the question because going to a party typically involves participating in social activities, interacting with others, and having a good time. People generally attend parties to celebrate special occasions, unwind, and meet new people or reconnect with friends and acquaintances. The primary purpose of attending a party is to have a pleasant and fun experience, which is synonymous with enjoying oneself. The other options provided are not as relevant or suitable for describing the main reason why people would go to a party. Let's analyze each one briefly: - \\"To be alone\\" contradicts the fundamental essence of a party, which is socializing and being with others. - \\"Believe in god\\" might be related to attending a religious gathering, but it does not directly address the main motivation for going to a typical social party. - \\"Face each other\\" seems vague and doesn't provide a clear reason for attending a party. While it might imply confrontation or meeting others, it's not an explanation for a fun and engaging event like a party. - \\"Group together\\" can be considered as one element of a party given people come together in a single place, but it fails to convey the notion of enjoyment, which is the primary motivation behind attending a party. Hence, \\"enjoy themselves\\" is the most appropriate reason for someone to go to a party, as it accurately captures the essence of having fun and socializing in a relaxed and festive atmosphere."},{"question":"When you are relaxing with friends, what are you doing if you discuss anything?

Since merely discussing anything does not imply taking sides, this option doesn't fit. 2. \\"Hang out\\" refers to spending time together with friends in a casual and relaxed manner. While hanging out can include discussing various topics, this option doesn't specifically address the aspect of discussing anything. 3. \\"Go to the movies\\" involves attending a cinema to watch film together. Again, while you might discuss topics during or after the movie, this option doesn't specifically address the act of discussing anything. 4. \\"Understand each other\\" refers to a mutual comprehension between individuals. Although understanding each other could be a result of discussing various topics, this option doesn't specifically focus on the act of discussing anything either. 5. \\"Talking about\\" specifically involves discussing or conversing about various topics.

She placed three pots in a sunny area and three pots in a shaded area. She watered each pot the same and measured the growth of the lettuce. After Mara analyzes her data, what conclusion will it help her to make? Options: A. When to plant her lettuce. B. Where to plant her lettuce. C. How much water to give lettuce. D. How many lettuce plants to grow.","response":"Based on Mara's experiment, the conclusion she can make relates to Option B: Where to plant her lettuce. Mara has conducted a controlled experiment, in which she maintained constant factors, such as the quantity of seeds, the amount of water given to each pot, and the type of lettuce seeds used. The only variable she has changed in her experiment is the exposure to sunlight – three pots in a sunny area and three pots in a shaded area. The purpose of this experiment is to understand the impact of sunlight and location on lettuce growth. After analyzing the data collected, Mara will be able to determine whether the lettuce grew better in the sunny area or the shaded area. The pot's growth rate and the overall health of the plants will serve as the basis for her conclusion. If the lettuce grown in the sunny area is taller, is leafier, or appears healthier compared to the lettuce in the shaded area, Mara may conclude that a sunnier area is a better location for planting lettuce. On the other hand, if the lettuce grown in the shaded area outperforms the lettuce in the sunny area, Mara may conclude that planting in a shaded area is more suitable for lettuce growth. Option A: When to plant her lettuce - The experiment does not provide any information on the ideal time to plant lettuce seeds, as it focuses only on sunlight exposure. Option C: How much water to give lettuce - Mara waters each pot the same, which means her experiment does not analyze the different water requirements for optimal lettuce growth. Therefore, the results of her experiment cannot be used to conclude how much water is necessary for the plant's growth. Option D: How many lettuce plants to grow - The experiment does not give any guidance on the ideal number of lettuce plants to grow, as it focuses on the effects of sunlight exposure on growth rather than determining how many plants perform the best under specific conditions. In conclusion, with the data collected from her experiment, Mara will be able to make an informed decision on where to plant her lettuce (Option B) based on the impact of sunlight exposure on lettuce growth."},{"question":"Do you think the right answer to the question \\"sense of smell impacts an animal's what?\\" is \\"reproduction\\", given that sense of smell impacts an animal's survival? (1). Yes (2). No Answer:","response":"(2). No Step 1: Understand the question The question asks if the answer \\"reproduction\\" is the right term for what sense of smell impacts in an animal, given that it impacts their survival. Step 2: Evaluate the relationship between survival and reproduction Survival and reproduction are both essential aspects of an animal's life. While survival ensures the animal's ability to live, reproduction ensures the continuity of its species. Step 3: Determine the role of sense of smell in survival and reproduction The sense of smell in animals plays a significant role in their survival, as it helps them find food, avoid predators, and locate mates. This supports the notion that the sense of smell impacts an animal's survival. However, it is important to recognize that the sense of smell also impacts an animal's reproduction. Animals rely on their sense of smell to locate and identify suitable mates, which is crucial for successful reproduction. Step 4: Provide the justification for the answer Although sense of smell does impact an animal's survival, it is not accurate to say that the right answer to the question is \\"reproduction\\". The sense of smell affects various aspects of an animal's life, and reproduction is only one of them."},{"question":"Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: In what year did the song Symfonin reach top of the Swedish singles charts at the festival that has been the launch-pad for the success of popular local acts? Hundreds of songs and performers have entered Melodifestivalen since its debut. Although songwriters living outside Sweden were once not allowed to enter Melodifestivalen, the 2012 contest marked the first time foreign songwriters could submit entries, provided that they collaborated with a Swedish songwriter. To be eligible, songwriters and performers must be at least sixteen years of age on the day of the first Eurovision semi-final.Until 2001, participation in the festival was limited to a single night. The number of contestants ranged from five to twelve. A two-round system was used intermittently between 1981 and 1998, in which all but five of the contestants were eliminated in a first round of voting. Failure to reach the second round under this system was seen as a major failure for a prominent artist; when Elisabeth Andreassen failed to qualify in 1984, it almost ended her career. The introduction of weekly semi-finals in 2002 increased the number of contestants to thirty-two. At least ten of the contestants must perform in Swedish. A CD of each year's competing songs has been released since 2001, and a DVD of the semi-finals and final since 2003. Melodifestivalen has been the launch-pad for the success of popular local acts, such as Anne-Lie Rydé, Tommy Körberg, and Lisa Nilsson. The competition has played host to performers from outside Sweden, including Baccara, Alannah Myles, Katrina Leskanich, and Cornelis Vreeswijk. Melodifestivalen participants have also represented—and unsuccessfully tried to represent—other countries at Eurovision. While local success for Melodifestivalen winners is common, most contestants return to obscurity and few have major international success. The impact that the competition makes on the Swedish charts means an artist need not win the competition to earn significant domestic record sales. For example, the song which finished last at Melodifestivalen 1990, \\"Symfonin\\" by Loa Falkman, topped the Swedish singles chart. The most recent occurrence was 2016 with Samir &...

Goodall had always been passionate about animals and Africa, which brought her to the farm of a friend in the Kenya highlands in 1957. From there, she obtained work as a secretary, and acting on her friend's advice, she telephoned Louis Leakey, the notable Kenyan archaeologist and palaeontologist, with no other thought than to make an appointment to discuss animals. Leakey, believing that the study of existing great apes could provide indications of the behaviour of early hominids, was looking for a chimpanzee researcher, though he kept the idea to himself. Instead, he proposed that Goodall work for him as a secretary. After obtaining approval from his wife Mary Leakey, Louis sent Goodall to Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania, where he laid out his plans. In 1958, Leakey sent Goodall to London to study primate behaviour with Osman Hill and primate anatomy with John Napier. Leakey raised funds, and on 14 July 1960, Goodall went to Gombe Stream National Park, becoming the first of what would come to be called The Trimates. She was accompanied by her mother, whose presence was necessary to satisfy the requirements of David Anstey, chief warden, who was concerned for their safety; Tanzania was \\"Tanganyika\\" at that time and a British protectorate. Leakey arranged funding and in 1962, he sent Goodall, who had no degree, to Cambridge University. She went to Newnham College, and obtained a PhD degree in ethology. She became the eighth person to be allowed to study for a PhD there without first having obtained a BA or BSc.

But in winter, it could not find food. So it came to villages and ate a lot of people. People were so afraid of Nian that they locked their doors before evening came during the winter. One day, an old man came to a village. He told people there that Nian was afraid of three things----the color red, fire and noise. He told people to play drums and gongs, make big fires and set off fireworks to make Nian go away. On a moonless, cold night, Nian went to the village again. As soon as it opened its big mouth, people made loud noises and made fires. Nian was really afraid and ran away. wherever it went, there was noise and fire. When Nian was tired and could not run anymore, people killed the monster.

(CNN) -- Interim Egyptian President Adly Mansour sent a letter to the family of jailed Al Jazeera journalist Mohamed Fahmy on Sunday telling him that Fahmy \\"will enjoy all his rights guaranteed by Egyptian law.\\" Mansour also ordered Egypt's interior minister to follow up on Fahmy's health condition and \\"to provide all possible care.\\" Fahmy, a former CNN producer, injured his shoulder before his arrest in December while working as bureau chief for Al Jazeera English in Cairo. He's complained about not getting proper medical treatment while in prison. He says that because of the lack of treatment, he no longer has full use of his right arm. He said he and his colleagues -- Al Jazeera correspondent","response":"Peter Greste and producer Baher Mohamed -- are being targeted not for any crime, but because they were \\"just doing their jobs\\" as journalists, reporting on various stories in Egypt to keep the public informed. Fahmy vehemently maintains that his unyielding commitment to truthful and objective reporting stands as testament to the fact that the charges against him and his fellow journalists are unfounded. He, Greste and Mohamed are facing charges of promoting false news in favor of the Muslim Brotherhood, which Egypt declared a terrorist organization after President Mohamed Morsi's ouster. All three have denied the accusations, insisting that their work was solely focused on providing accurate and unbiased information to their viewers. Al Jazeera has also vehemently denied any wrongdoing, calling the charges baseless and unjust, and has been working tirelessly to secure the release of their reporters. Their trial has drawn sharp criticism from the international community, who argue that the case is just another example of the Egyptian government attempting to stifle press freedom and crack down on dissent in the country. The United Nations, the European Union, and other global organizations have all expressed concern over the condition of press freedom in Egypt, urging the government to drop the charges and release Fahmy, Greste, and Mohamed. Despite the ongoing pressure, the Egyptian government has remained steadfast in their pursuit of the case. Fahmy and his colleagues have spent over 400 days behind bars, as their legal battle continues to unfold. The case has been marked by numerous adjournments, causing further frustration to their friends and families who are eager to see them released. Fahmy's health remains a significant concern, as the deteriorating condition of his shoulder is a constant reminder of the inadequate medical care he has received while in prison. Human rights groups and medical professionals have advocated for Fahmy to receive proper treatment, emphasizing the irreversible consequences of such neglect. As he and his fellow journalists continue to fight for their freedom, their case serves as a stark reminder of the erosion of press freedom in certain parts of the world. The global community of journalists and press freedom advocates remain committed to their cause, hopeful that one day they will be released and reunited with their loved ones, and that this dark chapter in Egypt's history will come to an end. The unwavering support and solidarity from around the world for Fahmy, Greste, and Mohamed demonstrate the vital importance of a free and independent press in maintaining a just and democratic society."},{"question":"Denny asked: If \\"A sponsored motorcyclist is making a turn on a racing circuit.\\" does that mean that \\"A person is riding a motorcycle.\\"?

In February, during this prestigious event, we unveiled our ambitious strategy focused on democratizing mobile multimedia services, making them available and accessible to everyone, regardless of their income, location, or device preferences. Our goal is to bridge the digital divide and enable access to a variety of mobile content, including videos, music, games, and other forms of multimedia entertainment. This is particularly important for those in underserved communities who may not have the same level of access to these services due to financial, geographic, or technological constraints. To achieve this objective, we have outlined a multi-faceted approach: 1. Developing affordable devices and solutions: We are working on creating low-cost smartphones, tablets, and other devices that allow users to access multimedia content more easily. By making devices more affordable, a larger portion of the population would have the opportunity to use these multimedia services. 2. Building robust and resilient networks: A key enabler for democratizing mobile multimedia is ensuring that the necessary network infrastructure is available to provide high-quality connectivity. We are collaborating with network operators, governments, and other stakeholders to expand coverage and improve the performance of mobile networks in underserved areas. 3. Investing in new technologies: We are looking into next-generation technologies, such as 5G, to provide faster connections and lower latency, allowing for enhanced multimedia experiences on mobile devices. Additionally, we are exploring innovative ways to compress data and optimize the delivery of content to reduce costs and improve efficiency. 4. Fostering partnerships and collaborations: We understand that to make a meaningful impact, we need to work together with other players in the industry. We are forging partnerships with content producers, service providers, and other technology companies, fostering a collaborative ecosystem that supports our mission to bring mobile multimedia to everyone. 5. Promoting digital literacy: As part of our effort to democratize access to mobile multimedia services, we are also committed to promoting digital literacy by offering educational resources and training programs to help people acquire the necessary skills to navigate and benefit from these services. By implementing this comprehensive strategy, our aim is to create a more inclusive and connected world, offering individuals from all walks of life the opportunity to access and enjoy the rich content and applications that mobile multimedia has to offer."},{"question":"Instructions: In this task, you are given sentences from movie reviews.

Translate to Finnish Finnish:","response":"On aika ottaa käyttöön käytännönläheinen ja päättäväinen politiikka tämän tyrannin suhteen. Tämä johtuu useista syistä, jotka on syytä käsitellä perusteellisesti. Ensinnäkin, kuten historian on osoittanut toistuvasti, tyrannit eivät ole tehokkaita johtajia, ja heidän hallintojensa alla yhteiskunnat kärsivät. Tämä johtaa väistämättä vakaan ja kestävän yhteiskuntarakenteen murenemiseen sekä kansalaisten hyvinvoinnin vähenemiseen. Toiseksi, tyrannien vallanhimo voi johtaa turvallisuusriskien lisääntymiseen alueen muille valtioille. He eivät useinkaan kunnioita kansainvälistä oikeutta tai normeja eivätkä pidä diplomaattisia tai kansainvälisiä sopimuksia velvoittavina. Tämä aiheuttaa jännitteitä ja konflikteja, jotka voivat johtaa poliittisiin kriiseihin ja mahdollisesti vakavaan väkivaltaan. Kolmantena syynä on se, että tyrannit usein harjoittavat massiivisia ihmisoikeusloukkauksia ja sortavat kansalaisiaan. He saattavat tukahduttaa vapaan sanan ja demokraattiset instituutiot, määrätä mielivaltaisia pidätyksiä ja pahoinpitelyitä sekä aiheuttaa kärsimyksiä ja hädänalaisuutta kansalleen. Tämä herättää maailmanlaajuisen huomion ja lisää kansainvälistä painetta toimia tilanteen korjaamiseksi. Neljäs syy on tarve ylläpitää uskottavuutta kansainvälisenä toimijana. Passiivinen asenne tai tukemalla tyrannin kaltaista hallintoa saattaa johtaa kansainvälisen yhteisön luottamuksen menettämiseen, sillä ihmiset odottavat johdonmukaista ja eettistä ulkopolitiikkaa. Olemalla kärkäs ja päättäväinen puuttumaan tyrannin toimiin, valtiot voivat osoittaa kunnioituksensa kansainvälisiä normeja kohtaan ja säilyttää asemansa luotettavana kumppanina. Pragmatismi ja päättäväisyys ovat keskeisiä piirteitä tällaisen politiikan toteuttamisessa. Sen sijaan, että tuijotettaisiin ainoastaan ihanteellisiin tai teoreettisiin ratkaisuihin, on tärkeää ottaa huomioon käytännön realiteetit ja tehdä tasapainoisia ja strategisia päätöksiä, jotka voivat tuottaa aidosti myönteisiä tuloksia ajan myötä. Lopuksi on syytä muistaa, että tällainen koplaaminen tyrannien kanssa saattaa kantaa pitkällä aikavälillä hedelmää auttamalla yhteiskuntia kuoriutumaan sorron ikeestä ja luomaan paremman tulevaisuuden. Siksi on tärkeää, että maiden johtajat omaksuvat käytännönläheisen ja päättäväisen politiikan, joka ei salli tyrannin toimintaedellytyksiä ja rohkaisee kansainvälistä yhteisöä ottamaan saman linjan."},{"question":"Build a movie plot around this: After Evan was saved, what did he do?

Without giving any damm to my privacy she opened the phone and it was my bad luck that there was no screen lock. The movie automatically started and after 5 seconds she took the phone to my dad she said “This is what he is doing when he's alone” My parents called me what is this ?? I said it's a video message from the company and it starts automatically. I have nothing to do with that stuff and suddenly my dad said yes he is right, it's a video from the company and asked me to delete the video.

Some hid beneath the huge black seed-pods, some scuttled in the shadows of the nearby mountain. Patch knew from their smells there were at least a dozen of them. There was another smell too, mixed with that of the rats. The very same unsavory squirrel-smell he had detected in Silver's abandoned drey. \\"What do you want?\\" Patch asked, from his perch atop the mound of seed-pods. He was concerned but not yet frightened. Rats and squirrels were neither friends nor enemies. Squirrels were bigger and stronger, but rats were far more numerous. There were legends of long-ago wars between the two species, but no squirrel Patch knew had ever been attacked by rats. Squirrels lived aboveground, in the sun; rats frequented the night and the dark underworld. Of course, squirrels found rats disgusting and disagreeable -- but so did all other animals. An unusually large rat climbed up to the top of a seed-pod. It was almost as big as Patch himself. Rats usually avoided light, but this one stood unafraid beneath the sun, and demanded: \\"Who are you?\\" \\"I am Patch son of Silver, of the Seeker clan, of the Treetops tribe, of the Center Kingdom,\\" Patch said. \\"Who are you that asks?\\" \\"I am Snout,\\" the rat replied. \\"Why are you here?\\" \\"I came to look for food.\\" \\"This is our food.

The Sandra Bullock/George Clooney space thriller set an October opening weekend record, surpassing \\"Paranormal Activity 3's\\" 52.6 million debut in 2011, according to EW. Many critics also hailed the film, which centers around characters being set adrift in space. But some in the science community have taken exception to some of the facts presented. Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson took to Twitter over the weekend to offer several \\"Mysteries of #Gravity,\\" including \\"The film #Gravity should be renamed 'Angular Momentum.' \\" He points what the film got wrong, from the fact that Bullock's hair didn't free float to why she, as a medical doctor, was on the mission to start with. So here we offer 5 things that couldn't happen in \\"Gravity.\\" Word to the wise: Stop reading now if you have an issue with spoilers (Seriously. You have been warned). 1. The way the shuttle travels NASA expert Michael A. Interbartolo III didn't even have to wait for the film to come out to dispute this. When the trailer premiered, he wrote that the relative motion of the shuttle in the film appears to be off for the chain of events that follow. \\"The way I am seeing it, the shuttle was wings level, payload bay up (Z), right wing into the orbital velocity vector (X direction of travel), nose in Y,\\" wrote Interbartolo, who said he flew the shuttle in Mission Control for 11 years. \\"The Micrometeoroid and Orbital Debris [MMOD] (though most were not really micro Meteoroid) impact puts it into a roll about Y with it still traveling in the velocity vector X, and why are the Forward and Aft reaction control jets not firing to damp the ramp since they were intact in the trailer?\\" Translation for you non-science types out there: It's more movie magic than actual science that has the shuttle getting smacked with debris and then heading in the direction it is set. Sandra Bullock keeps defying gravity with her career 2. Rendezvousing in space is not as easy -- or as quick -- as the film makes it appear Bullock plays Ryan Stone, a medical engineer on her first mission in space who gets set adrift after an accident. Part of the action involves her trying to make her way back to a fellow astronaut, Clooney's Matt Kowalski. But according to Interbartolo, it's a wonder that Clooney's character doesn't get \\"shredded\\" by all the debris floating around after the incident, let alone that the pair manage to link up again. \\"If it is just her and Clooney, assuming she somehow got back to him after being flung away on the (Remote Manipulator System) free floating trying to get to the space station without a vehicle, that seems unlikely, unless the two orbits just magically intersect at the exact right time for them to be anywhere near the (International Space Station),\\" he said. What Buzz Aldrin thinks of 'Gravity' 3. Kowalski's equipment is outdated Kowalski flies around on a way-cool jet pack that helps him get to Stone when she is in need. Writing for WRAL's science blog, NASA/JPL Solar System Ambassador program volunteer Tony Rice notes that \\"The Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU) Clooney's character jets around on in the opening scenes does exist but was used only on three early shuttle missions and not since 1984. \\"You can see space flown MMUs today hanging above space-flown shuttle orbiters at the Air and Space Museum and Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex,\\" Rice wrote. \\"The MMU was capable only of short bursts to move astronauts around the shuttle, not crossing distances portrayed in the film and certainly not in the time presented. But it was certainly a cool way to get Bullock and Clooney into the second act.\\" Read this story or we give away the ending 4. Bullock's astronaut is way more adept than she should be After all the space walking, being flung around and dodging debris, Bullock's Stone is still able to navigate not just one but two spacecraft from other countries: a Russian Soyuz and a Chinese Shenzhou. It's amazing, given that Stone points out that she was not the best in training on the United States spacecraft. \\"She handles both ships with surprising deftness considering she was only lightly trained on the Soyuz and not at all on the Shenzhou,\\" Jeffrey Kluger wrote for Time magazine. \\"And throughout the movie, she and Clooney spend a fair bit of time getting whacked around in space, grabbing onto this or that rail or tether on the shuttle or ISS only at the last second to avoid pinwheeling off into the void. In truth, pressurized space gloves are murderously hard to manipulate, providing only limited grip at best and leaving astronauts' hands cold and very painful after a day of work. Making the kinds of one-handed Cirque du Soleil catches Clooney and Bullock accomplish would be impossible.\\" How Bullock prepared for her role 5. The Hubble, the International Space Station and a Chinese space station are not neighbors In the film, Bullock just needs to hop from space station to space station in order to find a refuge from debris and to make it home to Earth. But as the New York Times pointed out, that's not as easy as it looks. Photos: Sandra Bullock: America's sweetheart \\"As we recall from bitter memory, the Hubble and the space station are in vastly different orbits,\\" Dennis Overbye wrote. \\"Getting from one to the other requires so much energy that not even space shuttles had enough fuel to do it. The telescope is 353 miles high, in an orbit that keeps it near the Equator; the space station is about 100 miles lower, in an orbit that takes it far north, over Russia.\\" \\"To have the movie astronauts Matt Kowalski (Mr. Clooney) and Ryan Stone (Ms. Bullock) zip over to the space station would be like having a pirate tossed overboard in the Caribbean swim to London.\\" The film's director, Alfonso Cuarón, seemed fully prepared for the criticism after \\"Gravity's\\" release. \\"This is not a documentary,\\" the director told collectSPACE.com. \\"It is a piece of fiction.\\"","response":"In the movie \\"Gravity,\\" starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, there are some issues regarding the portrayal of scientific facts. Some of the inaccuracies the film presents include: 1. The way the shuttle travels: The shuttle's movements in the film have been deemed unrealistic by NASA expert Michael A. Interbartolo III, who claims that the way the shuttle gets impacted by debris and heads in a particular direction is more movie magic than actual science. 2. Rendezvousing in space: In the movie, Bullock's character attempts to make her way back to Clooney's character. However, Interbartolo points out the improbability of this scenario, especially considering the debris floating around and the difficulty of two orbits intersecting at the right moment. 3. Kowalski's (Clooney's character) equipment is outdated: Kowalski uses a Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU) to fly around. However, this type of equipment was only used on three early shuttle missions and has not been used since 1984. 4. Bullock's astronaut is more adept than she should be: Despite her character admitting to struggling in training, Bullock's Ryan Stone is portrayed as being able to efficiently navigate two spacecraft from other countries. 5. The distance between space stations: In the film, Bullock's character hops from one space station to another. In reality, the Hubble, the International Space Station, and a Chinese space station are not close neighbors, making this an unrealistic scenario. Despite these inaccuracies, it is important to remember that \\"Gravity\\" is a work of fiction, not a documentary."},{"question":"Q:Here's a question: Where is the last place food is before being eaten? Here are possible answers to this question: - kitchen - plate - dinning - stomach - pantry I believe the correct choice is \\"plate\\", here's why: A:","response":"Indeed, the correct choice is \\"plate.\\" When we consider the process of preparing and consuming food, there are several stages involved, including purchasing, storing, preparing, and serving. The last place food is typically found before being eaten is on a plate or other serving dish. Here's a brief overview of the stages mentioned and how they relate to the given options: 1. Pantry: This is where food is stored prior to being prepared. Pantries typically house dry goods, canned goods, and other non-perishable food items. Refrigerators and freezers play a similar role for perishables. 2. Kitchen: This is where food is prepared for consumption, usually by cooking, baking, or otherwise assembling ingredients. The kitchen is equipped with appliances, utensils, and cookware to help create various dishes. 3. Dining: This refers to the act of eating food, whether at a dining table, a restaurant, or elsewhere. This stage comes after food has been served on a plate. 4. Plate: This is the final stage where food is presented, portioned, and consumed. Plates, bowls, and other serving dishes hold the food so that it can be eaten with utensils or by hand. 5. Stomach: This is not a place where food is found before being eaten, but rather the first destination during the digestion process after the food has been consumed. In summary, the last place food is before being eaten is on a plate, where it is typically presented and portioned before consumption. The plate serves as the final stage between food preparation in the kitchen and the act of dining, during which the food is consumed and later digested in the stomach."},{"question":"\\"Happy Hour Review\\" We have never been here before and decided to try Happy Hour, which is 5-7pm.

Over the past decades, the monarch butterfly population has seen a rapid decline, causing concern among scientists, environmentalists, and the general public. This decline is attributable to various factors including habitat loss, climate change, pesticides, and other anthropogenic issues. Hypothesis: Increasing the availability of milkweed plants, the primary food source for monarch caterpillars, across their migratory pathways will help to restore the monarch butterfly population. Possible links between the loss of milkweed along the migratory corridors and the decline in the monarch butterfly population have led many researchers to believe that increasing the availability of this critical plant species could aid in the recovery of these butterflies. Milkweed plants are crucial for the survival of monarch caterpillars as they provide sustenance during their growth and development. To investigate the hypothesis, several experiments and initiatives can be proposed. These projects can be implemented on a local or even national scale to observe their impact on the population numbers of monarch butterflies. Some suggested approaches include: 1. Encouraging the cultivation of milkweed: This can be done through public awareness campaigns, educational programs, and partnerships with nurseries and garden centers. Providing free or subsidized milkweed seeds and plants to homeowners, community gardens, and schools can foster an environment that supports the growth and maintenance of critical monarch habitats. 2. Implementing milkweed restoration projects: Opportunities for large-scale ecological restoration projects can be explored, focusing on restoring milkweed populations along the monarch butterfly migratory pathways. Collaborating with governmental and non-governmental organizations that focus on conservation and habitat restoration can enhance the effectiveness of these efforts. 3. Evaluating the impact of pesticides on milkweed and monarch populations: Research on the effects of various pesticides on milkweed plants and monarch butterflies can provide valuable insights into potential interventions and best practices to prevent further decline. Policy recommendations can be drawn from this research to limit the use of harmful pesticides on milkweed habitats. 4. Identifying and preserving monarch butterfly overwintering sites: Monarch butterflies rely on specific overwintering sites during their migration. Protecting these sites, often located in endangered ecosystems, is essential for the survival and reproduction of the species. Collaborative efforts with local communities, governments, and conservation organizations can lead to effective protective measures to maintain these habitats. 5. Monitoring and tracking monarch population trends: Establishing a comprehensive monitoring program to assess the trends in the monarch butterfly population will provide data to enable the evaluation of the effectiveness of implemented interventions. This program would involve participation from citizen scientists, researchers, and conservation organizations. The hypothesis suggests that a multi-pronged approach, emphasizing the importance of milkweed in the life cycle of monarch butterflies, may be an effective method to restore their declining population. Through these experimental and practical initiatives, researchers can better understand the factors driving the decline and identify the most effective solutions to address the threats faced by the species."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Read the below conversation.

Available choices: a). Add blanket to an open suitcase.; b). Add blanket to a closed suitcase.;","response":"In this single/multi-choice problem, we are comparing two available options to create a temporary bed for a baby. The ultimate goal is to provide a safe and comfortable sleeping environment for the infant. Let's analyze the two choices in detail and determine which would be a better solution. Choice A: Add a blanket to an open suitcase. When creating a temporary bed for a baby using an open suitcase, the first step would be to ensure that the suitcase is clean and free of sharp or hazardous objects. In this option, we would place a soft and comfortable blanket in an open suitcase and create a cozy bed for the baby. The edges of the suitcase may provide some form of enclosure, which could help to make the baby feel more secure. Pros: 1. The open suitcase provides a relatively flat surface and may contain the baby within a confined space. 2. There is a degree of flexibility in terms of adjusting the level of cushioning by adding more blankets or padding if necessary. 3. Easy access to the baby for supervision and care. Cons: 1. Without proper padding, the open suitcase may not provide adequate support or comfort for the baby. 2. The baby could roll onto the suitcase edges, posing a safety risk. 3. The open suitcase does not provide much protection from environmental factors such as cold temperatures or insects. Choice B: Add a blanket to a closed suitcase. In this option, we would place a soft blanket over a closed suitcase and use it as a makeshift surface for the baby to sleep on. While this choice provides a flat surface for the baby, it poses some concerns regarding safety and comfort. Pros: 1. A closed suitcase can offer a flatter surface to lay the baby on. 2. The elevated height could be more convenient for parents or caregivers while tending to the baby. Cons: 1. Depending on the design of the suitcase, it may be unstable and pose a risk of falling or tipping over. 2. The hardness of the suitcase does not provide ideal sleeping conditions for the baby. 3. The edges of the suitcase may be uncomfortable and pose safety concerns, particularly if the baby rolls over. 4. The height provided by a closed suitcase may be unsafe for a baby who can roll over or attempt to crawl. Upon evaluating the pros and cons of both choices, it appears that choice A (adding a blanket to an open suitcase) would be a better solution for creating a temporary bed for a baby. While both options have their limitations and potential safety concerns, the open suitcase provides greater flexibility in terms of cushioning and adjustability in the sleep environment. However, it is crucial to note that these options should only serve as temporary solutions, and the infant should ideally be placed in a designated crib, bassinet, or playpen specifically designed to ensure their safety and comfort while sleeping. Parents and caregivers should also take the necessary precautions to monitor the baby at all times, particularly in unconventional sleeping arrangements."},{"question":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Is \\"The Celts who settled in Galatia came through Thrace under the leadership of Leotarios and Leonnorios circa 270 BC.\\" the correct answer?","response":"Yes, the statement \\"The Celts who settled in Galatia came through Thrace under the leadership of Leotarios and Leonnorios circa 270 BC.\\" is partly correct, but it does not encompass the entire geographical trajectory or provide all relevant historical context. The Celts who settled in Galatia were part of a larger group of Celtic tribes that migrated from central and western Europe in various stages throughout the 4th and 3rd centuries BC. These tribes had earlier dominions in areas now corresponding to modern-day France, Germany, Belgium, and Britain. Their initial migration took them through the Balkan Peninsula, where they caused significant cultural and political changes to existing populations. Their first known encounter was with the Macedonians in 279 BC, where the Celtic tribes, led by Brennus, attempted to plunder the rich city of Delphi. They were ultimately defeated, but in the process, they established themselves as a formidable force. Following Brennus' defeat, the Celts divided into smaller groups and continued their migration across the Balkan Peninsula. One of these groups, led by Leotarios and Leonnorios, aimed to establish a new home in the region known as Thrace, which was inhabited by Thracian tribes. Thrace, located in modern-day southeastern Europe, mainly encompassed territories in present-day Greece, Bulgaria, and Turkey. Passing through Thrace, Leotarios and Leonnorios' group defeated the Thracian king Cavaros in 278 BC. After this victory, the Celts moved eastward and crossed the Bosporus Strait into Asia Minor (now modern-day Turkey). At the time, the region was under the control of the declining Seleucid Empire. Upon reaching Asia Minor, the Celtic group was offered a truce by Nicomedes I, the King of Bithynia. He offered them land in exchange for military support against his opponents. This region, later known as Galatia, comprised parts of the ancient territories of Phrygia, Lycaonia, and Cappadocia. Thus, the Celts who settled in Galatia did pass through Thrace, adding significantly to their journey from central and western Europe. This was an essential part of their odyssey, which ultimately culminated in the founding of Galatia circa 270 BC. It is important to understand that the migration and establishment of the Celtic tribes in Galatia were complex and multi-faceted, rather than just a single event or passage through Thrace."},{"question":"Australia win the toss and bat first in the tri-series final against Pakistan.

For much of the past decade, patient numbers have been rising as would be expected with an ageing population. But since 2010, the numbers have levelled off - with just one in eight areas now doing more hips and knees and one in five seeing rises in cataracts. It comes amid mounting pressures on the health service. The challenges facing A&E units have been well documented, but reports have also been emerging that non-emergency care is being squeezed too. These findings - to be published on Monday in Dr Foster's annual hospital guide - provide perhaps the most comprehensive picture yet of what is happening. The health care analysts looked at the number of operations being carried out for the three types of procedures - among the most life-enhancing done by the NHS - for the past decade. It found virtually no change in the overall numbers over the past two years with the total numbers hovering around the 475,000 mark each year. Hip replacements were the only treatment out of the three that were still going up - although the rate of increase has slowed. Meanwhile, the number of cataract operations is at its lowest level for five years and 2012-13 saw the first fall in knee replacements for a decade. The review also provided details of what local areas were up to by looking at the individual figures for the 200-plus clinical commissioning groups which are now in charge of local health budgets. The data showed that just 27 (13%) areas saw a significant rise in knee replacements over the past two years, 27 (13%) a rise for hip replacements and 40 (19%) a rise for cataracts. Roger Taylor, co-founder of Dr Foster, said the findings suggested the squeeze on spending was having an impact on these \\"highly effective\\" treatments. \\"There has been a sharp slow-down in activity. We are seeing some operations fall when normally we see them increasing by 4%, 5% or 6% a year.\\" Postcode search: Find out how your area is doing The review will also highlight other areas of concern. Dr Foster analysed data on what it called \\"ineffective operations\\". These include procedures such as tonsillectomies and knee washouts where the benefits are marginal. While overall the numbers being done had fallen by 8% in the past five years there are still 124 areas where their use has increased since 2010-11. Mr Taylor added: \\"Money is being wasted on care that is of no benefit.\\" Colin Howie, vice president of the British Orthopaedic Association, said the findings were \\"very concerning\\". \\"By trying to save money in the short term, it will cost the NHS and society in the long term. These are highly effective operations because they restore mobility and reduce disability. \\"What is more, the research shows it is the most vulnerable in society - the elderly and poor - who are most likely to miss out.\\" A spokesman for NHS England said: \\"While the data raises important questions, we should be wary of leaping to the answers. \\"Cataracts, knees and hip replacements are generally 'good' but it is still the case that they can be overused. \\"We do a very significant number of these operations all over the country and it should not be taken as a given that this figure should automatically increase.\\" This article was about:","response":"The article discusses the findings of a study conducted by Dr. Foster Research Group focused on three key medical procedures: knee replacements, hip replacements, and cataract operations. These procedures are largely due to the aging population, and the number of patients undergoing these surgeries has been rising for most of the past decade. However, since 2010, the growth has leveled off, with only one in eight areas now seeing increased hip and knee replacements and one in five areas experiencing a rise in cataract surgeries. The study reveals that the total number of these surgeries had hardly changed over the past two years, remaining around 475,000 operations each year. This stagnation in growth is thought to be a result of increased pressure on the NHS (National Health Service) and limitations on healthcare spending. Hip replacements are the only procedure of the three still seeing an increase in numbers, though the rate of growth has slowed down. On the other hand, cataract operations are now at their lowest numbers in five years, and 2012-13 saw the first decrease in knee replacements in a decade. The data also showed that: - 27 areas (13%) saw a significant rise in knee replacements over the past two years - 27 areas (13%) saw a rise for hip replacements - 40 areas (19%) experienced a rise for cataract surgeries Roger Taylor, co-founder of Dr. Foster, believes the stagnating numbers suggest that spending constraints are affecting these crucial treatments. He notes that there has been a sharp slowdown in activity, as some surgeries are no longer increasing at their usual 4%-6% yearly rate. The study also looked at data on \\"ineffective operations,\\" such as tonsillectomies and knee washouts, which have marginal benefits. The numbers of these procedures have fallen by 8% in the past five years, yet there are still 124 areas where their use has increased since 2010-11. Medical professionals have expressed concerns about the situation. Colin Howie, Vice President of the British Orthopaedic Association, views the findings as \\"very concerning\\" and believes that attempts to save money in the short term will cost the NHS and society in the long term. These operations are seen as highly effective, restoring mobility and reducing disability for patients, yet the research shows that vulnerable populations, such as the elderly and poor, are most likely to miss out on these procedures. A spokesperson for NHS England emphasized the need to be cautious when drawing conclusions from the data presented. Although these procedures are usually considered effective, they can also be overused, and it's important to analyze the reasons behind the numbers before making definitive claims about their impact on healthcare."},{"question":"Question: what are the elements in whole grain oats?

One in four working parents worry that half an hour simply isn't enough, while almost half fret that they aren't a good enough parent during the week. However, parenting experts believe just 12 minutes a day may be enough for mothers and fathers to fully _ with their child -- as long as they ask the right questions. Child psychologist Dr Claire Halsey said asking a series of open-ended questions can help improve parents' relationship with their children. Among the questions recommended in the research are: \\"How many times have you smiled today -- what made you laugh?\\"; \\"Can you act out what you did at breaktime?\\"; \\"Who is taller -- mummy or your teacher?\\" and \\"What are the names of the toys you played with today?\\" Parents of older children are advised to start up a conversation with: \\"I've got a great story for you but I want one in return... you first!\\" or \\"Tell me some school gossip ... _ !\\" Dr Halsey, working with the makers of Ribena Plus, who commissioned the research, said: \\"There is no one as tough on their own parenting skills as a parent -- but this study shows there is no need for parents to be so harsh. It's hard for working parents to juggle all their responsibilities and it can feel like guilt is simply a parent's lot -- but it's absolutely not. By using clever tactics such as a little preparation alongside use of open-ended questions -- such as 'Tell me what the best bit about your day was?' -- parents can reduce the time worrying about chores and work and spend more time learning about their children's day.\\" Options: A Where are you off to with your friends this weekend?

This manner of questioning seeks to identify a specific geographical location or place. In particular, it's asking for a strait, which is a narrow passage of water connecting two seas or two other large areas of water. In this case, the question is asking for the precise strait that serves as the linkage between the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. Understanding how such a question is structured underlines how geography and our knowledge of the world around us can be queried. This can be especially valuable in contexts such as education, navigation, or even in trivia games. Knowing the specificities of the world's bodies of water and how they're interconnected can be pertinent in a wide range of situations. This type of question is not asking for a description (I) because it's not seeking descriptive information concerning a certain subject or event. Neither is it inquiring about an entity (II), as it's not focused on pinpointing a specific item, organization, or being. It's far from requesting an abbreviation (III), because it's not after the shortened form of a certain phrase or word. The question is not about a human (IV), given it's not interested in finding more about a certain person or group of individuals. Lastly, it does not require a numeric answer (V), because it's not asking for a quantifiable or numerical type of response.

He decides to take a one-week vacation in San Francisco, but this does not sit well with Paula Gibson (Pamela Britton), his confidential secretary and girlfriend, as he does not want her to accompany him.Bigelow meets and accompanies a group of randy men from a sales convention on a night on the town. At a \\"jive\\" nightclub called \\"The Fisherman\\", unnoticed by Bigelow, a stranger swaps his drink for another.

He visits a doctor at the general hospital, where tests reveal he swallowed a poison called \\"luminous toxin\\" for which there is no antidote.

Bob liked herbal tea a lot more than adderall because the","response":"natural benefits it offered not only provided a soothing sensation but also a plethora of health advantages that were not accompanied by the unwanted side effects often experienced with stimulant medications like Adderall. Herbal teas have been consumed for centuries across different cultures worldwide, and they are known for their numerous healing properties. Bob preferred herbal tea over Adderall as he discovered that these natural infusions were packed with antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals, which helped to boost his immune system, maintain overall health, and reduce the risk of chronic diseases. Furthermore, many herbal teas have calming and stress-relieving effects, such as chamomile, lavender, and lemon balm. These teas aid in relaxation, promote better sleep, and help reduce anxiety, which is especially important for individuals like Bob who struggled with the stimulating and sometimes unnerving experience of taking Adderall. On the other hand, Adderall is a prescription medication used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy. It is a stimulant that works by increasing the levels of certain neurotransmitters in the brain, which enhances focus, alertness, and impulse control in people with ADHD. While Adderall can be highly effective for some individuals, it comes with a range of potential side effects, including insomnia, dry mouth, loss of appetite, headaches, and anxiety. Long-term use of Adderall also raises concerns about the risk of dependence and addiction, making many people, like Bob, wary of using it as a long-term solution. Additionally, Adderall can also interact with other medications or existing health conditions, causing more severe side effects or complications. For those who are sensitive or have negative reactions to stimulants, herbal teas serve as a gentler, more natural alternative that comes without the risk of dependency or harmful interactions. Bob's preference for herbal tea over Adderall is a testament to the rise in popularity of natural therapies, which may prove to be a more sustainable and healthier choice for long-term wellness. As each individual's needs and preferences differ, it is essential to consult with a healthcare professional before making any decisions on which treatment options might be best for your situation. However, for Bob, the benefits of herbal tea far outweighed those of Adderall, especially since they provided him with a sense of well-being and comfort without introducing any harsh or harmful side effects."},{"question":"What happens next?

Recently, most attention has been given to the allegations concerning Russian interference in the 2016 US election: the hacking of the Democratic Party and leaking of damaging information; and the state-sponsored creation of fake newsites spreading false stories similarly detrimental to Hilary Clinton’s campaign. Unsettling as this activity is, it’s just the digital-age spin on the age-old black arts of spying and propaganda. More alarming, however, is the potential for “hard” cyberwarfare: attacks that go beyond hacks and misinformation, to directly disrupt the physical world – sabotage by software that can shut things down, blow things up, take actual lives. This is the stuff of Hollywood techno-thrillers, of course. But, as Zero Days, a disturbing documentary by the prolific Alex Gibney, spells out in clear detail, it has also been our reality for at least seven years. Gibney’s film raises several troubling issues, but its specific subject is the Stuxnet virus, a malware first spotted in the wild by an independent anti-virus advisor in Belarus in 2010. As the online security community grew alert to its presence, it became apparent Stuxnet was worming its malicious way through computers all around the world. But what the hell it was remained unknown. The first part of Zero Days recounts how analysts set to unpicking the code, and how two things gradually became clear. First, that the virus was of a dizzying sophistication, unimaginable without vast resources behind it – those of a nation state. Second, that, while it had shown up everywhere, Stuxnet was infecting one country more than any other: Iran. Add in clues provided by the geopolitical context – when Iran’s then-president Ahmadinejad was pugnaciously pushing his nuclear programme, while simultaneously declaring Israel would be “wiped off the face of the earth” – and the truth about Stuxnet was soon established. The virus was developed in a joint covert operation between the US and Israeli governments (with input from others, including the UK), designed to attack and cripple Iran’s nuclear facilities by making their centrifuges spin out of control. This, anyway, is the truth everyone who has investigated Stuxnet – or “Olympic Games” as the project was apparently known internally – agrees upon, and which Gibney offers overwhelming evidence in support of. But neither Israel nor America admit any involvement, a situation that lends this documentary a paranoid wonderland flavour. Gibney succeeds in securing on-camera interviews with many high-profile government officials, who then spend their time telling him they’re not allowed to tell him anything, or even admit anything happened. The implications of such secrecy itself becomes a subject, and the Stuxnet story would be fascinating enough if it stopped there. But, like any good worm, it doesn’t. “Olympic Games” was only the precursor to another planned secret cyberoperation codenamed “Nitro Zeus,” a larger-scale assault designed to cripple Iran’s infrastructure, since put on hold (for now). Meanwhile, Gibney traces how cyberwarriors working for Iran have retaliated, launching their own malware attacks against American banks and other institutions. This hugely timely film, then, is the story of the planet’s first cyber weapon and the weapons race it has let loose. Among the contributors, former CIA Director Michael Hayden makes the direct comparison with the bombing of Hiroshima: “This has a whiff of August 1945. Somebody just used a new weapon, and this weapon will not be put back in the box.” If you need something else to worry about this week, don’t miss it. Falling Water Amazon Prime Arriving today, this 10-part supernatural sci-fi is the latest in the wave of Big Mystery dramas ushered in by JJ Abrams’s Lost, in which the biggest mystery is whether or not it will turn out to have been worthwhile sitting through it all just to get to the end. The concept, which takes a while and a lot of explanation to reveal itself, is our three unrelated protagonists are all dreaming parts of the same dream: Tess, a trend-spotter by trade, is convinced she’s just had a baby, but maybe she dreamt it; Burton, a millionaire security expert, dreams about an enigmatic woman in red; and New York cop Taka is investigating a mass suicide while dreaming of when his sick elderly mother wasn’t sick or elderly. How all of these begin to connect remains to be seen, as the show slides slowly and fairly humourlessly along and “real” life collides with the dream logic world. It might begin to grip later, but the early episodes are a bit of a slog. Meet The Trumps: From Immigrant To President 10pm, Channel 4 For the obvious insane reason, there are a few Donald Trump documentaries kicking around this week. Look out on Monday for President Trump’s Dirty Secrets (Channel 4, 8pm), a Dispatches investigation into how, while promising to “drain the swamp” of outside interests in Washington DC, the incoming president has crammed his team with billionaire chums of the gas and oil conglomerates, and the implications of this for climate policy. Also on Monday, Panorama (8.30pm, BBC Two) considers Trump’s relationship with Vladimir Putin. Meanwhile, tonight’s profile offers a vivid thumbnail sketch of the 45th US President’s life and times. The family story begins with two tales of immigration: a German grandfather who arrived penniless in 1880s America and ended up running brothels in the gold rush; and Trump’s famously Scottish mother, who travelled from the Outer Hebrides to New York and worked as a maid before marrying Donald’s property tycoon father, Fred. Trivia note: Donald’s dad’s middle name was “Christ.” Hospital 9pm, BBC Two The kind of thing that makes you proud of the BBC, unless you’re a politician. This important and incredibly timely series – a forensic examination of the crisis facing the NHS as it plays out on the wards – continues with another episode set in St Mary’s hospital in Paddington, where, with nearly all of its 297 beds occupied, staff must discharge patients before any new ones can be admitted. But while the hospital struggles to discharge patients, new ones keep arriving. We follow the work of Sister Alice Markey, who is trying to discharge a homeless Polish man, but until she can find a translator to explain what will happen to him when he leaves, he must remain in a hospital bed. Elsewhere, after breaking her ankle, 91-year-old Dolly has been in hospital for three weeks, and waits for a place to become available in a rehabilitation centre. Meanwhile, after a two-month wait, a man arrives for a potentially lifesaving operation – but unless the hospital staff can clear a bed, it won’t go ahead. Unforgotten 9pm, STV We’re at the halfway stage of the series now, which can only mean one thing: time to bring out the Wendy Craig. The Butterflies legend was previously glimpsed in episode one, but her character, Joy Dunphy, comes into closer view tonight, as DCI Cassie Stuart (Nicola Walker) interviews her, hoping to learn just why Joy’s address was written on the travelcard found among the possessions of David Walker, the victim murdered 26 years ago. Brilliantly, this also means that Cassie finally goes on to speak with Joy’s daughter, Marion, played by Rosie Cavaliero, who does the full Cavaliero as the two of them have an uncomfortable exchange. (One of the best things in this second series is how it has paired Cavaliero and Nigel Lindsay as a couple, making it a spin-off from Mid Morning Matters With Alan Partridge, in my head at least.) Elsewhere, DS Sunny Khan (Sanjeev Bhaskar) meets the murdered man’s oldest friend, whose revelations shed new light on the case. A good episode tonight... President Trump: The Inauguration 4pm, BBC One/ STV After a long absence, The Twilight Zone returns with one of the most ambitious, expensive and controversial productions in broadcast history. Sci-fi writers have dabbled often with alternative history stories – among the most common is the “What If The Nazis Had Won The Second World War” setting – but this huge interactive virtual reality project, which will unfold on TV, in the press, and on Twitter over the next four years, sets out to build an ongoing alternative present. The story begins in a nightmarish version of 2017 in which huge sections of the US electorate have somehow been duped into voting to make Donald Trump president. It sounds far-fetched, and it is, but as it goes on it becomes more and more chillingly plausible. Today’s feature-length opener concentrates on the gaudy inauguration of President Trump, and the stirrings of protest and despair surrounding the ceremony, while pundits speculate gravely on what lies ahead. It’s a flawed piece, but a disturbing glimpse of the horrors we could stumble into, if we’re not careful. Urban Myths 7pm, Sky Arts This new comedy series uses some of the oddest stories doing the rounds about famous figures as the basis for strange little one-off plays. Future programmes involve Hitler, Samuel Beckett and (all together in the same episode) Marlon Brando, Elizabeth Taylor and Michael Jackson. But it begins in fine style with one of the most please-let-this-be-true legends in the enchanted life of Bob Dylan. The story goes that, in 1993, Dylan (played by Eddie Marsan) flew into London unannounced, planning to visit his pal, Eurythmic Dave Stewart, at his studio in Crouch End. Due to a slight mix up in the address, however, when Dylan got out of his cab, he wound up knocking on the door of a house around the corner. When a woman answered, Dylan asked if Dave was in, and she replied he’d popped out, but would be back soon, and he was welcome to wait. And so, when her husband – a plumber called Dave (Paul Ritter) – arrived home, he found Bob Dylan sitting drinking tea in his living room ... ||||| Add this Tweet to your website by copying the code below.

It was directed by Ishirō Honda and featured special effects by Eiji Tsuburaya. This iconic film introduced the world to the giant, radioactive dinosaur-like monster known as Godzilla, who has since become a pop culture phenomenon and a symbol of Japan's post-World War II fears of nuclear destruction. Gojira was a response to the anxieties and concerns felt in Japan during the early 1950s, especially after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 and the Castle Bravo nuclear test conducted by the United States in 1954. The movie's plot revolves around the destructive power of the nuclear age, as Godzilla is a beast awakened and mutated by atomic radiation. The film was a huge success in Japan and was later released in the United States in 1956 as \\"Godzilla: King of the Monsters!\\". This American adaptation featured English dubbing and additional scenes with actor Raymond Burr. Since the release of the original 1954 film, the Godzilla franchise has expanded to include over 30 films produced by Toho Co., Ltd., as well as numerous comic books, novels, video games, and an animated series. The Godzilla character has gone through various transformations and incarnations over the years, from being a metaphor for nuclear destruction to becoming a defender of Earth against various other monsters like Mothra, Rodan, and King Ghidorah. Godzilla's appearances in these movies have ranged from being a terrifying force of destruction to a more sympathetic, sometimes even humorous, character. The original 1954 Godzilla movie has been critically acclaimed for its stark, black-and-white visuals, haunting score, and powerful anti-nuclear theme. It remains an influential work in both Japanese cinema and the global monster movie genre, and its legacy endures even today, with modern films like Gareth Edwards' \\"Godzilla\\" (2014) and Hideaki Anno and Shinji Higuchi's \\"Shin Godzilla\\" (2016) paying homage to this classic film."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Here is a review left by a customer on a product.

Please remove spaces between words.","response":"DBalMax is a premium muscle gaining supplement that claims to offer impressive results for both men and women. The secret behind its effectiveness lies in its unique blend of high-quality and powerful ingredients. This supplement works to increase muscle mass, enhance strength, and boost performance during workouts by optimizing the body's natural anabolic processes. DBalMax features a potent mix of ingredients that work synergistically to provide users with noticeable improvements in muscle mass, strength, and performance. Let's take a close look at the key ingredients found in DBalMax and uncover the secret behind its muscle-gaining capabilities: 1. 20-Hydroxyecdysterone: This is a plant extract that has been found to have potent anabolic effects in the body. 20-Hydroxyecdysterone is responsible for increasing muscle mass, improving endurance, and promoting faster recovery time after workouts. Research has shown that this plant extract acts on muscle cells, leading to a higher rate of protein synthesis and enhanced nitrogen retention - both of which are crucial for muscle growth and repair. 2. Whey protein complex: Whey protein is one of the most popular choices of protein supplementation among fitness enthusiasts. It contains a fast-absorbing blend of essential amino acids that are easily utilized by the body. Whey protein complex speeds up the process of muscle recovery after strenuous workouts and helps build new muscle fibers, leading to an increase in muscle mass. Consuming adequate amounts of high-quality protein, such as whey protein found in DBalMax, ensures optimum muscle growth. 3. Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs): DBalMax consists of BCAAs like L-Leucine, L-Isoleucine, and L-Valine, which play a key role in muscle metabolism, growth, and repair. These essential amino acids are quickly absorbed into the bloodstream, stimulating protein synthesis and preventing muscle breakdown during workouts. BCAAs also help to reduce exercise-induced fatigue, allowing users to work out longer and push themselves harder during their training sessions. 4. Creatine: Creatine is an organic compound that is naturally found in muscle cells. It has been widely recognized for its exceptional ability to enhance muscular strength and power. Creatine supplementation works to increase the levels of phosphocreatine in the muscle cells, helping to produce more energy during high-intensity workouts. This improves overall performance and output while allowing the body to gain muscle mass. 5. L-Glutamine: This is another important amino acid present in DBalMax, whose primary function is to safeguard muscle mass and support the immune system. L-Glutamine is used for preventing muscle breakdown and aiding recovery after intense workouts. It also has the potential to increase the emission of the growth hormone, which further facilitates muscle gains. 6. L-Arginine: L-Arginine is an amino acid that promotes the production of nitric oxide in the body, resulting in increased blood flow and better nutrient delivery to muscles. This enhanced blood flow allows for increased muscle pumps, improved endurance, and superior performance during workouts. The secret of DBalMax's muscle gaining capabilities is in its unique blend of high-quality, potent ingredients that work together to deliver remarkable results. The combination of 20-Hydroxyecdysterone, whey protein, BCAAs, creatine, L-Glutamine, and L-Arginine allows users to experience improved muscle mass, heightened strength, and enhanced performance during workouts. The ingredients in DBalMax ensure the body's natural anabolic processes are optimized, providing a fast and effective way to build muscles and achieve fitness goals."},{"question":"Can you tell me the answer to who had the most assists in nba history??","response":"Of course! The basketball player with the most assists in NBA history is John Stockton. He played for the Utah Jazz and has a total of 15,806 assists.

So John was really good at helping his friends score points!"},{"question":"Explain simply why yes is the correct answer to: Given the sentence \\"A ski jumper enjoys winter fun.\\" is it true that \\"A skier likes the winter activities.\\"?. Explanation:","response":"Yes, the statement \\"A skier likes the winter activities\\" is true, given the sentence \\"A ski jumper enjoys winter fun.\\" Here's the explanation: Both sentences discuss individuals who participate in winter sports or activities. A ski jumper is a specific type of skier who competes in ski jumping, which is a winter sport. Since ski jumping is a winter activity, the enjoyment that the ski jumper feels can be assumed to apply to winter activities in general. Now, if we break down the sentence \\"A skier likes the winter activities\\", it aligns with the original sentence in the following ways: 1. A ski jumper is a skier: Although more specialized, a ski jumper is still a skier since they use skis as their primary equipment. 2. Enjoys vs. likes: Both words indicate a positive feeling, so we can understand that the ski jumper's enjoyment and the skier's liking are similar emotions in this context. 3. Winter fun vs. winter activities: Both phrases refer to activities one takes part in during the winter season. Ski jumping can be considered a winter activity, and thus, it also counts as winter fun. In conclusion, it can be inferred that since a ski jumper enjoys winter fun, it is true that a skier likes winter activities."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Article: David: I like blue.

Mom won't tolerate the noise of the drum in the house as the","response":"sound echoes throughout the entire space, making it nearly impossible for her to focus on anything she needs to do. In order for me to practice my drumming, I need to come up with a solution to minimize the disturbance it causes. Step 1: Identify possible noise reduction methods Before starting, it's essential to research various ways to minimize the noise of a drum while playing it indoors. This might include the use of soundproofing materials, the installation of acoustic panels, and switching to quieter drumming alternatives like electronic drums or drumming practice pads. Step 2: Evaluate each method Next, I will need to evaluate each of these methods by taking into account factors like their effectiveness, affordability, and ease of implementation. Additionally, I will need to ensure that the chosen solution doesn't negatively impact my drumming skills. Step 3: Consult with Mom Talking with Mom and discussing the possible solutions I've researched helps ensure that we agree on an approach that suits both her needs and mine. This step is important as it strengthens the relationship and understanding between us. Step 4: Implement the chosen solution Once Mom and I have agreed on a method to reduce the drumming noise, it's time to implement it. This might involve ordering the required soundproofing materials and installing them in the room where I practice. Alternatively, it could involve buying an electronic drum set or practice pads for practicing at a lower volume. Step 5: Test the effectiveness of the solution After the solution has been implemented, it's important to test how effective it is in reducing the drumming noise. This can be done by having Mom present while I practice. If she is satisfied with the noise reduction, we can consider the task a success. If not, it might be necessary to explore additional solutions until we find one that works. Step 6: Plan for routine maintenance Finally, for long-term effectiveness, it's crucial to establish a routine of maintaining the soundproofing materials or equipment. This might include checking the condition of the materials, cleaning the acoustic panels, or ensuring proper calibration of electronic drum sets. By regularly maintaining the solution, we can ensure the noise levels remain at an acceptable level for Mom."},{"question":"Write an article based on this summary: A coroner has recorded a verdict of accidental death on five members of a family who died in a house fire in Sheffield last year.","response":"Title: A Sad Accident: Five Family Members Lost in a House Fire Once upon a time in a city called Sheffield, there was a very sad accident.

Options: - Sentence A: \\"A mountain is higher than a valley\\" - Sentence B: \\"A beach is higher than a valley\\" A: Sentence B Explain how we arrive at this answer:","response":"Answer: Sentence B Explanation: Sentence B, \\"A beach is higher than a valley,\\" is against common sense because it tries to compare two different geographical features that are typically at different elevations. A valley is a low-lying area enclosed by higher land, such as hills or mountains. It is formed due to the continuous erosion by rivers or glaciers. Valleys are generally characterized by their lower elevation compared to the surrounding terrains. On the other hand, a beach is a landform alongside a body of water, such as an ocean, sea, or lake. It is made up of loose particles like sand, gravel, or pebbles, which are deposited through the action of waves, tides, or wind. Beaches can be found at various elevations, from sea level to cliffs, depending on the coastal environment. So, it's not accurate to generalize that a beach will be higher than a valley. In contrast, Sentence A, \\"A mountain is higher than a valley,\\" is consistent with common sense. A mountain is a large natural elevation of the Earth's surface typically much higher than a valley. By definition, a mountain has a greater elevation than the surrounding landscape, including any valleys."},{"question":"Read the text and determine if the sentence is true: Marques Ackerman (born 1 March 1996) is a South African first-class cricketer.

Britain's request for military assistance from the Dominions at the outbreak of the Chanak Crisis the previous year had been turned down by Canada and South Africa, and Canada had refused to be bound by the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne. After pressure from Ireland and South Africa, the 1926 Imperial Conference issued the Balfour Declaration, declaring the Dominions to be \\"autonomous Communities within the British Empire, equal in status, in no way subordinate one to another\\" within a \\"British Commonwealth of Nations\\". This declaration was given legal substance under the 1931 Statute of Westminster. The parliaments of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, the Irish Free State and Newfoundland were now independent of British legislative control, they could nullify British laws and Britain could no longer pass laws for them without their consent.

A: Oh, that sounds interesting! I'm always down to talk about music. What genres are you getting into? B: Well, I stumbled upon this Scandinavian folk music band called \\"Wardruna,\\" and they've blown me away. It's like a different world completely. A: Oh wow! I've heard about them. Their music is inspired by ancient Norse culture, right? B: Exactly! The use of traditional instruments combined with their deep, resonant vocals transports me to another realm. It makes me feel like I'm a Viking sailing through the Norse fjords. A: I can imagine that. I've been discovering some indie folk music myself. Have you heard of \\"Fleet Foxes\\"?

It's perfect for introspection or a long walk in the woods. B: Speaking of atmospheric music, I've also been delving into the world of ambient electronic music. There's this group called \\"Boards of Canada\\" that just captivates me. A: Oh, I think I've heard a couple of their tracks. Their music is quite hypnotic and has a nostalgic touch, doesn't it?

Post-rock is a genre that primarily focuses on instruments and builds upon layers of sound, right? B: That's right! Their live performance was a breathtaking experience. The way they manipulate their guitars to create waves of sound that slowly build up, only to crash down into a cathartic release, is extraordinary. A: I'd love to attend a post-rock concert. It must be an unforgettable experience to hear and feel those powerful waves of sound in person. B: It truly is. I think you'd really enjoy it. So, we've covered quite a few different genres today; it's always so interesting to explore new styles and see how talented artists can be. A: It sure is! Thank you for sharing your discoveries with me. I'll take some time to properly explore these artists, and who knows, maybe I'll find even more genres and musicians to discuss next time we meet.

Dawn was an American hip hop act, formed in 1988 by the brothers Attrell Cordes (known by his stage name Prince Be, sometimes credited as Prince Be the Nocturnal) and Jarrett Cordes (known as DJ Minutemix) in Jersey City, New Jersey. They earned significant crossover success in the early 1990s with music that merged hip hop, older soul, and more pop-oriented urban R&B. After recording their debut single \\"Ode to a Forgetful Mind\\" in 1988, P.M. Dawn released their first album Of the Heart, of the Soul and of the Cross: The Utopian Experience in 1991 to critical acclaim. The Cordes brothers' father died of pneumonia when they were children. Further family tragedy occurred when their baby brother, Duncan, drowned at the age of two. The two elder brothers were raised by their mother and their stepfather George Brown, a founding member of Kool & the Gang. Attrell Cordes began DJing parties and composing songs in ninth grade. Cordes, known by his stage name Prince Be, and his younger brother, Jarrett Cordes, known as DJ Minutemix, formed P.M. Dawn in 1988. The group's first demo tape was created using 600 that Prince Be had earned through his job as a night security guard at a homeless shelter. They first approached Tommy Boy Records, the rap music subsidiary of Warner Brothers, with their demo, but they were told that they were too much like alternative hip-hoppers De La Soul, and not hardcore or ghetto, and were turned away. Eventually, Warlock, an independent record label, issued a debut single, \\"Ode to a Forgetful Mind\\", in 1989, but it went unnoticed. The record label that released the single in the United Kingdom, Gee Street Records, found greater success. Gee Street mixed and marketed the song so that it earned considerable attention from music reviewers, and P.M. Dawn found themselves courted not just by Gee Street's head, Jon Baker, but also by most of the major UK record labels. Gee Street brought the brothers to London in 1990 to record tracks for an album; however, the label found itself facing bankruptcy during the recording. The entire Gee Street operation, along with P.M. Dawn's recording contract, was sold to the highest bidder, Island Records. Island issued a few more singles in the United Kingdom before releasing their debut album, Of the Heart, of the Soul and of the Cross: The Utopian Experience. what was the title?","response":"The title of P.M.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","response":"Step 1: Rinse the dishes before placing them in a dishwasher Justification: Rinsing the dishes helps to remove any large food particles and reduces the amount of work the dishwasher has to do, thus improving its overall efficiency. Step 2: Load glasses and plastic wear on the top rack Justification: Glasses and plastic items are more fragile and may be damaged if placed on the bottom rack. Top rack placement also helps ensure they receive a gentler wash. Step 3: Put plates, bowls, pots, and pans on the bottom rack Justification: The bottom rack is designed for sturdier items and allows for better water circulation to clean them better. Step 4: Place all the utensils in the utensil basket Justification: The utensil basket helps to segregate and organize utensils for better cleaning, prevents items from nesting, and ensures they don't fall through the racks. Step 5: Put detergent into the detergent holder Justification: Adding the appropriate amount of detergent is crucial in order for the dishwasher to clean the dishes effectively. Step 6: Close the door and push the start button Justification: Closing the door properly and selecting the appropriate wash cycle ensures the dishwasher functions as designed to provide optimal cleaning. Perturbation Hypothesis: Suppose less detergent is used. How will it affect helping the dishwasher to clean better? Less detergent will likely have a negative effect on the cleaning process. Adequate detergent is necessary to break down and remove food particles and grease from dishes. Too little detergent can result in poorly cleaned dishes and may require re-washing, thus reducing the overall efficiency of the dishwasher. In some cases, it may cause issues with the dishwasher itself, such as buildup of food particles or lingering odors. In conclusion, the perturbation of using less detergent may have a negative impact on the dishwasher's ability to effectively clean dishes and may, in some instances, even cause operational issues."},{"question":"Sentiment possibilities Options are: (a). negative; (b). positive;.

Naylor's boss, BR, sends Naylor to Los Angeles to bargain for cigarette placement in upcoming movies. Naylor takes along his young son Joey in hopes of bonding with him. The next day, Naylor is sent to meet with Lorne Lutch, the cancer-stricken man who once played the Marlboro Man in cigarette ads and is now campaigning against cigarettes. As his son watches, Naylor successfully offers Lutch a suitcase of money for his silence. During the drive back, Nick and Joey discuss the beauty of argument. Senator Finistirre, one of Naylor's most vehement critics, is the promoter of a bill to add a skull and crossbones POISON warning to cigarette packaging. During a televised debate with Finistirre, Naylor receives a death threat from a caller. Despite the threat, Naylor still plans to appear before a U.S. Senate committee to fight Finistirre's bill. Naylor is then kidnapped and covered in nicotine patches. Awakening in a hospital, he learns that the very high nicotine tolerance level resulting from his smoking has saved him from death by nicotine poisoning, but now he is hypersensitive to nicotine and can never smoke... Answer:","response":"What challenges does Nick Naylor face as a tobacco lobbyist when trying to increase cigarette sales, and how does his relationship with his son impact his actions throughout the movie?"},{"question":"Republican presidential candidate, Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., acknowledges the crowd before a political rally, Tuesday, July 19, 2011, in downtown Aiken, S.C. (AP Photo/The Augusta Chronicle, Rainier Ehrhardt) The first issue is obvious. Fitness for office — essentially “Can this person do the job for which they are running?” — is a basic building block of any campaign, particularly with a candidate like Bachmann who remains very much an unknown commodity for voters. If voters have doubts about whether a candidate is up to the job, everything else — positions on issues, likability, electability — take a back seat. Knowing that, Bachmann’s campaign sought to quickly stomp out the idea that the headaches were either not under control or had the potential to incapacitate her for extended periods of time. “Let me be abundantly clear — my ability to function effectively has never been impeded by migraines and will not affect my ability to serve as commander in chief,” she said in a statement. Bachmann is clearly hoping to put the story behind her although a handful of reports today — one from the New York Times and another from Politico — suggest that her struggles with headaches are both debilitating and well known among those who work for her. The Politico report in particular details a series of incidents that caused Bachmann to either miss votes or planned political events due to the headaches. Until the extent of Bachmann’s headaches — and the impact they have had on her congressional career — come fully to light, it’s hard to see the fitness for office questions disappearing completely. A look back at the history of health questions in the context of presidential campaigns suggests that while the headache questions may linger for Bachmann’s entire candidacy, they aren’t likely to derail it unless something more damaging comes out. The best known incident of health questions impacting a presidential campaign was in 1972 when reports surfaced that Missouri Sen. Tom Eagleton, South Dakota Sen. George McGovern’s vice presidential running mate, had suffered from depression and had been treated with electric shock therapy. While McGovern initially stood by Eagleton, the focus on whether the Missouri Democrat would be able to assume the office of the presidency dogged the campaign and eventually led Eagleton to step aside from the ticket. The Eagleton episode was the exception to the rule when it comes to the impact of health concerns in presidential politics, however. In 1984, there were questions about whether President Ronald Reagan was too old to stand for a second term — he was 73 — and his occasional forgetfulness in public kept the story going. But, Reagan masterfully turned his age into an asset during a debate with Sen. Walter Mondale and swept to a second term. In the 1992 presidential race, Massachusetts Sen. Paul Tsongas (D) had to deal with a series of questions about whether he was fit for office after battling cancer five years before. Tsongas came up short in that race though it’s hard to say that concerns about his health were at the root of his defeat. He died in 1997 after a re-occurrence of cancer. There are myriad other examples of politicians who faced health questions — John Kennedy in 1960 (overall ill health), John Kerry in 2004 (prostate cancer), John McCain in 2008 (age) to name a few. Some of those candidates won, others lost. But it’s hard to directly ascribe any of those outcomes to health questions. That leads us to the second less-covered-but-no-less-important problem that the Bachmann headache story shines a light on: the huge amount of turnover in her congressional staff. Both the original Daily Caller story as well as Politico’s follow up quote former Bachmann aides anonymously making the case that her migraine problems are real and problematic. And, this isn’t the first time that a former Bachmann staffer has raised doubts about her. Ron Carey, a former Bachmann chief of staff and former Minnesota Republican party chairman, has said publicly that the Congresswoman is neither electable nor ready for the job of president. Bachmann’s staff turnover is the stuff of legend on Capitol Hill. In the space of her first term in office, she had three different chiefs of staff and experienced any number of other staff departures as well. A cavalcade of disgruntled former aides (are there ever “gruntled” former aides?) willing to go public with questions and criticisms of Bachmann is decidedly problematic for her presidential candidacy. After all, if those who know (or knew) her best lack faith in her ability to do the job effectively, it will almost certainly force voters to re-examine their first, generally positive impressions of her. And, if you think that voters won’t hear about the criticisms launched against Bachmann by her former aides, you don’t follow campaigns very closely. It’s a lead pipe lock that her rivals are collecting those quotes in their opposition research files and will use them liberally on television ads if/when the time comes. The question for Bachmann is whether Carey’s comments and the migraine stories are the tip of the iceberg when it comes to former staffers venting or represent the full extent of the critique of Bachmann that will be offered by former employees. There’s little question that the migraine story — and the questions it raises about both Bachmann’s fitness for office and what role her former staff will play in the presidential race — is the first major bump in what has been a quick ascent in national politics for the Minnesota Republican to date. Putting the story behind her as quickly and completely as possible will be critical as she seeks to build momentum for the Ames Straw Poll next month.

Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) released a letter from Congress' attending physician Wednesday attesting to her health in an attempt to deflect growing attention to the issue of her migraine headaches. Dr. Brian P. Monohan wrote in a letter provided to the press by Bachmann's campaign that the congresswoman and presidential candidate has had \\"an extensive evaluation by both my office and by a board certified consulting neurologist.\\" The evaluations, Monahan wrote, have included \\"detailed labwork and brain scans all of which were normal.\\" \\"Your migraines occur infrequently and have known trigger factors of which you are aware and know how to avoid,\\" the letter continued. [READ THE FULL LETTER HERE] Monohan wrote that Bachmann can \\"control [the headaches] well\\" with sumatriptan and odansetron and added that \\"it has not been necessary for [Bachmann] to take daily scheduled medications to manage this condition.\\" The migraine story, since it was first reported Monday night by The Daily Caller, has become increasingly significant in the political conversation. Former Bush White House adviser Karl Rove said Wednesday that Bachmann should release her medical records to show supporters and potential voters that she is physically up to the challenge for running for president, much less holding the job. \\"It's going to be important for her to get her doctors out there, quickly, to provide the medical records and to provide the reassurance that people are going to want to have,\\" Rove said. News reports from Bachmann's campaign events have been dominated by questions about the issue over the last 36 hours. Meanwhile, former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, another 2012 hopeful who is struggling to make up ground against Bachmann ahead of the Aug. 13 straw poll in Ames, was asked questions about Bachmann's fitness for higher office. \\"I don't know enough about her particular medical situation to comment. I just don't have enough facts on me. I certainly would defer to the judgment of the medical professionals, but setting that aside all of the candidates, I think, are going to have to be able to demonstrate they can do all of the job all of the time,\\" Pawlenty said. \\"If you're going to be president of the United States you've got to be able to do the job every day, all the time. There's no real time off in that job,\\" he said. UPDATE: 5:41 p.m. - Republican presidential frontrunner Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, said at a campaign stop in Los Angeles late Wednesday that Bachmann's headaches should not be an issue. \\"There is no question in my mind that Michele Bachmann's health is in no way an impediment to her being able to serve as president,\\" Romney said when asked by reporters about the issue. \\"She and I have differing views, I'm sure, on some issues. We'll campaign in various states and express our views. But her health should not be an issue in a campaign. I have no question about that in my mind,\\" Romney said. Earlier in the day, Rep. Ron Paul (R-Tex) said that the news of Bachmann's migraines was \\"probably legitimate to know, and I don’t think that disqualifies somebody from running for office.\\" ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","response":"The issue of Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann's migraine headaches has raised concerns about her fitness for office. While health-related concerns have been part of previous presidential campaigns, it is essential for her to put the story behind her quickly and effectively to maintain momentum for her candidacy.

All the flights are booked, which forces him to take the train. The morning newspaper arrives and carries with it a detailed article on an altercation he'd been involved in. In the restaurant car, he meets Aditi Sengupta (Sharmila Tagore), a young journalist who edits a modern women's magazine, Adhunika.[2] Filled with contempt for the likes of him, she secretly plans to interview him because she thinks it'd attract more readers. He soon starts to reveal his personality, and also brings to surface the inner insecurities and his consciousness of the limitations of his 'powers'. Aditi initially takes notes, surreptitiously, but later on, out of empathy almost bordering on pity,stops. However, critical of the star, she interrogates him, leading to further introspection on his part. Slowly, his guilt about the way things turned out is very visible. Arindam also mentions Shankar-da, his mentor, who had never wanted Arindam to join films, being a strong opposer of the medium. He talks about his first day in film, and on the different experiences in faced with other workers in the field and some of the things that happened to them. Toward the end of the train journey, Arindam is drunk and feels a need to confide his wrongdoings. He asks the conductor to fetch Aditi. He begins to reveal the reason behind the altercation he was a part of, but Aditi stops him, as she has already guessed. It was an affair he'd had with one of his co-actors, Promila. Afraid that he might commit suicide, Aditi makes sure he returns to his cubicle, before going back to her own. As the star re-lives and examines his life with Aditi, a bond develops between them.

Often, events held before sporting events, such as pep rallies or team meetings, serve to boost morale and prepare teams for an upcoming event or competition. Pep rallies typically involve the entire student body, teams, and mascots, whereas team meetings generally occur only among team members, coaches, mascots, and related staff. But, these events are not necessarily interconnected with each other. In the given statement, the information provided is solely about the girl's volleyball game ending in a loss. This result does not directly correspond to or influence the events related to a boys' team meeting or pep rally. There could be several unrelated reasons why an all boys team would have a meeting with their mascot, such as preparing for their game or discussing strategy. To make any conclusions or connections between the two separate events, one would require additional information to establish a relationship between them. Here are some examples of how to gather more information to determine if there is a connection between the boys team pep meeting and the girls volleyball game: 1. Game schedules: Check if the boys have a game scheduled shortly after the girls' volleyball game. If a boys' game follows the girls' game, it could be possible that the boys' team is holding a meeting or pep rally to prepare. However, this does not guarantee that the team meeting is happening only because the girls' game ended in a loss. 2. Shared practice or event space: The boys' team may have scheduled a meeting with their mascot because they share the same space or resources with the girls' volleyball team. Once the girls' game ends, the boys may have planned to use the previously occupied area for their meeting, irrespective of the game's outcome. 3. Interteam relationships or support: Determine if there is a tradition of support between the girls' volleyball team and the boys' team, regardless of the sport they play. If so, the boys may want to meet for a pep rally in response to the girls' loss to show solidarity and encouragement. But, again, this connection cannot be confirmed solely based on the given statement. In conclusion, while it might be tempting to assume a connection between the two separate aspects, one cannot reasonably do so without gathering further information and understanding the context.

And having done it all, Swanson finds himself most comfortable calling the shots rather than carrying out someone else's orders. \\"I just like having the ability to lead and make decisions,\\" Swanson said, during a recent meeting in his Rockefeller Plaza office. \\"I realized when you were talent, you were always subject to the whims and fancy of the general manager. I wanted to be that guy.\\" And, as head of Ch. 4, Swanson definitely is that guy. From his corner office, decorated with sports memorabilia from his past life as head of ABC sports and a broadcaster in Chicago, Swanson presides over one of the strongest stations in town. Though No. 2 overall, Ch. 4 is in a tough battle with WABC/Ch. 7 for the top spot in ratings and revenue. Having worked on both the network and local levels, Swanson said he prefers the local side, because of its potential for more hands-on involvement, and its relative distance from the corporate bureacracy that permeates network television. \\"It's the community involvement and the ability to have more control over your destiny,\\" Swanson said. \\"You have more of an ability as president of a station to do things than you would as a network head.\\" Swanson joined the station in July 1996 after a 10-year run as president of ABC sports, a period that at times included simultaneous responsibility for ABC's daytime and children's programing. For the former Marine, it was a return to his local broadcasting roots. The 59-year-oldexecutive has been enamored of the small screen and journalism since he was a kid growing up in California. He started out as the sports editor of his eighth-grade newspaper and was drawn to TV early on, even though his family didn't get one until much later. \\"I thought TV was the place to go,\\" he said. \\"I thought it was the greatest instructional tool and entertainment device.\\" After a tour with the Marines from 1961 to 1963, Swanson broke into television as a reporter for WMT in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. He then spent two years as a news producer and assignment manager at WGN radio in Chicago. Later he moved on to WMAQ-TV in Chicago as an assignment editor and then a sportscaster. From there, his career turned toward management and to positions at KABC-TV in Los Angeles, WLS-TV in Chicago (where he helped create \\"The Oprah Winfrey Show\\") and then on to ABC. \\"I learned a great deal about how to manage people when I was in the Marine Corps,\\" said Swanson, who with his wife, Kathy, has three grown children and four grandchildren. \\"To be a news director or network head, you have to have some understanding of what it takes to manage people.\\" As for what's ahead at Ch. 4, Swanson says the station needs to continue to build its news image and increase its local programing, citing examples such as the weekly \\"Jets Game Day\\" and coverage of events like the West Indian/American Day Carnival. \\"We've shown some improvement,\\" he said. \\"But these stations are like big battleships they turn slowly.\\" Summary:","response":"Dennis Swanson, president and general manager of WNBC/Ch. 4, has a unique perspective on the television industry, with experience in front of the camera, behind it, and in the corporate suites. Swanson, who began his career as a reporter and sportscaster, has also served as president of ABC Sports and held management positions at KABC-TV and WLS-TV. Preferring the local side of the industry, Swanson believes station presidents have more control over their destinies and a greater ability to make an impact on the community.

(CNN) -- A 22-year-old man from Pakistan hopes to soon swim the English Channel with an American friend -- but first he's got to navigate the currents of bureaucracy. College teammates David Gatz (left) and Usman Javaid want to swim the English Channel for charity. Usman Javaid, an Ohio college student who has won national swimming titles in his native Pakistan, wants to swim the channel with his best friend, David Gatz, a fellow member of the swim team at Ohio Wesleyan University in Delaware, Ohio. They want to honor their international friendship by working together to accomplish a great feat: a relay across the English Channel.

The visa application required evidence that Javaid would return to Pakistan after completing the challenge. However, the British authorities were not convinced by the documentation provided, and Javaid's visa application was denied. Disappointed but not defeated, Javaid and Gatz decided to persist in their plans and began exploring other options. They reached out to their local representatives and sought support from different organizations, including the Ohio Wesleyan University, which has expressed its backing to the duo tirelessly. College officials and faculty members have written letters vouching for Javaid's character, emphasizing his academic achievements and commitment to swimming. The pair also garnered support from the larger swimming community, including prominent international athletes and organizations. They believed that the attention their relay swim would receive would help raise awareness and funds for various charities, including those focused on providing clean water and education to underprivileged communities in Pakistan and around the world. Aware of the increased attention that their case was garnering, Gatz and Javaid felt a sense of urgency to secure the necessary permissions. They knew that overcoming the bureaucratic obstacles would be crucial if they wished to carry out their ambitious plans. Javaid then submitted an appeal to the British consulate, providing supplementary evidence to support his claim of temporary stay in the UK for the purpose of the Channel swim. As they awaited a decision on their appeal, Gatz and Javaid continued their rigorous training, motivated by their charitable initiatives and a determination to complete their relay swim, which they called \\"Swimming for Unity.\\" They focused on overcoming physical challenges and honing their skill, pushing their limits in both open water and pool practices. Finally, after months of advocacy, efforts, and anticipation, Usman Javaid received the good news that his visa appeal had been approved. The British consulate granted him a visitor's visa, allowing him to enter the UK to pursue the relay swim. With the bureaucratic obstacles finally behind them, Gatz and Javaid moved forward with their plans, finalizing logistics, and intensifying their training schedule in preparation for the Channel swim relay. They continued to engage supporters and publicize their cause, reminding everyone of the spirit of friendship, unity, and perseverance behind their quest.

I will select \\"Effects of exercise on mental health\\" as my topic because it is a widely researched area, and it will provide ample room for creating an interesting context and hypothesis. Step 2: Develop a context To develop a context, I will give a brief background on mental health and exercise. I will explain how mental health is a growing concern in today's society and how various methods are used to address these concerns. One such method that has been receiving attention is exercise, as it has been suggested to have potential benefits for mental well-being. Context: In today's fast-paced society, mental health concerns such as stress, anxiety, and depression are increasingly common. Various approaches, including therapy and medication, have been used to address these challenges. Studies have shown that exercise can have significant, positive effects on mental health, improving mood and cognitive function. As a result, promoting physical activity is increasingly being recognized as an effective strategy for maintaining and improving mental well-being. Step 3: Formulate a hypothesis Now that I have established a context, I will create a hypothesis that is related to the context. The hypothesis should be clear, specific, and testable, making a claim that can be supported or refuted through empirical research. Hypothesis: Engaging in moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, such as jogging or cycling, for at least 30 minutes per day, five days a week, will lead to a significant reduction in symptoms of depression and anxiety in adults. This hypothesis is clear and specific, stating that certain types of exercise, for a certain duration and frequency, can have a particular effect on mental health outcomes in adults. This hypothesis can be tested through experimental studies where participants are assigned to different exercise regimes and their mental health outcomes are tracked over time."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you're given a statement, the genre to which that statement belongs, and a label indicating if the statement should be agreed with (entailment), disagreed with (contradiction), or neither (neutral).

At the same time, the former head of a BBC children’s charity, Children in Need, said that, even a decade ago, suspicions about Mr. Savile were so prevalent that “we didn’t want him anywhere near” the organization. Dame Janet’s inquiry is one of two that the BBC has commissioned into the scandal. It began on the first anniversary of Mr. Savile’s death at age 84, and a day after the British police arrested a former pop star, Paul Gadd, better known as Gary Glitter, in the widening scandal. Mr. Gadd has been accused of abusing a teenage girl on BBC premises. The scandal has exploded since ITV, a BBC rival, broadcast a documentary this month about Mr. Savile and his alleged abuses, opening a floodgate of complaints. The police now say 300 potential victims have come forward. Much soul-searching and public anger have focused on how Mr. Savile’s misconduct appears to have been widely known among colleagues and police officers who did little or nothing to restrain or prosecute him. Sharpening the questions about the BBC’s conduct, one of the network’s current affairs programs, “Newsnight,” began and then canceled an investigation into Mr. Savile late last year. Bernard Hogan Howe, the commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, said on Monday that though Mr. Savile was accused a number of times while he was alive, police forces in different parts of Britain never put the picture together. Much attention has focused, too, on why successive heads of the BBC have said they were unaware of the rumors about Mr. Savile within the organization. They include the current director general, George Entwistle, and his predecessor, Mark Thompson, the incoming president and chief executive of The New York Times Company. Mr. Thompson was the organization’s head when the “Newsnight” investigation was canceled, a time when other BBC departments were planning holiday tributes to Mr. Savile. The extent of the mistrust surrounding Mr. Savile emerged from a BBC interview on Monday with Sir Roger Jones, a former BBC governor and the head of the Children in Need charity, who said that he had suspicions more than a decade ago, according to an article on the BBC Web site. “I think we all recognized he was a pretty creepy sort of character,” Mr. Jones said in the article. “We took the decision that we didn’t want him anywhere near the charity, and we just stepped up our child protection policies — which again would have put him at risk if he tried anything.” Still, he acknowledged that the charity had only suspicions against Mr. Savile. “If you’re going to go on the attack and make claims against him, then you’d need evidence, hard evidence that simply wasn’t there,” Mr. Jones was quoted as saying. The other inquiry, led by Nick Pollard, a former head of a rival network, Sky News, is looking specifically into the circumstances surrounding the cancellation of the “Newsnight” investigation. Compared with the public inquiries into the behavior of tabloid reporters and editors in Britain in the phone hacking scandal, which have unfolded in a glare of publicity, the inquiries into the Savile matter at the BBC seemed more opaque. A BBC spokesman and a person representing Dame Janet each said her inquiry began on Monday, but they declined to say who would go before the inquiry, where it was being conducted or whether it would operate in public. In response to a reporter’s questions, Dame Janet’s representative, Carolyn E. Pepper of the law firm Reed Smith, released a statement saying: “Dame Janet’s view is that it is not appropriate for her to give interviews or provide comment regarding the review at this time. Press information will be issued in due course.” Her inquiry is meant to gather testimony from people who have accused Mr. Savile of abusing them or who have raised concerns about his activities. It is also supposed to examine “the extent to which BBC personnel were or ought to have been aware of unlawful and/or inappropriate conduct by Jimmy Savile on BBC premises or on location for the BBC,” the BBC said. She is also supposed to determine whether the BBC’s child protection and whistle-blowing policies are adequate. The BBC has also said it is looking into nine more recent cases related to a variety of sexual harassment and abuse cases, but it has not said who was involved in them. Both her inquiry and Mr. Pollard’s investigation are supposed to be independent of BBC control, although both were appointed by BBC supervisory bodies. What are the most important parts of this text?","response":"The most important parts of this text are: 1. Dame Janet Smith, a retired appeals court judge, has opened an inquiry into the Jimmy Savile sexual abuse case. This inquiry is one of two that the BBC commissioned into the scandal. 2. The British police have received 300 potential victim complaints since a documentary about Mr. Savile and his alleged abuses was broadcast by ITV. 3. The Metropolitan Police commissioner, Bernard Hogan Howe, has stated that while Mr. Savile was accused several times during his lifetime, police forces in different parts of Britain never pieced the information together. 4. Successive heads of the BBC claim to have been unaware of the rumors about Mr. Savile during their tenure. 5.

When segmented properly, the words become: The revolutionary DVD PROJ File Analysis Tool scans, analyzes, and reports back every detail about your DVD PROJ file. Here's the context of what each segment refers to: - \\"The revolutionary DVD PROJ File Analysis Tool\\" appears to be a name of a software or tool. Judging by the name, this tool seems to be a new or innovative (revolutionary) software solution that's designed to work with DVD PROJ files specifically. DVD refers to Digital Versatile Disc, and PROJ may be a file extension related to project files but it is not usually associated with DVDs, so it might be software-specific. File Analysis Tool suggests that it examines or works with these files in some manner, most likely to extract or process some sort of data. - \\"scans, analyzes, and reports back every detail about your DVD PROJ file\\" - This segment of the sentence tells us about the functionalities of the software. According to this, the tool performs three major operations. It scans the DVD PROJ files, presumably to gather and identify data. It then analyzes this data, which could involve interpreting, organizing, or possibly manipulating it in some way. Finally, it reports back every detail about the DVD PROJ file. This suggests that the tool provides the user with a detailed output of what it found or did during the scanning and analysis, giving complete insight into the file's contents, structure or any alteration performed. So, when combined together, we can understand that \\"The revolutionary DVD PROJ File Analysis Tool scans, analyzes, and reports back every detail about your DVD PROJ file\\" refers to an innovative software solution that can work with DVD PROJ files, scanning and analyzing them, and then providing a detailed report about these files."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Law enforcement officers are often unfamiliar with information technology, and so lack the skills and interest in pursuing attackers. There are also budgetary constraints. It has been argued that the high cost of technology, such as DNA testing, and improved forensics mean less money for other kinds of law enforcement, so the overall rate of criminals not getting dealt with goes up as the cost of the technology increases. In addition, the identification of attackers across a network may require logs from various points in the network and in many countries, the release of these records to law enforcement (with the exception of being voluntarily surrendered by a network administrator or a system administrator) requires a search warrant and, depending on the circumstances, the legal proceedings required can be drawn out to the point where the records are either regularly destroyed, or the information is no longer relevant. Two neighboring police Departments took different approaches to fighting crime, Greenville P.D. did not invest in DNA testing, improved forensics, and information technology, while Grayville took extensive measures of that nature. Which P.D. took a more efficient approach in fighting crime? Answer:","response":"The question doesn't provide sufficient information to definitively determine which police department, Greenville or Grayville, took a more efficient approach in fighting crime. The efficiency of their crime-fighting approaches would be determined by their respective crime rates, the resolution rates of their crime cases, and other crime-related statistics, none of which are mentioned in the given information. However, it's worth noting that while Grayville PD's investment in DNA testing, improved forensics, and information technology could potentially enhance their crime-solving capabilities, it might also strain their budget as per the argument mentioned in the question. On the contrary, Greenville PD not investing in such technologies might free up resources for other law enforcement activities, but also might limit their ability to effectively solve some complex crimes. The end results will rely on various factors including but not limited to their management of resources, effectiveness of their chosen strategies and the specific crime problems in their jurisdictions. For a comprehensive evaluation, we need comparative data reflecting the overall effectiveness and efficiency of their different methodologies."},{"question":"Pick one category for the following text.

A marsupial has a short gestation period, typically shorter than its estrous cycle, and gives birth to an undeveloped newborn that then undergoes further development; in many species, this takes place within a pouch-like sac, the marsupium, located in the front of the mother's abdomen. This is the plesyomorphic condition among viviparous mammals; the presence of epipubic bones in all non-placental mammals prevents the expansion of the torso needed for full pregnancy.

With an intriguing plot, high-end special effects, and an A-list cast, one would imagine that it would be difficult to go wrong. However, unfortunately, the film disappoints on multiple levels, leaving the audience feeling underwhelmed and unfulfilled. The story follows the protagonist, played by the charismatic Tom Johnson, who embarks upon a thrilling journey to save the world from an imminent disaster. It is a premise that has been recycled countless times in cinema, yet it always has the potential to engage viewers if executed correctly. Sadly, in A Disappointing Adventure, the worn-out formula falls flat, as the plot runs out of steam midway through the film. The usually outstanding Tom Johnson seems to be phoning in his performance and appears to be disinterested throughout the entire film. His portrayal of the hero lacks depth and comes across as one-dimensional. The lack of chemistry with his on-screen partner, portrayed by Jane Adams, does not help either. Their relationship fails to evoke any heartfelt emotions and feels entirely forced. The film's visual effects, though technically impressive, are undercut by the inadequate storyline. Rather than immersing the audience in the fantastical world that the director intended, these graphic spectacles feel like distractions meant to compensate for lazy storytelling. On more than one occasion, the action sequences felt disconnected from the plot, leaving audience members feeling jolted and unengaged. Furthermore, the pacing of the film is erratic and inconsistent. The first half of the movie is a slow, tedious crawl that drags on unnecessarily, while the latter half feels overly rushed, making it difficult for the audience to connect with the protagonist's journey. The poorly edited and convoluted final act leaves viewers with more questions than answers, resulting in a frustrating and unsatisfying experience. In conclusion, A Disappointing Adventure is precisely that - a disappointing affair that falls short of its promise and potential. Hindered by a lackluster plot, weak performances, and a misguided reliance on visual spectacle, the film should serve as a cautionary tale for future endeavors in the genre. Though it had all the makings of a blockbuster success, A Disappointing Adventure ultimately stumbles and makes for an underwhelming cinema experience that viewers are better off skipping."},{"question":"5 years ago 05:04 drtuber college, student, party Please write the text above using proper case.","response":"Step 1: Identify the segments of text that require case adjustment. The text is \\"5 years ago 05:04 drtuber college, student, party\\". Here, '5 years ago 05:04' is a timestamp or time reference and doesn't require any case adjustments since it contains numerals and doesn't violate any casing rules. 'drtuber' likely refers to a name or specific entity which, per English grammar rules, requires capitalization at the beginning of it. 'college', 'student', and 'party' are likely tags or categories akin to hashtags. Depending on context, these may or may not require capitalization, but it's conventional for these to start with a capital letter as it enhances readability. Step 2: Convert the lower case parts to title or sentence case. So, considering all the points above, the \\"drtuber\\", \\"college\\", \\"student\\", and \\"party\\" should be rewritten with a capital letter at the start of each word. While these aren't sentences requiring words live verbs or objects, the text is more readable and presentable when we convert the start of these elements to upper case.

She is the daughter of the Broadway musical star John Raitt and his first wife, the pianist Marjorie Haydock, and was raised in the Quaker tradition. She began playing guitar at Camp Regis-Apple Jack in Paul Smiths, NY, at an early age. Later she gained notice for her bottleneck-style guitar playing. Context: In the fall of 1970, She played with her brother David on stand up Bass with Mississippi Fred McDowell at the Philly Folk Festival as well as Opening for John Hammond at the Gaslight Cafe in New York, she was seen by a reporter from Newsweek, who began to spread the word about her performance. Scouts from major record companies were soon attending her shows to watch her play. She eventually accepted an offer from Warner Bros., who soon released her debut album, Bonnie Raitt, in 1971. The album was warmly received by the music press, with many writers praising her skills as an interpreter and as a bottleneck guitarist; at the time, few women in popular music had strong reputations as guitarists. While admired by those who saw her perform, and respected by her peers, Raitt gained little public acclaim for her work. Her critical stature continued to grow but record sales remained modest. Her second album, Give It Up, was released in 1972 to universal \\"acclaim\\"; though many critics still regard it as her best work, it did not change her commercial fortunes. 1973's Takin' My Time was also met with critical acclaim, but these notices were not matched by the sales. Raitt was beginning to receive greater press coverage, including a 1975 cover story for Rolling Stone, but with 1974's Streetlights, reviews for her work were becoming increasingly mixed. By now, Raitt was already experimenting with different producers and different styles, and she began to adopt a more mainstream sound that continued through 1975's Home Plate. In 1976, Raitt made an appearance on Warren Zevon's eponymous album with his friend Jackson Browne and Fleetwood Mac's Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks.

Reason I say it was the dumbest is because I still acknowledge that it’s not my kind of dating scene even though I ended up meeting the love of my life through the app. Other than that? Nothing was wrong or dumb. I have done nothing much because the man I am currently dating sent me a superlike after I was on the app for less than 12 hours. I joined, created profile, went through possible matches, and then went to bed. I didn’t have enough time to do something dumb. Now my boyfriend on the other hand was on the app for 4–5 months prior to me joining and him finding me. His story is that he had been in there long enough to end up matching with some bots (robots that somehow end up joining or hacking the app. I have not a clue how) that he would have conversations with to test if they were legitimate people. He would also match with different people who would either immediately block him because he came as weird or he would block them because they came off as weird. When he found me, what he saw in my profile was that I was local, I was a legitimate person because I knew someone that he knew through Facebook, and I had multiple pictures of myself that looked genuine. I also had a description where I stated my intention for using the app which was that I was looking for a serious relationship. What he did after I connected with him was talk to me and then test me as the conversation progressed. How did he test me? He told a corny joke which I laughed to. If I hadn’t have found his joke funny, he probably wouldn’t have asked me out on a date. I hope that answers your question. I know it wasn’t very…. eventful.

Sadly, the weather has been pretty gray and rainy so far – in fact the forecast has it cloudy and rainy every day until after we leave. So I was pleasantly surprised to be awakened by the sun peeking around the edges of the curtain in my room, especially after the weather yesterday in which the wind gusted 35-40 mph – hard enough to blow the patio furniture around on my balcony (and at one point, catching a chair and flipping it against the rail so hard that if the rail had been just a bit shorter, it might have gone over). Our group all agreed that we should take advantage of the nice weather and head to the old city walls and St. Lawrence Fort (Lovrijenac). We spent several hours walking the walls and climbing up and down stairs. The sun sparkled off the Adriatic Sea and cast a warm glow on the orange and red tiled roofs in old city. It was such a change from the gray and foggy gloom of the last couple of days and it created a completely different mood, at least for me. From foreboding and dark to welcoming and bright. The clouds eventually rolled back in again, but the sunshine was nice while it lasted. We walked over to the fort and I took these shots of the city wall and from across the small cove between them. If you look closely in a few shots, you’ll see a stone pier, which is just between the Pile Gate (pronounced “peel-ay”) at the city walls and the fort.

The information provided in the premise is centered around Clinton's actions involving Arafat, the Palestinian leader, and Israel in the context of the peace process. The two key actions mentioned in the premise include: 1) Rolling out the carpet to enhance Arafat's prestige: This statement implies that Clinton was trying to increase Arafat's reputation and standing by offering him a warm reception and support. This can be interpreted as an attempt to strengthen Arafat's position in delicate peace negotiations and promote a peaceful resolution between the Palestinian Authority and Israel. 2) Sending Israel a warning not to screw up the peace process by provoking further conflict: Clinton's actions are also clearly focused on ensuring that Israel remains committed to the peace process and does not engage in behaviors that could disrupt progress or escalate tensions. This statement conveys the importance the Clinton administration placed on the peace process and their willingness to address any potential threats to its success. Given this context, the hypothesis involving North Korea is not supported by the premise. It is important to note that the premise does not mention North Korea or any other country beyond Palestine and Israel. The actions and intentions of the Clinton administration, as stated in the premise, are centered on achieving peace in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In summary, the hypothesis \\"Administration officials said Clinton was sending a warning to North Korea.\\" is not true based on the provided premise. The information given focuses on Clinton's efforts and intentions towards facilitating peace between Israel and Palestine, and does not involve North Korea in any way.

Babysitter Jeannie (voiced by Julie Bennett) is instructed to look after the baby while his mother (also voiced by Julie Bennett) goes out. However, Jeannie pays more attention to talking on the telephone apathetically than her actual babysitting. In the midst of Tom and Jerry's usual fighting, they see the baby crawling out of its pram. Any attempt to return the baby to where it came from simply results in the baby escaping from the pram again. During one escape, the baby crawls into Spike's dog house. Tom accidentally grabs Spike instead of the baby, and is promptly attacked, scratched and bit. This time, Tom angrily brings the baby back to Jeannie herself, who hits Tom over the head with a broom, thinking that Tom has taken the baby away from her. Realising that the baby is no longer worth the trouble, Tom does nothing the next time that it crawls from its pram. However, he and Jerry are forced to react after the baby crawls down to the street and into a 100-story mixed-use skyscraper construction site.

In Washington, in order to be a real estate agent you must: Be at least 18 years of age Have at least a high school diploma or the equivalent, such as a GED You will have to engage in nearly two years of education to get your real estate license in Washington. Use that time to your advantage to gain experience in the field. While not directly related to obtaining your license, certain experiences are invaluable to your success as an agent. Try to get an internship or office job in a real estate firm. Even an administrative position that seems only tangentially related to buying and selling houses can teach you hard work and give you a sense of what the industry is like. Not to mention, if you make a good impression on someone in the industry you could snag a job after you get your license. Ask an experienced real estate agent if you can shadow them for a day or week to see what the industry is like just to make sure this career path is really for you. In Washington, there are specific educational requirements you must complete before taking the real estate exam. Make sure the courses you enroll in are approved by the Washington State Department of Licensing. If you're unsure if a class is approved, give the Department of Licensing a call during office hours just to be sure. You don't want to invest time and money in a course that won't be accepted when you apply to take the exam. A list of approved curriculum is found on the Washington Department of Licensing website, as well as some approved schools. Classes are available online, through colleges such as Kaplan, and in-person at universities and community colleges. Find a route that works for you and enroll. Fees vary from program to program, but tuition can cost as much as 300. Be prepared to spend some money during the process of obtaining your license. You must complete 90 total hours of coursework within a 2-year time frame. These courses are extensive and demanding, so be prepared to commit. Your 90 hours include a 60-hour course in real estate fundamentals. This course is an overview of the real estate trade. You will learn about various real estate firms and what they do in communities. You will learn about policies like contract laws, fair housing laws, property ownership rights, and listing agreements. There's also an extensive overview of the buying and selling process, and a good deal of basic real estate vocabulary you must commit to memory. The additional 30 hours are comprised of a course in real estate practices. Here, you will learn about basic business skills and procedures in the real estate world. You will learn how to evaluate, price, and market property as well as a variety of negotiation and sales techniques. You will also learn about the closing process and how to conduct real estate math. The state exam is hard. Knowing the information and having completed the necessary coursework does not guarantee you will pass. The structure of the questions and specific vocabulary can throw even the most well-researched test taker. Exam prep, whether through software or a test prep class, can help you get a passing score on the real estate exam. Free practice exams are available online, but are not subject to as rigorous review as paid courses and prep work. Online universities offer test prep courses for a variety of state real estate exams, including Washington. Self-guided exam prep guides are available for purchase online, which include information on the format of the test, information you'll need to know, and a variety of practice exams. You can purchase exam prep books, either on Amazon or from a local bookstore, that help with real estate test prep. However, make sure you get the most recent edition as real estate exams are subject to change. Going to a used bookstore is not the best option if you're going the book route, as you're likely to find a dated exam guide. Summary:","response":"1. Ensure you meet the basic requirements to be a real estate agent in Washington: at least 18 years old and having a high school diploma or GED. 2.

Michael Kirby, who led the U.N. Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in North Korea, held a meeting in New York on Wednesday and engaged in a fiery debate with envoys from North Korea. Two North Koreans who had escaped the country also spoke. The meeting came just hours after American Jeffrey Fowle landed in Ohio after being freed from the hermit kingdom. Kim asked Kirby if he had ever read the North Korean constitution, which, OPTIONS: - American said does not allow for human rights violations. - Human Rights in North Korea said does not allow for human rights violations. - International Criminal Court said does not allow for human rights violations. - Jeffrey Fowle said does not allow for human rights violations. - Kim Jong Un said does not allow for human rights violations. - Michael Kirby said does not allow for human rights violations. - New York said does not allow for human rights violations. - North Korea said does not allow for human rights violations. - North Korean said does not allow for human rights violations. - North Koreans said does not allow for human rights violations. - Ohio said does not allow for human rights violations. - Security Council said does not allow for human rights violations. - U.N. said does not allow for human rights violations. - U.N.

Question: suppose More rain than usual happens, how will it affect MORE regulation of blood sugar level being needed. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","response":"C: no effect Step 1: Analyze the given process and determine if it has any connection to the weather. The given process is about blood sugar regulation. It describes how the pancreas and liver respond to a decrease in blood sugar levels, and there is no mention of weather or environmental factors affecting this process. Step 2: Evaluate if increased rainfall has any direct impact on blood sugar regulation. Rain is an external factor that has no direct impact on the biochemistry of the human body. Therefore, more rainfall would not directly affect the blood sugar regulation process. Step 3: Assess if increased rainfall might have any indirect impact on blood sugar regulation. More rain than usual might cause changes in lifestyle, such as reduced outdoor activities. However, this indirect influence would depend on individual choices and reactions, rather than a causal link between rain and blood sugar levels. It's also worth noting that people can still maintain their blood sugar levels through proper diet, medication, and indoor physical activities, regardless of the weather. Step 4: Reach the conclusion. Considering that there is no direct link between increased rainfall and blood sugar regulation, and any indirect impact would be subjective and depend on individual choices, the answer is C: no effect. The occurrence of more rain than usual should not have a direct influence on the need for more (or less) blood sugar regulation."},{"question":"Q: who is considered to be the first modern pop princess?

Born Madonna Louise Ciccone on August 16, 1958, she is an American singer, songwriter, actress, and entrepreneur who gained fame in the 1980s and has consistently remained one of the most iconic figures in pop music. Madonna emerged on the scene with her self-titled debut album in 1983, which produced the hit singles \\"Holiday,\\" \\"Lucky Star,\\" and \\"Borderline.\\" Her next album, \\"Like a Virgin\\" (1984), achieved massive success, cementing her status as a global pop sensation. The title track from the album became her first No. 1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and the album eventually went diamond with sales of over 10 million copies in the United States. Madonna's influence on pop music extends beyond her chart-topping hits. She is often credited with transforming the landscape of music by bringing female sexuality to the forefront and breaking down barriers for other female artists.

Is \\"The liquor monopoly lasted only from 98 to 81 BC, and the salt and iron monopolies were eventually abolished in early Eastern Han.\\" the correct answer?","response":"The question you asked is about the year Huo Guang died, while the statement provided is about the duration of the liquor monopoly and the eventual abolishment of the salt and iron monopolies. The two topics are unrelated, so the statement is not the correct answer to your question. Huo Guang, a renowned Chinese statesman and politician, was born in 110 BC and died in 68 BC. He served during the Western Han dynasty of China and played a crucial role in consolidating the rule of Emperor Wu. Following the death of Emperor Wu, Huo Guang acted as a regent for three successive emperors. He was instrumental in preserving the stability of the Western Han dynasty, particularly through his vision and outstanding political skills. Now, to address the statement you provided: \\"The liquor monopoly lasted only from 98 to 81 BC, and the salt and iron monopolies were eventually abolished in early Eastern Han.\\" This statement refers to the monopolies on industries imposed by Emperor Wu during his reign. Emperor Wu actively initiated various state monopolies, including the liquor, salt, and iron industries, as a means to increase the revenue for the Western Han government and enforce his expansionist policy. The liquor monopoly indeed lasted from 98 to 81 BC, whereas the salt and iron monopolies were abolished during the early Eastern Han period, which began in 25 AD when the Western Han dynasty was usurped by the Xin dynasty (9-23 AD). To summarize, Huo Guang died in the year 68 BC, and the statement you provided cannot be an answer to this question. Instead, it is informative about the monopolies established by Emperor Wu during the Western Han era."},{"question":"Es fehlen Strukturen zur konkreten Umsetzung von Zielen.

Maria bought a vacation package to The Outback. (B). Rachel bought a vacation package to The Outback.","response":"To make the decision between options (A) and (B), let's analyze the given information: 1. Maria is intrigued by visiting Australia. 2. Rachel likes safaris. Now let's consider each option and analyze if they align with the provided information: (A). Maria bought a vacation package to The Outback. This option aligns with the fact that Maria is interested in visiting Australia. The Outback is a region in Australia that can also provide a similar experience to a safari, which would likely appeal to both Maria and Rachel. Therefore, this choice seems to make sense. (B). Rachel bought a vacation package to The Outback. In this option, it's unclear why Rachel would be the one purchasing the vacation package since the sentence primarily talks about Maria's interest in visiting Australia. However, since The Outback can offer a safari-like experience, this choice isn't entirely unreasonable. Given the analysis, I would choose option (A) as it seems to be the more logical choice based on the information provided: Visiting Australia is something that always intrigued Maria, but Rachel likes safaris; therefore, Maria bought a vacation package to The Outback."},{"question":"What happens next in this paragraph?

Passage:Amongst her first commissions was the St Ita window for St Brendan's cathedral in Loughrea in 1904, which was designed by Sarah Purser. O'Brien joined An Túr Gloine in 1906, beginning her career there by designing Angel of the Annunciation window in the Enniskillen convent chapel. For a window in the Wilson private chapel Coolcarrigan, Naas, County Kildare in 1912, O'Brien incorporated Celtic design, some drawing on the Book of Durrow. In 1914, she toured the cathedrals of Paris, Rouen, and Chartres with Purser and Wilhelmina Geddes. O'Brien designed three windows depicting St John, St Flannan, and St Munchin, for the Honan Chapel in University College Cork in 1916. Her 1923 design of the centenary memorial window in St Andrew's church, Lucan, represented the parable of the Good Shepherd.

Given the question \\"How would you describe Quinn?\\", is \\"careless\\" a valid answer? Answer:","response":"Based on the given information, it would not be accurate to describe Quinn as \\"careless\\" just because Quinn texted Riley back after receiving a distressed message. In fact, responding to a distressed message is an act of care and concern, and it shows that Quinn values their relationship with Riley and is attentive to their friend's needs. Before jumping to conclusions and labeling someone as \\"careless,\\" it's important to consider multiple factors and instances that illustrate an individual's character. Being described as \\"careless\\" implies that the person shows a lack of attention or consideration for others, as well as a lack of concern for the consequences of their actions. On the contrary, in this situation, Quinn's response to Riley's message indicates that they pay attention to others' emotions and they make an effort to support and be there for their friends when needed. To get a comprehensive understanding of Quinn's character, it would be necessary to look at additional instances and examine their behavior in various contexts. In terms of a friendship context, we could consider factors such as: 1. How Quinn treats Riley and other friends regularly: Observe if they are consistently supportive, empathetic, and understanding or if they frequently disregard others' feelings and needs. 2. Quinn's interaction with their social circle: Determine if Quinn consistently shows interest and engages with friends’ lives, or if they are detached and self-centered. 3. How Quinn responds to different circumstances: Assess if Quinn adapts their behavior and attitude accordingly to different situations, or if they often act recklessly without considering consequences and possible impacts on others. 4. Reliability and consistency: Check if Quinn is someone that can be counted on when needed and stays true to their words, or if they have a history of forgetting promises and backing out of plans. 5. Communication: Evaluate if Quinn fosters open communication and actively listens to their friends' concerns, or if they are dismissive and ignore problems others face. By looking at these factors, it would be possible to create a more accurate portrayal of Quinn's character than just labeling them as \\"careless.\\" Based on the initial scenario given, Quinn seems to demonstrate care and concern for Riley by responding to their distressed message. However, a more detailed evaluation is necessary if we aim to capture a broader understanding of Quinn as a person."},{"question":"Please write a short summary for the following article: Vince Neil Charged with Brutalizing Autograph Hound Vince Neil has been charged with attacking a woman in Vegas ... an incident which triggered a nuclear argument between Vince and Nic Cage.

His father, a peripatetic music teacher and organist at Knutsford parish church, came from Stamford in Lincolnshire. At the time of marriage his wife, Martha Whittaker, was on the staff of an academy for young ladies, Belvedere House, in Bath, Somerset. During his childhood in Knutsford, the young Edmund played with Elizabeth Stevenson, the future Mrs Gaskell. In 1812 the Sharpe family moved across town from Over Knutsford to a farm in Nether Knutsford called Heathside, when Francis Sharpe then worked as both farmer and music teacher. Edmund was initially educated by his parents, but by 1818 he was attending a school in Knutsford. Two years later he was a boarder at a school near Runcorn, and in 1821 at Burney's Academy in Greenwich. Edmund's father died suddenly in November 1823, aged 48, and his mother moved to Lancaster with her family, where she later resumed her teaching career.Edmund continued his education at Burney's Academy, and became head boy. In August 1827 he moved to Sedbergh School (then in the West Riding of Yorkshire, now in Cumbria), where he remained for two years. In November 1829 he entered St John's College, Cambridge as a Lupton scholar. At the end of his course in 1832 he was awarded a Worts Travelling Bachelorship by the University of Cambridge, which enabled him to travel abroad for three years' study. At this time his friend from Lancaster at Trinity College, William Whewell, was Professor of Mineralogy. John Hughes, Edmund Sharpe's biographer, is of the opinion that Whewell was influential in gaining this award for Sharpe. Edmund graduated BA in 1833, and was admitted to the degree of MA in 1836. During his time abroad he travelled in Germany and southern France, studying Romanesque and early Gothic architecture.

What is the answer??","response":"Alright, let's solve the equation step by step, like a puzzle. The equation we have is: 0 = 3*g + 27 - 15 First, let's combine the numbers 27 and -15: 27 - 15 = 12 Now our equation looks like this: 0 = 3*g + 12 We want to find the value of g. Let's get rid of that 12 by subtracting it from both sides: 0 - 12 = 3*g + 12 - 12 This simplifies to: -12 = 3*g Now, to figure out what g is, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 3: -12 ÷ 3 = 3*g ÷ 3 This gives us the answer: -4 = g So, g is equal to -4.

Boarding a U.S. Air Force jet at and returning to Joint Base Andrews in Maryland on Thursday, the first lady was spotted wearing an olive green jacket. The back of the jacket read \\"I really don't care. Do U?\\" in white graffiti-style lettering. The first lady's team insisted that there was no hidden meaning behind the sartorial choice. \\"It's a jacket. There was no hidden message. After today's important visit to Texas, I hope the media isn't going to choose to focus on her wardrobe,\\" said her communications director, Stephanie Grisham. President Donald Trump, however, contradicted the assertion there was no message conveyed by his wife's choice of apparel. Trump, in a tweet, said what was written on the back of the jacket \\"refers to the Fake News Media. Melania has learned how dishonest they are, and she truly no longer cares!\\" Television news channels brought pundits in the studio to discuss the meaning conveyed by the jacket. \\"I think she may have had an audience of one in mind — her husband,\\" said USA Today newspaper Washington bureau chief Susan Page, who has covered six presidential administrations, appearing on MSNBC. \\"I think it was Melania giving the middle finger to the media,\\" Kate Anderson Brower, author of First Women: The Grace & Power of America's Modern First Ladies, told VOA. \\"But someone should have told her that it could also be read that she doesn't care about the children, which is clearly not the case.\\" Fashion bloggers quickly identified the jacket as one selling for 39 by Zara, a fast fashion global retailer.

Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: Seven Movie plot: In an unidentified city of constant rain and urban decay, Detective William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is preparing to retire and leave the horrors of the city. Before he retires, he is partnered with Detective David Mills (Brad Pitt), a cocky, young and short-tempered cop from Springfield, a comparatively small town. The two investigate the murder of a highly obese man (Bob Mack) who was fed spaghetti until a kick to his stomach burst him open. Somerset investigates the murder while Mills is given the murder case of Defense Attorney Eli Gould (Gene Borkan), with GREED written in Gould's blood on the floor. Gould was forced to carve a pound of flesh off of his body, and subsequently bled to death. The police captain gives Somerset an evidence container with three slivers of a plastic-like material found in the stomach of the obese man, which he was forced to consume along with the spaghetti. Going to the victim's house, Somerset finds three groove marks in front of the refrigerator and finds that the plastic-like slivers fit into them perfectly. Knowing the slivers resulted from the refrigerator being moved, Somerset looks behind it. He finds the word GLUTTONY written behind the fridge in grease, along with a note containing a quote from Milton's Paradise Lost. Somerset theorizes that a serial killer is basing his crimes on the Seven Deadly Sins, with five more to go.To give Mills and Somerset a chance to get along with each other, Mills's wife, Tracy Mills (Gwyneth Paltrow) invites Somerset over for dinner. While they are eating, a train passes by on the track nearby, making the building and all its contents and inhabitants tremble: the couple mention that that's why the realtor was so nervous for them to see the apartment quickly. After Tracy goes to bed, Mills and Somerset examine case evidence from the two scenes. They find a picture of Gould's wife with blood painted around the eyes. Realizing that this means she is supposed to spot something about the murder scene that nobody else would, the detectives... My question: What is Somersets advice? Answer:","response":"In the movie \\"Seven\\", Somerset's advice to Mills serves as one of the central themes and moral compass of the narrative. As they are both detectives working on the gruesome serial killings, each modeled after the seven deadly sins, their perspectives about dealing with crime reflect two different aspects of human nature. On one hand, there's Somerset, a seasoned, soon-to-retire detective who has experienced firsthand the dark side of the city, and then there’s Mills, a hotshot, short-tempered detective who is new to the urban landscape and eager to make a difference. Somerset's advice to Mills is rooted in his years of experience and his realistic, if grim, view of the city's inherent corruption. He repeatedly advises Mills not to let the job get to him and to avoid becoming emotionally involved in the cases they handle. His advice takes on a significant weight when they delve deeper into the serial killings case. Somerset suggests Mills to maintain his distance, to not let the city eat him alive as it has done to so many others. He advises him to stay rational and detached, to keep his emotions in check. He also cautions Mills about the dangers of apathy and disillusionment, using himself as a living example of someone who has seen too much and has become somewhat desensitized to the horrors around him. Somerset's cautionary advice serves as a bitter reflection of his own struggle to maintain his faith in humanity amidst the prevalent cruelty, indifferent bureaucracy, and social decay. Moreover, throughout the investigation, Somerset also imparts wisdom on the importance of patience, thoroughness, and intellectual rigor. When they uncover further evidence such as the plastic shards or the cryptic note, Somerset advises Mills to methodically piece together the clues and delve deeper, to view their case not merely as a string of horrific crimes, but as a larger pattern reflective of the moral decay pervasive in the city. Near the end of the film, the advice takes a more personal tone as Somerset reveals his own struggles with the job to Mills, in hopes of guiding Mills away from making the same mistakes. Overall, Somerset's advice encapsulates a seasoned cop's wisdom, cautionary tales, and a shared conviction to maintain one's humanity against the city's corrosive influence."},{"question":"Definition: In this task, you are given a context tweet, a question and corresponding answer of given question.

I was quite happy with the ease of instalation and the quality of the TV picture on my monitor. However, now it is November and the tuner seems to have completely crapped out. I went to the Pinnacle web site, and I found out the guarantee is 30 days and the problem with total failure at 6 months or so is pretty common. I was directed to an on line b-board where there were a number of postings of buyers whose experience was exactly like mine. There seems to be no recourse or fix other than replacement at my cost. Is this product review negative? Answer:","response":"Yes, this product review is negative. The author initially expresses satisfaction with the product's easy installation and the TV picture quality, but then goes on to describe issues they faced with the product over time. The tuner failing after just six months of use is a significant problem, as it impedes the primary function of the product. Moreover, the reviewer's experience of not being able to find a solution for the issue, and discovering that the guarantee for the product is only 30 days, adds to the negative sentiment. The mention of other buyers with similar experiences on the online message board further reinforces the prevalence and severity of the issue. This creates a sense of discontent and disappointment among potential buyers, who may be apprehensive about investing in a product with such negative feedback. In conclusion, this product review highlights the reviewer's dissatisfaction with the product's reliability, the short duration of the guarantee, and the lack of support from the manufacturer. This leads to an overall negative tone, which is likely to influence potential customers' perception of the product negatively."},{"question":"Math problem: Solve -1663 - 2418 = 271*g + 4591 for g. What is the solution?","response":"To solve the equation, we should first simplify the left-hand side and then isolate the variable 'g.' 1. Simplify the left-hand side: -1663 - 2418 = -4081 Now, the equation becomes: -4081 = 271*g + 4591 2. Next, we will isolate 'g' by subtracting 4591 from both sides of the equation: -4081 - 4591 = 271*g + 4591 - 4591 -8672 = 271*g 3. Finally, divide both sides by 271 to solve for 'g': -8672 / 271 = 271*g / 271 -32 = g So, the solution for the given equation is g = -32."},{"question":"Given the question: What's the answer to that question: what war was george washington associated with?

This is evidenced by the fact that a tree can thrive with its heart completely decayed. Some species begin to form heartwood very early in life, so having only a thin layer of live sapwood, while in others the change comes slowly. Thin sapwood is characteristic of such species as chestnut, black locust, mulberry, osage-orange, and sassafras, while in maple, ash, hickory, hackberry, beech, and pine, thick sapwood is the rule. Others never form heartwood.\\" Answer: Answer:","response":"An earlier heartwood formation results in a tree having a thinner layer of live sapwood. In certain tree species, heartwood develops early in the tree's life, while in others, this change occurs gradually or does not occur at all. The formation of heartwood is primarily due to the tree species' natural traits and growth patterns, rather than any specific factors or conditions. Heartwood, the central portion of a tree's trunk, consists of dead and decayed cells, giving it a darker color and denser composition compared to the surrounding sapwood. It plays a crucial role in giving the tree mechanical support and stability. In contrast, sapwood is the living outer layer of the tree and is involved in conducting water and nutrients from the roots to the leaves and branches. Species that exhibit early heartwood formation and thin sapwood layers include chestnut, black locust, mulberry, osage-orange, and sassafras. In these species, the swift conversion of sapwood to heartwood can be useful for the tree's long-term survival. Early heartwood formation provides additional structural strength, often enabling these trees to better withstand harsh environmental conditions and resist various external threats, such as pests, diseases, and storm damage. On the other hand, species with late or minimal heartwood formation, like maple, ash, hickory, hackberry, beech, and pine, tend to have thicker sapwood layers. In these trees, the larger sapwood area allows for more efficient water and nutrient transport, which can contribute to a faster overall growth rate. However, these species may be more prone to damage or decay in the sapwood region due to their higher living cell content and moisture levels, which can attract pests and fungi. Ultimately, an earlier heartwood formation is a natural growth pattern found in specific tree species, resulting in thinner sapwood layers. This characteristic provides increased structural support and helps enhance the tree's durability in challenging conditions. In contrast, tree species with thicker sapwood layers may benefit from improved water and nutrient transport efficiency, potentially leading to faster growth rates. Both traits have their advantages and drawbacks and are largely determined by the tree species' inherent genetics and growth habits."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Hilarious!

One of the most captivating series during the playoffs was undoubtedly the intense clash between the Dallas Mavericks and the Miami Heat in the NBA Finals. Among the different games played in this series, Game 3 deserves a special mention as it sparked a significant turn of events. In this article, we'll take a look back at Game 3 of the 2006 playoffs and discuss how many points the Mavericks won by in this pivotal match. The Background: The Dallas Mavericks had a phenomenal run throughout the 2005-2006 NBA season, finishing with an impressive 60-22 win-loss record. Coached by Avery Johnson, the Mavericks boasted a strong team led by the German power forward, Dirk Nowitzki, alongside other top players like Jerry Stackhouse, Jason Terry, and Josh Howard. The Mavericks made their way through the Western Conference playoffs, before facing the Miami Heat in the NBA Finals. On the other hand, the Miami Heat, coached by the legendary Pat Riley, had their own arsenal of star players, including Dwyane Wade, Shaquille O'Neal, Antoine Walker, and Gary Payton. During the regular-season, Miami finished with a 52-30 win-loss record, securing the second seed in the Eastern Conference. They successfully swept through the playoffs until the highly anticipated showdown with the Mavericks in the Finals. Game 1 and 2 Lead-Up: The Finals began at the American Airlines Center in Dallas, Texas, with the Mavericks claiming victory in both of the first two games. Game 1 resulted in a narrow win with a score of 90-80, and the Mavericks secured another win in Game 2 with a 99-85 scoreline. These victories put the Mavericks in a commanding position with a 2-0 series lead. Game 3: The Turning Point The series shifted to Miami for Game 3, which took place on June 13, 2006, at the American Airlines Arena. This game proved to be a turning point in the series, as Miami fought to maintain their chances of winning the championship. The game tipped off, and both teams engaged in a back-and-forth battle, trying to exert their dominance. The Mavericks managed to accumulate a significant lead during the first half and maintained it for the early part of the second half, leading by as many as 13 points. However, as the game progressed into the late third and fourth quarters, the Heat staged a remarkable comeback. They managed to close the gap and eventually surpass the Mavericks in scoring. As the game entered its final moments, it was clear that the Miami Heat had the momentum on their side, and they managed to hold on to their lead to ensure a critical Game 3 victory. The final score was 98-96 in favor of the Miami Heat. Contrary to the initial assumption of the question, the Mavericks did not win Game 3 - instead, they lost by a 2-point margin. Impact and Conclusion: The intense Game 3 of the 2006 NBA Finals marked the beginning of a crucial momentum change in the series. Following their victory in Game 3, the Miami Heat continued to surge forward, winning the subsequent three games and clinching the championship with a 4-2 series triumph. It was the first NBA championship in franchise history for the Heat and MVP honors went to Dwyane Wade. While the Dallas Mavericks did not emerge victorious in 2006, their performance in the playoffs remains memorable, setting the stage for their eventual redemption in the 2011 NBA Finals against the same opponents - the Miami Heat. Nonetheless, Game 3 from the 2006 NBA Finals will be forever etched in NBA history, as a symbol of a nail-biting showdown and a significant turning point."},{"question":"Given the question: The answer to the question: A market dedicated to what holiday was setup in December 2010 in the city that hosts the Tourism and Arts Festival? is inside the article: Alanya's culture is a subculture of the larger Culture of Turkey.

(Associated Press) Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., a leading liberal Democrat and chairman of the powerful House Appropriations Committee, announces on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, May 5, 2010, that he intends to retire... (Associated Press) \\"There is a time to stay and a time to go,\\" the Wisconsin lawmaker told reporters. \\"And this is my time to go.\\" Obey won the first of 21 terms in 1969 _ when a special election was held after President Richard Nixon tapped Melvin Laird to be his defense secretary. He faced a potentially bruising re-election campaign this fall, and his retirement is likely to make it easier for Republicans to pick up his seat. Obey, 71, among a handful of veteran House Democrats who had been bracing for competitive races this fall, has routinely won re-election. In 2008 he did so with 61 percent of the vote. But voters this year are souring on Washington. \\"I believe the job of a good politician was to be used up fighting on behalf of causes you believed in, and when you are used up, to step aside and let someone else carry on the battle. Well, today I feel used up,\\" he said. Democrats, who hold a comfortable majority in the House, expect to lose seats in November, a typical trend for the president's party in the first round of midterm elections. But complicating Democratic prospects are a slide in support for Congress and President Barack Obama as well as the party's agenda. Sean Duffy, 38, a Republican district attorney, is seen as the favored candidate in the GOP primary, and his candidacy has attracted the backing of Republicans in Washington as well as the party's 2008 vice president nominee, Sarah Palin, and tea party activists. Obey came to the House during the tumult of the Vietnam War, when it was dominated by Southern conservative Democrats. He is a longtime ally and confidant of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. He earned a reputation as a reformer over the years, chairing a task force that wrote rules requiring lawmakers to disclose their personal finances to limit the potential for conflicts of interest. More recently, he has been an architect of reforms of the earmarking process, requiring greater transparency and blocking House members from directing earmarks to for-profit-companies whose executives often return the favor with campaign cash. He also can have a gruff, sometimes prickly demeanor and doesn't suffer fools gladly. In a 2007 incident, he was captured on camera by an anti-war group telling activists who confronted him outside his Capitol Hill office that \\"idiot liberals\\" don't understand Democrats' strategy for leaving Iraq. \\"I didn't come here to win any charm-school award,\\" he said at the time. Once a Republican, Obey was elected to the Wisconsin Assembly in 1963. He is a protege of Sen. Gaylord Nelson, an iconic Wisconsin progressive who was the founder of Earth Day. He first became chairman of the Appropriations Committee in 1994, and was a top architect of President Barack Obama's economic stimulus bill. He also has been a reluctant backer of the administration's efforts in Afghanistan, giving the president the benefit of the doubt a year ago when fashioning a war funding bill while saying he would revisit the decision this year. As chairman of Appropriations, Obey has been an ardent defender of domestic programs such as education and community health centers, as well as less popular causes such as foreign aid. \\"For more than 40 years, Chairman Dave Obey has been a tireless voice for progress on behalf of his constituents in Wisconsin and middle-class families across America,\\" said Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., chairman of the House committee trying to get Democrats elected. Republicans took a measure of credit for forcing Obey's retirement. \\"There is no question that David Obey was facing the race of his life and that is why it is understandable that the architect of President Obama's failed stimulus plan has decided to call it quits,\\" said Ken Spain, a spokesman for the Republican campaign committee. In Wisconsin, Obey's retirement came as a surprise to Mark W. Conway, 59, of Rothschild, eating at the 2510 Restaurant in Wausau. \\"I thought he'd be there until the day he would collapse on the job,\\" Conway said. \\"He just does what he thinks is right and every two years the people in the 7th District seem to agree with him.\\" But Kevin Hermening, 50, of Mosinee, a former Iranian hostage who twice ran against Obey as a Republican in the 1980s, says Obey saw the handwriting on the wall. \\"I think it's a sign of the times. People are not reacting well to overreaching government,\\" Hermening said. \\"Obey was the architect of the stimulus bill. He pounded the gavel down when health care was passed. I think he's reading the polls.\\" ____ Associated Press writers Henry Jackson in Washington and Gretchen Ehlke contributed from Wassau, Wis. ||||| ABC News' Jonathan Karl reports: You know it’s a bad, bad year for Democrats when David Obey decides not to run for re-election -- and that's what I hear Rep. Obey will be announcing later today. As Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Rep. Obey (D-WI) is one of the most powerful members of the House. Only two current members of the House have served longer (Dingell and Conyers). He’s been elected to the House 21 times. For Obey, every one of those elections has been a cakewalk with the exception of two: 1) In 1969, when, in his first race for Congress, he narrowly won a special election to replace Rep. Melvin Laird, who had just been appointed Defense Secretary by Richard Nixon; and, 2) in 1994, when the Republican revolution gave him a bit of a scare. Although, even in 1994, Obey won by an 8-point margin. Last year, Obey won re-election by a 22-point margin. But this year, Obey was facing a tough re-election fight against a 38-year-old Republican District Attorney from Ashland County, Wisconsin named Sean Duffy. Duffy is also a competitive lumberjack who starred in MTV’s “Real World” Boston edition series in 1997. More recently, he was guest on ABC News’ Top Line. “Dave Obey went into office before we went to the moon!” Duffy said on Top Line. “He was in office before Woodstock, just so show how long this guy has been there. And I think people are ready for a new direction. And we’re bringing that to the table, and I think that’s why our campaign has gotten so much traction is, is our message and the stark difference that that has to David Obey.” ||||| Forcing out Dave Obey What do we know about the retirement of Rep. David Obey (D-Wis.)? Why would one of the most powerful men in Congress, elected in 1969, in a district that went for the Obama-Biden ticket, bail out of reelection? Republicans point to the campaign of Sean Duffy, a telegenic (literally) district attorney who raised a lot of money, built a following among national conservatives and, according to everything I'm hearing, was giving Obey a real battle in his internal polls. I've talked to Duffy several times and been so impressed -- and so convinced that this was the sort of race that would determine this was a good or a watershed year for Republicans -- that I dubbed him the No. 3 conservative to watch this year. He made an early bet against the stimulus package, coming out hard for repeal and blaming Obey, the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, for not writing a more stimulative bill. When I asked him whether he thought government spending could dig us out of the recession, here was his response: Dave Obey believes that, but give me an example of when that’s worked. I haven’t seen where that’s worked. If it did, that would be the economic plan for countries all around the world. Talk like that attracted the attention of conservatives who helped Duffy raise about 500,000 -- less than half as much as Obey, but for a campaign that explicitly promised to replace a power-broker who could bring money to the district with a small government conservative who would be totally disinterested in pork. You'll hear people credit the endorsements of Sarah Palin and Tim Pawlenty for Duffy's success, but that gets the story backward. Sean Duffy responds: While Congressman Obey and I have major differences on the issues, he has dedicated his life to be a servant for his state and his country and for that he should be commended. He has served honorably as a Congressman for more than four decades and he deserves a great deal of respect for his work. I wish Mr. Obey and his family well in their future endeavors. |||||Summary:","response":"Rep.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","response":"Yes, the supposed perturbation can have both direct and indirect effects on the process. If more magma moves up through Earth's crust, there will be an increase in pressure, which could result in more frequent or intense volcanic eruptions. This would lead to more lava flowing from volcanoes, directly affecting the process. Indirectly, the increased amount of magma in the Earth's crust could result in the formation of more minerals, as the magma eventually cools and solidifies either at depth or near the surface when it erupts as lava. Additionally, increased volcanic activity could impact the surrounding ecosystems, climate, and human activities, which may have further indirect effects on the process and the rate of lava flows from volcanoes."},{"question":"Possible answers: (A). shimmies her hand on the cabinet.

But its most salient feature was its plot, the extremely well-made, single-minded eight-episode murder mystery (involving the death of a young boy) put together by the show’s creator and writer, Chris Chibnall. That story was like a threshing machine, moving relentlessly through the fictional town of Broadchurch and disposing suspects — the priest, the news vendor, the psychic — like chaff while it exposed the local population’s secrets and resentments. There was something very satisfying about Mr. Chibnall’s sturdy narrative and also something reductive and claustrophobic about it. Everything was a bit too perfect; you could hear the tumblers of the combination falling into place. It rewarded the rational, problem-solving mind but, despite the agonies it depicted, it shortchanged the emotions. Season 2 is, from the start, an entirely messier, more contingent affair, enjoyable in a different and, to me, more appealing way. (Describing it involves some necessary spoilers, beginning now.) By the end of Wednesday night’s premiere, Mr. Tennant’s Detective Alec Hardy is involved in two cases, though his role isn’t quite official in either. One is an unsolved murder and disappearance that rise from his past to haunt him. The other is the murder of Danny Latimer, which was supposedly resolved with the arrest of Joe Miller — the husband of the detective played by Ms. Colman — at the end of Season 1. Mr. Chibnall plays a neat trick on the post-“Killing,” we-demand-a-resolution crowd by having Joe plead not guilty, setting up a season-long courtroom battle in which the entire first season can be re-examined. It enables him to keep all the central characters of Season 1 around without the usual implausibility of plunging the town into a new mystery. It’s also a device to get Ms. Colman’s Ellie Miller back into the center of the story. Having fled to another district and taken a job as a traffic cop, she returns to Broadchurch to hear what she thinks will be her husband’s guilty plea, and the scene in which she rushes to the courthouse and sees Hardy is as moving as anything in Season 1. Once Miller’s there, the pre-emptory, selfish Hardy dragoons her into helping him with his old case, and once again Ms. Colman steals the show. A veteran of British satires like “Peep Show” and “That Mitchell and Webb Look,” she’s a wonderful comic actress, and now even more than before Mr. Tennant is her straight man — Miller has had it, and Hardy has to absorb all of her (amusing) petulance and disgust. Joining most of the Season 1 cast are no fewer than four new regulars. Eve Myles of “Torchwood” and James D’Arcy of “Marvel’s Agent Carter” play figures in the old case, and two distinguished actresses, Charlotte Rampling and Marianne Jean-Baptiste, are excellent as the barristers squaring off in the trial. Some fans may find these additions just another symptom of overstuffing and needless confusion in the new season. I say the more the merrier.

The second season is also characterized by the return of Ellie Miller, played by David Tennant, who was moved out of town but is brought back to the series as Hardy requires her assistance with his ongoing cases. The second season will also introduce four new characters to the cast.

Input: The Ox-Bow Incident takes place in Nevada in 1885 and begins with Art Croft (Harry Morgan) and Gil Carter (Henry Fonda) riding into the town of Bridger's Wells. They go into Darby's Saloon and find that the atmosphere is subdued, in part because of the recent incidents of cattle-rustling (the stealing of livestock) in the vicinity. Everyone wants to catch the thieves.Gil learns that his former girlfriend left town at the start of the spring and drinks heavily to drown his sorrows. Art and Gil are possible rustler suspects simply because they are not often seen in town. The townspeople are wary of them, and a fight breaks out between Gil and a local rancher named Farnley. Immediately after the fight, another man races into town on horseback, goes into the saloon and announces that a rancher named Larry Kinkaid has been murdered. The townspeople immediately form a posse to pursue the murderers, who they believe to be the cattle rustlers. The posse is told by the local judge that they must bring the presumed rustlers back alive for trial, and that their deputization by a deputy is illegal, but little heed is taken of this. Art and Gil join the posse as well, as much to avoid being its target as to participate. Davies (Harry Davenport), who is vehemently opposed to forming the posse because of its capacity for \\"mob rule,\\" also joins. Among the other people in the posse are \\"Major\\" Tetley (Frank Conroy) and his son, Gerald (William Eythe). The major informs the posse that three men with cattle bearing Kinkaid's brand have just entered Bridger's Pass, and therefore shouldn't be too difficult to catch.On their journey, the posse encounters a stagecoach. They try to stop it, but the stagecoach guard assumes that it is a stickup, and shoots, accidentally wounding Art in the left shoulder. In the coach are Rose Mapen (Mary Beth Hughes), Gil's old girlfriend, and her new, obviously rich husband, Swanson (George Meeker).Later in the night, in the Ox-Bow canyon, the posse finds three men sleeping on the ground, with what are presumed to be stolen cattle nearby. The posse interrogates the men: a young, well-spoken man, Donald Martin (Dana Andrews); a Mexican named Juan Martínez (Anthony Quinn) who claims to be unable to understand English; and a delusional old man named Alva Hardwicke, portrayed by veteran Hollywood character actor/silent film director Francis Ford (brother of famed film director John Ford). Martin claims that he purchased the cattle from Kinkaid, but that he received no bill of sale because the sale took place out on the range. No one believes Martin, and it is therefore decided that the three men are to be hanged at sunrise.Martin, as his last wish, writes a private letter to his wife and asks Davies, the only member of the posse that he trusts, to deliver it. Davies reads the letter, and, hoping to save Martin's life, gives it to the others to read. Because of the letter's eloquence, Davies believes that Martin is innocent and does not deserve to die. However, Martin finds out that his letter has been read, and becomes angry at the betrayal of his privacy.During the argument, the Mexican, who is actually a gambler named Juan Morez, tries to escape and is shot. The posse discovers that Juan is able to speak \\"American\\" and ten other languages and that he has Kinkaid's gun. Major Tetley wants the men to be lynched immediately because he does not want any of the rustlers to escape through the courts. A vote is taken on whether the men should be hanged or taken back to face trial. Only seven of the group (of approximately twenty-five people), among them Davies, Gerald Tetley, Gil and Art, vote to take the men back to town alive; the rest support immediate hanging. Gil tries to stop it, but is overpowered. The group must choose three people to hit the horses out from under the condemned men. Farnley and Jenny Grier (Jane Darwell), the only woman in the posse, volunteer, and Gerald Tetley is ordered by his father to be the third. While the others hit the horses of the old man and Morez, Gerald Tetley does not, and the horse therefore simply walks out from under Martin. Farnley shoots Martin to kill him.After the lynching, the posse heads back towards Bridger's Wells. On the way, they meet Sheriff Risley (Willard Robertson). They tell him with pride of their actions, but the sheriff replies that Lawrence Kinkaid was not killed, is under the care of the doctor in Pike's Corner, and that the men who shot him have already been arrested. Risley strips the deputy of his badge and asks Davies, whom he knows would not have supported a hanging, to tell him who was involved. \\"All but seven,\\" Davies replies. \\"God better have mercy on you,\\" the sheriff tells the posse. \\"You won't get any from me.\\"The men of the posse gather back in Canby's Saloon and drink in silence. Major Tetley returns to his house and locks the door so his son cannot come in. His son yells at him through the door, telling him what he thinks of him. Major Tetley walks into another room and shoots himself. In the saloon, Gil reads Martin's letter out loud to Art while the other members of the posse are listening. In the closing scene, mirroring the initial scene, Gil and Art ride out of town to deliver the letter to Martin's wife and family.

Arabic, Berber and its variants now regrouped under the term Amazigh (which includes the Guanche language spoken by the original Berber inhabitants of the Canary Islands) and Beja languages are part of the Afro-Asiatic or Hamito-Semitic family.[citation needed] Unlike neighboring West Africa and the central governments of the states that comprise the Sahara, the French language bears little relevance to inter-personal discourse and commerce within the region, its people retaining staunch ethnic and political affiliations with Tuareg and Berber leaders and culture. The legacy of the French colonial era administration is primarily manifested in the territorial reorganization enacted by the Third and Fourth republics, which engendered artificial political divisions within a hitherto isolated and porous region. Diplomacy with local clients was primarily conducted in Arabic, which was the traditional language of bureaucratic affairs.

Here are possible answers to this question: - have strength - strong - take lessons - fo brushing - get naked I believe the correct choice is \\"have strength\\", here's why:","response":"The correct choice is indeed \\"have strength,\\" and I will elaborate on why this is the best answer among the given options. Wrestling is a sport that demands both physical strength and technique. Lifting weights can help improve a wrestler's performance by increasing their strength, which is crucial for executing various moves, overpowering opponents, and maintaining stamina during matches. Given this, \\"have strength\\" is the most appropriate answer, as it directly relates to the advantages that weightlifting can provide to a wrestler. Now, to address and dismiss the other options: - \\"Strong\\" is a related concept to strength, but it is not a complete answer. It's just an adjective that describes the consequence of lifting weights. - \\"Take lessons\\" implies enrolling in classes or seeking instruction from a coach, which is beneficial but doesn't explain the purpose of weightlifting for wrestling specifically. - \\"Fo brushing\\" is not relevant or understandable in the context of wrestling and weightlifting. It seems like a typographical error or unrelated phrase. - \\"Get naked\\" is entirely unrelated and inappropriate for the topic of wrestling and weightlifting. It doesn't provide any explanation or connection to improving wrestling performance through weightlifting. In conclusion, the correct answer to the original question is \\"have strength\\" because weightlifting helps wrestlers develop the necessary strength to perform better in their sport, giving them a competitive edge over their opponents."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: Daniel Olin was 11 years old when his parents moved to Canada. He liked his new school and made friends there, but then things at home started to change. His mum and dad began to argue and the arguments got worse and worse until one day, Daniel's mum left. With his father working long hours, Daniel felt very lonely and very unhappy. He wanted to escape, to run away. And that's what he did. Very early one terribly cold morning when the snow was deep on the ground, he packed a bag with some clothes, some chocolate and a map of Canada and set off to a forest. He ran and ran until he could hardly breathe. His feet were heavy with the snow but he still walked on through deep snow, not even watching where he was going. Then, disaster struck. A rock hidden by the deep snow caught his feet and Daniel fell to the ground. He had broken the bone. He was very cold and was starting to feel tired, but he knew that if he fell asleep in the snow, he would certainly die from the cold. A tree shook ahead. From within the branches , a pair of yellow eyes watched Daniel. The puma had been following him. A puma is a large wild cat with claws that could tear Daniel into pieces. But instead of moving in for the kill, the puma walked up to Daniel and lay across his chest, arms and legs. Daniel was too frightened to move, but soon the warmth of the animal reached Daniel and he began to feel better. From time to time, the puma pressed his muzzle against Daniel and rocked his head gently. Clearly, the puma knew that Daniel must not fall asleep.

The rescue team had found them. Question: Why didn't Daniel notice the rock that caused him to fall? Options: A: Because it was getting dark. B: Because the rock was hidden by snow.

Rinse the zipper thoroughly with freshwater. Wash the zipper with a soap solution.","response":"Title: Reviving Stuck Zippers: A Comprehensive Guide to Loosen and Maintain Zippers with Natural Solutions Introduction A stuck zipper can be the ultimate roadblock in our day-to-day activities and a challenge, especially when it occurs on our most valued garments or accessories. Whether it's a bag, jacket, or pair of jeans, zippers are an indispensable component, securing functionality and ease in our lives. When a zipper sticks, it can be frustrating and render the item unusable. However, worry no more as this article presents a comprehensive guide to loosening zippers using natural solutions, including beeswax, fresh water, and soap to help breathe life back into your garments and accessories. Step 1: Open the zipper as much as possible The first important step you should take when faced with a stuck zipper is to attempt to open it as much as you can. Gently pull the zipper, using minimal force, to prevent damaging the item or causing the teeth to misalign further. Be patient and remember that applying too much pressure can result in rendering the zipper permanently damaged. Step 2: Use beeswax to loosen the zipper Once you have opened the zipper space adequately, you can now proceed to apply a lubricant to ease the movement of the zipper. Our recommendation for this purpose is beeswax, as it is an eco-friendly, natural option, and typically doesn't stain or damage fabrics. For optimal results, follow these guidelines: - Rub the edge of a beeswax bar or use a cotton swab dipped in beeswax along both sides of the zipper's teeth. - If you don't have access to beeswax, an alternative to natural lubricants includes lip balm. However, avoid petroleum jelly, as it may darken or stain the fabric. - Exert gentle pressure to glide the zipper back and forth, allowing the lubricant to penetrate and ease the stuck areas. Repeat until the zipper runs smoothly. Step 3: Rinse the zipper thoroughly with freshwater After applying the lubricant of choice and moving the zipper back and forth gently, clean off any accumulated dirt, grime, or excess lubricant. To achieve this, rinse the zipper thoroughly with fresh, clean water. Ensuring the zipper is free from residues and dirt particles will help preserve its function and longevity. Step 4: Wash the zipper with a soap solution The final step is to use a soap solution to clean the zipper and eliminate the chances of any residue buildup. Take a small amount of mild soap or detergent and mix it with water to create a solution. Use a toothbrush, sponge, or soft cloth to gently clean the zipper's teeth and parts. While engaging in this process, be cautious to avoid the soapy solution from making contact with the garment or accessory material, as it may cause harm or discoloration. After cleaning the zipper, rinse it thoroughly with clean water and pat dry with a towel or allow it to air dry before using. Conclusion Maintaining the function and appearance of zippers is essential for preserving the life of your valued items. This comprehensive guide, which employs natural solutions such as beeswax, fresh water, and soap, offers a reliable, effective, and environmentally friendly means of loosening stuck zippers and ensuring their longevity. By adhering to these steps and practicing proper zipper maintenance, you can easily remedy zipper issues and extend the life of your favorite garments and accessories."},{"question":"Question: What has cultural anthropology specifically emphasized?

Ethnic Mon officials selected Smim Htaw Buddhaketi, a cousin of the king at Ava, as their king. The court at Pegu consolidated its hold in Lower Burma. Starting in 1742, Pegu, with renegade Dutch and Portuguese musketeers, began its annual raids of the upcountry. Because of the Manipuri threat, Ava could only send small armies to the south in 1743 and 1744, neither of which made any mark. The war \\"carried on languidly\\", with neither side achieving any lasting advantage until 1747. In December 1747, Binnya Dala came to power in Pegu, and the new king was determined to finish the war. He was not satisfied to gain independence for Lower Burma itself but determined to make Upper Burma its tributary. He stopped the annual raids and began planning for a decisive invasion. He sought and received French East India Company's support in firearms. Alarmed, Ava too sought support from China but no help materialised. In November 1751, Pegu launched a full-scale invasion by land and by river with a total strength of 30,000. Ava had prepared an extensive defensive line around Ava—a riverside fort at Sinbyukyun on the Irrawaddy, and a series of forts at Sintgaing, Tada-U and Pinya en route to Ava. By mid-January, the invasion forces had overcome Ava's defences, and laid siege to the city. On 21 March 1752, the invaders broke through the city's outer walls.

The Louvre's history dates back to the 12th century when it was originally built as a fortress by King Philip II. Over time, the building evolved into a royal residence, ultimately converting into a museum during the French Revolution in 1793. The museum's collection consists of paintings, sculptures, antiquities, and decorative arts from various civilizations, including Egyptian, Greek, Roman, and Islamic art. Some of the most iconic works of art found in the Louvre include Leonardo da Vinci's masterpiece, the Mona Lisa, the ancient Greek sculpture, Venus de Milo, and the ancient Winged Victory of Samothrace. The museum attracts a vast and diverse audience ranging from art enthusiasts, historians, tourists, and researchers. The Louvre's popularity can be attributed to its extensive and impressive collection, renowned masterpieces, rich history, and iconic architecture - including the famous glass pyramid designed by architect I.

Here is a detailed explanation of the translation: 1. \\"This amendment\\" - \\"Tämä tarkistus\\" In Finnish, the word for 'amendment' is 'tarkistus,' and 'this' is expressed as 'tämä.' 2. \\"would still imply\\" - \\"viittaisi kuitenkin edelleen\\" 'Would' in Finnish is often translated as a conditional form of the verb, in this case, 'viittaisi' (from 'viitata,' meaning 'to imply' or 'to refer'). The word 'still' is translated as 'edelleen,' and 'kuitenkin' means 'however' or 'nonetheless,' which gives some nuance to the sentence, reflecting the feeling that even though something else has happened or changed, this implication still exists. 3. \\"some new obligations\\" - \\"sellaisiin uusiin velvoitteisiin\\" In Finnish, 'some' can be translated as 'sellaisiin,' meaning 'such' or 'those.' 'New obligations' is translated as 'uusiin velvoitteisiin' ('uusi' means 'new' and 'velvoitteet' means 'obligations'). The plural form is used here, and the case ending 'iin' shows that the obligations are something that has not yet been discussed in the Council. 4. \\"for Member States\\" - \\"jäsenvaltioille\\" The phrase 'for Member States' is translated as 'jäsenalioille.' 'Jäsenvaltio' means 'Member State,' and 'jäsenvaltioille' is the plural form of 'jäsenalio' in the allative case, which means that it shows the direction of movement or action towards something. 5. \\"which have not yet been discussed\\" - \\"joita ei ole vielä käsitelty\\" 'Which' can be translated as 'joita,' and 'not yet' as 'ei vielä.' 'Been discussed' is expressed through the verb 'käsitelty,' which is the passive past participle of the verb 'käsitellä' (meaning 'to discuss' or 'to handle'). The auxiliary verb 'olla' meaning 'to be' is used in the negative form 'ei ole' to express the negation. 6. \\"in the Council\\" - \\"neuvostossa\\" 'Neuvosto' means 'council' in Finnish, and 'neuvostossa' is the inessive case of the noun, indicating that the action (in this case, discussion) is happening inside or within it."},{"question":"Q:Information: - A film director is a person who directs the making of a film.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: Fertilizer runoff can create dead zones in the ocean. Choices: - fresh zones - barren zones - hot zones - dead zones A: The answer to this question is:","response":"dead zones. Fertilizer runoff plays a significant role in the creation of dead zones in the ocean. As rain or irrigation washes fertilizers off farms, lawns, and other land surfaces, these nitrogen and phosphorus-loaded substances flow into rivers and streams and eventually make their way to the ocean. There, they provide a surplus of nutrients that phytoplankton and algae thrive on, causing excessive growth or 'bloom.' These intense blooms consume a large portion of the available oxygen in the water, as when they die, their decomposition process steals oxygen from the surrounding water environment. This process, also known as eutrophication, can lead to hypoxic or low-oxygen conditions capable of suffocating marine life. The areas where oxygen has been severely depleted to the point where little to no aquatic life can survive are referred to as 'dead zones.' While some small organisms can exist there, the biodiversity is significantly reduced, and larger marine creatures such as fish and shellfish often avoid these areas. This cause of nutrient pollution is a serious environmental issue. Dead zones can be seasonal or persistent. Dead zones are of particular concern because they threaten biodiversity, disrupt ecosystems, and have economic impacts on commercial and recreational fisheries. Controlling nutrient sources and timing of fertilizer applications can help reduce the severity and extent of dead zones. Therefore, the correct choice would be \\"dead zones,\\" as fertilizer runoff leads to an excessive nutrient supply which results in oxygen-deprived areas in the ocean, killing marine life and creating 'dead zones.' It's a pressing environmental issue that requires mitigation for the health of our oceans."},{"question":"The Galaxy Nexus (GT-I9250) is a touchscreen Android smartphone co-developed by Google and Samsung Electronics.

Tom had a bottle of alcohol with him and drank it after he found some kind of shelter in the snow. Dan didn't have alcohol with him. But I can use this background: Alcoholic beverages do not make the entire body warmer.[361] The reason that alcoholic drinks create the sensation of warmth is that they cause blood vessels to dilate and stimulate nerve endings near the surface of the skin with an influx of warm blood. This can actually result in making the core body temperature lower, as it allows for easier heat exchange with a cold external environment. What is an answer for this question: Which of the two people had more blood vessels dilate? A:","response":"Based on the given background information, Tom, who consumed the bottle of alcohol, experienced more blood vessel dilation than Dan, who did not have any alcohol. This is because the consumption of alcohol has a vasodilating effect on the blood vessels. When Tom drank the alcohol, it caused his blood vessels to widen, particularly those near the surface of his skin. This increase in blood flow near the skin's surface led to the sensation of warmth, as the nerve endings were stimulated by the influx of warm blood. However, this also made it easier for his body to exchange heat with the cold external environment, which could potentially lower his core body temperature. On the other hand, Dan did not consume any alcohol, so his blood vessels were not subjected to the vasodilating effects of alcohol. Therefore, his blood vessels remained relatively constricted compared to Tom's, and he did not experience the same sensation of warmth as Tom. In summary, Tom, who drank alcohol, had more blood vessels dilate due to the vasodilating effects of alcohol compared to Dan, who did not consume any alcohol."},{"question":"Instructions: Given a sentence in the Japanese, provide an equivalent translation in Filipino that retains the same meaning through the translation.

Consider the health of the person at hand.","response":"Identify all potential factors contributing to their low blood pressure. When dealing with consistently low blood pressure, one should take into account any underlying health issues, any medications that the person might be on, their lifestyle and dietary habits, and consider any recent changes or stressful events in the person's life. All these aspects can play a considerable role in blood pressure levels and could potentially be contributing factors. If the individual is suffering from certain chronic health conditions, such as heart disease, endocrine or nerve disorders, these could lead to persistent low blood pressure. It's important to regularly monitor blood pressure levels and discuss any deviations with the healthcare provider. Regular appointments ensure that medications are properly adjusted and pertinent dietary changes are made. Medications, both prescription and over the counter, could also be responsible. Drug categories like alpha blockers, beta blockers, diuretics, antidepressants, or medications for Parkinson's disease or erectile dysfunction could have a negative influence on blood pressure levels. Moreover, a person's lifestyle choices can also have an effect on blood pressure. Factors like diet, exercise, stress, or recreational drug use can drastically impact blood pressure. A diet high in salt, lack of physical activity, heavy alcohol consumption, or using illicit drugs can all contribute to low blood pressure. In addition to these factors, sudden changes in lifestyle or unexpected, stressful events can affect the body both emotionally and physically, thereby influencing blood pressure. For example, a person who has recently been through a major life change, such as a job loss, a move, or a death in the family, may undergo a temporary drop in blood pressure as a response to the increased stress. Hence, when trying to raise blood pressure, an integrated approach, which encompasses all these factors and addresses each one of them, is usually most effective. The first step in this process should always be to identify which of these potential factors are relevant for the person suffering from low blood pressure. From then on, it is crucial to collaborate with medical professionals such as a primary care physician or a cardiologist to develop a personal, comprehensive plan that will help increase blood pressure in a safe, controlled, and sustainable way. The next phase in the process involves implementing the strategies chosen in the personal plan. It may include starting, adjusting, or stopping certain medications, making dietary adjustments, instituting an exercise routine, addressing mental health concerns or managing stress."},{"question":"Q:- Magma comes up to the surface of the earth - The magma cools - Particles inside the magma move closer together - Crystals are formed What might be the last step of the process? A:","response":"The last step of the process, following the formation of crystals, is the solidification of the remaining magma and the formation of igneous rock. As the crystals continue to grow and develop, they will eventually interlock with one another, which in turn creates a more compact structure. The newly formed rock, now solid and stable, will ultimately transition from a molten state to a solid state. This step can further be explained through the following sub-steps: 1. Cooling rate slows down: As the magma gradually loses heat and cools down, the rate at which it does so starts to decrease, allowing the magma to cool more slowly as it reaches a more solid state. 2. Remaining liquid solidification: While some of the magma has already crystallized, the remaining liquid part of the magma still needs to solidify. This process is dependent on various factors such as composition, pressure, and the presence of any impurities or volatiles, which can influence the cooling rate and determine the type of igneous rock that may form. 3. Interlocking of crystals: As the remaining liquid portion solidifies, the formed crystals continue to grow and start to interlock with one another. The interlocking of these crystals makes the rock more stable and resistant to various physical and chemical alterations. This interconnected structure becomes the primary feature of most igneous rocks. 4. Formation of igneous rock: With the interlocking of crystals and the complete solidification of the remaining magma, an igneous rock is formed. There are two main types of igneous rocks depending on where the solidification occurred; if the process takes place beneath the Earth's surface, it forms plutonic or intrusive igneous rocks, and if the process occurs on the Earth's surface, it forms volcanic or extrusive igneous rocks. These rocks are characterized by their texture, mineral composition, and the size of the crystals. 5. Erosion and weathering: The newly formed igneous rocks may become exposed to the Earth's atmosphere and weathering processes over time. This exposure can cause physical and chemical alterations to the rock structure, eventually leading to the breakdown and erosion of the rocks. The eroded materials may be transported and deposited elsewhere, serving as the starting point for new geological processes such as sedimentation and the formation of sedimentary rocks. In conclusion, the last step of the process after crystals are formed in magma is the solidification of the remaining magma and the formation of igneous rock, characterized by the interlocking crystal structure. The type of igneous rock formed will be determined by the specific conditions and location of solidification. The rock will eventually become subject to erosion and weathering processes, which may lead to its transformation into other types of rocks or sediments."},{"question":"Countering Krugman, Peter J.

Here is a breakdown of each option: A. Fall: A fall can cause a headache if it results in a head injury, traumatic brain injury, or concussion. These injuries can lead to inflammation, swelling, and pressure within the skull, which can cause head pain. B. Schizophrenia: Schizophrenia itself is a mental health disorder and is not directly linked to causing headaches. However, individuals with schizophrenia may experience stress, anxiety, or sleep disturbances that can lead to tension headaches or migraines. C. Made fun of: Being made fun of can lead to emotional distress, which could contribute to tension headaches or stress-related headaches. Emotional responses to such situations can cause muscle tension and tightening in the head and neck, leading to headaches. D. False information: Receiving false information may cause confusion, stress, or anxiety. These factors can contribute to headaches, particularly tension headaches, by increasing muscle tension in the head and neck area. E. Brain tumor: A brain tumor can indeed be a cause of headaches.

I’d always thought that colomba would make a very good baking project but was somewhat intimated by getting the right shape — it’s vaguely in the shape of a dove, if you use your imagination — and texture — wonderfully soft, fluffy, sweet yeasted bread. I had attempted making panettone (this fig, walnut and date panettone) a few years ago with fair results — absolutely delicious results, actually, they were just not as fluffy and bouncy as expertly made ones from your favourite pastry shop where panettoni are hung upside-down to maintain their height and airiness. But when I came across the familiar brown and gold paper forms for making colomba at the supermarket, I thought I’m only ever going to get a chance to make this now! Like the panettone, I referred to my favourite baking book for Italian specialties, Carol Field’s The Italian Baker. Field recounts a bit of history behind the colomba, which I’m sure is little known to anyone these days. Colomba is a fixture at Easter tables all around Italy (and is often given as presents), even though it comes from the north of Italy, Pavia. It is one of those traditions that are now a given, where a slice of colomba, perhaps eaten with pieces of a cracked chocolate Easter egg and an espresso or a glass of dessert wine, is a welcome end to the meal (or indeed breakfast the next day).

He was defeated in 288 BC when Lysimachus of Thrace and Pyrrhus of Epirus invaded Macedon on two fronts, and quickly carved up the kingdom for themselves. Demetrius fled to central Greece with his mercenaries and began to build support there and in the northern Peloponnese. He once again laid siege to Athens after they turned on him, but then struck a treaty with the Athenians and Ptolemy, which allowed him to cross over to Asia minor and wage war on Lysimachus' holdings in Ionia, leaving his son Antigonus Gonatas in Greece. After initial successes, he was forced to surrender to Seleucus in 285 and later died in captivity. Lysimachus, who had seized Macedon and Thessaly for himself, was forced into war when Seleucus invaded his territories in Asia minor and was defeated and killed in 281 BCE at the Battle of Corupedium, near Sardis. Seleucus then attempted to conquer Lysimachus' European territories in Thrace and Macedon, but he was assassinated by Ptolemy Ceraunus (\\"the thunderbolt\\"), who had taken refuge at the Seleucid court and then had himself acclaimed as king of Macedon. Ptolemy was killed when Macedon was invaded by Gauls in 279, his head stuck on a spear and the country fell into anarchy.

The Inca Empire, or Tawantinsuyu in the Quechua language, was the largest empire in pre-Columbian America and it was the culmination of a long history of Andean civilizations. The Inca Empire was established around the 13th century and lasted until the Spanish conquest in the 16th century. The capital of the empire was the city of Cusco, which is located in present-day Peru. The Incas were known for their advanced social organization, monumental architecture, and technological innovations such as extensive road networks and the use of a communication system called quipu. At its height, the Inca Empire was home to over 10 million people belonging to various ethnic groups, who were all subjected to the overarching Inca political and economic system. The empire was divided into four provinces or suyus, which were linked by an extensive road system, the Qhapaq Ñan, that extended for more than 40,000 kilometers. This efficient communication network allowed for rapid military mobilization and administrative control. The Incas were skilled builders and architects, constructing impressive structures like the famous Machu Picchu. This ancient city, located high in the Andes mountains, was an Inca citadel built around 1450 and is now one of the most famous archaeological sites in the world. Other well-known structures by the Incas include the fortress of Sacsayhuamán, the Temple of the Sun, and the agricultural terraces at Moray. The Inca society was based on a hierarchical system, with the Sapa Inca, or the emperor, at the top. The nobility comprised the ruling class, while the majority of the population was made up of commoners. The Incas had a centralized bureaucracy, with various offices responsible for different aspects of the administration. The decline of the Inca Empire began with a civil war between two brothers, Atahualpa and Huáscar, who were fighting for the throne. The Spanish conquistadors, led by Francisco Pizarro, arrived in the midst of this conflict in 1532. Within a few years, the Spaniards managed to seize power and execute Atahualpa, bringing an end to the once-mighty Inca Empire. Today, the remnants of the Inca civilization, including diverse indigenous cultures and Quechua, the most widely spoken language of the Inca Empire, continue to be part of the rich cultural heritage of Peru and other Andean countries."},{"question":"This is a correct answer to the following question about Bacon. Yes or no? Answer: Bacon-cured pork loin is known as back bacon . Question: what part of the pig is bacon A:","response":"Yes, the answer you provided is correct. Bacon-cured pork loin is known as back bacon. However, to give you a more detailed answer, bacon typically comes from various parts of the pig, depending on the type of bacon. There are different types of bacon, primarily determined by the part of the pig used: 1. Back bacon - This comes from the pork loin, which is a leaner cut located at the top rear section of the pig. Back bacon can include a small amount of fat, depending on how it's trimmed. 2. Streaky bacon - This type of bacon comes from the pork belly and is characterized by its alternating layers of meat and fat. It's the most common type of bacon in the United States and is often referred to as American bacon. 3. Middle bacon - Middle bacon is a combination of the leaner back bacon and the fattier streaky bacon. It's taken from the side of the pig and includes both the pork loin and a portion of the pork belly. 4. Jowl bacon - This type of bacon comes from the jowls (cheeks) of the pig and has a higher fat content. It's popular in Southern American cuisine and often used for flavoring dishes. Therefore, bacon can come from various parts of the pig, and the specific cut determines its name and characteristics."},{"question":"Multi-choice problem: Continue writing the next sentence in this paragraph: How to become more assertive during your college years Speak up in class. Many people in college find it difficult to have the confidence to speak up in class. You may feel intimidated by your classmates or professor, or you may be afraid to mess up with the wrong answer. (a). Confidence in yourself is important to cultivate as you're an assertive figure in an otherwise bland environment. When faced with confrontation, stand up straight. (b). If you are afraid you will miss a class, show that you are an intelligent and creative person by speaking up in class. Always strive to catch the comments your classmates or professor makes. (c). Class participation is important for your education, not only so you learn how to confidently express your ideas and knowledge, but many professors incorporate it into your grade. If you need your professor to explain or repeat something, raise your hand and ask them to explain what they just said. (d). It's important that you act assertively in class. If you feel like you are not being listened to, pull yourself together and stand up for yourself.","response":"(c). Class participation is important for your education, not only so you learn how to confidently express your ideas and knowledge, but many professors incorporate it into your grade. If you need your professor to explain or repeat something, raise your hand and ask them to explain what they just said. Explanation: The question asks for the next sentence in a paragraph about becoming more assertive in college and speaking up in class. Option (c) is the correct choice because it elaborates on the importance of participating in class and encourages students to ask questions, which is directly related to the topic. It also mentions that class participation can be a component of the final grade, which adds to its relevance. (a) This option uses the phrase \\"otherwise bland environment,\\" which is irrelevant and could be considered offensive. It also dives into the topic of confrontation, which is not the focus of the paragraph. (b) This option does not directly address assertiveness or speaking up in class, as it mainly focuses on missing a class, showing intelligence, and catching comments. These points do not contribute to the development of assertiveness. (d) This option jumps straight to acting assertively and standing up for oneself but does not address the importance of class participation and might seem too confrontative in the given context."},{"question":"Answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.

Since replacing Michael Flynn as National Security Adviser, H.R. McMaster has worked to wrest control of the National Security Council away from the nationalist wing of the administration, carrying out a series of high-profile staffing changes in the process. Think back: Cohen-Watnick first gained notoriety in March as one of Devin Nunes' purported sources for the alleged unmasking of Trump team associates during incidental intelligence collection by the Obama administration. McMaster reportedly tried to force him out of his position after the CIA deemed him as \\"a threat,\\" but that move was shot down by Bannon and Jared Kushner after they appealed directly to President Trump. More of McMaster's attempts to reshape Trump's NSC... Steve Bannon Trump's chief strategist controversially held a seat on the NSC during the earliest days of the Trump administration, while Flynn was still at the helm. But in April, soon after McMaster was brought in, he launched a restructuring of the NSC that — among other things — saw Bannon lose his seat at the table, along with his most direct influence on the country's national security policy. K.T. McFarland Just days after Bannon lost his seat at the NSC, McMaster also pushed out Deputy National Security Adviser K.T. McFarland, a former Fox News contributor and Flynn ally. McFarland stayed in the administration — her nomination to become ambassador to Singapore is currently pending — but she lost her key national security position. Tera Dahl McMaster reassigned Dahl, a deputy chief of staff at the NSC who mostly occupied an administrative role, in early July, per Buzzfeed. Dahl was known to have close ties to Bannon, having previously worked as a columnist at Breitbart News. She had founded a think tank with the wife of NSC aide Sebastian Gorka that warned against the use of \\"politically correct\\" terms when discussing terrorism. Derek Harvey Last week, McMaster removed Harvey, the NSC's Middle East adviser, from his post, per Foreign Policy. Though the reasoning wasn't immediately made clear, Harvey was brought in by Flynn and was a noted hawk on Iran. He had also drafted a list of Obama-era \\"holdovers\\" employed by the NSC, a nod to the \\"deep state\\" theory in some conservative circles. Rich Higgins News broke earlier today that Bannon ally Rich Higgins, a director of strategic planning for the National Security Council, was fired last month after crafting a memo warning that \\"globalists and Islamists\\" were undertaking a \\"Maoist insurgency\\" to undermine President Trump via \\"political warfare,\\" per The Atlantic. ||||| FILE - In this July 3, 2017, file photo, President Donald Trump boards Air Force One at Morristown Municipal Airport, in Morristown, N.J., en route to Washington from Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster,... (Associated Press) FILE - In this July 3, 2017, file photo, President Donald Trump boards Air Force One at Morristown Municipal Airport, in Morristown, N.J., en route to Washington from Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster,... (Associated Press) WASHINGTON (AP) — Donald Trump once questioned the wisdom of taking vacations. \\"What's the point?\\" he asked. But now the president is getting ready to join the annual August exodus from this town he calls \\"the swamp.\\" Trump is due to set out Friday on his first extended vacation from Washington since the inauguration — a 17-day getaway to his private golf club in central New Jersey. The president's vacation could be driven, in part, by necessity. Everyone who works in the White House West Wing, including the Oval Office occupant himself, will be forced to clear out by week's end so that the government can replace the balky, 27-year-old heating and cooling system. But the White House hasn't been entertaining questions about the president's August plans. Asked whether Trump would be leaving Washington this month, given his recent warning that Congress should stick around until they vote on health care legislation, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Tuesday: \\"We'll continue to keep you guys updated on his August schedule as those details are finalized.\\" Trump and his supporters like to tout his disdain for taking vacations, when the truth is he takes them constantly. \\"Don't take vacations. What's the point? If you're not enjoying your work, you're in the wrong job,\\" Trump wrote in his 2004 book, \\"Trump: Think Like a Billionaire.\\" He told Larry King in an interview that year that \\"most of the people I know that are successful really don't take vacations. Their business is their vacation. I rarely leave. You know that,\\" Trump said. \\"You and I are friends. How often do you see me going away?\\" Actually, Trump gets out of town quite often. So far, he has spent 13 of his 28 weekends in office away from the White House, mostly at his properties in Palm Beach, Florida, or in Bedminster, New Jersey, according to an Associated Press count. The figures include a weekend during official travel overseas, and Father's Day weekend at Camp David, the government-owned presidential retreat in Maryland. Contrast Trump's own frequent getaways with his criticism, before and during last year's presidential campaign, of former President Barack Obama's vacations and frequent golf outings. \\"@BarackObama played golf yesterday. Now he heads to a 10 day vacation in Martha's Vineyard. Nice work ethic,\\" Trump tweeted in August 2011. Trump said last year that he wouldn't have time for golf if he became president. \\"I'm going to be working for you, I'm not going to have time to go play golf,\\" he told supporters in Virginia. But he plays golf whenever he's at his clubs; sometimes it's the full 18 holes, other times less than that. His staff rarely acknowledges that he plays, even when photos of him on the course pop up on social media. Presidents have been escaping Washington's summer heat and humidity ever since Thomas Jefferson looked out of the White House windows and watched as a white fog that was believed to be toxic rolled in. Harry Truman played poker on the porch in Key West, Florida. Ronald Reagan rode horses at his mountain ranch in California. Bill Clinton and Barack Obama both spent August vacations on Martha's Vineyard, the tiny Massachusetts island that serves as a summer playground for the rich and famous. George W. Bush retreated to his secluded Crawford, Texas, ranch to clear brush and ride his mountain bike. Besides the replacement of the West Wing's heating and cooling system, repairs are also to be made to the steps on the South Portico, the side of the White House facing the National Mall. Cosmetic upgrades, including interior painting, replacing carpeting and curtains and fixing water leaks in the press office ceiling, are also on the maintenance list. Repairmen and others are expected to work around the clock during the coming weeks to complete all the upgrades by Aug. 21. Presidents travel with the equivalent of a mini-White House made up of advisers, other aides and security, and they must be prepared to deal with a crisis at all hours and from wherever they are. But chronic stress affects the body's ability to resist infection, maintain vital functions and avoid injuries, Susan Krauss Whitbourne, then a professor of psychological and brain sciences at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, wrote in a 2010 paper on the website of Psychology Today subtitled \\"why presidents (and all of us) need vacations.\\" Stressed out people are more likely to get sick, have accidents, sleep poorly, be more irritable and less fun to be around. Whitebourne wrote that vacations break the \\"stress cycle.\\" \\"Perhaps it's good that someone as important as our president is showing that he believes it's beneficial to take a break from the office, get out and enjoy the outdoors in a little bit of a break in mindset and, we would hope, be able to go back to work refreshed and renewed and do a better job,\\" Whitbourne, who currently teaches at the university's Boston campus, told the AP in a telephone interview. \\"I think that's the theory of vacations.\\" ___ Associated Press writer Nancy Benac contributed to this report. ___ Follow Darlene Superville on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/dsupervilleap ||||| Summary:","response":"National Security Advisor H.R.

A. hockey game B. cold weather C. refrigerator D. zoo E. antarctica The best answer is Answer:","response":"The best answer is D. Zoo. Here's a detailed explanation for each option: A. Hockey Game - Ice is an essential part of a hockey game, as the sport is played on a surface made of frozen water, called an ice rink. Therefore, it would be highly likely to find ice at a hockey game. B. Cold Weather - Ice is formed when water freezes, which occurs at temperatures below its freezing point (32°F or 0°C). Therefore, during cold weather, it would be likely to find ice on surfaces such as sidewalks, roads, or natural bodies of water like rivers and lakes. C. Refrigerator - Most refrigerators have a cooling mechanism that involves the circulation of refrigerants, which can cause the water vapor inside the refrigerator to freeze. This results in the formation of ice, especially in the freezer section. Finding ice in a refrigerator is a common occurrence. D. Zoo - A zoo primarily serves as a facility where various animals are housed and cared for. While certain animals, like polar bears or penguins, may require ice or cold conditions for their habitats, it would not be common to find ice widely present throughout the zoo. This makes it the least likely place to find ice among the given options. E. Antarctica - Antarctica is the southernmost continent on Earth, and it is almost entirely covered in ice.

Given Problem A: ['B', 'a', '4039', 'a', '7277', '4837', 'C', 'p', 'd', '2113', 'W', 'X'] Applying the steps: Step 1: numbers_list = [] Step 2: Iterating through A: - 'B': not a number - 'a': not a number - '4039': is a number, add to 'numbers_list' -> numbers_list = ['4039'] - 'a': not a number - '7277': is a number, add to 'numbers_list' -> numbers_list = ['4039', '7277'] - '4837': is a number, add to 'numbers_list' -> numbers_list = ['4039', '7277', '4837'] - 'C': not a number - 'p': not a number - 'd': not a number - '2113': is a number, add to 'numbers_list' -> numbers_list = ['4039', '7277', '4837', '2113'] - 'W': not a number - 'X': not a number Step 3: 'numbers_list' contains all the elements that are numbers -> ['4039', '7277', '4837', '2113'] Step 4: Return the 'numbers_list' as the solution. Solution: ['4039', '7277', '4837', '2113']"},{"question":"Q: I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: what material is a mouse pad made out of? Suggested answer: A mousepad with a padded wrist rest. Should I validate this answer? A:","response":"The suggested answer is not entirely accurate, as it does not fully address the question of what material a mousepad is made out of. Instead, it mentions a specific feature of some mousepads (a padded wrist rest), which is not necessarily relevant to the core question. A more appropriate answer to the question \\"what material is a mouse pad made out of?\\" would cover the different types of materials that could be found in typical mouse pads. So, a detailed response would look something like this: Mouse pads can be made from various materials, depending on the design and purpose. The most common materials include: 1. Rubber foam base: This serves as the bottom layer of a mousepad, providing grip and stability. The rubber foam base is anti-slip and can be either hard or soft, depending on user preference. 2. Fabric (e.g., polyester, microfiber, or cloth): This is a top layer material that provides a smooth surface for the mouse to glide across. The fabric layer can also have varying textures, which may affect the precision of the mouse movements. Some mouse pads have heat-treated surfaces for a smoother glide. 3. Plastic (e.g., polyethylene or acrylic): Some mouse pads have a hard plastic surface instead of a fabric layer. Hard plastic pads generally offer greater durability and are often preferred by gamers for their low friction surfaces that enable quicker mouse movements. 4. Metal (e.g., aluminum): Metal mouse pads are less common but provide a sleek, premium feel. They are durable and offer a unique texture. 5. Glass: These mouse pads typically have a frosted or textured surface to provide optimal tracking for the mouse. Glass mouse pads are easier to clean and have an elegant appearance, but they may not be suitable for all mice and users. 6. Gel or foam wrist rest: As you mentioned, some mouse pads do include a padded wrist rest, which is made of a comfortable gel or foam material. This additional feature is designed to provide ergonomic support and alleviate strain during long periods of use. In conclusion, while the suggested answer you provided is not completely incorrect, it does not offer a comprehensive understanding of the various materials that mouse pads can be made from. A more accurate response would include details about rubber foam bases, fabric surfaces, plastic, metal, and glass options, and the potential addition of ergonomic wrist rests."},{"question":"Claim: \\"The most common injuries from Parachuting are to outstretched limbs, such as hands or ankles.\\" Is the claim above correct, and can it be verified by human common sense and without a web search? Options: - yes - no The thought process:","response":"The claim states that the most common injuries from parachuting are to outstretched limbs, such as hands or ankles. To verify this claim, we can think step-by-step and use our understanding of parachuting and potential risks involved. 1. Parachuting involves jumping from a significant height and using a parachute to control the speed of descent. This suggests that the impact during landing could be a potential cause of injury. 2. When landing from a parachuting jump, it makes sense that people would instinctively try to brace themselves for the impact or to maintain balance. This might lead individuals to outstretch their limbs, such as extending their arms or legs upon impact. 3. Considering the forces and pressure applied to the body during the landing, it seems reasonable that outstretched limbs could be prone to injury. Injuries to ankles may occur if a person lands with their legs extended and their weight is not distributed evenly, while injuries to hands might result if a person tries to break their fall with an outstretched arm. 4. Parachuting is an activity with inherent risks, and even with proper training and equipment, accidents can happen. Thus, it is plausible that injuries to outstretched limbs are indeed common during parachuting. Based on this thought process and our general understanding of parachuting, it appears that the claim is plausible. However, without specific data about injury rates and types, it cannot be absolutely verified by human common sense and without a web search.

However, I have to acknowledge that no diet is perfect for every single person and Mediterranean diet is no exception to that rule. The Mediterranean Diet is not for everyone. There may be some people who find that they have negative reactions to some of the foods on the diet – others may find that it simply is not suitable for their lifestyle. However, it is an excellent choice for most people because the health benefits are tremendous. Lower blood pressure, reduced cholesterol levels, reduced risk of diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, diabetes and much more. The diet is based on consuming wholesome fresh foods in their natural state and by cooking them in a healthy ways. Red meats are eaten only on occasion; sugar, processed foods filled with additives, fast foods, and junk food, which are the cause of so many illnesses in today’s world are simply not eaten. It should not be news that most health problems in the US can be attributed to a poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle. The Mediterranean diet solves both problems, if you let it. It provides the healthy nutritious foods your body needs for energy and well-being; plus, it incorporates exercise to solve the sedentary lifestyle issue. Let’s look at some of the potential difficulties. 1. The diet can be expensive. When you eat primarily fish, fresh (preferably organic) fruits and vegetables, nuts, etc. you will find that they are more expensive than grabbing a cheeseburger from a fast food joint or buying junk food from the vending machine at work. But . . . if you consider the health problems you may endure in the future and the cost of health care that goes with those problems, you may want to think twice about the actual cost. The healthy foods on the Mediterranean diet may not seem so expensive after all. According to the above context, answer the following question. How long does someone need to stay on the Mediterranean diet for? The answer is:","response":"The length of time someone should stay on the Mediterranean diet can vary from person to person depending on individual goals, personal preferences, and how their body responds to the diet. The Mediterranean diet is not a short-term, quick-fix solution for weight loss or health issues. Instead, it is a sustainable lifestyle choice that promotes long-term health and well-being. For individuals who enjoy the Mediterranean diet and its benefits, it can become a lifelong choice. It is essential to understand that adopting the Mediterranean diet is about making lasting changes to one's eating habits and overall lifestyle, rather than setting a specific time limit. Incorporating the diet's principles and staying consistent with it over time will yield the most significant health benefits. The Mediterranean diet has been associated with various health advantages, such as lower blood pressure, reduced cholesterol levels, and reduced risks of diseases like cancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and diabetes. To reap these benefits, it is essential to maintain the diet consistently for an extended period. Some studies suggest that the health benefits become more apparent after a few months of following the diet, while others demonstrate long-term improvements in health markers after several years. In conclusion, there is no fixed duration for someone to stay on the Mediterranean diet. It is primarily about adopting a sustainable and healthy lifestyle choice that can be maintained throughout one's life. The longer an individual commits to the diet and incorporates its principles into their daily routines, the more significant the potential health benefits they can experience."},{"question":"Question: Breathing was difficult after the injury, but he was still able to what with it?

He returned to the practice field for the first time since suffering a right ankle injury in Week 3 against the New York Giants. Breeland said the ankle was stiff, but he didn’t experience any pain during practice. He doesn’t think it’s enough to impact his play however. He has been sidelined the past two games because of the injury, and Breeland said he’s itching to get back on the field. “It feels like I ain’t played in five games,” Breeland said. “You know [with the way] I started the season, I’m just ready to go ahead and turn the hat over.” He received some negative tweets from Redskins fans after celebrating Washington’s victory on Sunday over the Baltimore Ravens. Breeland responded and said he “wanted to be the villain at that point in time” because of criticism after a win. His season got off to a rough start after an impressive training camp. Breeland recorded an interception in the season opener against the Pittsburgh Steelers, but he allowed two touchdowns to wide receiver Antonio Brown on plays that could’ve resulted in takeaways. It spiraled down from there as questions arose about why the Redskins didn’t use cornerback Josh Norman to trail Brown. During the second half of Washington’s game against the Dallas Cowboys in Week 2, defensive coordinator Joe Barry made the switch to have Norman trail wide receiver Dez Bryant during the fourth quarter. these so call redskins fans need to stop wasting their breathe talking to me like im a slouch check ur history real talk #HTTR — Bashaud Breeland (@Salute_me17) October 10, 2016 “To me, I feel like I’m one of those players where I know I messed up,” Breeland said. “I know I’ve played bad, and I critique myself.

It’s a fresh week. You don’t have to keep relaying that to me. I know that. “Those plays lost us the game, and I know that. I don’t fault them for what they’re saying. But them knowing me, and if you’re a real Redskins fan and you know me, then you should know that I’m always going to bounce back. That was my only issue. It don’t bother me when they say that.” Breeland hasn’t had a chance to redeem himself because of the injury he suffered during the Giants game. He said he wanted to show Redskins fans in his tweets that his confidence hasn’t been shot despite the slow start. “I feel good,” Breeland said when asked if he’ll play on Sunday against the Philadelphia Eagles. “I feel confident that I’m capable of playing.

Was the original James Bond actor born near the Washington Monument? Answer. no What step-by-step reasoning justifies that answer?","response":"The original James Bond actor was Sir Sean Connery, who was not born near the Washington Monument. Here's the step-by-step reasoning that justifies this answer: 1. Identify the original James Bond actor: Sir Sean Connery is widely recognized as the original actor to portray James Bond in the film series. He first appeared in the role in the 1962 film, \\"Dr. No.\\" 2. Determine Sir Sean Connery's birthplace: Sean Connery was born on August 25, 1930, in Edinburgh, Scotland. Edinburgh is the capital city of Scotland and is part of the United Kingdom. 3. Identify the location of the Washington Monument: The Washington Monument is located in Washington, D.C., the capital of the United States of America. 4. Compare the birthplace of Sir Sean Connery and the location of the Washington Monument: Edinburgh, Scotland, and Washington, D.C., are geographically distant from one another. Edinburgh is situated in Europe, while Washington, D.C. is in North America. Based on this step-by-step reasoning, it can be concluded that Sir Sean Connery, the original James Bond actor, was not born near the Washington Monument, as he was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, rather than in Washington, D.C."},{"question":"Select from the following. -- Yes -- No The money had turned up missing, so Jesse gave Sasha the chance to confess. Given the question \\"What will Sasha want to do next?\\", is \\"lie about stealing the money\\" a valid answer? Answer:","response":"As an AI, I don't have the ability to predict individual human behaviors in specific scenarios based on limited context. However, whether \\"lie about stealing the money\\" is a valid answer depends on certain factors not mentioned in the question: Sasha's character, guilt, fear of consequences, and her relationship with Jesse, among others. If Sasha actually stole the money and feels that lying could help her avoid trouble, this could indeed be a possible next step. However, if Sasha is innocent or values honesty, she might not choose to lie, instead opting to defend her innocence or admit guilt.

The gentry elite engaged in the arts as accepted pastimes of the cultured scholar-official, including painting, composing poetry, and writing calligraphy. The poet and statesman Su Shi and his associate Mi Fu (1051–1107) enjoyed antiquarian affairs, often borrowing or buying art pieces to study and copy. Poetry and literature profited from the rising popularity and development of the ci poetry form. Enormous encyclopedic volumes were compiled, such as works of historiography and dozens of treatises on technical subjects. This included the universal history text of the Zizhi Tongjian, compiled into 1000 volumes of 9.4 million written Chinese characters. The genre of Chinese travel literature also became popular with the writings of the geographer Fan Chengda (1126–1193) and Su Shi, the latter of whom wrote the 'daytrip essay' known as Record of Stone Bell Mountain that used persuasive writing to argue for a philosophical point.

Donald Trump seems poised for a big win, but is there anything that could stop him? He leads the delegate count by a considerable number, but Ted Cruz has been making key plays in delegate elections, setting himself up for a second-ballot upset should the Republican National Convention get that far. Today, however, is where we get a better look at the inevitability of Donald J. Trump. The real estate mogul leads in the delegate count with 845 bound delegates – nearly three hundred more than Cruz, who has 559. Up for grabs tonight are delegates in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, Rhode Island, and Connecticut – a total of 172. A total sweep isn’t likely in any of the states, but a solid showing by Trump will make a lot of people nervous. The States The territory – the northeastern states where Ted Cruz was never expected to do well – under normal circumstances would be ripe for John Kasich. These moderate-to-liberal-leaning Republicans are his people. However, the mere existence of Trump, a man from the northeast and someone who has somehow up-ended the natural order of politics (in a less-than-positive way), means that Kasich will have to fight very hard for the votes in these states. Cruz’s best chances lay in Pennsylvania, the only state where he is consistently polling in second place (however, he is still at best 14 points behind Trump, mind you – more on the polling below). Cruz’s best states may ultimately be behind him, but a joint effort between he and Kasich seem to be their last hope to keep Trump from getting the 1,237 delegates that would ensure him a first ballot win in July. The Polling As mentioned above, the polling looks great for Trump and bad for everyone else. Over at RealClearPolitics, the averages are all at least 20 points in his favor. In Pennsylvania, the average is at about 20 points separating Trump and Cruz. Trump has only broken 50% in one of those polls, but has been close in two others – a 48% and 49% – at minimum an 8-point jump in a matter of weeks. One Maryland poll has Trump over 50%, while two others have him in the 40s. However, Trump’s best states are the remaining three. Mind you, Delaware only has one poll out there, and in the other two states, Trump’s biggest leads are shown in polls from Public Policy Polling. Not that it’s likely Trump is actually in danger of being overtaken by Kasich, but it’s incredibly difficult to determine where the final numbers will actually go – we expect Trump to pretty much sweep the night, but we have no idea by how much. The Process As the voters go to the polls, the rules for each state (as they are wont to do) vary wildly. Here are the basics: Pennsylvania – Winner-take-all in the statewide delegate race, but a loophole primary for the districts. It’s also a closed primary, which on average have produced worse results for Trump than open primaries. Maryland – A basic winner-take-all in both statewide and district results, along with a closed party primary. Connecticut – This state is a winner-take-most state. Also closed party. Rhode Island – A proportional delegate primary, with a modified party primary system (meaning major party voters have to stick to their party, but independents can vote in whichever party primary they want). Delaware – Winner-take-all, and a closed party primary. Analysis While we expect Trump to win, by how much will be the interesting question. Four of the states, including the big one – Pennsylvania – meaning a good ground game by the other two candidates could throw a wrench into Trump’s plans. Rhode Island is the only state that will allow independents to vote in a major party’s primary, which could end up being where we see Trump’s largest margin of victory. If you are #NeverTrump, it will not be a good night for you. The bright spots will come in the form of lower Trump turnout/support where the closed primaries are concerned. ||||| A sudden political alliance between Ted Cruz and John Kasich against Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump quickly ran into speed bumps Monday that exposed the plan’s risks and called into question whether it would work. In their unconventional last-ditch scheme, Kasich said he would clear the way for Cruz to face Trump in Indiana while Cruz would return the favor in Oregon and New Mexico. The plan aimed to produce what anti-Trump Republicans have yearned for since the fall: a one-on-one showdown with the mogul. But less than 12 hours after the pact was announced, Kasich undercut the idea by declaring Monday that his supporters in Indiana should still vote for him. The Ohio governor also plans to keep raising money in the state and to meet Tuesday with Republican Gov. Mike Pence. Cruz, meanwhile, said that Kasich was “pulling out” of the state. A super PAC supporting the senator from Texas also said it would continue to air an anti-Kasich ad in the state — a sign the Cruz camp fears Kasich could still peel away enough support to sink Cruz’s chances here. The tumult fueled doubts about the arrangement among voters and Republican elites, who worried that Cruz and Kasich have handed Trump a ready-made argument that the party establishment is plotting against him. The mogul said as much in a series of stump speeches on the eve of primary voting on Tuesday, when Trump is poised to rack up delegates in five Eastern states: Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. The Fix's Chris Cillizza explains why the strategic alliance between Ted Cruz and John Kasich seems destined to fail. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) “Honestly, it shows such total weakness, and it’s pathetic when two longtime insider politicians — establishment guys, whether you like it or not — have to collude, have to get together to try to beat a guy that really speaks what the people want,” Trump said at a rally in Warwick, R.I. [Cruz has more to gain from deal with Kasich, according to delegate rules] Cruz and Kasich are bound by two self-serving goals: winning enough delegates between them to prevent Trump from clinching the nomination outright and trying to demonstrate that he isn’t favored by most Republicans. If those goals are met, July’s Republican National Convention in Cleveland is likely to be a free-for-all offering Cruz and, perhaps, Kasich a shot at the nomination. Already on Monday, many Republicans were dubious. “It’s hard to assess whether it will have any significant impact,” former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty, who supported Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and is neutral now, said by email. “Voters tend to stick to their preferred candidate for personal, not tactical, reasons.” The marriage of political convenience was announced in separate news releases late Sunday night by the two campaigns. But it was immediately put to the test early Monday, when Kasich said at a news conference at Philadelphia’s Penrose Diner that any Indiana voter inclined to vote for him should do so. Ted Cruz appears with his daughters Caroline and Catherine at a campaign event in Columbus, Ind. (Aaron P. Bernstein/Reuters) “I’ve never told ’em not to vote for me,” Kasich said. “They ought to vote for me. But I’m not over there campaigning and spending resources.” Just hours earlier, Kasich’s campaign co-chair in Indiana was saying the opposite. “Kasich is asking his supporters in Indiana to vote for Cruz so Trump does not win Indiana,” Carmel Mayor Jim Brainard Cruz told the Indianapolis Star, suggesting that Cruz would do the same with his voters in Oregon and New Mexico. Kasich scrapped his public events in Indiana, but he still plans to meet with Pence — as Cruz and Trump did last week — and to hold a fundraiser in Indiana on Tuesday, according to Kasich campaign consultant Pete Seat. The announcements on Sunday did not specifically say what the candidates’ voters should do, but the intent was clear: to try to help Cruz win Indiana on May 3 and to help Kasich claim Oregon on May 17 and New Mexico on June 7. [Is Indiana the last stand for the ‘Never Trump’ movement?] Outside groups supporting Cruz and Kasich and opposed to Trump appeared mostly keen on the plan. But the pro-Cruz super PAC Trusted Leadership said it planned to continue broadcasting an anti-Kasich ad in Indiana while ceasing plans to air ads in Oregon and New Mexico. Speaking to reporters before a rally here in Borden, Cruz said it was “big news today that John Kasich has decided to pull out of Indiana to give us a head-to-head contest with Donald Trump.” He said the division of resources in key primary states “made sense from both campaigns.” At Cruz’s rally, where he did not mention he was ceding Oregon and New Mexico, there was some skepticism about whether the plan would help the senator from Texas in next week’s primary or instead bolster Trump. “It could go either way,” said Pat Cambron of Borden, who is deciding between Cruz and Trump. “It might be a little late,” said Mary Jean Halbleighb, a Cruz supporter from Floyds Knobs. [On policies, Ted Cruz shifts his stance to suit a fractured GOP] The deal was discussed in a private meeting last week between Cruz campaign manager Jeff Roe and Kasich chief strategist John Weaver on the sidelines of the Republican National Committee’s spring meeting in Hollywood, Fla., said a person with knowledge of the discussions who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The deal was finalized Sunday in phone calls between the two advisers. Limited public polling in Indiana has shown that Cruz stands the best chance of stopping Trump on May 3. Cruz and his allies were worried about Kasich pulling critical votes away from him in the Hoosier State. Kasich’s campaign said it sees similarities between Oregon, New Mexico and the Northeast, where Kasich’s centrist pitch has won him more support than Cruz. But Kasich has struggled overall, notching his only win in his home state. Overall, Trump leads the Republican race with 845 delegates, according to the latest Associated Press count. Cruz has 559, while Kasich is much further back with 148. To win the nomination outright, a candidate must clinch 1,237 delegates. If that doesn’t happen, a contested convention will be triggered and the nomination will be up for grabs. At a town hall meeting in Rockville, Md., Kasich assured the crowd that an open convention would be good for Republicans and for the country, and suggested that voters were figuring that out. “Some guy, when I was walking into this diner this morning, shouted out: ‘It’s so nice to see you, Governor Lincoln!’ ” said Kasich. “You go hit Google and find out what he could mean by that, okay?” He was referring to a fact that the campaign later pushed out on Twitter: At seven of 10 open conventions, the eventual winner was not the candidate who entered as the favorite. One of the underdogs who won was Abraham Lincoln in 1860. In his back-and-forth with reporters, Cruz was pressed on Trump’s assertion that he was engaging in collusion. Signaling how he intends to define himself against those claims, Cruz quickly pivoted away from his own actions and toward his rival. “Yes, I understand the Trump campaign is going to scream and cry,” he said. “That’s what they do.” Weigel reported from McKees Rocks, Pa. Jose A. DelReal in West Chester, Pa., contributed to this report. ||||| Sometimes people on the East Coast act as if the political world revolves around them (OK, us). It usually doesn’t. Except this time. Voters in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island will cast their ballots on Tuesday. These five primaries are expected to provide big batches of delegates to both the Democratic front-runner, Hillary Clinton, and the Republican, Donald Trump. (Since delegates are assigned proportionally across the board in Democratic primaries, I’m going to concentrate on the Republican side here.) So just how big is Trump going to win on Tuesday, and where might he lose delegates? (Remember, Trump’s path to the 1,237 delegates necessary to clinch the GOP nomination is on a knife’s edge, so every delegate matters.) More Politics Check out our live coverage of the April 26 primary elections. Connecticut Delegates at stake : 28 (15 by congressional district, 13 statewide) : 28 (15 by congressional district, 13 statewide) Nate Silver’s “deterministic” Trump projection : 23 delegates (this is, as Nate wrote, “the single most likely” number of delegates Trump will win in the state, in Nate’s view.) : 23 delegates (this is, as Nate wrote, “the single most likely” number of delegates Trump will win in the state, in Nate’s view.) Allocation: 15 delegates awarded winner-take-all by congressional district; 13 delegates awarded proportionally statewide with a 50 percent winner-take-all threshold and a 20 percent qualifying threshold. The limited polling that’s been conducted in Connecticut has found Trump hovering right around the 50 percent mark, and the FiveThirtyEight polls-plus and polls-only forecasts have him falling just shy of 50 percent. If he wins a majority statewide, though, he’ll get that bundle of 13 delegates. If Trump misses the 50 percent mark, he’ll probably win only six to eight of the statewide delegates, depending on whether Ted Cruz and John Kasich cross 20 percent. The other big question is whether Kasich can sneak a win in Connecticut’s 4th Congressional District, which borders New York (Trump will probably win the other four districts). The 4th was home to former Rep. Chris Shays, a moderate, who has endorsed Kasich, and with nearly 60 percent of non-Hispanic whites 25 years or older there holding at least a bachelor’s degree, it’s the type of district in which Trump struggled in the New York primary. If Trump loses the 4th, he’ll lose its three delegates — but he may not lose it. He was beating Kasich 41 percent to 38 percent among college-educated Republicans statewide in the latest Quinnipiac University poll of Connecticut. Still, given the obstacles between Trump and a clean sweep of Connecticut’s delegates, it’s still not clear where the state fits in Trump’s fight to collect 1,237 — whether Connecticut will get him closer to that goal or set him further off track. Delaware Delegates at stake : 16 : 16 Nate’s deterministic Trump projection : 16 delegates : 16 delegates Allocation: winner-take-all About 50,000 Republicans voted in the last competitive presidential primary in Delaware back in 2008. If turnout in 2016 is anything like that, Delaware would provide the winner with more delegates per vote than most caucuses and primaries so far. Although there has been little polling in the state, the one poll there has been found Trump with a 55 percent to 18 percent lead over Kasich. Trump is also polling very well along the eastern shore of Maryland, which borders Delaware. Trump’s strength here shouldn’t be too surprising given that Delaware has nominated outsiders for major political office before. Remember how tea party star Christine O’Donnell defeated moderate Rep. Mike Castle in the 2010 Republican Senate primary? It was perhaps the most blatant example of primary voters throwing away a Senate seat I’ve ever seen. (Chris Coons, a Democrat, beat O’Donnell in the special election that year.) In other words, Trump is likely to win Delaware and show once again that the GOP primary rules are mostly helping him, not hurting him. Maryland Delegates at stake : 38 (24 by congressional district, 14 statewide) : 38 (24 by congressional district, 14 statewide) Nate’s deterministic Trump projection : 29 delegates : 29 delegates Allocation: winner-take-all on the district and statewide level Trump is likely to get the vast majority of Maryland’s delegates. He has led in every public poll taken there this year and holds at least a 10 percentage point lead in both our polls-only and polls-plus models. If Cruz and Kasich could somehow combine into one super candidate — let’s call him “John Cruz” — that candidate could beat Trump. The combined share of the two candidates’ vote in Maryland polls has almost always been greater than Trump’s share. But “John Cruz” doesn’t exist; Kasich plays better among moderates and Cruz among very conservative voters. If the polling is to be believed, Kasich will beat Trump in the highly educated Washington suburbs, such as Howard County and Montgomery County. But Maryland has one of the most gerrymandered congressional district maps in the nation, which means the voting power of well-educated Republicans around Washington is diluted. A recent Monmouth University poll (which was Trump’s best statewide) showed Trump with a decent chance of winning all eight of the state’s congressional districts. My own guess is that he’ll probably lose one or two districts — most likely the 2nd, 3rd, 5th or the 7th — but even in that scenario he’d exceed Nate’s deterministic delegate projection. Pennsylvania Delegates at stake : 71 (54 by congressional district, 17 statewide) : 71 (54 by congressional district, 17 statewide) Nate’s deterministic Trump projection : 17 delegates (statewide only) : 17 delegates (statewide only) Allocation: loophole by congressional district and winner-take-all statewide The big story in Pennsylvania isn’t what happens on Tuesday, but what happens after Tuesday. Only the 17 delegates awarded to the statewide winner will be bound to a candidate — probably Trump, who holds a nearly 20 percentage point lead in FiveThirtyEight’s weighted Pennsylvania polling average. The 54 district delegates (three awarded in each congressional district) will be selected individually by voters, and nowhere on the ballot will it indicate which candidate each delegate supports. Even if a delegate currently announces plans to vote for a particular candidate at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, nothing binds that decision. Many of the delegates have said they will vote for the candidate who wins their district, while others have pledged to back the statewide winner. That potentially puts Trump in a very strong position, given his large lead in the polls. I say “potentially” because the pressure on these delegates to change their minds could be immense if it looks like they will be the difference between Trump winning on a first ballot or not. Listen to the latest episode of the FiveThirtyEight elections podcast. Rhode Island Delegates at stake : 19 (6 by congressional district, 13 statewide) : 19 (6 by congressional district, 13 statewide) Nate’s deterministic Trump projection : 9 delegates : 9 delegates Allocation: proportional by congressional district and statewide This will be Rhode Island’s first Republican presidential primary with the nomination still in doubt since 2000. Back then, just more than 35,000 people voted in the primary. If the number of participants is close to that this year, a lot of delegates will be awarded for very few votes (just like in Delaware). Beyond that, there’s not a lot to say about Rhode Island. The few polls conducted of the state’s few Republican voters have Trump winning, with Kasich a distant second and Cruz a very distant third. That’s not too surprising since Trump easily won next door in Massachusetts and is expected to also win easily in Connecticut, with nearly 50 percent of the vote. Since so few delegates are at stake and everything is proportional, not a lot will be riding on even moderate changes in the share of the vote each candidate wins here. If you’re looking for some sort of excitement, there’s some question as to whether Cruz can reach the 10 percent threshold required to qualify for any delegates. But he probably will — the latest Brown University poll showed him at 14 percent with a lot of undecided voters. In other words, your time on Tuesday is probably better spent concentrating on other states. ||||| Republican frontrunner attacks ‘pathetic’ John Kasich and Ted Cruz for lining up their campaigns to deny him votes in Indiana, Oregon and New Mexico Donald Trump has decried “collusion” between his Republican rivals to deny him victory in upcoming primary contests as five more states prepared to vote for their preferred presidential candidate. Trump fumed over the alliance between John Kasich and Ted Cruz to cede upcoming states to each other in the hope that they can stop the frontrunner winning enough delegates to clinch the Republican nomination outright. Trump attacked Kasich and Cruz as “truly weak” over the strategy whereby Cruz, a Texas senator, will concentrate his resources in Indiana while Kasich, the Ohio governor, will focus on Oregon and New Mexico instead. “Collusion is often illegal in many other industries and yet these two Washington insiders have had to revert to collusion in order to stay alive,” he said. “They are mathematically dead and this act only shows, as puppets of donors and special interests, how truly weak they and their campaigns are.” Republicans fearing Trump is on a roll to becoming the party’s presidential candidate are pinning their homes on a “contested convention” where no clear winner emerges in the first round of voting by delegates at their national conference in July. In any subsequent rounds of voting at the conference, Trump’s delegates would be free to vote for someone else. The tit-for-tat continued on Monday, with Cruz declaring Trump’s campaign part of the “Washington cartel” despite the frontrunner framing himself as anti-establishment. “The entire Trump campaign is run by Washington lobbyists, it’s the Washington cartel. Donald Trump is the system,” Cruz said. Trump then lashed out on Twitter against John Kasich saying that people should still back him in Indiana – even though he is not campaigning there as part of his alliance with Cruz. Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Kasich just announced that he wants the people of Indiana to vote for him. Typical politician - can't make a deal work. However, Kasich’s adviser John Weaver noted that the plan wasn’t to endorse each other in those states, but instead focus their campaigning. John Weaver (@JWGOP) We're not telling voters who to vote for in IN, only where we are going to spend resources to ultimately defeat Hillary. They get it. Trump railed against a “totally rigged” nomination system where two candidates with “no path” to victory could seek to deny him the nomination. “I have brought millions of voters into the Republican primary system and have received many millions of votes more than Cruz or Kasich. Additionally, I am far ahead of both candidates with delegates and would be receiving in excess of 60% of the vote except for the fact that there were so many candidates running against me. “Because of me, everyone now sees that the Republican primary system is totally rigged.” Ted Cruz, speaking in Borden, Indiana, made no apology for lining up with Kasich to stymie their mutual rival. “I don’t doubt that Donald Trump will scream and yell and curse and insult and probably cry and whine some as well,” Cruz said. Talking Points Memo reported the Texas senator as adding: “Donald is a sore loser. When he lost five states in a row in landslide elections, Donald threw a tantrum … “His response is to attack the voters. His response is to attack the people. Yes, I get that the Trump campaign is scared. They’re scared of Indiana. If Donald wasn’t scared, he’d show up in Indiana and have a debate. But he would much rather hide in Trump Tower.” On Tuesday a five-state marathon known as the “Acela primary” will take place in Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Maryland and Delaware. Trump and the Democratic frontrunner, Hillary Clinton, are expected to win the lion’s share of the delegates up for grabs. On the Democratic side, Bernie Sanders’s campaign chief vowed the candidate would stay in the Democratic race until the summer convention, even as Clinton looks to lock down her commanding position in Tuesday’s contests. Clinton has the chance of a clean sweep or at least multiple victories that would probably foreclose Sanders’s already narrow path to the nomination. But the Vermont senator’s campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, said the millions of dollars flowing to Sanders and the boisterous rallies showed his “supporters will stand with us all the way to the end”. Both Democrats spent Monday campaigning on the east coast. Clinton looked beyond her rivalry with Sanders and went after Trump as a man out of touch on wages, climate change, national security and the lives of everyday people. “Come out of those towers named after yourself and actually talk and listen to people,” Clinton told a Delaware crowd, as if talking to him. “Don’t just fly that big jet in and land it and go make a big speech and insult everybody you can think of and then go back in on that big jet and go back to your country club house in Florida or your penthouse in New York.” She was addressing more than 900 people in a Wilmington theatre. At a Hartford rally with more than 1,800 people, Sanders drew distinctions with Clinton on the minimum wage, his call for a carbon tax to address climate change, fracking and more. “We cannot afford to poison our water,” he said. “Secretary Clinton does not agree. In fact, as secretary of state she pushed fracking on countries all over the world.” Sanders said he would phase out fracking as president.

After Trump’s two final rivals announced a deal intended to better Cruz’s chance of winning Indiana’s primary, Kasich suggested during a campaign stop in Philadelphia that his supporters in Indiana should vote for him regardless. “I’ve never told them not to vote for me,” Kasich said at a diner in Philadelphia. “They ought to vote for me.” ADVERTISEMENT Trump, for his part, seized on the pact as obvious collusion, using it to buttress one of the central claims of his campaign: that he and his supporters are the targets of establishment GOP forces conspiring against them. “So they colluded, and, actually, I was happy because it shows how weak they are; it shows how pathetic they are,” the front-running candidate said at a rally in Rhode Island on Monday. “If you collude in business, or if you collude in the stock market, they put you in jail. But in politics, because it’s a rigged system, because it’s a corrupt enterprise, in politics you’re allowed to collude,” he added. The Cruz-Kasich plan won poor reviews from Republican insiders, who expressed considerable skepticism it would work. Several drew attention to the marked ideological and stylistic differences between the Texas senator and the Ohio governor. “It remains to be seen how effective this is going to be,” said GOP strategist Dan Judy. “Can the average Kasich supporter stomach voting for Cruz?

Trump is enjoying another strong spell in his campaign. He won his native New York by a thumping margin last week, taking at least 89 of the 95 delegates up for grabs. The billionaire is also expected to sweep across the five states in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions that are voting Tuesday: Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. Cruz and Kasich hope to slow his progress after Tuesday. The idea is for Cruz to stop Trump in Indiana. In exchange, Cruz is agreeing to not campaign in New Mexico and Oregon, where Kasich will focus his efforts. Most experts believe that the crux of the Cruz-Kasich deal is Indiana, where Kasich canceled two rallies that had been scheduled for Tuesday. It offers 57 delegates, five more than New Mexico (24) and Oregon (28) combined. Importantly, the Hoosier State’s delegates are allotted on a winner-take-most basis: The statewide winner takes 30 delegates immediately, with three more to be claimed by the winner of each one of the state’s nine congressional districts. The primary is set for May 3. “The statewide winner is going to get 30 delegates off the bat, so that’s a pretty significant play there,” said University of Georgia political science lecturer Josh Putnam, an expert on the delegate system who runs a blog on the subject, Frontloading HQ. In the RealClearPolitics polling average in the state, Trump leads by 6.3 points. But Kasich has been showing respectable strength there. In the three most recent major polls, he has registered between 16 percent and 22 percent support. Strategists in Indiana raise serious questions as to how much of that support will now go to Cruz. They note that the areas in which Kasich had been expected to be strong — the suburbs of Indianapolis and other major cities like Evansville — look like inhospitable ground for an evangelical social conservative such as Cruz. “I think the Kasich people are now ... left choosing between two people who they see as unappealing,” said Mike Murphy, a GOP operative in the state who worked with Jeb Bush’s now-suspended campaign. “I have talked to a lot of friends today who are stunned and puzzled and kind of adrift: ‘What do we do now?’ ” Another Republican strategist in the state who requested anonymity and is not affiliated with any of the three candidates said, “I think it’s a bit of an open question as to whether this deal will take. I’ve got people who say, ‘Yes, I will do anything to stop Trump.’ And others who say, ‘What in the world is the party coming to?’ They view Cruz as unsatisfactory as a nominee but Trump as unfathomable.” Still, that strategist emphasized the result in the state is anybody’s guess. Asked whom he would bet on, he replied, “I wouldn’t put a nickel on the outcome.” There is also the question of whether the machinations put into motion by Cruz and Kasich could cause disaffection. Dave Ober, a Republican state representative in Indiana, tweeted Sunday night: “This election is garbage. I voted early and then they cut a deal a week before election day.” A Cruz win in Indiana could be enough to stymie Trump’s efforts to get to the magic number of 1,237 delegates. If Trump does hit that goal, he will be able to claim the presidential nomination on the first ballot at the Republican National Convention, set for Cleveland in July. Experts in the delegate process believe he has a challenging but achievable path to 1,237. The answer will likely only be known after the last day of the Republican primary process, June 7, when California and New Jersey are among the states voting. Meanwhile, the national party is doing its best to stay out of the flap over the Cruz-Kasich accord. “The role of the RNC is to be a fair and transparent arbiter of the process,” said Republican National Committee spokeswoman Lindsay Walters in an email to The Hill. “Each campaign has to employ the strategy they feel is best for their candidate.” ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","response":"An “alliance” between Ted Cruz and John Kasich intended to block Donald Trump’s presidential bid appears to be failing, as Trump uses the pact between the candidates as another example of how the Republican nomination process is “rigged” against him. Cruz and Kasich plan to concentrate on different areas in their efforts to prevent Trump from getting enough delegates to win the Republican nomination outright. Trump responded to the pact on Monday, describing the two politicians as \\"pathetic\\" and claiming the alliance demonstrated how \\"weak\\" they are. Republican strategists are said to be concerned the pact will make little difference when Mr Trump is expected to sweep to victory in the five states participating in the “Acela primary” on Tuesday."},{"question":"В качестве стандартной опции присутствует mini USB разъем, телефон может работать с любым стандартным кабелем, что является огромным плюсом.

A:","response":"A: Newly duplicated chromosomes are divided into two daughter nuclei during the anaphase of mitosis, which is a stage of cell division (also known as nuclear division) in eukaryotic organisms. Mitosis is a process through which a single cell divides into two daughter cells, each containing the same number and type of chromosomes as the parent cell. It plays a crucial role in growth, development, and tissue repair. Mitosis is subdivided into four main stages: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase, each with specific events involving the alignment, separation, and movement of chromosomes. 1. Prophase: During this initial stage of mitosis, the chromatin condenses and becomes visible under a microscope as chromosomes, composed of two sister chromatids joined at a point called the centromere. The centrosomes, responsible for creating the mitotic spindle, start moving to opposite poles of the cell. 2. Metaphase: The centrosomes are now situated at the two poles of the cell. The mitotic spindle fibers, which emerge from the centrosomes, attach to the centromeres on each sister chromatid. The chromosomes align along an imaginary plane known as the metaphase plate, which is equidistant from the two centrosomes. 3. Anaphase: During this stage, the cohesin that binds sister chromatids at the centromere breaks down, and the sister chromatids consequently separate. The now individual chromatids, referred to as daughter chromosomes, are pulled toward opposite poles by the spindle fibers. This is the critical point when newly duplicated chromosomes are divided into two daughter nuclei, ensuring that each daughter cell receives an identical set of chromosomes. 4. Telophase: The daughter chromosomes reach the two poles of the cell, and the nuclear envelope begins to reform around them, creating two distinct nuclei. The chromatids start to decondense back into chromatin, and the nucleolus reappears. Mitotic spindle fibers also disassemble during this phase. After telophase, the final step of cell division is the process of cytokinesis, during which the cytoplasm of the parent cell is divided among the two daughter cells, creating two separate cells. In summary, newly duplicated chromosomes are divided into two daughter nuclei during the anaphase stage of mitosis. This process ensures that both daughter cells receive the same genetic information, enabling organisms to grow, develop, repair tissues, and maintain their overall functioning."},{"question":"Phichai Railway Station is a railway station located in Nai Mueang Subdistrict, Phichai District, Uttaradit.

Phichai Railway Station opened as part of the Northern Line extension from Phitsanulok to Ban Dara Junction in November 1908. Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"Phichai Railway Station is a railway station where you can get a train home\\"?","response":"From the information provided, we can conclude that Phichai Railway Station is an operational railway station located in Nai Mueang Subdistrict, Phichai District, Uttaradit, which is part of the Northern Line of the State Railway of Thailand. It is situated 447.553 km from Bangkok Railway Station and is classified as a class 2 railway station. The fact that it opened in November 1908 as part of the Northern Line extension from Phitsanulok to Ban Dara Junction also suggests that it has been functioning as a connecting point within the larger railway network for quite some time. Therefore, it can be reasonably assumed that this railway station is a place where you potentially can get a train home, depending on the availability of train services and your travel destination. However, to be more certain about whether you can get a train home from Phichai Railway Station, it would be necessary to gather additional information regarding the specific train schedules, routes, and connections offered at this station. Furthermore, understanding the fare structure, ticket availability, and booking process might also be essential for a smoother travel experience. In conclusion, based on the provided paragraph, Phichai Railway Station seems to be a functioning and connected railway station within the State Railway of Thailand's network.

Options: - blue - dangerous - important - glass - park Step-by-step reasoning process below:","response":"A large body of water often appears to be blue. Here's the step-by-step reasoning process: 1. We have five options: blue, dangerous, important, glass, and park. We can eliminate a few options based on immediate relevancy. 2. \\"Park\\" is not relevant to this context as it refers to a green space, not a body of water. 3. \\"Glass\\" likely doesn't fit as well, as it is a solid material and not typically associated with water appearance. 4. Now, we are left with blue, dangerous, and important. Let's examine these options more closely. 5. Although large bodies of water can sometimes be dangerous due to currents, weather, and other factors, there is no inherent basis for them to appear dangerous just by looking at them, so we can eliminate the \\"dangerous\\" option. 6. Importance can be subjective and location-dependent, but it is not an attribute that is immediately apparent when looking at a large body of water. So, we can eliminate the \\"important\\" option. 7. Finally, we are left with \\"blue,\\" which is a common observation for large bodies of water due to light scattering and absorption within the water. When sunlight hits the surface of the water, it gets absorbed and the light scatters in various directions. The blue part of the light spectrum, however, scatters more effectively than the other colors. This is why large bodies of water, such as oceans, seas, and lakes, often appear blue to our eyes."},{"question":"Sentence: The Baku Turkish Martyrs' Memorial which is made of red granite and white marble is dedicated to the Ottoman Army Soldiers killed in the Battle of Baku.

Hypothesis: Isabella is a teenager.","response":"The hypothesis that Isabella is a teenager cannot be definitively drawn from the provided context. The text passage does not provide specific information about Isabella's age or hints that could allow a reasonable assumption towards her being a teenager, rather it mentions an instance where Isabella was reading a book, it got ripped, and she asked her father to fix it with tape. While teenagers can indeed read books and may also ask adults for help in certain situations, the provided activities are not exclusive to that developmental stage. Children from varying age groups could be imagined in this scenario – they could be infants in their primary school, pre-teen children in their middle school who are starting to enrich their reading habits, or could be teens or even adults who still need help from their father occasionally. Moreover, behaviors of asking for help, especially from parents, and reading books cut across many demographic categories including teenagers, children, adults and more. Therefore, it is not specific or unique enough to a certain group, such as teenagers, to draw this conclusion. Also, the book that Isabella was reading could be of any genre or level of complexity – it could be a children’s graphic novel, a young adult fantasy novel or an adult literary fiction. Without this specification, it is hard to determine her intellectual or reading maturity, which could have been a clue in drawing a hypothesis about her being a teenager. Thus, from the given context, the hypothesis that Isabella is a teenager is insufficiently supported. In order to determine the validity of this hypothesis, more context or specific information about Isabella's life, activities, or references would be needed that directly or indirectly allude to her age or developmental stage."},{"question":"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan Aug. 22, 2004 - Security forces hunted for more terror suspects, officials said Sunday, as Pakistan revealed it has arrested a dozen al-Qaida-linked militants planning to launch simultaneous Q: Which is the best summary of this article?

In the brain, neurons communicate with one another using a combination of electrical and chemical signals to transmit information. This process begins with an electrical signal, known as an action potential or nerve impulse, traveling along the length of a neuron's axon. The axon is a long, slender extension of the neuron's cell body, which serves to transmit information to other neurons or target cells. When the action potential reaches the end of the axon, called the axon terminal, it triggers the release of small chemical messengers called neurotransmitters. These neurotransmitters are stored in small sacs, or vesicles, within the axon terminals. As a result of the action potential, the vesicles fuse with the cell membrane and release their neurotransmitter contents into the synaptic cleft, which is the tiny space separating the axon terminal from the receiving neuron's dendrite or cell body. The released neurotransmitters then travel across the synaptic cleft and bind to specific receptor proteins on the surface of the receiving neuron. This binding process creates a new electrical signal in the recipient neuron, which may either excite or inhibit the neuron's activity depending on the specific type of neurotransmitter and receptor involved. If the signal is strong enough, it may trigger another action potential in the receiving neuron, continuing the transmission of the signal to the next neuron in the chain. Overall, neurons communicate with one another through a highly specialized, dynamic, and finely tuned combination of electrical and chemical signaling across synapses. This process enables the transmission of intricate and diverse information within the brain and nervous system, facilitating essential functions such as cognition, sensation, and motor control."},{"question":"Q:I have never been a stop-and-smell-the-roses type of person. For me, there’s always something that has to be done. In fact, the biggest complaint that my husband and two children have about me is that I’m “always busy.” Seventeen years ago, when my oldest son was about a year old, he woke up in a very fussy mood. Instead of being his usual cheerful and compliant self, he just wanted to be cuddled. A mother’s dream, right? Well, not for me. There was too much to be done; I didn’t have time to hold him. I was well aware that in addition to some projects I was working on, there was laundry to be washed and ironed, breakfast dishes to do, a house that needed cleaning. My usual response would have been to try to coax my son into cheerfulness, or to put him back to bed to sleep it off. But it was clear that he was unwell, so against my usual inclination, I decided that I would just hold him. The chores could wait another day. So I settled into the recliner chair in the lounge room and held my son while he slept. I dozed occasionally too, waking up now and then to enjoy the feeling of snuggling my baby and looking at the world beyond the window. It was a cold day, but clear and sunny. The trees rustled in the gentle breeze, and birds and butterflies flitted about the garden. Inside, my son and I stayed snuggled together under a blanket for most of the day. He slept while I, for one of the few times in my life, just drank in the beauty of the world and the happiness of sharing this time with my son. Better mothers than I am must have done similar things many, many times with their children. But for me, this very small decision, this day of ‘laziness’, became a treasured memory. What is the first chore the mother does later? A. She cleans dishes. B. not enough information C. She irons clothes. D. She washes clothes.

He is also accused of fleeing to Spain 10 days later \\"to avoid arrest, prosecution and conviction\\". Mr Paterson denies all the charges against him and has lodged two special defences of alibi and incrimination. The trial is taking place at the High Court in Glasgow. An excerpt from a telephone call made by Mr Paterson to his girlfriend Sarah Maguire from prison in October last year was played to the court. In it he was heard telling her that he had been served with his indictment and that there were 350 witnesses on the list, including her father. Giving evidence to the jury, Miss Maguire's father Kevin Maguire, 70, told the court that Mr Paterson was in a relationship with his daughter and before going to Spain in January 2010 sometimes stayed at their house. Det Sgt Grant Durie, who searched the house where Miss Maguire lived with her father in Cumbernauld, also gave evidence. He told the court he was the crime scene manager and that during the search a bulletproof vest was found under the bed in Miss Maguire's room. Advocate depute Iain McSporran asked if it was if it was \\"unusual\\" to find it and he said it was. The prosecutor asked how many times he had previously come across a bulletproof vest during searches and he replied: \\"That was the first time, sir.\\" The officer also told the court that Kevin Carroll had the nickname \\"Gerbil\\". He confirmed that a man called Ross Monaghan had been arrested and charged with Mr Carroll's murder. It is claimed - while masked and acting with others - Mr Paterson repeatedly discharged loaded handguns at 29-year-old Mr Carroll shooting him on the head and body. The 35-year-old is also accused of attempting to defeat the ends of justice. The indictment claims that on 23 January 2010 he boarded a flight from Glasgow to Malaga \\"to avoid arrest, prosecution and conviction\\".

They meet Mathias (Joe Anderson), a German tourist, who is looking for his brother Heinrich. His last known location is an archaeological dig at a remote Mayan ruin in the jungle. They are also joined by Dimitri (Dimitri Baveas), Mathias's friend. The group reaches the ruins of a Mayan temple, and are confronted by Mayan villagers with guns and bows. Mathias tries to explain their purpose, but the villagers do not understand Spanish or English. When Amy accidentally touches some vines the villagers become increasingly agitated. Dimitri approaches the villagers, hoping to appease them, but they shoot and kill him. The rest of the group flees up the steps of the ruins. At the top, they find an abandoned camp and a shaft in the center. The group cannot call for help since Eric's phone has no signal. They hear a cell phone ringing from somewhere inside the ruins. Believing it is Heinrich's phone ringing, the rest of the group lowers Mathias down the shaft with a rope. The rope breaks and Mathias falls, becoming completely paralyzed. Amy and Jeff descend the temple steps hoping to reason with the Mayans, but to no success. In anger, Amy throws a clump of vines at them and hits a young boy, whom the Mayans promptly kill. They realize the Mayans are afraid of the vines, and won't let them go since they have touched them. Later, Stacy and Amy descend the shaft to help Mathias and to find the phone.

Denzel Washington has given us some of the best performances of the last decade, as a black soldier in the Civil War in Glory, and a lawyer in the acclaimed Philadelphia. And of course, he made special notoriety last year when he won the Academy Award for Best Actor in Training Day, in which Denzel Washington became the first African American to receive the award for Best Actor. I guess Denzel wanted a change of pace, so he chose to direct Antwone Fisher, in which he also stars. Fisher is played by Derek Luke, who is new to the silver screen, but has made some guest appearances on such television shows as King of Queens, and he will be appearing in the upcoming film release of Biker Boyz. This is a truly well done film from Denzel Washington, considering it was his first time directing. Undoubtedly, Denzel felt some kind of commitment and believed in the real life story of Antwone Fisher. Antwone Fisher is about a young African American man in the Navy who constantly gets into fights, and after one particular brawl he is sent to see a Navy psychiatrist named Jerome Davenport, played by Denzel Washington. Davenport helps Antwone to deal with his troubled past and learn to move on with his life, by finding his birth mother who had to give him up at birth because she was in prison. What makes this film good is the fact that it's not overly melodramatic. I was expecting something a little more like Good Will Hunting, with a lot of swearing, fighting and vulgarity. Not that I didn't like Good Will Hunting, or the swearing, fighting and vulgarity of the film were out of place. Quite the contrary! However, Antwone Fisher is a true story, and I don't think that Washington wanted to sensationalize the story for dramatic affect in the film. Don't get me wrong, there are moments when we see Antwone fighting, carrying on and having moments when it seems like the world is closing in on him. After all, in his first session with his psychiatrist, the character played by Washington, Devenport asks Fisher where he was born, and Fisher's response is, \`from under a rock,' an obvious jab at the pressures waning on Antwone Fisher's soul. But I had to appreciate the fact that this film wasn't sensationalized for dramatic affect. I think it shows real character on the part of Denzel Washington to deliver a more realistic story and to avoid the typical clichés that are common in Hollywood films, even those based on true stories. One other point that I would like to bring up about Antwone Fisher is the acting. Over all, performances were good in the film, but not great. At times, I think it was a bit obvious that the main characters were actors, but overall, to complain about performances in this film would be ludicrous. One actress that I would like to point out in this film is Viola Davis. She plays Antwone's mother, but she says barely two sentences in the movie at all, but not so much because she appears at the end of the film, but more because she in shock that her long lost son, Antwone has found her. What I would like to point out about her as an actress in the lack of use of her. She in basically a character actress, and I haven't seen her play any really elaborate roles. She made appearances in Traffic, Out Of Sight, Kate & Leopold, and two recent films: Far From Heaven and Solaris. In Steven Soderberg's remake of Solaris, she played a scientist on a doomed space craft orbiting a planet. In that film, she is confronted by George Clooney's character and she drawn to tears by what Clooney tells her in a particular scene. When I first saw Solaris, I remember seeing her tear up in the scene and thinking, wow, this woman can act. It was as if you could feel the character's grief. In that brief shot of her face, she gave so much expression and I honestly felt very sorry for her character's sadness and trouble in the film. I think she has definite potential as an actress and should be used more often perhaps in leading roles, rather than just as a character driven actress. Nonetheless, Antwone Fisher is a very good movie. Denzel Washington, as always, pulls off a great performance and he gives us a great directorial debut. Also, Derek Luke is a very talented actor. I think that Antwone Fisher will bring his immense critical fame for his portrayal of the troubled man, but I think that his public popularity will increase with the release of Biker Boyz, which also stars Lawrence Fishburn. Antwone Fisher is based on the book \`Finding Fish: A Memoir,' by Antwone Quenton Fisher. *** Choose your answer. What is the sentiment of this review?

The intricate design features a heart held by two hands, with a crown above it, representing love, friendship, and loyalty, respectively. The traditional Irish ring's rich history dates back to the small fishing village of Claddagh in Galway, where the ring was first created, and its use has since then carried on & transcended beyond the Irish culture. One fascinating aspect of the Claddagh ring is the way it's worn, which indicates the wearer's relationship status. This article will delve into the subtle art of communicating one's relationship status through the positioning of the Claddagh ring on the ring finger of the right hand. The Claddagh Ring: Origins and Symbolism The origins of the Claddagh ring can be traced back to the 17th century in Ireland. Among several legends about the ring's creation, the most popular and widely accepted one revolves around Richard Joyce, a Galway native and fisherman who was separated from his beloved when he was captured by pirates and sold into slavery. While in captivity, Joyce learned the art of metalwork and fashioned the first Claddagh ring to symbolize his love, friendship, and loyalty to his sweetheart whom he hoped to return to someday. Eventually, Joyce gained his freedom and reunited with his love, presenting her with the ring he had crafted. The word \\"Claddagh\\" itself refers to the village of Claddagh in Galway, where this romantic story originated. Wearing the Claddagh Ring: The Art of Signaling Relationship Status The Claddagh ring has become a beloved symbol of Irish identity, and the subtle method of wearing it to signify one's relationship status has resonated with people worldwide. To demonstrate the nuances of this tradition, we will explore the various positions and their corresponding meanings: 1. Wear the Ring on the Right Hand, Heart Facing Outward To indicate that you are single and potentially open to love, wear the Claddagh ring on the ring finger of your right hand, with the heart pointing outward, away from your body. This positioning of the heart is an open invitation for someone to capture it and symbolizes that the wearer's heart is not yet committed to another. In this stance, the heart represents a willingness to explore potential relationships and an openness to finding love. 2. Wear the Ring on the Right Hand, Heart Facing Inward If you are in a relationship, you can convey that by wearing the Claddagh ring on the ring finger of your right hand, with the heart pointing inward, towards your body. In this position, the heart signifies that it has been claimed by someone and demonstrates that the wearer has made a commitment to their partner. The heart facing inward represents the emotional connection and devotion to another person, symbolizing a strong bond between the wearer and their partner. Beyond Relationship Status: Other Uses of the Claddagh Ring Beyond signaling one's relationship status, the Claddagh ring is also worn for other purposes in various contexts. The Claddagh ring is often used as a friendship ring, presented from one friend to another as a symbol of loyalty, trust, and support in their relationship. Additionally, it's common for the ring to be adopted as an engagement or wedding band, handed down through generations as a family heirloom, or given as a meaningful gift representing the promise of love, friendship, and loyalty.

I have it on an old LP and listen to it and enjoy it frequently, as Hazlewood's music is catchy and the way he and Sinatra's voices work together is magic. Recently, while surfing on eBay, I came across an import CD release which has 9 of the 11 songs from 'Nancy & Lee\\" plus another 11 that Nancy did solo, and even one with Frank \\"Something Stupid\\". This CD ran about 6.95 and is digitally remastered and plays great. It's listed simply as Nancy Sinatra Greatest Hits or something close to that. I agree that paying over 100 for a CD is crazy when you can get an import for 6.95 or download the songs off itunes for a buck apiece. So why doesn't whoever owns Reprise Records realize they are losing some serious money by not re-releasing this great record. In the meantime, eBay's cheaper import, though not quite the same (check the song list), or itunes, are great backups.

Bowie moved to the US in 1974, initially staying in New York City before settling in Los Angeles. Diamond Dogs (1974), parts of which found him heading towards soul and funk, was the product of two distinct ideas: a musical based on a wild future in a post-apocalyptic city, and setting George Orwell's 1984 to music. The album went to number one in the UK, spawning the hits \\"Rebel Rebel\\" and \\"Diamond Dogs\\", and No. 5 in the US. To promote it, Bowie launched the Diamond Dogs Tour, visiting cities in North America between June and December 1974. Choreographed by Toni Basil, and lavishly produced with theatrical special effects, the high-budget stage production was filmed by Alan Yentob. The resulting documentary, Cracked Actor, featured a pasty and emaciated Bowie: the tour coincided with the singer's slide from heavy cocaine use into addiction, producing severe physical debilitation, paranoia, and emotional problems. He later commented that the accompanying live album, David Live, ought to have been titled \\"David Bowie Is Alive and Well and Living Only in Theory\\". David Live nevertheless solidified Bowie's status as a superstar, charting at No. 2 in the UK and No. 8 in the US. It also spawned a UK No. 10 hit in Bowie's cover of Eddie Floyd's \\"Knock on Wood\\". After a break in Philadelphia, where Bowie recorded new material, the tour resumed with a new emphasis on soul. Matters came to a head in London in May in what became known as the \\"Victoria Station incident\\". Arriving in an open-top Mercedes convertible, Bowie waved to the crowd in a gesture that some alleged was a Nazi salute, which was captured on camera and published in NME. Bowie said the photographer caught him in mid-wave. He later blamed his pro-fascism comments and his behaviour during the period on his addictions and the character of the Thin White Duke. \\"I was out of my mind, totally crazed. The main thing I was functioning on was mythology ... that whole thing about Hitler and Rightism ... I'd discovered King Arthur\\". According to playwright Alan...

Understand the context of the question 2. Research the origin of the theory of nature vs. nurture 3. Provide the name of the person(s) involved in the development of the theory Step 1: Understanding the context of the question The theory of nature vs. nurture is a central debate in psychology and related fields that discusses the relative contributions of inherited traits (genetics) and environmental influences (upbringing and experiences) on individual behavior and development. Step 2: Research the origin of the theory of nature vs. nurture While the concept of nature vs. nurture can be traced back to ancient philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle who grappled with the question of whether knowledge is innate or acquired through experience, the modern version of the debate can be attributed to the work of various scientists and philosophers of the 17th - 20th centuries. Some of these influential figures include: - John Locke, a 17th-century English philosopher, who coined the term 'tabula rasa' and argued that the mind is a blank slate at birth to be filled through experiences. - Francis Galton, an English Victorian polymath, who is often credited for defining the nature vs nurture debate in the late 19th century by drawing attention to the heritability of human traits, particularly intelligence. He coined the term \\"nature vs. nurture.\\" - Charles Darwin's work on the theory of evolution also contributed to the debate, albeit indirectly, by providing evidence for the effect of genetic traits on an individual's development. Step 3: Provide the name of the person(s) involved in the development of the theory Although many individuals have contributed to the development of the nature vs. nurture debate, Francis Galton is often regarded as the individual who came up with the modern conception of the theory.

In everyday usage, temperature indicates a measure of how hot or cold an object is. Temperature is an important parameter in chemistry. When a substance changes from solid to liquid, it is because there was an increase in the temperature of the material. Chemical reactions usually proceed faster if the temperature is increased. Many unstable materials (such as enzymes) will be viable longer at lower temperatures. Now, I have a new situation: Susan went to the store to buy some bags of ice for a party she was having later in the day. When she got home she put one bag of ice in the sink and another in the freezer, but then was distracted by a phone call and forgot to put the other bag in the freezer. When she returned, the bag of ice had melted. Thomas is a research assistant and has taken samples of rat liver enzymes that need to be stored overnight. He places one in refrigerated storage, but forgot one and left it out on the counter top. Answer this question please: Which sample will be viable for a shorter time, the one on the counter top or the one in refrigerated storage? A:","response":"The sample that will be viable for a shorter time is the one left on the counter top. This is because enzymes are more stable and viable at lower temperatures, as mentioned in the background information. When enzymes are exposed to higher temperatures, they tend to lose their structure and function more quickly. Therefore, the sample in the refrigerated storage will be viable for a longer time as it is stored at a lower temperature, preserving the enzymes' stability and function."},{"question":"Given the question: Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it?

The novel is set in the Lammermuir Hills of south-east Scotland, and tells of a tragic love affair between young Lucy Ashton and her family's enemy Edgar Ravenswood. Scott indicated the plot was based on an actual incident. \\"The Bride of Lammermoor\\" and \\"A Legend of Montrose\\" were published together as the third of Scott's \\"Tales of My Landlord\\" series. As with all the Waverley Novels, \\"The Bride of Lammermuir\\" was published anonymously. The novel claims that the story was an oral tradition, collected by one \\"Peter Pattieson\\", and subsequently published by \\"Jedediah Cleishbotham\\". The 1830 \\"Waverley edition\\" includes an introduction by Scott, discussing his actual sources. The later edition also changes the date of the events: the first edition sets the story in the 17th century; the 1830 edition sets it in the reign of Queen Anne, after the 1707 Acts of Union which joined Scotland and England. The story is the basis for Donizetti's 1835 opera \\"Lucia di Lammermoor\\". - A Legend of Montrose is an historical novel by Sir Walter Scott , set in Scotland in the 1640s during the Civil War .

Here is a hypothesis: Admitting returns have increased are real would have no adverse effect.

Hypothesis: \\"Admitting returns have increased are real would have no adverse effect.\\" This implies that acknowledging the reality of increased returns would not negatively impact anything. Now, let's compare the two statements: 1. If admitting that increasing returns exist would destroy economic theory, it means that there would be an adverse effect on the field of economics. 2. However, the hypothesis states that admitting increased returns are real would have no adverse effects. Based on these points, we cannot conclude that if the premise is true, the hypothesis is also true. In fact, the hypothesis contradicts the premise, as the premise suggests that there would be adverse effects while the hypothesis states no adverse effects would occur."},{"question":"The answer to the question: What is the full name of the person who does Christabel's portrait? is inside the article: Donna Foster works for publisher John Caine.

Is it true that ok google is puerto rico part of america?","response":"Yes, it is true that Puerto Rico is part of the United States of America. Although Puerto Rico is not a state, it is an unincorporated territory of the United States. In simple terms, this means that the island is under the jurisdiction of the United States but is not fully incorporated into the union. Puerto Rico became a U.S. territory in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War in 1898 when Spain ceded the island to the United States under the Treaty of Paris. After the conclusion of the war, the Foraker Act was passed in 1900, establishing a civilian government on the island under the auspices of the U.S. government. In 1917, the U.S. Congress granted U.S. citizenship to Puerto Ricans through the Jones-Shafroth Act. However, this did not convey full political rights, as Puerto Ricans do not have the ability to vote in U.S. presidential elections unless they reside in one of the 50 U.S. states. The political status of Puerto Rico underwent another change in 1952 when the island became a commonwealth, which is a voluntary association with a federal entity. The newly-established Commonwealth of Puerto Rico adopted its own constitution, which was approved by the U.S. Congress. As an unincorporated U.S. territory, Puerto Rico is subject to most federal laws, and the U.S. Supreme Court exercises judicial authority over the island. Puerto Ricans enjoy many of the same benefits as U.S. citizens, such as the protection of the U.S. constitution, Social Security benefits, and access to federal assistance programs. However, they do not have full voting representation in the U.S. Congress, and, as mentioned earlier, they cannot vote in U.S. presidential elections unless residing in a state. In the past few years, there has been a growing movement for Puerto Rico to redefine its relationship with the United States. Some people advocate for Puerto Rico to become the 51st state in the U.S., while others push for full independence or an enhanced commonwealth status. In recent non-binding referendums, a majority of Puerto Ricans have voted in favor of statehood, but the issue remains a subject of ongoing political debate in both Puerto Rico and the United States."},{"question":"Q: Based on the given context, craft a common-sense question, especially those that are LONG, INTERESTING, and COMPLEX.

She examines a red one and notices that it bends much more easily than a green one. Which pole should she choose if she wants to lower the likelihood that the pole will snap? (A) green vaulting pole (B) red vaulting pole. What is the most sensical answer between \\"red vaulting pole\\" and \\"green vaulting pole\\"? Answer:","response":"The most sensical answer between \\"red vaulting pole\\" and \\"green vaulting pole\\" would be the green vaulting pole (A). To understand the reasoning behind this answer, let us consider the situation that Tamara is in and the properties of each pole. Tamara needs a new vaulting pole for her upcoming meet, which means that she hopes to find a pole that will be reliable, safe, and efficient in helping her perform her best. When Tamara examines the red and green poles, she notices a significant difference in their flexibility. The red pole bends much more easily than the green one. This observation leads to an important question: which of these properties is more desirable in a pole-vaulting context? For an effective pole vault, the athlete relies on the pole to transfer their forward momentum into vertical lift. The pole needs to be strong and flexible enough to withstand the stress and absorb the energy during this process. If the pole is too weak or flexible, it can snap or lose power when recoiling, which may cause injury to the athlete or negatively affect the performance. In this case, Tamara's observation suggests that the green pole is less flexible and potentially stronger compared to the easily bendable red pole. A pole that is less prone to bending can typically hold up more weight and pressure without snapping. Therefore, the green pole (A) seems to be a better choice for Tamara, as it lowers the likelihood that the pole will snap during the competition and helps her ensure a more secure and successful performance. In conclusion, the most sensical answer for Tamara's situation between the two vaulting pole options is the green vaulting pole (A), as it displays characteristics of a more reliable, safe, and efficient tool for her upcoming meet compared to the red one."},{"question":"Summarize this article in one sentence. There are many playing factors that you must consider when placing a bet including: Performance of the starting pitcher. The strength of a team’s bullpen. A team’s record at home vs away. A team’s record in head-to-head play. A team offensive output. Baseball betting lines are available everyday. You may choose from a variety of options depending on where you place your bet. Options typically include betting on moneylines, totals, runlines, and futures. Don’t settle on just one place to bet, often called a sportsbook. Place different wagers at different sportsbooks to ensure you are getting the best odds. Seek out the sportsbook that will give you the best payout for your bet. Shop around to find the best payouts. If you find that a sportsbook in a casino 30 minutes away is paying 5 cents better than your favourite local sportsbook, it's best to go with the one 30 minutes away. Maximize your dollar. Join at least one betting exchange in addition to your favourite dimeline sportsbook. A betting exchange is similar to a sportsbook except players determine their own betting lines with one another. In other words, you will determine the payout with the person you are betting against. Dimeline odds ensures that the odds on favorite and the underdog are separated by 10 cents on the dollar, thus the term dimeline. For example, if the favored team is given -150 odds, then a line of +140 will be given to the underdog, which is a 10 cent difference. If you choose the favourite the payout will be less than if you bet on the underdog to win. The team with the negative sign in front of it is the favourite. The team with the plus sign is the underdog. Dimelines work in your favour because the sportsbook can’t over-shade the favourite without exposing themselves on the back side with a large underdog line. If a sportsbook offers 15 or 20 cent odds, the favourite and underdog will be separated by 15 or 20 cents. This puts you at a disadvantage so be weary. Choosing a dimeline book ensures that your winnings will be higher over the long term, regardless of who you bet. Betting exchanges cut out the middle man and let bettors from around the world offer their own money lines directly to other bettors. This results in lines that are more favourable than any sportsbook. Additionally, a betting exchange won’t straddle the line. This means it won’t always separate the favourite and the underdog by exactly 10 or 20 cents. It may even be common to find no or almost no separation between the favourite and the underdog. You can’t get better than equal odds. Summary:","response":"When betting on baseball, consider various factors and strategies such as team performance, betting options, comparing odds at different sportsbooks, and utilizing dimeline odds and betting exchanges to maximize potential payouts."},{"question":"Instructions: This task is about writing a correct answer for the reading comprehension task.

Putting on weight was the expected outcome for Matthew but not Nelson because","response":"Nelson had always been conscious about his fitness and nutrition choices. Ever since their childhood, Matthew and Nelson were like two peas in a pod. However, they had contrasting lifestyles and approaches towards their health and well-being. Matthew, on the other hand, never bothered about keeping a check on his food habits or physical activities. While growing up, both friends had developed different perspectives on weight, body image, and overall health. Matthew was more inclined towards enjoying food, with little regard for its nutritional value or the impact on his body. His sedentary lifestyle further contributed to his weight gain. By the time they reached adulthood, the disparity in their physical appearances and attitudes was quite apparent. Nelson, being a fitness enthusiast, put in considerable effort to maintain his body weight and even improve his physique. He regularly engaged in different forms of exercise like running, swimming, and weight lifting. Although occasionally he would indulge in junk food, Nelson usually stuck to a well-planned and balanced diet, which included all the necessary nutrients to keep his body functioning optimally. In addition to physical activities, he was a firm believer in proper hydration and managing stress, as these factors played a vital role in his overall health. Matthew, meanwhile, slowly embraced a lifestyle that accentuated his weight gain. He binge-watched television series, munched on notoriously unhealthy snacks, and spent long hours working without taking breaks to move around. Ironically, his job and personal commitments took a toll on his physical health, and he succumbed to the belief that he could deal with it just by eating his comfort food. As time went by, Matthew's weight piled on relentlessly. He noticed the difference not only in how he looked but also in how he felt physically. Tasks that seemed easy earlier, like climbing a flight of stairs, were starting to challenge him. He began to realize that he had neglected his health a little too much, but inertia held him back from taking any substantial steps to change his habits. Simultaneously, the gap between him and Nelson grew wider as Nelson's disciplined lifestyle and healthy habits manifested into admirable fitness levels. Despite these growing differences, both Matthew and Nelson remained great friends. Eventually, Nelson became a pillar of support for Matthew as he began considering the idea of making changes in his life to become healthier. Nelson started by encouraging Matthew to incorporate small changes like taking short walks, drinking more water, and avoiding excessive sugar. He provided Matthew with valuable knowledge about nutrition, the importance of exercise, and the impact of a positive mindset towards health transformation. Matthew began to gain a deeper understanding of the power of healthy choices, which began altering his attitude toward his well-being. With continuous motivation and support from Nelson, Matthew embarked on the journey of weight loss and achieving a healthier lifestyle. In conclusion, putting on weight was the expected outcome for Matthew but not Nelson because their distinct lifestyles and attitudes towards health led them down divergent paths. However, their friendship remained strong and served as a support system for both of them, especially in Matthew's quest to transform his life. With Nelson's guidance and his self-determination, Matthew can steadily work towards reclaiming control over his health, thereby bridging the gap both in terms of weight and their attitudes towards fitness."},{"question":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

In the second quarter, the Browns scored on a 1-yard run by RB Peyton Hillis, but soon gave the lead back on an interception returned by CB Brandon Flowers. However, the Browns took a 14-10 lead into halftime on a deep touchdown pass from Wallace to WR Josh Cribbs. After the half, the Browns' offense stalled, and Succop kicked two more field goals to give the Chiefs a 16-14 victory. How many points in total were scored in the first half?","response":"In the first half of the game, a total of 24 points were scored. Here's the breakdown of the scoring in the first half: 1. Chiefs K Ryan Succop's early field goal contributed 3 points. 2. Browns RB Peyton Hillis scored a 1-yard run touchdown, earning 6 points (pending extra point) 3.

Of all the developments of Institute week, naturally the one which filled J.W.'s thoughts with a sort of awed gladness was Marty's decision to offer himself for the ministry. Joe Carbrook's right-about-face was much more dramatic, for J.W. saw, when the decision was made, that Marty could not have been meant for anything but a preacher. It was as fit as you please. As to Joe, previous opinion had been pretty equally divided; one side leaning to the idea that he might make a lawyer, and the other predicting that he was more likely to be a perpetual and profitable client for some other lawyer. In the light of the Institute happenings, it was to be expected that the question of college would promptly become a practical matter to four Delafield people. Marty was greatly troubled, for he knew if he was to be a preacher, he must go to college, and he couldn't see how. J.W. felt no great urge, though it had always been understood that he would go.

The NAACP argued that although schools were not legally segregated, the city of Detroit and its surrounding counties had enacted policies to maintain racial segregation in public schools. The NAACP also suggested a direct relationship between unfair housing practices and educational segregation, which followed segregated neighborhoods. The District Court held all levels of government accountable for the segregation in its ruling. The Sixth Circuit Court affirmed some of the decision, holding that it was the state's responsibility to integrate across the segregated metropolitan area. The U.S. Supreme Court took up the case February 27, 1974. The subsequent Milliken v. Bradley decision had wide national influence. In a narrow decision, the Court found that schools were a subject of local control and that suburbs could not be forced to solve problems in the city's school district.","response":"The role of the specific person called out in the lawsuit, Governor William Milliken, was that he was one of the Michigan state officials being sued by the NAACP for being responsible for de facto public school segregation.

Sentence A: \\"He's cleaning.\\" This sentence has a pronoun \\"He\\" which refers to a person, and the verb \\"is cleaning,\\" which is an action that can be performed by a human. The sentence structure is subject-verb, making it grammatically correct and logically coherent. 2. Sentence B: \\"Dog is cleaning.\\" In this sentence, \\"Dog\\" is the subject, and \\"is cleaning\\" is again the verb. However, the issue with this sentence is that the action \\"cleaning\\" is typically not associated with a dog. Dogs can groom themselves, but \\"cleaning\\" is generally related to human actions, like cleaning the house or cleaning the dishes.

Choices: - clerk - barber shop - neighborhood - city - strip mall The rationale to choose \\"neighborhood\\" as the answer is that: The answer to this question is:","response":"\\"neighborhood\\" Rationale: The opening of a small locally owned beauty salon would most likely have the greatest impact on the local economy of the surrounding neighborhood, as opposed to the other options provided. Here's a breakdown of each choice, explaining why \\"neighborhood\\" is the best answer. - Clerk: A clerk is an employee who performs administrative or sales tasks, and is not a relevant choice in this context. - Barber Shop: Though a beauty salon and a barber shop both offer personal grooming services, they cater to different clientele. A beauty salon is unlikely to have a significant direct impact on a barber shop's business, as they often serve different markets. - Neighborhood: Local businesses, such as a beauty salon, contribute to the economy by providing jobs, attracting customers and generating revenue within the immediate vicinity. When residents frequent these businesses, they help to support the local economy and create a thriving neighborhood. - City: Although a beauty salon might have some impact on the city's economy, its effect is expected to be more localized within the neighborhood. The scale of a small beauty salon limits its overall impact on a city's economy compared to larger businesses or industries. - Strip Mall: A strip mall is a group of shops sharing a common parking area, typically arranged in a row along a major road. While the opening of a beauty salon could benefit surrounding businesses in a strip mall, the question specifically mentioned a \\"small locally owned beauty salon,\\" which does not necessarily imply being part of a strip mall. The neighborhood is a more inclusive and relevant answer in this context. In conclusion, choosing \\"neighborhood\\" as the answer makes the most sense, as a small beauty salon would have the greatest impact on the local economy by supporting nearby businesses and fostering community growth."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.

Here are possible answers to this question: - canada - the desert - indiana - california - backyard I believe the correct choice is \\"california\\", here's why: Answer:","response":"While all of the options mentioned might experience varying levels of water availability and precipitation, the most probable location for a rosebush to die due to lack of water would indeed be the desert. Let me explain this in detail by comparing the different locations mentioned. 1. Canada: Generally, Canada has a humid continental climate, with cold winters and warm summers. Precipitation is fairly consistent year-round in most areas, with seasonal variations often leading to snow in winter. Overall, if a rosebush is properly cared for and watered sufficiently during the growing season, it would have a good chance of survival in Canada. 2. The Desert: Deserts are areas characterized by extremely low precipitation, hot temperatures, and arid conditions. This combination means that water is scarce, and many plant species cannot survive without additional water sources. With very limited rainfall and intensely dry conditions, a rosebush planted in the desert would have a high likelihood of dying due to lack of water, as it is not adapted to these harsh conditions. 3. Indiana: Indiana has a humid continental climate, with hot summers, cold winters, and moderate to heavy precipitation throughout the year. This means that even without considerable supplemental watering, a rosebush planted in Indiana would receive enough rainfall for survival through most of the year. 4. California: While California does face water scarcity issues, the climate varies significantly across the state. Coastal regions receive more rainfall and have milder temperatures, while inland areas tend to be drier and hotter. However, both are generally more hospitable for rose bush growth than a desert environment. In addition, many gardeners in California are experienced in water conservation practices, which can help support the survival of a rosebush even in drier areas. 5. Backyard: The term \\"backyard\\" is relative and could apply to any of the previously mentioned locations. Depending on the specific climate and conditions of the backyard, a rosebush may or may not survive. It would be important to consider the local rainfall, temperature, and soil conditions to determine if a backyard would be hospitable for a rosebush. In conclusion, among the locations provided, a rosebush would be most likely to die due to lack of water in the desert. The extreme lack of precipitation and arid conditions make it an inhospitable environment for a plant that requires a moderate amount of water to survive. Although California has faced drought conditions, the climate in much of the state is still more favorable for rosebush survival compared to a desert setting. Meanwhile, Canada, Indiana, and a \\"backyard\\" might provide varied but generally more advantageous conditions for rosebush growth, assuming proper care and watering."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Context: Tracy afforded Bailey the opportunity to get a raise by putting in some overtime.

The reasoning behind this answer is that the observed actions (hugging) could be just a display of sportsmanship or a response to a particular situation, which doesn't necessarily imply friendship."},{"question":"Premise: We asked Why did Al Gore pay Naomi Wolf so much money for advice which, presumably, he could've gotten for free? Hypothesis: Naomi Wolf demanded a large sum of money for her advice. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","response":"The hypothesis that Naomi Wolf demanded a large sum of money for her advice is not explicitly entailed by the premise. The premise states that Al Gore paid Naomi Wolf a significant amount of money for advice he could have presumably received for free. However, there could be several reasons for this payment, and the hypothesis represents only one possibility. There are a few factors that need to be examined to understand why Al Gore paid Naomi Wolf for her advice, even if he could have potentially obtained such advice for free. The following factors can shed light on this issue: 1. Expertise and Reputation: Naomi Wolf is a well-known political consultant, author, and feminist activist. Her expertise and reputation in the field of politics could have been a factor in Al Gore's decision to hire her. He may have felt that her guidance would be valuable and beneficial to his campaign or initiative. 2. Exclusive Access: While it is true that some advice can be obtained for free, it is important to remember that Naomi Wolf's time and expertise are in demand. As a result, she might charge a fee for her services to manage her availability and prioritize clients willing to pay for exclusive access to her advice. 3. Confidentiality and Trust: Paying Naomi Wolf for her advice guarantees a certain level of confidentiality between both parties. This arrangement provides a sense of trust, ensuring that the advice provided remains exclusive and tailored to Al Gore's needs. 4. Perceived Value: Sometimes, the perceived value of advice is higher when there is a cost associated with it. In certain situations, people may assume that paying for advice demonstrates investment and commitment to following or acting upon it. This notion could be another reason why Al Gore chose to pay for Naomi Wolf's insights. While the hypothesis that Naomi Wolf demanded a large sum of money for her advice is one plausible explanation, it does not automatically follow from the premise. Other factors, such as expertise and reputation, exclusive access, confidentiality and trust, and perceived value, should also be taken into account to better understand the rationale behind Al Gore’s decision to pay Naomi Wolf for her advice."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a context and four options.

This contributed to an increase in 1-year and 5-year adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) rates, making ARM interest rate resets more expensive for homeowners. This may have also contributed to the deflating of the housing bubble, as asset prices generally move inversely to interest rates, and it became riskier to speculate in housing. U.S. housing and financial assets dramatically declined in value after the housing bubble burst. Now answer this question: How do asset prices generally move in relation to interest rates?","response":"Asset prices generally move inversely to interest rates. This means that when interest rates increase, asset prices tend to decrease, and when interest rates decrease, asset prices tend to increase. This relationship occurs because higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive, which can lead to reduced demand for assets and lower asset prices. Conversely, lower interest rates make borrowing cheaper, which can increase demand for assets and lead to higher asset prices."},{"question":"Write a sentence not in English.","response":"As an AI language model, I am capable of producing sentences in various languages.

Phillips, who works in China, released his report saying China's suicide rate from 1995 to 1999 reached 0.023 percent, the country has been ranked among those with the highest suicide rates in the world. But Jing Jun, a professor of sociology in Tsinghua University, challenges that view and presents the true picture through his nationwide research. Jing and his students took one year to set up the first national database on suicide rate to grasp the overall trend of suicides in China. They collected data from the Health Statistics Annuals of the World Health Organization (sample size 10 million), and the country's Health Statistics Annuals (which cover 100 million people). The database covers 23 years, from 1987 to 2009. Jing calculates the suicide rate in China based on these data. Though the suicide rate was comparatively high in the early years, his study shows it has dropped in recent years, as opposed to the ascending trend in the rest of the world. According to Jing's calculation, China's suicide rate had dropped to about 0.01 percent in 2004. In 2009, the figure dropped further to 0.007 percent, which is rather low compared with the global rate of 0.016 percent. Even if the \\"missing\\" suicides were added, China's suicide rate in 2009 would still be below 0.008 percent.[:Zxxk.Com] Jing has found that one of the main reasons why the suicide rate has dropped was the steady and big decline in the number of suicides committed by rural women. In the early years, researchers generally agreed that the suicide rate among Chinese women was higher than among men, which is pretty rare in the rest the world. But the suicide rate among Chinese women, especially in rural areas, has declined remarkably in recent years. In fact, it is almost equal to that of Chinese men. As a sociologist, Jing regards suicide as a social issue, and believes improvement of social policies will reduce the suicide rate even further. More people's lives can be saved if the authorities adjust to... Question: In Jing's opinion, what should be done to reduce the suicide?

I tried my best to get my grades up myself without any help from anyone, but my pride just made my grades worse. And I had to miss out on one of the most important speech and debate competitions all year: States. I was heartbroken. I realized that I could not survive my junior year on my own, so I had to get help fast. Once I got a tutor, my grades went from Cs, Ds, and even some Fs, to nothing but As and Bs.

And the answer is...","response":"To solve the equation -6399*r + 12842*r - 1452 = 6377*r for r, we need to follow these steps: Step 1: Simplify the equation on both sides if necessary. In our case, we can simplify the left side of the equation: -6399*r + 12842*r - 1452 = 6377*r Combine the terms with r: (12842 - 6399)*r - 1452 = 6377*r (6443*r) - 1452 = 6377*r Step 2: Shift all terms containing r to one side of the equation and all constant terms to the other side. To do this, we can subtract 6377*r from both sides of the equation: 6443*r - 6377*r - 1452 = 0 (6443 - 6377)*r - 1452 = 0 66*r - 1452 = 0 Now, we'll add 1452 to both sides of the equation: 66*r = 1452 Step 3: Solve for r. Now we have a simple equation to solve for r. We just need to divide both sides by 66: r = 1452 / 66 Simplify the right side of the equation: r = 22 So, the solution to the equation -6399*r + 12842*r - 1452 = 6377*r for r is r = 22."},{"question":"Given those answer options, answer the question: Jan shook a leg and a spider fell on the ground.

Sentence 2: Republican politicians from Oklahoma are the dumbest.

In the first sentence, the statement being made is that Oklahoma's jocks (referring to athletes) may be no denser (meaning not more stupid) than many of its other Republican politicians. This sentence suggests a comparison between two groups - athletes and politicians - and highlights a potential similarity in terms of intelligence or lack thereof. On the other hand, the second sentence makes a definitive and absolute claim that Republican politicians from Oklahoma are the dumbest. This sentence declares that this particular group of politicians is not just denser than the athletes or others but is in fact the dumbest amongst the wider population. Although the first sentence implies that the intelligence of Oklahoma's Republican politicians leaves something to be desired and compares it unfavorably to that of athletes, it does not directly entail the second sentence. The first sentence leaves room for other groups to also have similarly low intelligence, while the second sentence specifically establishes Republican politicians from Oklahoma as being the dumbest.

The dream climate has sucked in sun worshipers from all over the world -- one quarter of the population are foreigners. Start using \\"Brissie\\" and \\"togs\\" Brisbane has its own lingo. A swimming costume is no longer a \\"cozzy,\\" as for other Aussies. Or swimmers or bathers. Those in Brissie call them \\"togs.\\" Oh, and in this sport-worshiping state, \\"The King\\" isn't Elvis but former homegrown sporting star Wally Lewis. Informalities come away like layers of clothes. \\"Mate,\\" \\"hey,\\" \\"ay\\" and \\"but\\" punctuate conversation. People here call Queensland Premier Campbell Newman \\"Can Do\\" -- to his face! They also debate the relative merits of the \\"Goldie\\" (Gold Coast) to the south, and \\"Sunny\\" (Sunshine Coast) Coast to the north. Like all Queenslanders, Brisbanites cop often unnecessary flak for speaking slowly, perhaps on account of the heat. Be ready for the storm. Subtropical climes mean rain -- buckets of it. And hailstones the size of golf balls -- they're declared \\"natural enemy\\" number one by Brisbanites. Lighting and thunder are also familiar villains. The storms are regularly spectacular and also very damaging. Severe flooding has hit the city and state in recent years. Living in the city means always carrying a lightweight waterproof -- and being ready to take cover from the storm. Live the River. The Brisbane River is the city's lifeblood. (And it's not uncommon for sharks to be caught in sections of the river). Unfurling 16 kilometers (10 miles) inland from the Pacific Ocean, it Big Dippers through the city around a series of beak-shaped headlands. The river is a ticket to ride through one of Australia's greenest urban settings. In forward-thinking Brissie, thickets of skyscrapers and urban bush land meet. You have to cruise the river to experience the city's most iconic public transport -- the ferries. Free CityFerries and faster CityCats zip round a network of 24 terminals, allowing passengers to hop on and off to lap up Brisbane's watery character. Ferries run from 6 a.m. to midnight, daily. Go walkabout. Outdoor activities are Brisbane's chief modus operandi. City overseers are prioritizing pedestrian and bike friendliness. Brisbanites wake up before dawn to dart about along verdant harborside paths or on the 24-hour CityCycle biking sharing plan. A circuit-walking trail links the foreshore Botanic Gardens, Parliament House and Old Government House. Pedestrians can follow it across the river, via the car-free Goodwill Bridge, and walk through South Bank's museums and restaurants. The stunning LED-lit Kurilpa footbridge will take you back to the central business district. Nicknamed \\"sticks bridge\\" (due to its spiky appearance), it was the world's largest solar-powered bridge until London's Blackfriars stole its thunder last January. The \\"tensegrity\\" construction relies on tension in the cables between the pillars to stay upright. Go suburban. Australian suburbia is the spread that doesn't fit in a Vegemite jar. Being a few miles upstream from the city center in Brisbane is no crime. In fact it's seen as a lifestyle plus. Hot to trot neighborhoods dot the riverbanks -- Fortitude Valley (or just the Valley) and Paddington have vibrant restaurant and bar scenes. Further along from trendy Teneriffe in New Farm is Bulimba. Proliferating swimming pools and architect-designed homes have seen median house prices here outstrip 1 million. But there's a breezy village feel among Oxford Street's bookshops, cafes and cinemas. Ferrying here, you'll get a sense of leaving the city behind, as bushy reserves surge. Picnic in a park. The picnic is the crux of Brisbane's public bonding culture. Locals head en masse to riverside parks for picnicking, barbies and mingling. With 1,820 parks and gardens, this is supposedly Australia's most bio-diverse capital. It aims to be its greenest by 2016 -- carbon neutral and crammed with trees. Sprawling greens, multipurpose pathways and barbecue areas flank riverbanks north (city side) and south. The Brunswick Street ferry stop will land you in New Farm Park. Some 18,000 people flood here every week according to management, \\"to picnic, play, eat, dance, ponder, gaze and wonder.\\" You can also awe at the willowy Queenslander houses, perched high on flood-defying stilts. Get cultural. If you don't cross the Brisbane River, you risk missing all the culture concentrated on the southside. Comedian Barry Humphries -- aka Dame Edna Everage -- helped spark the great Brisbane cultural debate with the disparaging quip: \\"Australia is the Brisbane of the world.\\" These days, cries of intellectual destitution are difficult to sustain among the billowing art and science institutions of South Bank. The capital for culture is Stanley Place. The white-stone-swathed \\"Cultural Precinct\\" is home to the Queensland Art Gallery and Gallery of Modern Art. Collectively they're known as \\"QAGOMA.\\" Entry is free, barring special exhibitions. Love thy mall. Brisbane's \\"big country town\\" reputation of the past lives on in pockets of the beloved Queen Street Mall. The downtown strip is a mishmash of Seventies shops, ultra-mod glassy office tower-hotels and steel clad sunshades. The 26-point City Centre Heritage Trail shows you the colonial anachronisms among the flourishing skyscrapers. Church spires and Edwardian-Baroque facades from the 1800s mingle with neon casino lights and bar upon bar. Brisbane's love of blingy buildings and nightlife spawned its endearing tag, BrisVegas. Down a lager. Brisbane pub culture is perched somewhere between traditional drinking holes and sleek modern emporiums. Once grabbing a pint of XXXX (pronounced \\"four-ex\\") beer while singing along with locals as they croon \\"Love you Brisbane\\" is a good way to get involved. Nowadays the drinking scene -- like the city -- is a lot more sophisticated, with a wide range of Australian brews (large and micro-breweries) available pretty much everywhere. Not to mention the rising crop of cocktail and wine-focused bars. Know your wildlife. Australians love their nature and wild beasts. Be warned -- in Brisbane \\"local wildlife\\" may refer to two-meter-long pythons, dwelling in people's backyards. Not to a raucous night out on the town.

Although it seeks to allure the gastronomes with its French cuisine, the customer rating of this joint suggests a considerable need for improvement, unfortunately securing only a 1 out of 5. This score indicates that the dining experience might not meet expectations, considering aspects such as food quality, customer service, atmosphere, and value for money.

Goal: Reduce heartburn pain. Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal? pick from the following. - Take a few sips of peach juice.. - Take a few sips of pickle juice.....I think the answer is","response":"Take a few sips of peach juice. The correct answer is to take a few sips of peach juice. Peach juice is considered more reasonable for reducing heartburn pain because it is less acidic compared to pickle juice. This means that it won't irritate your throat or stomach as much. Pickle juice is not a good option because it is very acidic, which can actually make heartburn pain worse.

Throughout the early years of the July Monarchy, Alkan continued to teach and play at public concerts and in eminent social circles. He became a friend of many who were active in the world of the arts in Paris, including Franz Liszt (who had been based there since 1827), George Sand, and Victor Hugo. It is not clear exactly when he first met Frédéric Chopin, who arrived in Paris in September 1831. In 1832 Alkan took the solo role in his first Concerto da camera for piano and strings at the Conservatoire. In the same year, aged 19, he was elected to the influential Société Académique des Enfants d'Apollon (Society of the Children of Apollo), whose members included Luigi Cherubini, Fromental Halévy, the conductor François Habeneck, and Liszt, who had been elected in 1824 at the age of twelve. Between 1833 and 1836 Alkan participated at many of the Society's concerts. Alkan twice competed unsuccessfully for the Prix de Rome, in 1832 and again in 1834; the cantatas which he wrote for the competition, Hermann et Ketty and L'Entrée en loge, have remained unpublished and unperformed.In 1834 Alkan began his friendship with the Spanish musician Santiago Masarnau, which was to result in an extended and often intimate correspondence which only came to light in 2009. Like virtually all of Alkan's correspondence, this exchange is now one-sided; all of his papers (including his manuscripts and his extensive library) were either destroyed by Alkan himself, as is clear from his will, or became lost after his death. Later in 1834 Alkan made a visit to England, where he gave recitals and where the second Concerto da camera was performed in Bath by its dedicatee Henry Ibbot Field; it was published in London together with some solo piano pieces. A letter to Masarnau and a notice in a French journal that Alkan played in London with Moscheles and Cramer, indicate that he returned to England in 1835. Later that year, Alkan, having found a place of retreat at Piscop outside Paris, completed his first truly original works for solo... Answer:","response":"Alkan returned to England in 1835."},{"question":"Review: It's sort of hard for me to say it, because I so greatly enjoyed both \\"Targets\\" and \\"Paper Moon\\", but I thought \\"The Last Picture show\\" was a somewhat fascinating but overly self-indulgent film. Its main positive, as far as I'm concerned, is the stunning photography. But for me the film had nothing to offer beyond surface beauty (and a kind of hidden beauty, at that). The characters were very hard to relate to or to care about. Basically you had this very slow pace and this naturalistic style of acting, but it was all there to prop up a very formulaic and predictable story, complete with all the trappings one would expect from any small town melodrama -- everything from the boy cheating with his teacher's wife to the handicapped kid who everyone picks on. It was like \\"American Graffiti\\" without the joy of life. Some might say this film is more realistic -- nowadays a lot of people seem to think that realism is the only virtue a film can possess. But for me the film was simply oppressive, and I want to see it again about as badly as I'd like to spend a few hours in that miserable town the characters live in. Maybe this film really just belongs to its time -- perhaps if I'd seen it in 1971 I would have been impressed by its novelty, just by seeing something different on the screen. But that would basically assume that I had never seen anything like, say, Godard's \\"Breathless\\". Maybe the overt references to classic films would have appealed to the movie geek in me and helped me to overlook some of the film's weaknesses. But in the post-Tarantino world that hardly seems unique or special either. It is interesting though how he uses the films in the film to give his own film more depth. We see 3 films as I recall in the picture show. First we see Vincente Minnelli's \\"Father of the Bride\\" -- Liz Taylor's exquisite looks provide a contrast to Sonny's girlfriend and Minnelli's studied upper-middle class milieu contrasts to the character's \\"real life\\" surroundings in a similar way. Later, clips from Howard Hawks' \\"Red River\\" emphasize the theme of a broken friendship between a mentor and a protégé. It really just reminds me that Bogdanovich is kissing his own mentor's butt, much as he did if I remember correctly by selecting a Hawks film as part of his own on-screen reverie with Boris Karloff in \\"Targets\\". I guess in 1971 this kind of thing was new but looking at it today it just seems self-indulgent, like so much of the rest of this film. Ultimately, I'd rather see another film by Hawks, Ford or Minnelli than to have Bogdanovich's film remind us of why they were so striking in such a less-than-subtle way. Maybe he intends to remind us of the giants whose time had passed -- all he really does is remind us how small he and most of his contemporaries are in relation. Now, what is this review like? Available choices: (I). negative. (II). positive.","response":"This review is (I). negative. Reasoning: The user found the film \\"The Last Picture Show\\" to be overly self-indulgent and largely formulaic. They felt the characters were hard to connect with and the plot was predictable. They also criticized the film's allusions to other movies as self-indulgent. While they acknowledged the film's strong photography, this was not enough to redeem the overall experience for them.

Give me reasons, before answering the question","response":"Let's use algebra to solve this problem. Let x be the number of years it will take for Beth to be twice her sister's age. We can set up the following equation: Beth's age + x = 2 * (Sister's age + x) We know that Beth is 18 years old and her sister is 5 years old, so we can substitute these values into the equation: 18 + x = 2 * (5 + x) Now, we can solve for x: 18 + x = 10 + 2x 18 - 10 = 2x - x 8 = x So, in 8 years, Beth will be twice her sister's age. Here's the reasoning for this calculation: In 8 years, Beth will be 18 + 8 = 26 years old. Her sister will be 5 + 8 = 13 years old in 8 years. 26 (Beth's future age) is twice 13 (sister's future age), which means that Beth will be twice her sister's age in 8 years."},{"question":"You are given a sentence in Arabic.

If this depth is a quarter of the vertical distance between the riverbed and the peak of the hill, how high is the hill? Think carefully first, then make a decision:","response":"Let's think step-by-step: 1. We know the depth of the riverbed from the seabed is 300m. 2. This depth is a quarter of the vertical distance between the riverbed and the peak of the hill. 3. Let's use the variable \\"x\\" to represent the vertical distance between the riverbed and the peak of the hill. Now we can set up the equation: 300m = 1/4 * x To solve for x, we need to multiply both sides of the equation by 4: (4 * 300m) = (4 * 1/4 * x) 1200m = x So, the vertical distance between the riverbed and the peak of the hill is 1200m. Now, we need to find the height of the hill: Height of the hill = Height of the riverbed from the seabed + Vertical distance between the riverbed and the peak of the hill Height of the hill = 300m + 1200m Height of the hill = 1500m Thus, the height of the hill is 1500 meters."},{"question":"Write a title for this article: NEW YORK DAILY NEWS STAFF Sunday, May 8, 2016, 10:18 PM Jose Reyes’ punishment from MLB should be expected soon, and the Rockies shortstop is likely to receive a 60-game suspension, perhaps more, for his role in an alleged domestic violence incident, according to Jon Heyman of MLB Network.

The US space agency probe continues to downlink the information gathered during its historic flyby of the dwarf planet on 14 July. As this data arrives on Earth, the team processes it and studies it. A black and white image of the hazes was previously released, showing them to be as high as 130km above Pluto's surface. That picture came from the Lorri camera and was acquired as New Horizons departed the dwarf, looking back to see sunlight skim the edge of the distant world. This new view comes from the Ralph colour camera system. Again, it is taken with Pluto backlit. Like Earth, the dwarf has a predominantly nitrogen atmosphere (albeit much more spare). But it is the interaction of this nitrogen with the Sun's ultraviolet light, in presence of another atmospheric constituent, methane, that is able to create the chunky haze particles. \\"That striking blue tint tells us about the size and composition of the haze particles,\\" said New Horizons team member Carly Howett from the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) in Boulder, Colorado. \\"A blue sky often results from scattering of sunlight by very small particles. On Earth, those particles are very tiny nitrogen molecules. On Pluto they appear to be larger - but still relatively small - soot-like particles we call tholins.\\" The principal investigator on the mission, Alan Stern, had teased Pluto fans in recent days, telling them to expect something special from this week's regular Thursday release of new images. \\"Who would have expected a blue sky in the Kuiper Belt? It's gorgeous,\\" he said in a Nasa statement. If you stood on Pluto and looked straight up, the sky would actually appear black because of the rarity of the atmosphere. \\"The haze is pretty thin, so you'd mostly see the colour of the haze as blue sunrises and sunsets,\\" Dr Howett explained to BBC News. The other important piece of news to come out concerns the detection of water-ice at many locations on the 2,300km-wide dwarf's surface. More volatile ices tend to dominate the surface, so understanding why the water-ice is seen strongly in some places is an interesting observation that will need to be followed up, the team says. \\"We expected water-ice to be there, but we've searched for water-ice in Pluto's spectrum for decades and not seen it before now,\\" tweeted Alex Parker, also from SwRI. Since 14 July, New Horizons has moved more than 100 million km beyond Pluto. And this puts it about five billion km from Earth. The vast separation makes for very low data rates. It will be well into 2016 before all the information is on the ground.

To delve deeper into this process: 1. Assess the type and quantity of dishes: Before selecting a wash cycle, it is essential to determine the types and quantity of dishes loaded in the dishwasher. These could range from lightly dirty dishes to heavily soiled pots and pans. The selection of the wash cycle is crucial to ensure proper cleaning and sanitization of the dishes without wasting water and energy. 2. Selecting the appropriate wash cycle: Modern dishwashers usually offer multiple wash cycle options, such as quick wash, normal wash, heavy wash, and eco wash. The quick wash cycle is suitable for lightly soiled dishes, while the normal wash cycle is designed for regular loads with moderate soil levels. The heavy wash cycle is meant for heavily soiled dishes and cookware. Lastly, the eco wash cycle is an energy-saving alternative that reduces energy and water consumption while still providing a thorough wash. 3. Adjust settings as necessary: In some cases, you may need to make additional adjustments to the dishwasher settings, such as selecting a higher wash temperature or enabling options like a heated dry for optimal results. For instance, if you have loaded glass items that require a more gentle wash, you should choose a cycle designed for delicate items. Always consult the dishwasher's user manual for guidance on using specific features and settings. 4. Initiate the cycle: Once you have chosen the appropriate cycle and adjusted any settings, press the start or play button on the dishwasher's control panel to initiate the washing process. The dishwasher will then run through the selected cycle, which typically includes a pre-rinse, wash, post-rinse, and drying phase. As the dishwasher runs, it is essential to not open the door to avoid disrupting the wash cycle and causing any potential leaks or damage. In conclusion, the final step in the dishwasher's process of cleaning dirty dishes is selecting the appropriate wash cycle and settings, then initiating the cycle to ensure proper cleaning and sanitization."},{"question":"Steven Ellison (born October 7, 1983), known by his stage name Flying Lotus or sometimes FlyLo, is an experimental multi-genre music producer, electronic musician, DJ, filmmaker, and rapper from Los Angeles, California. Flying Lotus has released five studio albums--1983 (2006), Los Angeles (2008), Cosmogramma (2010), Until the Quiet Comes (2012) and You're Dead! (2014)--to critical acclaim. At his mother's house, Ellison saw an advertisement on Adult Swim/Cartoon Network asking for song submissions. He sent some in, under the name Flying Lotus (a moniker inspired by lucid dreaming) and was accepted. Around this time, he was interning at the pioneering hip hop label Stones Throw Records. Days were spent in their offices, and nights were spent at his grandmothers, working on the music that would become his debut album: 1983. The record (released on LA indie label Plug Research) was an early touchstone for Ellison's eclectic creative mission, forging compressed, spacey and Eastern sounding hip-hop beats, that summoned Madlib as much as Dntel, while sampling as far back as 70s Japanese proto-synthpop and 60s jazz harp. It would also feature Laura Darlington, who went on to become a vocal fixture of future albums. In 2006, Ellison participated in that year's annual Red Bull Music Academy, which took place in Melbourne, Australia. In 2007, he announced on CSU-Fullerton's Titan Radio that he signed with Warp Records (home to Prefuse 73, Autechre, Boards of Canada, and Aphex Twin). Following his Warp debut, the six-track Reset EP, he quickly became one of the label's cornerstone artists and released his second studio album, titled Los Angeles, on June 10, 2008. His first release on Warp, Reset EP, gave his new audience a taste of the steady grooves and darker breaks that had earned him the move. As Ellison's profile rose, he decided to commandeer the limelight by launching his own label, Brainfeeder, to house his friends (Samiyam, Ras G, etc.) and unite a large section of the LA beat scene under one label.

An announcer is paging Captain James (Douglas Lambert) as the ship he is piloting is leaving in just a few minutes. We see James enter a locker room where he starts to put on his spacesuit and we see another figure in a spacesuit lurking in the corner wearing a helmet so we can't see his face. James addresses the figure as Benson (Harvey Keitel). Benson has apparently just failed a mental stability exam and James is replacing him on this mission. Before James is finished putting on his suit, however, Benson straps himself down and opens the airlock venting the locker room. James is killed and his body flushed out into space. Benson closes the door and then takes James's place on the mission.Benson flies the ship through the rings of Saturn and lands it on a moon at the Saturn 3 experimental food station. It is a remote and isolated underground facility crewed by just two scientists: the older Adam (played by a 64 year-old Kirk Douglas) and the beautiful young Alex (played by a 33 year-old Farrah Fawcett). Despite their age difference the two are happy as lovers.Adam and Alex escort Benson inside the facility. Despite their warm greeting, Benson seems cold.

She has finished hanging streamers and now she has to fill the balloons. Having never used a helium tank before, she wants to test how much to fill each balloon. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: If Catherine filled two balloons and one expanded more than the other does the smaller balloon have higher or lower air pressure? Hint: All fluids exert pressure like the air inside a tire. The particles of fluids are constantly moving in all directions at random. As the particles move, they keep bumping into each other and into anything else in their path. These collisions cause pressure, and the pressure is exerted equally in all directions. When particles are crowded together in one part of an enclosed space, such as the air particles first entering a tire, they quickly spread out to fill all the available space. That’s because particles of fluids always move from an area of higher pressure to an area of lower pressure. This explains why air entering a tire through a tiny opening quickly fills the entire tire.","response":"Based on the information provided, the smaller balloon would have higher air pressure. Step 1: Understand the relationship between volume and pressure As the paragraph explains, fluid particles, such as air, move from an area of higher pressure to an area of lower pressure. When the balloons are filled, the air particles inside them spread out to fill the available space. As the volume of the balloon increases (it gets larger), these particles have more space and experience fewer collisions, resulting in lower pressure inside the balloon. Conversely, as the volume of the balloon decreases (it gets smaller), there are more frequent collisions between particles, causing higher pressure inside the balloon. Step 2: Apply the concept to Catherine's balloons Catherine filled two balloons, with one expanding more than the other. Since the smaller balloon has less volume, there is less space for the air particles to spread out. This leads them to have more frequent collisions, which in turn causes higher pressure. Conclusion: The smaller balloon has higher air pressure than the larger balloon."},{"question":"Definition: You are given a sentence in Galician.

They assert that the divine force or being they worship transcends both the known and the unknown aspects of the universe, encompassing and permeating all aspects of existence. For these religious leaders, their faith does not rely on resolving gaps in scientific knowledge but serves to inspire and inform their ethical and moral beliefs, enriching their understanding of the world and humanity's place within it. Moreover, they argue that Hawking's view of God as a mere explanatory tool for unanswered scientific questions diminishes the significance and complexity of religious beliefs. They contend that while scientific progress may continue to shed light on the mysteries of the universe, it does not negate the role of God or spirituality in human life. They point out that numerous scientists, including many notable physicists, have found no conflict between their religious beliefs and their scientific pursuits, embracing a multidimensional understanding that can accommodate both faith and reason. The religious leaders believe that engaging in discussions and debates on science and theology can foster a greater appreciation for the multi-faceted aspects of human understanding and promote cooperation and mutual respect between the scientific and religious communities. By doing so, they hope to foster intellectual and spiritual growth among adherents and non-believers alike, while advocating for an inclusive approach that acknowledges the various paths to knowledge and wisdom. In conclusion, while the debate sparked by Hawking's remarks in \\"The Grand Design\\" highlights the ongoing tensions between science and religion, it also serves as an opportunity for thoughtful reflection and dialogue on the nature and limits of human understanding and the multidimensional aspects of belief and inquiry. As humanity continues to explore the cosmos, it remains essential to consider the profound questions of existence, ethics, and purpose that have long captivated the imagination and enriched the intellectual and spiritual traditions of cultures around the world."},{"question":"Given the question: - Kidneys filter waste out of blood - Composition of blood is regulated - Volume of water in blood is kept constant - PH is kept at a constant level - Kidneys help regulate blood pressure - Kidneys stimulate the making of red blood cells What might be the last step of the process?

Extra genetic material from the X chromosome interferes with male sexual development, preventing the testicles from functioning normally and reducing the levels of testosterone. Triple X syndrome (trisomy X) results from an extra copy of the X chromosome in each of a female's cells. Females with trisomy X have a lower IQ than their siblings. Turner syndrome results when each of a female's cells has one normal X chromosome and the other sex chromosome is missing or altered.

Tsugumo HanshirÅ arrives at the estate of the Ii clan and says that he wishes to commit seppuku within the courtyard of the palace. To deter him SaitÅ Kageyu (RentarÅ Mikuni), the Daimyo's senior counselor, tells HanshirÅ the story of another rÅnin, Chijiiwa Motome â formerly of the same clan as HanshirÅ. Motome arrived at the palace a few months earlier and made the same request as HanshirÅ. Infuriated by the rising number of \\"suicide bluffs\\", the three most senior samurai of the clanâYazaki Hayato, Kawabe Umenosuke, and Omodaka Hikokuroâpersuaded SaitÅ to force Motome to follow through and kill himself. Upon examining Motome's swords, their blades were found to be made of bamboo. Enraged that any samurai would \\"pawn his soul\\", the House of Ii forced Motome to disembowel himself with his own bamboo blade, making his death slow, agonizingly painful, and deeply humiliating. Despite this warning, HanshirÅ insists that he has never heard of Motome and says that he has no intention of leaving the Ii palace alive.

These seismic waves, which are the direct result of the sudden release of accumulated energy in the Earth's lithosphere due to the breaking of rocks along the fault lines, propagate through the Earth and on its surface, ultimately causing the ground to shake and vibrate. Once the seismic waves reach the Earth's surface, they cause ground motion which is felt by the inhabitants of the area surrounding the epicenter, or the point on the Earth's surface directly above where the earthquake originates. The intensity of the shaking experienced on the surface depends on several factors such as the magnitude of the earthquake, the distance from the epicenter, the depth at which the earthquake occurs, and the local geological conditions. Earthquakes can cause widespread damage to infrastructure, buildings, and other structures, leading to injuries, fatalities and economic losses. The extent of the damage is directly related to the intensity of the ground shaking, as well as the design and construction quality of the built environment. Following the main earthquake event, or the mainshock, several smaller earthquakes, known as aftershocks, may occur along the same fault lines. Aftershocks can be triggered by the redistribution of stress along the fault system due to the mainshock and can continue for days, weeks, or even months after the initial event but generally decrease in intensity and frequency over time. In summary, the final step of the described process is the occurrence of an earthquake, characterized by the shaking and vibration of the ground as a result of seismic waves caused by the release of energy associated with the breaking of rocks along fault lines. Earthquakes and their associated ground motion can lead to significant damage and disruptions to society, making it crucial for seismologists and scientists to closely study and monitor fault lines activity to better understand and mitigate potential earthquakes hazards."},{"question":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task. \\"Yes, and\\" is a rule-of-thumb in improvisational comedy that suggests that a participant in a dialogue should accept what another participant has stated (\\"Yes\\") and then expand on that line of thought or context (\\"and...\\").

During the battle, Hippolyta specifically targeted and beheaded her son Thrax, whom Ares forcibly conceived with her and who is fighting for his father. Hippolyta then defeated Ares, but Zeus stopped her from delivering the death strike. Instead, Hera bound his powers with magic bracers so that he was deprived of his ability to draw power from the psychic aura of violence and death he could instigate, and only another god could release him. In compensation, the Amazons were granted the island of Themyscira, where they would remain eternally youthful and isolated from Man in the course of their duty of holding Ares prisoner for all eternity. Later, Hippolyta was granted a daughter, Princess Diana, whom she shaped from the sand of the Themyscirian seashore and gave life with her own blood. Over a millennium later, an American fighter pilot, USAF Colonel Steve Trevor, is shot down in a dogfight and crash-lands his YF-23 on the island, where he soon runs afoul of the Amazon population, including the combative Artemis. Steve and Diana meet and fight, and Diana defeats him, taking him to the Amazons. After interrogating him with the use of the Amazons' golden lasso, Hippolyta decides he is not an enemy of the Amazons and as such, tradition dictates that an emissary be tasked to ensure his safe return to his own country. Diana volunteers, but is assigned to guard Ares's cell instead since her mother argues that she has not enough experience in dealing with the dangers of the outside world. Diana defies her mother and, her face hidden by a helmet and her guard duty covered by her bookish but kind-hearted Amazon sister Alexa, participates in contests of strength and wins the right to take Trevor back to his home., can you guess it ? A:","response":"Yes, the name of the person who gave her daughter life with her own blood is Queen Hippolyta."},{"question":"Question: Information: - In linguistics, cognates are words that have a common etymological origin. In etymology, the \\"cognate\\" category excludes doublets and loanwords. The word \\"cognate\\" derives from the Latin noun \\"cognatus\\", which means \\"blood relative\\". - Mount Passaconaway is a mountain in the Sandwich Range Wilderness of the White Mountain National Forest near the eastern boundary of Waterville Valley . It is named after Passaconaway , a 16th - century sachem of the Pennacook tribe , whose name was also attached to a small village in Albany , where the northern trailhead is now located . It is ranked 42d in elevation on the list of 48 White Mountains four - thousand footers . On the original 1931 list of 4000 - footers , it was ranked 26th , with an elevation of 4,116 feet , although the 1931 topographic map shows it as 4,060 feet . The 1987 USGS topographic map indicates it is 4,043 , while the elevation recorded in the USGS Geographic Names Information System is 4,019 ft. The thickly wooded , unmarked summit may be approached from trailheads to the north ( on the Kancamagus Highway ) or from Wonalancet to the south . Old maps show a \`\` Passaconaway Lodge '' or \`\` shelter '' on the southeast aspect of the mountain , and the 4,000 - footer guidebook mentions that it was built in 1891 . It was rebuilt several times , evolving into the Wonalancet Out Door Club 's Camp Rich . After its collapse in 2000 it was removed , consistent with Wilderness regulations . - A sachem or sagamore is a paramount chief among the Algonquians or other Native American tribes of the northeast. The two words are anglicizations of cognate terms (c.1622) from different Eastern Algonquian languages. Some sources contend the sagamore was a lesser chief than the sachem. - The Weeks Act is a federal law (36 Stat. 961) enacted by the United States Congress on March 1, 1911. Introduced by Massachusetts Congressman John W. Weeks and signed into law by President William Howard Taft, the law authorized the US Secretary of Agriculture to \\"Examine, locate and recommend for purchase ... such lands within the watersheds of navigable streams as ... may be necessary to the regulation of flow of navigable streams...\\" This meant that the federal government would be able to purchase private land if the purchase was deemed necessary to protect rivers' and watersheds' headwaters in the eastern United States. Furthermore, the law allowed for land acquired through this act to be preserved and maintained as national forest territory. Six years earlier, the Transfer Act of 1905 transferred control over the federal forest reserves from the General Land Office of the Department of the Interior to the Department of Agriculture and its Forest Service. Responsibility for land purchased through the Weeks Act was not given to former Chief Forester Gifford Pinchot because he resigned in 1907, with the stipulation that he would only resign if he could appoint his successor. This stipulation led to the Forest Service's tradition of picking a head with forestry knowledge. With the land acquired through the Weeks Act, Pinchot's successor obtained the power to issue permits for water power development on National Forests. The Weeks Act appropriated 9 million to purchase 6 million acres (24,000 km) of land in the eastern United States. - Massachusetts ; officially the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, is the most populous state in the New England region of the northeastern United States. It is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the east, the states of Connecticut and Rhode Island to the south, New Hampshire and Vermont to the north, and New York to the west. The state is named for the Massachusett tribe, which once inhabited the area. The capital of Massachusetts and the most populous city in New England is Boston. Over 80% of Massachusetts' population lives in the Greater Boston metropolitan area, a region influential upon American history, academia, and industry. Originally dependent on agriculture, fishing and trade, Massachusetts was transformed into a manufacturing center during the Industrial Revolution. During the 20th century, Massachusetts' economy shifted from manufacturing to services. Modern Massachusetts is a global leader in biotechnology, engineering, higher education, finance, and maritime trade. - The Merrimack River (or Merrimac River, an occasional earlier spelling) is a river in the northeastern United States. It rises at the confluence of the Pemigewasset and Winnipesaukee rivers in Franklin, New Hampshire, flows southward into Massachusetts, and then flows northeast until it empties into the Atlantic Ocean at Newburyport. From Pawtucket Falls in Lowell, Massachusetts, onward, the MassachusettsNew Hampshire border is roughly calculated as the line three miles north of the river. - A paramount chief is the English language designation for the highest-level political leader in a regional or local polity or country administered politically with a chief-based system. This term is used occasionally in anthropological and archaeological theory to refer to the rulers of multiple chiefdoms or the rulers of exceptionally powerful chiefdoms that have subordinated others. Paramount chiefs were identified by English-speakers as existing in Native American confederacies and regional chiefdoms, such as the Powhatan Confederacy and Piscataway Native Americans encountered by English colonists in the Chesapeake Bay area of North America. - The Massachusett are a Native American people who historically lived in areas surrounding Massachusetts Bay, as well as northeast and southern Massachusetts in what is now the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, including present-day Greater Boston. Tribal members spoke the Massachusett language, which is part of the Algonquian language family. The present-day U.S state of Massachusetts is named after the tribe. - The White Mountain National Forest (WMNF) is a federally managed forest contained within the White Mountains in the northeastern United States. It was established in 1918 as a result of the Weeks Act of 1911; federal acquisition of land had already begun in 1914. It has a total area of (1,225 sq mi). Most of the WMNF is in New Hampshire; a small part (about 5.65% of the forest) is in the neighboring state of Maine. While often casually referred to as a park, this is a National Forest, used not only for hiking, camping, and skiing, but for logging and other limited commercial purposes. The WMNF is the only National Forest located in either New Hampshire or Maine. Most of the major peaks over 4,000 feet high for peak-bagging in New Hampshire are located in the National Forest. Over of the Appalachian Trail traverses the White Mountain National Forest. In descending order of land area the forest lies in parts of Grafton, Coos, and Carroll counties in New Hampshire, and Oxford County in Maine. - The Pennacook, also known by the names Penacook, and Pennacock, were a North American people of the Wabanaki Confederacy who primarily inhabited the Merrimack River valley of present-day New Hampshire and Massachusetts, as well as portions of southern Maine. They are also sometimes called the Merrimack people. - The Eastern Algonquian languages constitute a subgroup of the Algonquian languages. Prior to European contact, Eastern Algonquian consisted of at least 17 languages, collectively occupying the Atlantic coast of North America and adjacent inland areas from what are now known as the Canadian Maritime provinces to North Carolina. The available information about individual languages varies widely. Some are known only from one or two documents containing words and phrases collected by missionaries, explorers or settlers, and some documents contain fragmentary evidence about more than one language or dialect. Nearly all of the Eastern Algonquian languages are extinct. Mi'kmaq and Malecite-Passamaquoddy have appreciable numbers of speakers, but Western Abnaki and Delaware are each reported to have fewer than 10 speakers after 2000. - North America is a continent entirely within the Northern Hemisphere and almost all within the Western Hemisphere. It can also be considered a northern subcontinent of the Americas. It is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the west and south by the Pacific Ocean, and to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea. - The Wabanaki Confederacy (\\"Wabenaki, Wobanaki\\", translated roughly as \\"People of the First Light\\" or \\"People of the Dawnland\\") are a First Nations and Native American confederation of five principal nations: the Mi'kmaq, Maliseet, Passamaquoddy, Abenaki, and Penobscot. - New Hampshire is a state in the New England region of the northeastern United States. It is bordered by Massachusetts to the south, Vermont to the west, Maine and the Atlantic Ocean to the east, and the Canadian province of Quebec to the north. New Hampshire is the 5th smallest by land area and the 9th least populous of the 50 United States. - Maine is the northernmost state in the New England region of the northeastern United States. Maine is the 39th most extensive and the 41st most populous of the U.S. states and territories. It is bordered by New Hampshire to the west, the Atlantic Ocean to the east, and the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick and Quebec to the north. Maine is the easternmost state in the contiguous United States, and the northernmost east of the Great Lakes. It is known for its jagged, rocky coastline; low, rolling mountains; heavily forested interior, and picturesque waterways; and also its seafood cuisine, especially clams and lobster. There is a continental climate throughout the state, even in coastal areas such as its most populous city of Portland. The capital is Augusta. - Passaconaway, which translates to \\"Child of the Bear\\", was sachem of the Pennacook people in what is now northern New England in the United States. - New England is a geographical region comprising six states of the northeast United States: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont. It is bordered by the state of New York to the west and south, and the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick and Quebec to the northeast and north, respectively. The Atlantic Ocean is to the east and southeast, and Long Island Sound is to the south. Boston is its largest city. Its largest metropolitan area is Greater Boston, which also includes Worcester (the second-largest city in New England), Manchester (the largest city in New Hampshire), and Providence (the capital and largest city of Rhode Island), with nearly a third of the entire region's population. - The Sandwich Range is located in the White Mountains of New Hampshire in the United States, north of the Lakes Region and south of the Kancamagus Highway. Although the range is not outstanding for its elevation, it is very rugged and has excellent views of the surrounding lakes, mountains, and forests. - The Appalachian National Scenic Trail, generally known as the Appalachian Trail or simply the A.T., is a marked hiking trail in the eastern United States extending between Springer Mountain in Georgia and Mount Katahdin in Maine. The trail is about 2,200 miles (3,500 km) long, though the exact length changes over time as parts are modified or rerouted.

Tweet: i really miss my 1/2&quot; lobes Choose from: *negative. *positive.","response":"Before analyzing the sentiment of the tweet \\"i really miss my 1/2\\" lobes\\", let's first understand the context of the text. The tweet is referring to \\"1/2\\" lobes which indicate the size of earlobe stretching (piercings) that the person used to have. This tweet consists of two main elements: \\"really miss\\" and \\"1/2\\" lobes\\". The element \\"really miss\\" signifies a sense of longing and craving for something that the user used to have, which in this case, are the 1/2\\" lobes. Missing something usually signifies a positive sentiment; however, it is important to note that missing something means that it is no longer present or the user doesn't have it anymore. This absence contributes to a negative sentiment as well. The element \\"1/2\\" lobes refers to a specific size of earlobe stretching the user used to have. Talking about a past earring choice indicates a personal preference or experience, which is neither inherently positive nor negative. Taking the two elements into account, the sentiment in this tweet can be seen as a mix of both positive and negative emotions. On one hand, the positive sentiment comes from the fact that the user has fond memories or positive feelings regarding their 1/2\\" lobes. On the other hand, the negative sentiment is due to the absence or loss of those 1/2\\" lobes, which is something the user misses or longs for. However, considering the overall tone of the tweet and that the user has chosen to express their longing for their 1/2\\" lobes, it can be inferred that the primary sentiment is negative. This is because the tweet focuses on the absence and longing more than the appreciation or positive feelings associated with the 1/2\\" lobes. Therefore, the sentiment of the following tweet: \\"i really miss my 1/2\\" lobes\\" can be considered *negative."},{"question":"Please capitalize where necessary: but mistakes are the foundation of all terrestrial human evolution.","response":"Step 1: Identify the beginning of the sentence to capitalize the first word.

Navarrette: A black actress came out for Romney and got slammed and reviled. Limbaugh calls activist a 'slut,' he says, columnist blasted for changing parties. Nobody can disagree without going on the attack, he writes, and leaders just as bad.","response":"Title: The Growing Divide: How Discord and Name-Calling Lead to a Fragmented Society The United States of America has long been acclaimed as a land of freedom - a place where people of diverse backgrounds, opinions, and beliefs can coexist in peace. However, in recent years, a worrisome trend has emerged. As noted by political commentator Ruben Navarrette, the nation now seems to be sharply divided into two camps that refuse to engage in meaningful dialogue, opting instead for relentless name-calling and division. In his article, Navarrette highlights instances where celebrities and public figures are not only vehemently criticized for their political views, but also subject to personal attacks and vitriolic language. He cites the example of a black actress who publicly endorsed then-presidential candidate Mitt Romney. The actress faced backlash in the form of verbal abuse and hatred. This troubling episode underscores the fact that, regardless of one's profession or personal life, political differences are being used as grounds for marginalization and ridicule. The political landscape is also replete with instances where prominent figures themselves engage in name-calling. Navarrette refers to conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh's labeling of an activist as a \\"slut,\\" and a columnist being criticized for switching political parties. It seems that, to an ever-increasing extent, the limits of decency are being crossed as political opponents seek to demean each other. This ongoing - and escalating - trend of attacking our fellow citizens due to their political beliefs has far-reaching consequences. It is slowly eroding the foundations of our democracy, which is built on the idea that rational debate and the exchange of ideas should play key roles in shaping policies and opinions. Name-calling, in contrast, is devoid of substance and serves only to poison the atmosphere. Furthermore, when name-calling grows to be the norm, it discourages people from engaging in political conversations. Fearful of harsh judgments and potential ostracism, individuals may prefer to keep their thoughts and opinions to themselves. This climate of silence and mistrust further widens the divide between the two camps and stifles the development of innovative ideas and solutions. It is clear, then, that a solution to this problem is sorely needed. Political discourse must return to its roots in respectful, open debate, where individuals can disagree without resorting to ad-hominem attacks. We must foster a culture in which it is possible for a person to endorse a particular candidate or political party without fear of being vilified. This necessitates a collective commitment to civility and understanding, both from our political leaders and from the average citizen. One approach to fostering such a change is through grassroots initiatives that encourage dialogue between people of different political persuasions. Creating safe spaces where people can discuss political topics without fear of judgment can break the ice and help develop a sense of mutual respect. These kinds of conversations can promote empathy and understanding while also breaking down stereotypes. In conclusion, the political polarization and name-calling that Ruben Navarrette describes in his article represent significant barriers to progress and unity in our society. To bridge the gap and heal the rifts that have formed, we must all do our part to encourage respectful, meaningful conversations and promote understanding across the political spectrum. The future of our nation - and our democracy - depends on our ability to set aside our differences, resist the impulse to attack one another, and find common ground."},{"question":"Continue writing the next sentence in this paragraph: How to do a frontflip (beginners ) Stretch first.

Question: suppose less rockets will be launched into space happens, how will it affect MORE or LARGER satelites in space. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","response":"If fewer rockets are launched into space, it would have a significant impact on the deployment of more or larger satellites in orbit. Launching more or larger satellites would require a functioning and consistent space program, which can be heavily influenced by the number of rocket launches. A reduction in the number of rocket launches would thus have several major effects. 1. Resource Allocation: With fewer rockets being launched, it is likely that fewer resources, including funding, personnel, and technological development, will be allocated to space programs. This will lead to a reduced capability to develop, manufacture, and launch more or larger satellites, directly affecting the increase of satellites in space. 2. Technological Innovations: Reduced rocket launches may slow down the advancements in satellite and rocket engineering. The development of newer and more efficient satellites and rockets could be limited by the shrinking demand for launch services and insufficient funding. As a result, the progress in satellite technology can be negatively affected. 3. Satellite Launch Windows: The fewer the rocket launches, the less frequently satellite launch windows are available. Without frequent launch opportunities, developers and operators of more or larger satellites may face delays in getting their satellites into space, which could have various consequences, such as outdated or obsolete technology being deployed. Perturbation is defined as a deviation of a system, moving object, or process from its regular or normal state or path, caused by an outside influence. In terms of the effect of reduced rocket launches, the perturbation caused by this factor would primarily lead to a less efficient and less effective satellite implementation and operation process. This can also affect the various sectors that rely on satellite technology, including telecommunications, Earth imaging and monitoring, global navigation systems, and space research. To answer the question directly, the supposed perturbation (less rocket launches) would have a more significant effect on the deployment and operation of more or larger satellites in space. The decreased number of rocket launches would lead to resource limitations, delayed innovation, and fewer satellite launch windows, which would all negatively impact the functionality and effectiveness of satellites orbiting Earth. As a result, satellites may become less capable of providing the necessary services and technological advancements to various industries, leading to potential setbacks in sectors reliant upon satellite data and services."},{"question":"Information: - Top 40 is a music industry shorthand for the currently most-popular songs in a particular genre.

Flattering aspects: - The reviewer was able to prepare for the test within just a week's time. - The study material was seemingly comprehensive enough to help the reviewer achieve a passing score. - The reviewer found value in using the practice tests provided in the book. 2. Unflattering aspects: - The reader may question if a score of 73 is satisfactory. The desirability of this score depends on the user's individual goals and the requirements for whatever they're pursuing (e.g., an exam, a certification, or a particular skill level). - It is unclear if the reviewer had any prior experience or background knowledge in the subject, which could affect the perceived effectiveness of the study material. - The minimal timeframe for preparation might not work for everyone, meaning potential users might expect better results with more extended study periods. In conclusion, the review has both flattering and unflattering elements.

Answer:","response":"The first black American to win the Nobel Peace Prize was Ralph Bunche. Born on August 7, 1903, in Detroit, Michigan, Ralph Johnson Bunche was an American political scientist, academic, and diplomat. He received the prestigious Nobel Peace Prize in 1950 for his exceptional mediation efforts and success in negotiating peaceful agreements during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, particularly for the 1949 Armistice Agreements. Bunche was a trailblazer for black Americans as well as people of color worldwide. His accomplishments and accolades spanned various spheres, including education, diplomacy, and civil rights activism. He earned his undergraduate degree summa cum laude from the University of California, Los Angeles, in 1927 and later completed his master's and doctorate degrees in government and international relations from Harvard University in 1928 and 1934, respectively. Bunche became the first black American to be awarded a PhD in political science from an American university. Throughout his illustrious career, Bunche held numerous significant positions in both academia and international diplomacy. He worked as a researcher and professor, teaching political science at universities such as Harvard, Northwestern, and Howard. Eventually, he transitioned to the world of diplomacy, where his expertise in colonization and racial conflict resolution was evidently instrumental in international conflict resolution efforts. In the early 1940s, Bunche served as an advisor to the U.S. State Department and played a vital role in creating the United Nations. As a participant in the 1945 San Francisco conference, he contributed to drafting the U.N. Charter, and later in that year, he joined the permanent staff of the United Nations as Head of the Trusteeship Division. Bunche's most significant achievement in diplomacy took place while working for the United Nations. In 1948, he was appointed as Principal Secretary of the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine (UNSCOP) and later as Acting United Nations Mediator on Palestine. The following year, he played a pivotal role in securing the armistice agreements between Israel and the Arab States. As a direct consequence of these efforts, Ralph Bunche received the Nobel Peace Prize on December 10, 1950. In the 1950s and 1960s, Bunche actively participated in the civil rights movement, working closely with prominent figures like Martin Luther King Jr. He held prestigious positions throughout his life, such as serving as Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations, and actively engaged in global efforts to promote peace and combat racial discrimination. Ralph Bunche passed away on December 9, 1971, but left behind a legacy as a pioneering black American who dedicated his life to be an advocate for peace and equal rights."},{"question":"Combine facts and answer this: How many works where made in 2000 by an American composer born on January 31, 1937? Answer:","response":"Without knowing the specific composer in question, it would be impossible to provide an accurate answer. The American composer born on January 31, 1937 is Philip Glass, a very prolific composer in the minimalist style known for his work across multiple mediums, including opera, symphony, and film scores. However, the exact number of works Philip Glass composed in 2000 isn't readily available. If we check the chronology of his works, he has consistently written multiple works each year since the 1960s. For example, in 1999 he wrote the music for films like \\"Dracula\\" and \\"The Hours\\", as well as a symphony (\\"Symphony No. 5\\"). In 2001, he wrote the opera \\"In the Penal Colony\\", the piano suite \\"The Orphée Suite for piano\\" as well as more film scores. Considering his productivity, it would not be surprising if Philip Glass composed several works in 2000, however, without specific data or a complete catalog of Glass’ works, it's impossible to give an exact number. It's also important to remember that each work is unique, and the time it takes to compose can differ from one project to the next. To get the most accurate information, the catalogue of the composer or their official website would be the best source. As an AI, I can only provide information that is available and cannot generate data that isn't there.

I was rostered to the brain injury ward in a chronic hospital, where the patients had severe brain damage from tumours, car accidents, strokes, metabolic diseases, degenerative diseases, and alcoholism. Only about half were ambulant. Most had severely impacted recent and long term memories. They could not bathe or feed themselves. The majority sat most of the day in chairs lined along the sides of the day room. They were spoon-fed meals and wheeled into the toilet. One of those patients was Connie S. She was maybe 55 yrs old and she spent a lot of the day screaming in her chair. She could not speak, walk, or cooperate. One nurse was very impatient with her and once I heard that nurse say to her, “You think the water is too hot, do you? Then have it cold!” as she bathed her in cold water. I remember standing up for her to that nurse. I worked that ward for over a year and then, one day, just like that, Connie S. woke up. She suddenly began speaking and walking. She apparently remembered most of the things had had happened to her in the ward. Soon, she walked right out of that ward and never came back. As she left, she appeared dignified and so happy, so relieved. I was too junior at that stage to know what her diagnosis was supposed to have been, but no-one expected her ever to leave. No-one left that ward. It was the end of the line. I remember being really glad that I had stood up for her and thinking how ashamed the nasty nurse must have been. It is now many years later and I often think of this woman and wonder how she fared in her post-hospital life. Her name is not common, but every so often I meet people with the same name and ask them if they know of a relative to whom this happened, but, so far, no-one has known of her.

Geographical Location: He belonged to the region of Burgundy, which is located in present-day France. 3. Religion: Saint Gangulphus is recognized as a martyr by the Catholic Church, which indicates that he was an adherent of the Catholic faith at the time. 4. Socio-economic Background: He was a courtier in the Burgundian court, depicting his high social standing during that period.

Occupation and Lifestyle Transformation: Gangulphus was initially a great landowner with vast properties and wealth.

Question: suppose oxygen leaves air sacs and goes into bloodstream happens, how will it affect a GREATER amount of oxygen being delivered to the blood stream. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect","response":"Assuming the given process where oxygen leaves the air sacs and goes into the bloodstream happens, and this perturbation results in a GREATER amount of oxygen being delivered to the blood stream, we can analyze the effect on the subsequent steps in the process. Given the normal process: 1. You breathe oxygen into your body through the nose or mouth. 2. The oxygen travels to the lungs through the windpipe. 3. The air sacs in the lungs send the oxygen into the blood stream. 4. The carbon dioxide in the blood stream is transferred to the air sacs. 5. The lungs expel through the nose or mouth back into the environment. The perturbation is that a greater amount of oxygen is now being delivered to the bloodstream (Step 3). Now, let's consider how this affects the second effect mentioned (Step 4), which is the transfer of carbon dioxide from the blood stream to the air sacs: If there is a greater amount of oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream, it implies that the blood is taking up more oxygen from the air sacs than usual. As a result, there might be a slight increase in the efficiency of the carbon dioxide transfer process, since the availability of more oxygen facilitates the transport of carbon dioxide in the blood. Thus, based on the described perturbation, the influence on the second effect (carbon dioxide transfer to air sacs) would be that it has a \\"more\\" effect, meaning the transfer of carbon dioxide may become slightly more efficient. Keep in mind that this is a simplified analysis, and actual physiological processes occurring in the body may be more complex."},{"question":"Josie started planning her new garden in the winter.

Hadden had spent the day training and killing time cleaning engines. When he finally sat down with his crew to eat dinner in the middle of his 24-hour shift, the phone rang — and he had to hop into an ambulance to make an emergency call. When he arrived on scene, he and his partner found a pregnant woman in labor. As soon as they helped her into the ambulance, she was ready to give birth. Marc Hadden It was the first time Hadden took charge during a delivery in his two decades of working. “I was tasked with everything to do with Gracie,” Hadden told CBS News. “I helped her take her first breath.” The team then called for backup and rushed to the hospital to drop off the mother and child. While filling out routine paperwork at the hospital, Hadden overheard nurses say the new mom requested the baby girl be put up for adoption “immediately.” “Throw my name in the hat if this baby’s being put up for adoption,” Hadden said jokingly. But he wasn’t actually kidding. Due to medical complications, Hadden and his wife, Rebecca, weren’t able to have any more children after they had their second son. “We checked into adopting, but it was way too expensive,” Hadden. “We prayed about it.” The nurses turned to Hadden and said, “You need to go talk to this mom.” Hesitantly, Hadden walked into the woman’s hospital room to introduce himself. He explained that he has two kids, his wife’s a school teacher and they want to have more children, but aren’t able to. After a friendly chat, Hadden swung by the nursery and sent his wife a picture of the smiley little girl. She jokingly texted back, “Can we keep her?” Marc Hadden Hadden knew his wife wasn’t joking either. Exhausted, Hadden headed home to talk to his wife in person. They both agreed, it was worth trying. What did they have to lose? The next day, Rebecca visited the woman in the hospital. “With both of our boys, we had families, support and a ton of stuff,” Hadden said. “This mom didn’t. She had nothing. No family that was there.” As Rebecca started to walk out of the hospital, a doctor stopped her in the hallway and said, “She’s ready to go forward with the adoption.” Marc Hadden Forty-eight hours later, the Haddens had their little girl, and in March 2012 the closed adoption that the girl’s birth mom requested was complete. “It was meant to be,” Hadden said. “Everything that happened that day changed: my station, assignment, the location. So many things happened that made us 100 percent sure.” Marc Hadden The family named their baby girl Rebecca Grace Hadden; she goes by Gracie. “The name Grace over the years has become extremely fitting for her,” Hadden said of the now 5-year-old. “She’s an awesome kid.” The 5-year-old girl loves playing with her brothers and dressing up with her mom, but she especially loves hearing the story of how her “daddy” delivered her in the back of an ambulance. “Our bond is extremely tight. She’s a part of the family, and we love her more than life,” Hadden said. “We wouldn’t change anything. We would do it all again if we could.” ||||| Get the latest from TODAY Sign up for our newsletter / Source: TODAY By Rheana Murray It's been more than five years since Marc Hadden, a firefighter in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, went on the emergency call that would change his life — and his family — forever. \\"It was a normal slow day in November,\\" Hadden, 47, told TODAY. \\"We were sitting down to eat, hadn't had a call all day.\\" But then they got one — a woman was complaining of severe abdominal pain. When Hadden and the other firefighters arrived on scene, they quickly realized the woman was in labor. Rebecca Grace Hadden, who goes by Grace, was born on November 14, 2011. Courtesy of the Hadden family \\"It was a pretty serious call for us,\\" he said. \\"We got her on some oxygen, started some IVs and literally as we were getting ready to leave the parking lot in the ambulance, my partner said, 'We're about to deliver a baby right here.' We had no time to prepare. Before we could do anything — we hadn't even cut her clothes — Gracie came right out. Immediately she was handed to me.\\" RELATED: 3-year-old boy's joy over adoption photo goes viral Of course, she wasn't known as Gracie then. Hadden and his wife, Beth, named her Rebecca Grace Hadden after they adopted her; she goes by her middle name. At the hospital later on the day of Grace's birth, November 14, 2011, Hadden learned the woman, who he believes was homeless, was putting the infant up for adoption. Hadden and his wife, who had been praying for a third child, jumped at the opportunity. Two days later, they took her home, and in March of 2012 they got full custody of Grace. Today, she is simply part of the family. Grace fit right in with her family.

She's a pretty remarkable kid.\\" She also has two big brothers: Parker, 12, and Will, 14. \\"The boys absolutely love her and she loves them,\\" said Hadden, who still works as a firefighter, but now on a volunteer basis. Now Grace is a happy 5-year-old who loves gymnastics, soccer and hanging out with her brothers. Courtesy of the Hadden family \\"Most days it's business as usual, getting Gracie to day care or gymnastics or soccer,\\" he added. \\"Every once in a while it will hit us, usually when we're out on a date night ... oh my gosh, my wife and I have been together for 15 years, we have three kids now!

The story of Grace, is one of them. For first responder, Marc Hadden seeing the unusual is all in a day's work, but he never expected that taking this call would forever change his life. \\"911, what's your emergency?\\" It was a cool crisp November night when Marc Hadden and his crew arrived on scene. \\"It was just a somewhat normal call. Very quickly we realized that it was going to be a life changer for us,\\" says firefighter, Marc Hadden. There was no time to get to the hospital and before he knew it, Marc was delivering a baby girl. \\"He called me and he was ecstatic. I mean, he delivered a baby and who in the world gets to deliver a baby in their lifetime that's not a doctor?\\" says wife, Beth Hadden. Shortly after the amazing experience, the Haddens discovered Baby Grace was immediately put up for adoption, an unknown blessing for the family of four who always knew they wanted their family to grow, but couldn't. \\"Ever since we had the boys, we knew that we wanted more children,\\" explains Beth. \\"But I was pre-term with them so we knew that it wasn't possible to have any more babies. And we had it in our minds and in our hearts for years to adopt and we just left it in God's hands. We said if its meant to be, it will be.\\" In a strange twist of fate, it was as if little Grace picked them. \\"I don't know if I have words. I never envisioned that I would have a daughter. We are truly blessed, for sure,\\" says Marc. Just 48 hours after the emergency call, their new bundle of joy wrapped in pink was coming home. \\"As soon as we signed the papers I looked a Marc and went, 'Oh my gosh, we have to pay for a wedding.' I was like, that was my first thought? I guess just having a girl is so different after having two boys,\\" laughs Beth. As for the boys, Will and Parker haven't skipped a beat taking on the roles as the protective, older brothers. They realize they may not share the same DNA as Grace, but the way they light up when they see her can only be described as true love. \\"I just love her to pieces,\\" says big brother Will. It's been nearly eight months now since little Grace miraculously fell right into her daddy's arms. The family of five is happy and healthy and life has proven once again that being in the right place at the right time can change everything. Marc jokingly says, \\"I've been telling people that, you know [that old saying], 'I brought her into this world and I can take her out' and I'll be able to tell her that.\\" Most would say little Gracie was saved the night she was born, but the Haddens would argue it was Grace who saved them. \\"I don't even think about her being adopted. She's ours and we love her,\\" says proud dad, Marc. Making room for their bundle of joy Word about the Haddens spread quickly after their appearance on WMBF News. Their family was growing as Marc and Beth Hadden opened their arms, their hearts and their home to Grace, and that outpouring of love is contagious. A friend of the family who has witnessed the tale of Haddens first hand wanted to pitch in and help, donating time and supplies to construct an expansion to their home. The contractor Buddy Satterfield explains, \\"It feels good to do something that we feel is relatively simple in the construction business, but it just means so much to somebody else. So it's just great to be able to pass on the blessing that has been sent to us.\\" The new construction on the Haddens' home began on Monday, July 23 - and now on Tuesday - the additions are nearly complete. The crew built a partition separating a dining area from the family room and creating a fourth bedroom. After some light vanity work, the room should be ready for use this weekend. Proud father Marc Hadden cheers, \\"I don't know what we would have done because we have definitely outgrown our home.

Lyell was knighted (Kt) in 1848, and later, in 1864, made a baronet (Bt), which is an hereditary honour. He was awarded the Copley Medal of the Royal Society in 1858 and the Wollaston Medal of the Geological Society in 1866. Mount Lyell, the highest peak in Yosemite National Park, is named after him; the crater Lyell on the Moon and a crater on Mars were named in his honour; Mount Lyell in western Tasmania, Australia, located in a profitable mining area, bears Lyell's name; and the Lyell Range in north-west Western Australia is named after him as well. In Southwest Nelson in the South Island of New Zealand, the Lyell Range, Lyell River and the gold mining town of Lyell (now only a camping site) were all named after Lyell.

And I was wondering What did Lucy need to do before this? A:","response":"Before asking Lee for a recommendation letter for nursing school, Lucy would have needed to: 1. Research nursing schools: Before anything else, Lucy would have to research potential nursing schools to find the best fit for her career goals, interests, and background. This may involve considering factors such as location, tuition, program length, and school rankings. 2. Meet the basic requirements: Lucy would need to ensure she meets the nursing school's basic requirements, such as completing prerequisite courses, maintaining a minimum GPA, and possibly having some experience in healthcare settings (e.g., CNA, volunteering). 3. Take required exams: Lucy might have to take exams such as the Test of Essential Academic Skills (TEAS) or the National League for Nursing Pre-Admission Examination (NLN PAX) if required by the nursing schools she's interested in. 4. Compile application materials: In addition to a recommendation letter, Lucy would typically need to prepare other application materials, such as a personal statement, resume or CV highlighting relevant experiences, and copies of her transcripts. 5. Choose a recommender: Lucy would need to carefully consider who to ask for a recommendation letter. It is essential to select someone who can speak to her abilities, character, and potential as a nursing student, such as a current or former professor, supervisor, or mentor. 6. Prepare a request: Before asking Lee (or any recommender), Lucy should prepare a detailed request including information about the nursing school(s), the specific program she's applying to, her goals and aspirations, and any other relevant details that would help the recommender write a strong, personalized letter. 7. Give enough time: Finally, Lucy should make sure to ask for the recommendation letter well in advance (at least a few weeks to a month before the deadline) to give Lee enough time to draft, review, and submit the letter to the nursing school.

Plot title: The Prestige Movie plot: In early 1900s London, magician Robert Angier performs his trick, 'The Real Transported Man,' to a sold out theater. Rival magician Alfred Borden, in disguise, sneaks under the stage. At the trick's culmination, Angier drops through a trap door and into a waiting water tank, where Borden watches him drown. At Borden's murder trial, Angier's ingÃ©nieur, John Cutter testifies how Borden pushed the water tank under the trap door to catch and kill Angier during his New Transported Man trick. In prison, Borden is visited by an agent of Lord Caldlow, who offers to care for Borden's daughter Jess in exchange for all of Borden's tricks. As a show of good faith, Caldlow gives Borden a copy of Angier's diary, which Borden reads. In flashback, Angier and Borden work as shills for Milton the Magician, alongside ingÃ©nieur John Cutter and assistant Julia, who is also Angier's wife. Milton's famous trick is the water tank trick, where Julia is bound in ropes and dropped in a water tank, from which she frees herself and escapes. Borden, with Julia's consent, ties her hands with a more secure, yet difficult knot. Julia fails to slip the knot and drowns, infuriating Angier and fueling his deep-seated grudge against Borden. Borden launches a solo magic career and hires the silent, mysterious Fallon as his ingÃ©nieur, Borden courts and eventually marries Sarah, who gives birth to their daughter, Jess. At his first show, Borden's bullet catch trick is sabotaged by Angier, and Borden loses two fingers. Angier launches his own magic career, hiring Olivia Wenscombe as his assistant and Cutter as his ingÃ©nieur.

As gross as it all sounds, there's a certain spark behind the basic premise of this film that could have worked, in the hands of a less cocky filmmaker. Unfortunately what we end up with is poorly drawn characters whose sole purpose seems to be to look beautiful at the beginning to make the inevitable decomposition more contrasting, a hackneyed script so profanity-laden as to leave the viewer tuning out the dialogue, and several incomprehensible subplots that motivate little more than (in one instance) an on-screen appearance by director Roth.

There is some evidence that myopia is inherited. If one or both of your parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too. Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20. However, nearsightedness may also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes. A common sign of nearsightedness is difficulty seeing distant objects like a movie screen or the TV, or the whiteboard or chalkboard in school. Paragraph: Bimmy and Harold are both four years old and are about to start attending school. Before that though, it is important that they have adequate supplies to be prepared. Bimmy's parents, who both have worn glasses their whole lives, took him to the store to pick up folders and pencils. While there, they bumped into Harold and his parents, who do not wear glasses. They quickly exchanged hellos before moving on with their shopping. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which boy will more likely struggle to see the chalkboard when they start school?

Solve this problem.","response":"To solve the equation 84*p - 5 = 83*p for p, we need to isolate p on one side of the equation by performing some algebraic manipulations. Here's the step-by-step process: 1. Write down the original equation: 84*p - 5 = 83*p 2. To start isolating \\"p\\", move all terms containing \\"p\\" to one side of the equation. In this case, we'll subtract 83*p from both sides. This will leave us with the following equation: (84*p - 83*p) - 5 = 0 3. Now, simplify the equation by combining like terms. Since 84*p and -83*p both have \\"p\\" in them, we can combine them: (84 - 83)*p - 5 = 0 1*p - 5 = 0 4. Now, let's move the constant term to the other side of the equation to completely isolate \\"p\\". In this equation, the constant term is -5. To move it to the other side, add 5 to both sides of the equation: 1*p = 5 5. Lastly, to find the value of \\"p\\", divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of \\"p\\", which in this case is 1: p = 5 / 1 Therefore, the solution to the equation 84*p - 5 = 83*p is: p = 5"},{"question":"Article: It's not yet clear how many other cases — including the 400 inmates on the state's death row — could be affected, experts said. “The substance of the ruling would affect the vast majority of Florida’s death row inmates,\\" said Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, which opposes capital punishment. \\"The remaining question would be: Will the Supreme Court consider this to have retroactive effect and retroactive to when?” He said he expects the ruling will unleash a wave of litigation. “Every defendant in Florida whose death sentence was imposed in this matter will be challenging the constitutionality of his or her death sentence under Hurst,\\" Dunham said. Connie Fuselier, the mother of Hurst's victim, said she doesn’t care if he is executed at this point, but she can’t bear the thought of more legal proceedings. “It’s been hell,” she told NBC News. “When you get to thinking it’s over with, it starts all over again. It’s nerve-racking.” At one point during the many appeals the case has spawned, Fuselier said, she told the prosecutor she’d be satisfied with a sentence of life without parole. “I just want it over with. I want to know he has no more appeals,” she said. She said the case’s 17-year journey through the courts, with the rehashing of the gruesome details of her daughter’s death, has taken a toll on the family. “I have post-traumatic stress. I have depression,” she said. “It’s like the family evaporated. We’re all here, but it’s like we’re not.” ||||| WASHINGTON (AP) — Florida's unique system for sentencing people to death is unconstitutional because it gives too much power to judges — and not enough to juries — to decide capital sentences, the Supreme Court ruled Tuesday. The 8-1 ruling said that the state's sentencing procedure is flawed because juries play only an advisory role in recommending death while the judge can reach a different decision. The decision could trigger new sentencing appeals from some of the 390 inmates on the Florida's death row, a number second only to California. But legal experts said it may apply only to those whose initial appeals are not yet exhausted. The court sided with Timothy Lee Hurst, who was convicted of the 1998 murder of his manager at a Popeye's restaurant in Pensacola. A jury divided 7-5 in favor of death, but a judge imposed the sentence. Florida's solicitor general argued that the system was acceptable because a jury first decides if the defendant is eligible for the death penalty. Writing for the court, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said a jury's \\"mere recommendation is not enough.\\" She said the court was overruling previous decisions upholding the state's sentencing process. \\"The Sixth Amendment requires a jury, not a judge, to find each fact necessary to impose a sentence of death,\\" Sotomayor said. The justices sent the case back to the Florida Supreme Court to determine whether the error in sentencing Hurst was harmless, or whether he should get a new sentencing hearing. Justice Samuel Alito dissented, saying that the trial judge in Florida simply performs a reviewing function that duplicates what the jury has done. Under Florida law, the state requires juries in capital sentencing hearings to weigh factors for and against imposing a death sentence. But the judge is not bound by those findings and can reach a different conclusion. The judge can also weigh other factors independently. So a jury could base its decision on one particular aggravating factor, but a judge could then rely on a different factor the jury never considered. In Hurst's case, prosecutors asked the jury to consider two aggravating factors: the murder was committed during a robbery and it was \\"especially heinous, atrocious or cruel.\\" But Florida law did not require the jury to say how it voted on each factor. Hurst's attorney argued that it was possible only four jurors agreed with one, while three agreed with the other. Sotomayor said Florida's system is flawed because it allows a sentencing judge to find aggravating factors \\"independent of a jury's fact-finding.\\" The Supreme Court ruled in 2002 that a defendant has the right to have a jury decide whether the circumstances of a crime warrant a sentence of death. Florida is one of only three states that do not require a unanimous jury verdict when sentencing someone to death. The others are Alabama and Delaware. Stephen Harper, a law professor who runs the Death Penalty Clinic at Florida International University, said it's unlikely the Supreme Court ruling will open the door for most Florida death-row inmates to new sentencing hearings. He said the Florida decision is based on a previous Arizona ruling that was already found not to be retroactive. \\"In general, it will not be retroactively applied,\\" Harper said. But he added that Florida inmates whose initial appeals have not been exhausted may be able to argue that the latest decision applies to them. And, he said, any capital cases that are awaiting trial would likely be delayed while state legislators and the Florida Supreme Court sort out the next steps. Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi said her office is reviewing the ruling. News of the high court's decision stunned Florida legislators. Florida House Speaker Steve Crisafulli, who learned of the ruling while he was giving a speech to open the state's annual legislative session, said the Supreme Court had \\"impeccable timing.\\" Crisafulli said House legal experts would begin to review the ruling. Rep. Matt Gaetz, an attorney who has dealt with capital punishment during his legislative career, predicted that Florida legislators would act swiftly to get the death penalty \\"right back on track.\\" Cassandra Stubbs, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Capital Punishment Project, said the ruling \\"restored the central role of the jury in imposing the death penalty.\\" She called it another step toward ending capital punishment since juries across the country have been increasingly reluctant to impose death sentences. ___ Associated Press writers Curt Anderson in Miami, Gary Fineout in Tallahassee, Florida, and Tamara Lush in St. Petersburg, Florida, contributed to this report. ||||| The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday struck down Florida's death penalty system on the grounds that judges, not juries, decide the key facts that determine whether a killer is condemned to die. In an 8-1 ruling, the justices said this judge-driven system violates a defendant's right to a jury trial. The ruling will likely give new sentencing hearings to inmates who were recently sentenced to death in Florida, but the justices in the past have said such new rulings do not apply automatically to old cases. Tuesday's ruling relied on a 2002 decision that struck down Arizona's judge-driven system for deciding death penalty cases. Despite that ruling in the case of Ring vs. Arizona, the Florida courts had continued to uphold death sentences there on the grounds that juries had recommended death as the proper verdict. But on Tuesday, the justices decided Florida must move to a sentencing system that gives juries the final word. The ruling will mean a new sentencing hearing for Timothy Hurst, who was convicted of stabbing and killing a a co-worker at a Popeye's restaurant in 1998. Join the conversation on Facebook >> He was tried twice, and the jury, though divided, recommended a death sentence, and the judge imposed one. But Justice Sonia Sotomayor, speaking for the court, said Florida should have followed the 2002 decision by putting the full weight on the jury. \\"The 6th Amendment protects a defendant's right to an impartial jury,\\" she said. \\"This right required Florida to base Timothy Hurst's death sentence on a jury verdict, not a judge's fact-finding. Florida's death sentencing scheme, which required the judge alone to find the existence of an aggravating circumstance, is therefore unconstitutional.\\" Dissenting alone, Justice Samuel A. Alito said the justices had upheld Florida's system in the past. \\"Under the Florida system, the jury plays a critically important role,\\" he said, by weighing the evidence and recommending whether the murderer should die.

The 8-1 ruling says that the state's sentencing procedure is flawed as juries play only an advisory role in recommending death while the judge can reach a separate decision. The decision could result in new sentencing appeals from some of the 390 inmates on Florida's death row."},{"question":"So I had my daughter and one of her friends with me and decided to brave a Costco visit. They have lots of samples and toys. We tried a lot of samples, but didn't play with the toys much this visit. We went to gets some cheese for the cheese fair on Wednesday at my daughter's after school program. So naturally, what would take me five minutes turned into half an hour. I picked up a pack of Babybel Cheese for the cheese fest and headed to the cashiers. As usual, there was a longer-than-the-supermarket wait. It's finally my turn, and I give the cashier my card, and he tells me that it is expired. \\"Can we get a manager on aisle 4 please!!\\" So the manager comes over, and the cashier pleads my case like a champ, \\"His card expired and he just wants to get the bag of cheese, he'll renew next time.\\" I would have renewed then, but, of course, my MasterCard and Visa are no good at Costco. I have the cash for the cheese, but not for the renewal as well. The manager looks at my accounts and tells me that it has been expired since May, and that he can't let me buy the cheese. So apparently my wife and I hadn't been to Costco since before May, but I'm sure it appeared as if I were a serial non-renewer. That might be plausible if I weren't buying a single 24 pack of Babybels. Yeah, I'm refusing to renew so that I can buy well priced cheese wrapped in wax. The wax is actually really cool. So I lower my head in shame, gather up the kids, leave the cheese, am given back my expired card with a \\"you don't want to forget this,\\" and head for the door to tell the people who make sure that you aren't shoplifting that there is nothing to check because I couldn't get the cheese for my daughter's cheese tasting. By the way, I chucked the card because it was obviously the cards fault, or maybe I just didn't want the reminder. Is this review positive or negative?","response":"This review is negative.

The absolute difference is calculated as the absolute value of one integer subtracted by another. The result must be a single integer representing the smallest possible absolute distance. Here's how we can solve this task using the given list of integers: [-30, 60, 94, -14, -11] 1. First, sort the list in ascending order: [-30, -14, -11, 60, 94] 2. Initialize a variable, 'min_difference', to store the smallest absolute difference found so far. Set its initial value to the absolute difference between the first two numbers in the sorted list ('min_difference' = |-30 - (-14)| = 16) 3. Iterate through the sorted list, starting from index 2 (the third element) to the end: - Calculate the absolute difference between the current number and the previous number in the list - If this absolute difference is less than the current 'min_difference', update 'min_difference' with the new value 4. The final value of 'min_difference' will be the smallest possible absolute distance. Using this method, let's find the minimum absolute difference: - Initial min_difference: 16 - Absolute difference between -14 and -11: |-14 - (-11)| = 3 (min_difference is updated to 3) - Absolute difference between -11 and 60: |-11 - 60| = 71 (min_difference does not change, as 71 > 3) - Absolute difference between 60 and 94: |60 - 94| = 34 (min_difference does not change, as 34 > 3) After iterating through all the elements, the minimum absolute difference is found to be 3.

Monteux's first high-profile conducting experience came in 1895, when he was barely 20 years old. He was a member of the orchestra engaged for a performance of Saint-Saëns's oratorio La lyre et la harpe, to be conducted by the composer. At the last minute Saint-Saëns judged the player engaged for the important and difficult organ part to be inadequate and, as a celebrated virtuoso organist, decided to play it himself. He asked the orchestra if any of them could take over as conductor; there was a chorus of \\"Oui – Monteux!\\". With great trepidation, Monteux conducted the orchestra and soloists including the composer, sight-reading the score, and was judged a success.Monteux's musical career was interrupted in 1896, when he was called up for military service. As a graduate of the Conservatoire, one of France's grandes écoles, he was required to serve only ten months rather than the three years generally required. He later described himself as \\"the most pitifully inadequate soldier that the 132nd Infantry had ever seen\\". He had inherited from his mother not only her musical talent but her short and portly build and was physically unsuited to soldiering.Returning to Paris after discharge, Monteux resumed his career as a violist. Hans Richter invited him to lead the violas in the Bayreuth Festival orchestra, but Monteux could not afford to leave his regular work in Paris. In December 1900 Monteux played the solo viola part in Berlioz's Harold in Italy, rarely heard in Paris at the time, with the Colonne Orchestra conducted by Felix Mottl. In 1902 he secured a junior conducting post at the Dieppe casino, a seasonal appointment for the summer months which brought him into contact with leading musicians from the Paris orchestras and well-known soloists on vacation. By 1907 he was the principal conductor at Dieppe, in charge of operas and orchestral concerts. As an orchestral conductor he modelled his technique on that of Arthur Nikisch, under whose baton he had played, and who was his ideal conductor.

There are family cord blood banks in countries throughout the world. You can ask your doctor or hospital to direct you to a private bank with a good reputation, or you can look on a directory of private blood banks and do your own research on those you find. The Parent's Guide to Cord Blood Foundation has a worldwide directory of family cord blood banks, which you can browse for free. Note that cost is not necessarily an indication of quality. Some less expensive blood banks might be cutting corners in potentially unsafe manners, but others might have lower costs simply because they spend less on marketing. Reputation is usually a better indication than anything else. You should also check on the qualifications and experience of those running the blood bank, as well as the company's viability, stability, and storage technology. Shop around. If one blood bank can't offer you a discount, call another. It may take awhile to find the best rates for your financial situation. Once you find a private blood bank you want to work with, you should contact them and make arrangements. You should also make sure that your doctor and hospital are aware of these arrangements at least one month before your baby is born, if not sooner. The company you've chosen to bank with should send you a collection kit. You must give this kit to the hospital or birthing center at the time of delivery. Even though the hospital will not receive the kit until delivery, you should still make them aware of your intentions beforehand. Make sure that cord blood is collected after delivery. Doctors and nurses should collect the blood from your baby's umbilical cord within a few minutes after the birth of your child. Each private blood bank has its own procedures, but when your family needs the cord blood stored at the bank, you should be able to notify the bank and have the blood delivered to your hospital for a transfusion. You may need medical authorization from a doctor to show the blood is presently needed. The cord blood will be tested to see whether or not it's a match for the patient. Summary:","response":"This article discusses the process of finding a reputable family cord blood bank, considering factors such as cost, reputation, and qualifications, and highlights the importance of making necessary arrangements with the chosen blood bank, doctor, and hospital prior to the baby's birth for proper cord blood collection and storage."},{"question":"Question: I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

In the end, credits that are heavily laced with references to moose, llamas and other furry animals roll to highly festive Latin music.Little is to be seen but fog over a grassland while the sound of a galloping horsea sound that could only be made on cobblestone, but not grassis heard. From the fog emerge two pedestrians: King Arthur (Graham Chapman), dressed in chain mail, a tunic and a crown; and Patsy (Terry Gilliam), who appears to be fulfilling the role of beast of burden, and is using two half-coconuts percussively.They approach a castle and Patsy perfectly mimics the sound of a galloping horse coming to a stop. Two guards become barely visible atop the castle wall. Arthur announces that he is looking for knights to join him at Camelot, and wishes to recruit the master of the castle. Unfortunately, the two guards are immediately distracted by Patsy's half-coconuts. Arthur tries to return the conversation to the quest, but the guards are unable to turn their attentions from the possible causes for coconuts appearing in Mercia (England), as Arthur claims that they found them there, or how a bird, or a set of birds, might have brought one up from the tropics.

It grow along cracks in stone walls and along the roadside near my home in Settignano, which is blooming with spring goodness right now: robinia (black locust) trees, wild garlic (three-cornered leek) and even elderflowers are already bursting. I asked the vendor just to double check, “Is this borage?” “Si,” Came the answer, “Borragine.” He confirmed. “I’ve had it in ravioli,” I started to say, “Brava!” He said, as if we were about to start a guessing game on what could be done with it. Actually, there’s a lot that can be done with it. If you can use it as a ravioli filling with ricotta, then you can imagine it taking the place of spinach in gnudi, too, but also soups or frittata or stirred through polenta. I learned that the flowers are just as delicious, if not more interesting, for their delicate cucumber-like flavour — people told me of their use in salads or cocktails like Pimms, and someone even mentioned she freezes them in ice cubes, what a pretty idea for those first warm nights when you can dine al fresco, homemade cocktail in hand. Then there’s risotto and of course the fritters, much like these ones. Or you can simply deep fry the clusters of buds that haven’t yet burst open like these deep-fried robinia flowers. borage and ricotta crepes The problem, I was thinking, as I took home my bag of borage, is that I can’t decide what to make. There’s simply too much choice. I consulted two of my favourite books that also happen to be cookbooks. Patience Gray’s Honey from a Weed and Luigi Ballerini’s A Feast of Weeds. Both had wonderful ideas for borage (and indeed many other edible, foraged plants). The cooking probably took - two hours - an hour - a day - not enough information","response":"In Patience Gray's Honey from a Weed, she mentions using young borage leaves in a frittata, simply by combining them with eggs and a little seasoning. She also writes about making a soup with borage, potatoes, and leeks, blending everything together with the addition of a little cream to finish it off. The soup is said to have a fresh, delicious flavor, not unlike leek and potato soup, but with a hint of the cucumber-like taste that borage is known for. In Luigi Ballerini's A Feast of Weeds, he suggests making borage and ricotta crepes. The recipe involves making a simple crepe batter, combining the cooked and chopped borage leaves with ricotta cheese and a pinch of nutmeg, and then spooning the mixture into the crepes, folding them into packets, and baking them in the oven until heated through and slightly crispy on the edges. Ballerini's recipe also calls for serving the crepes with a drizzle of melted butter and Parmesan cheese, a classic and decadent Italian touch. After spending some time browsing through these two cookbooks and contemplating the many possible uses for borage in my dishes, I decided to go ahead and try making the borage and ricotta crepes. The result was wonderful - the crepes were light and delicate, while the filling was creamy and packed with the unique flavor of borage. The process of making the crepes and the filling took about two hours, from start to finish. This included the time spent cleaning and blanching the borage leaves, which can take some time due to their fuzzy and slightly prickly nature. It's important to choose young, fresh leaves for this type of preparation, as they are more tender and less prickly than older leaves. It wasn't the quickest of meals to prepare, but it was well worth the effort. As I enjoyed my borage and ricotta crepes with a simple green salad and a glass of white wine, I couldn't help but think of how fortunate I was to have stumbled upon this versatile and delicious plant. The fact that it grows wild in my own backyard makes it even more special, as it's a constant reminder of the beauty and abundance of nature, and the many culinary delights that can be enjoyed if we just take the time to explore and embrace the natural world around us. In the end, my foray into cooking with borage turned out to be a wonderful experience, one that left me with a newfound appreciation for this unassuming, yet delightful plant. I now look forward to trying even more recipes and preparations using borage, with the goal of incorporating it into my culinary repertoire on a regular basis.

After the Summit, I took the train back home to Philadelphia. You won’t believe what happened when I arrived at 30th Street Station. I can’t find my car. So I walk all six floor in the garage with my luggage, black bag with all my heavy files, heels and a hot pink yoga mat that I had gotten at the Summit.

Velma calls Tyrone, her manager. Tyrone comes and tells me that people are always losing their cars because they think they drove up the ramp when they really drove down the ramp. He repeats this point as he drives me up and down the ramps in his 1972 Chevrolet with his muffler dragging and… So we call the police and report it stolen.

To turn her into her demon form. A:","response":"Title: The Demonic Embrace Genre: Horror, Supernatural, Thriller Set in the small rural town of Grünwald, Germany, the movie plot revolves around Helena, a young woman who, unbeknownst to her, possesses a dark secret – she is the last descendant of an ancient demonic bloodline. The town of Grünwald is home to a secret religious cult that worships demons and the occult. For centuries, the cult has been waiting for the arrival of the last descendant to awaken the dormant demon within the bloodline, believing it will bring them unimaginable power and dominion over the world. As Helena (our protagonist, played by an up-and-coming actress) settles into her new life in Grünwald, unusual events begin taking place. From mysterious storms to the brutal murder of her fiancé, Helena's life becomes a nightmare. Unbeknownst to her, the cult continues its violent killing spree, collecting body parts for their sinister rituals. Helena begins to question her mysterious past, as her dreams are haunted by nightmarish visions of a demonic creature. As she investigates her family history, she comes across an ancient book about her demonic ancestors revealing her true existence. The cult, realizing Helena's discovery, decides to expedite their ritual. Under the guidance of the cult leader (played by a well-known actor), the members capture Helena and perform the dark ceremony, feeding her a dead German's leg to complete the transformation. However, they do so with malicious intentions, as the leg belongs to none other than Helena's murdered fiancé. Overcome by grief, this act triggers the demon within her bloodline to fully awaken, transforming Helena into her true demonic form. Instead of obeying the cult's commands, she unleashes her fury on her captors. Fueled by vengeance and pain, Helena uses her newfound powers to exact brutal revenge on the cult members, destroying them one by one. Meanwhile, a local priest (played by a seasoned actor) and his apprentice start to investigate the horrific events unfolding within Grünwald, as they set out to stop the demonic rampage. When the priest discovers Helena's true nature, he is torn between his duty to vanquish the demonic entity and his empathy for the young woman who was a victim of the cult's diabolical plot. As the climactic confrontation ensues between Helena and the priest, the two discover that their shared hatred for the cult may provide the key to defeating the darkness within her. Empowered by their newfound bond, Helena and the priest work together to find a way to exorcise the demon from Helena's bloodline and break the cycle of terror that has plagued Grünwald for centuries. The movie ends with the defeat of the cult and the closure of the demonic chapter in Helena's life. Having earned her redemption, she vows to use her powers for good and devote her life to protecting the innocent from the dark forces that dwell within our world. \\"The Demonic Embrace\\" is a horrifying yet compelling tale that explores themes of family, destiny, and redemption. Its unique plot will captivate audiences, inviting them to experience the darkness and catharsis of a woman who finds power in the darkest corners of her being."},{"question":"Sentence: Hypermarcas, founded on January 1, 2001, is located in Brazil and has a net income of 108,600,000.

He has a younger brother and sister. He took up magic after seeing Harry Blackstone Sr. and reading conjuring books while spending 13 months in a body cast following a bicycle accident. He confounded doctors who expected he would never walk again. In 1996, Randi established the James Randi Educational Foundation. Randi and his colleagues publish in JREF's blog, Swift. Topics have included the interesting mathematics of the one-seventh area triangle, a classic geometric puzzle. In his weekly commentary, Randi often gives examples of what he considers the nonsense that he deals with every day. Beginning in 2003, the JREF annually hosted The Amaz!ng Meeting, a gathering of scientists, skeptics, and atheists. The last meeting was in 2015, coinciding with Randi's retirement from the JREF. James Randi began a series of conferences known as \\"The Amazing Meeting\\" - TAM - which quickly became the largest gathering of skeptics in the world, drawing audiences from Asia, Europe, South America, and the UK. It also attracted large percentage of younger folks. Randi has been regularly featured on many podcasts, including The Skeptics Society's official podcast Skepticality and the Center for Inquiry's official podcast Point of Inquiry. From September 2006 onwards, he has occasionally contributed to The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe podcast with a column titled \\"Randi Speaks.\\" In addition, The Amazing Show is a podcast in which Randi shares various anecdotes in an interview format. In 2014 Part2Filmworks released An Honest Liar, a feature film documentary, written by Tyler Measom and Greg O'Toole, and directed and produced by Measom and Justin Weinstein. The film, which was funded through Kickstarter, focuses on Randi's life, his investigations, and his relationship with longtime partner Jose Alvarez, a.k.a. Deyvi Pena. The film was screened at the Tribeca Film Festival, at Toronto's Hot Docs film festival, and at the June 2014 AFI Docs Festival in Silver Spring, Maryland and Washington, D.C., where it won the Audience Award for Best Feature. It has since been captioned in ten different languages, shown worldwide, and was also positively received by critics. The film was featured on the PBS Independent Lens series, shown in the U.S. and Canada, on March 28, 2016. In 2017, he appeared in animated form on Holy Koolaid, in which he discussed the challenge of finding the balance between connecting sincerely with his audience and at the same time tricking/fooling them with an artful ruse and indicated that this is a balance many magicians struggle with. what is the amazing meeting","response":"The Amazing Meeting (TAM) is an annual conference series dedicated to promoting critical thinking, skepticism, and science.

The Amazing Meeting provided a forum for attendees to exchange ideas, learn from guest speakers, engage in debates, and listen to lectures and panel discussions on a wide range of subjects, including critical thinking, debunking pseudoscience, scientific investigation, religion, and the paranormal. The event showcased prominent figures from the fields of science, academia, and entertainment, who are known for their commitment to skepticism and rationality.

The school is widely believed to be Williams College, Webb's alma mater (in the opening sequence of the movie, Dustin Hoffman, playing Benjamin Braddock, is wearing a Williams College tie). Benjamin is seen arriving at LAX International Airport over the opening credits.The movie really begins at a party that same evening celebrating his graduation at his parents' house in Pasadena, a suburb of Los Angeles. Benjamin is visibly uncomfortable at the party attended by his parents' friends. He remains aloof while his parents deliver accolades and neighborhood friends ask him about his future plans. Benjamin escapes from each person who comes to congratulate him, exposing his seeming embarrassment at all the honors he had won at college.

Brian Jonestown Massacre and the Dandy Warhols. What makes it special is the examination of the complex contrasting personalities and the ironies of success and failure. Anton Newcombe, the main man of Brian Jonestown Massacre, is widely recognised as a musical genius not only by his colleagues, his friends and rivals the Dandy Warhols, but also by record producers and most people who have worked with him. Sadly he and his band members are also incapable of integrating with the real world. Newcombe picks fights with band members on stage or with members of the audience (getting arrested at one point for literally kicking in the head of a fan). Newcombe knows no limits  he plays between 40 and 100 different instruments, writes and produces all BJM's music, can produce enough songs to fill a whole album in a single day, has a prophet-like obsessiveness with his own musical genius, but is also a heavy drugs user, flies into rages at the slightest compromise of his own artistic integrity, orders his band members about as if they are lower forms of life, and can blow deals as fast as he makes them. BJM go through a large number of record labels in fast succession  they sign them up as soon as they realise Newcombe's talents and let them go as soon as they realise he is totally uncontrollable. The Warhols acknowledge their debt to Newcombe's creativity and don't even put themselves in the same exalted sphere of greatness  but the Warhols have something that BJM don't  the ability to integrate their talents with common sense, the real world, and their market  as a mixing pot of talent (even if much of it is distilled from guru Newcombe) and accessibility, they are the very definition of 'cool.' DiG! follows the parallel careers of the two bands with increasing poignancy. At one point, Newcombe pulls stunts designed to generate publicity by sending apparent death threats and hate messages to the Warhols (in a box containing live ammunition and insults like a bar of soap 'to clean up their act')  only he forgets to tell them it's a stunt and they get so paranoid they take out a restraining order against Newcombe. By the time the Dandy Warhols take off in Europe with hits like 'Every Day Should Be A Holiday' and 'Bohemian Like You', Newcombe is becoming increasingly isolated. BJM are stopped and the band breaks up when they are arrested for possession of marijuana  the Warhols get busted for drugs around the same time, let off with a warning, and even allowed to keep the grass. The wider appeal of DiG! is that the lessons of genius versus accessibility go way beyond two bands or even rock music. The downside is that it is still a documentary, however intimate, and it will mostly only appeal to dedicated film fans or people who are already interested in the music of one or both of the featured bands. Newcombe may well be a largely unrecognised genius, and there are feint glimpses of this in the film, but to the unattuned ear there is little more than the assertions of the people interviewed to attest to this. In the words of one of the band members: \\"In every spiritual tradition, you burn in hell for pretending to be God and not being able to back it up.\\" Newcombe isn't pretending  but numerically there are maybe still insufficient people to appreciate him in his own lifetime, and DiG! has an uphill struggle to rectify the balance in favour of a tortured but largely unrecognised genius.

Answer:","response":"No, I would not agree that the right answer to the question \\"what does loud noises often do to mammals?\\" is \\"comfort them.\\" On the contrary, loud noises typically cause discomfort, stress or even fear in mammals. This is because loud noises can be perceived as a potential threat or danger in their environment, leading them to startle or display other defensive behaviors. Furthermore, mammals have evolved to be sensitive to loud noises as a survival mechanism. This sensitivity allows them to effectively respond to potential threats, such as predators or natural events like storms or avalanches. Consequently, loud noises can trigger a \\"fight or flight\\" response in many mammals, increasing their heart rate, adrenaline production, and other physiological changes that help them quickly respond to perceived danger. In general, loud noises are more likely to cause stress, discomfort, or fear in mammals rather than providing any sense of comfort or relaxation."},{"question":"Q: Why were game animals introduced by acclimatisation societies? A: The islands making up New Zealand originally had no land mammals apart from bats. Does the answer correctly answer the question Choose from: -- yes. -- no.","response":"Yes, game animals were introduced by acclimatisation societies primarily due to the lack of native land mammals in regions like New Zealand. These societies aimed to enhance the biodiversity of their respective regions by importing and acclimating foreign species to local environments. However, the introduction of game animals by these societies had both positive and negative consequences. In the 19th century, European settlers in countries like New Zealand and Australia founded acclimatisation societies with the primary objective of making these newly settled lands more familiar and comfortable. Adding game animals to the local ecology not only provided settlers with recreational hunting opportunities but also an additional source of food, leading to increased self-sufficiency. This is evidenced by the introduction of various animals like rabbits, deer, pheasants, and trout to the islands of New Zealand. Acclimatisation societies took great care in selecting the species to be introduced and closely monitored their progress in adapting to their new environments. However, these societies failed to predict the long-term ecological consequences of introducing new and, in many cases, invasive species to ecosystems that had developed in isolation over thousands of years. In many instances, the introduction of game animals caused irreversible damage to local habitats and led to the decline or even extinction of indigenous flora and fauna. In New Zealand, for example, the introduction of rabbits, possums, and stoats led to widespread devastation of local ecosystems, causing significant loss of native vegetation and bird life. These invasive species, which had no natural predators in their new environments, multiplied rapidly and overwhelmed the native species for resources, ultimately leading to imbalanced ecosystems and the disruption of natural food chains. In conclusion, game animals were introduced by acclimatisation societies in countries like New Zealand to create a sense of familiarity for European settlers, provide recreational hunting opportunities, and increase self-sufficiency through alternative food sources. While these initiatives were successful in their aims, they also resulted in unforeseen ecological consequences, disrupting ecosystems and threatening the existence of native species. Today, many conservation efforts are focused on mitigating the damage caused by these introduced game animals and restoring local ecosystems to their former balance."},{"question":"Aleksey Chirikov (icebreaker), builder, Finland; Aleksey Chirikov (icebreaker), builder, Helsinki What is sentence that verbalizes this data?","response":"Aleksey Chirikov is a big and strong icebreaker ship, which is like a friend that helps other ships to move through thick ice in the cold seas.

According to the 1478 census Selânik (), as the city came to be known in Ottoman Turkish, had 6,094 Greek Orthodox households, 4,320 Muslim ones, and some Catholic. No Jews were recorded in the census suggesting that the subsequent influx of Jewish population was not linked to the already existing Romaniote Jews community. Soon after the turn of the 15th to 16th century, however, nearly 20,000 Sephardic Jews immigrated to Greece from the Iberian Peninsula following their expulsion from Spain by the 1492 Alhambra Decree. By c. 1500, the number of households had grown to 7,986 Greek ones, 8,575 Muslim ones, and 3,770 Jewish. By 1519, Sephardic Jewish households numbered 15,715, 54% of the citys population. Some historians consider the Ottoman regimes invitation to Jewish settlement was a strategy to prevent the ethnic Greek population from dominating the city. Question: How many more Greeks than Jews lived in Selânik by c. 1500? Answer:","response":"By c. 1500, there were 7,986 Greek households and 3,770 Jewish households in Selânik. To find out how many more Greeks than Jews lived in the city by c. 1500, we need to subtract the number of Jewish households from the number of Greek households: 7,986 (Greek households) - 3,770 (Jewish households) = 4,216 households Thus, there were 4,216 more Greek households than Jewish households in Selânik by c. 1500. Since the data is available in terms of households, we cannot determine the exact number of individuals. However, the difference in households gives a clear indication that the Greek population was considerably larger than the Jewish population at that time."},{"question":"Leo: Premise: \\"A cowboy rides a brown horse in a rodeo with 8 minutes remaining on the clock.\\" Based on this premise, can we conclude that the hypothesis \\"A man rides a brown horse in a rodeo with 8 minutes remaining on the clock.\\" is true?

Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda pledged to step down as party president after exit polls showed a smashing loss in lower house voting. The party, once seen as a breath of fresh air in Japanese politics, came to be regarded as increasingly ineffective. \\"We got a regrettable result,\\" Noda said. \\"The result is everything in the politics.

The LDP ruled the country almost continuously since its establishment in 1955 until it was forced from power three years ago by the DPJ.

Context: Recently the subject of discrimination has been something I have been thinking a lot about. It was the subject of some meetings with ubuntu-women, something I have discussed with my friend Sulamita in a Brazilian bar at 4.30am and the subject of various ad-hoc discussions at the Ubuntu Developer Summit. As the wider Open Source community grows, it becomes more of an issue every day, and something we all need to be aware of. While in Brazil I made a promise to Sulamita that I would be blogging about the issue of discrimination against women, and I have been holding off writing an entry until I had some real, practical, implementable steps that I can advise people to take to help make the situation better. Although I will never fully understand how some women are made to feel at the hands of such discrimination, I have been hoping my contribution could be to help contribute to an awareness of the issue, and for that to happen I felt I needed to construct some doable steps that people can execute. Solving social problems is hard though, which ain’t all that surprising, so I had held off on a blog post until I had some such action points. I have since discovered that there is really one key step that we all need take – don’t accept or allow discrimination in your community. In my mind all discrimination is bad. Every day people get up and are discriminated due to gender, age, race, mobility, technical knowledge and more. The issues of discrimination, while different in the specifics (e.g. women are discriminated in different ways to age discrimination), the underlying issue is very similar – mistreating people because of a grouping they are part of. We have all suffered this in different ways, from serious racial hatred to someone not taking you seriously because you have long hair and an Iron Maiden t-shirt. Question: How has the speaker been discriminated against? Options: A. Casual profiling B. Judged for a t-shirt C. Serious racial hatred D. not enough information The answer is:","response":"B. Judged for a t-shirt"},{"question":"Solve -73*r - 15020515 + 15016427 = 0 for r. Solve this problem.","response":"To solve the equation -73*r - 15020515 + 15016427 = 0 for r, we'll follow these steps: Step 1: Combine the numerical terms on the left side of the equation. -73*r - 15020515 + 15016427 = 0 The numerical terms are -15020515 and 15016427. We'll add these two numbers: (-15020515) + (15016427) = -409088 So, the equation becomes: -73*r - 409088 = 0 Step 2: Isolate the variable (r) on one side of the equation. To achieve this, we'll move the constant term (-409088) to the right side of the equation by adding 409088 to both sides. -73*r - 409088 + 409088 = 0 + 409088 -73*r = 409088 Step 3: Solve for r. Now, we'll divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of r, which is -73. -73*r / -73 = 409088 / -73 r = -5608 So, the solution to the given equation is r = -5608."},{"question":"Translate to French: Immediate Source of Acquisition: unknown.","response":"Étape 1: Identifier les mots clés et les phrases à traduire.

What is the answer??","response":"Okay, let's solve this equation step by step like we're explaining to a young kid. We have this equation: 57*t = 54*t + 9 1. We want to get all the 't' parts on one side and the numbers on the other side. To do that, we can subtract 54*t from both sides of the equation: 57*t - 54*t = 54*t - 54*t + 9 2. Now, we can combine the 't' parts: (57 - 54)*t = 9 3*t = 9 3. To find 't', we can now divide both sides of the equation by 3: 3*t / 3 = 9 / 3 t = 3 So, the answer is: t = 3!"}]`),H={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.question&&e.question.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.response&&e.response.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},W={class:"search-container"},P={class:"card-container"},D={key:0,class:"empty-state"},N=["disabled"],j={key:0},R={key:1};function E(i,e,h,m,o,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return a(),n("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",W,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),n("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",P,[(a(!0),n(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(p,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),n("div",D,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
