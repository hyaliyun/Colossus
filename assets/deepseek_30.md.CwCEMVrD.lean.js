Other coffee beans are naturally low in acid because of the area of the world that they grow in. Start with a coffee that's designed to be low-acid if you're concerned about acidity. Coffees that are processed to remove the acidity are often marketed as “mild” or “stomach-friendly.” Many coffees grown in Hawaii, Sumatra, Brazil, India, and the Caribbean are naturally lower in acid. Dark roast coffees, such as Italian and French roast, are usually lower in acid than light or medium roast varieties. That's because coffee undergoes chemical changes as it roasts, so the longer that it does, the more acid that is removed. Choose a dark roast coffee and make it using any method that you prefer. Dark roast coffee also causes less acid to be secreted by the stomach than light or medium roasts. If you're not used to drinking dark roast, use a smaller amount than you would of your usual light or medium roast until you're accustomed to the taste. If coffee beans are ground too finely, too much of the acid may be extracted during the brewing process. To reduce the acid in your coffee, opt for a coarser grind, which isn't likely to be over-extracted when you're brewing your coffee. You may want to try a medium ground coffee to see how it affects your stomach. However, avoid fine and extra fine ground coffees.","response":"Coffee beans can have less acid in them because of where they grow or how they are processed.

Elmo's mother rarely stayed up past 10:00 PM, and it was nearly 11:00. She closed the door and started to go back to her room across the hall. She was halfway through a romance novel. But Hadley's delicious oatmeal raisin cookies were calling to her. She walked down the stairs to the kitchen and put a few cookies on a plate. Then she poured a glass of milk. She wondered what Elmo was doing. Was he in the Media Room with Carsie? Their Media Room? Before Elmo and Carsie got together, Elmo and Macy used to spend hours almost every night in that room. Some nights he had almost kissed her. She left her milk and cookies on the kitchen counter and went down another flight of stairs, which came out in the Recreation Room. Macy could hear the sound of the TV coming from Media Room. She tiptoed to the open doorway and peeked in. There she was--that conniving slut--sitting where Macy should have been. How could Elmo have replaced her like that? She thought he had been falling in love with her. How could she have been so wrong? But it could still happen--if that woman would just go away.

The other options do not make sense because: - Shopping bag: This is not a place to shop; it's an item used to carry purchased goods. - Trash: Discarded items in the trash are considered waste and not meant for sale. - Landfill: Although you might find old and discarded items here, it would be unlikely to find a specific item like a pie safe for sale in a landfill. - Cupboard: A cupboard is a piece of furniture typically used for storing items in a household, not a place where you can buy something."},{"question":"I read this background article the other day: Currently, millions of individuals with high cholesterol take a similar type of drug, known as a statin. The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference? Because of the genetic background of all people; the different single nucleotide polymorphisms that make us all different. Pharmacogenomics, a combination of pharmacology and genomics (the study of the genome) that refers to the study of the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics, may explain and simplify this problem. I am facing a new situation today: Uncle Tom and uncle Sam both have high cholesterol. Uncle Tom is on statin drugs and uncle Sam is not. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which uncle doesn't take a drug that works slightly differently in many people? Answer:","response":"Uncle Sam is the one who doesn't take a drug that works slightly differently in many people. This is because, as you've mentioned, Uncle Tom is on statin drugs, which are known to work differently in different individuals due to variations in their genetic backgrounds as per the information in the background article you cited. Statins, as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, lower cholesterol by increasing the expression of low-density lipoprotein receptors in the liver. However, due to individual genetic differences, these drugs can vary in their effect, significantly lowering cholesterol in some people, moderately in others, or having no significant effect at all in some cases. Since Uncle Sam is not taking statin drugs, he isn't subject to this variable efficiency of medication as described. Therefore, Uncle Sam is the uncle who doesn't take a drug that works slightly differently in many people."},{"question":"Q: Context: The Second Continental Congress was a convention of delegates from the Thirteen Colonies that started meeting in the spring of 1775 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Refresh page for latest. 6:40 p.m. update:A severe thunderstorm watch has been issued for the entire area until 1 a.m. Storms are currently lined up from northern West Virgina through southern Pennsylvania. Movement is mainly to the east, but there is also a bit of a southeast push. It’s still somewhat uncertain how much of this storminess will impact the immediate area, but for now, the further north you are, the better your odds remain. Additional storms further west may be the ones to really watch, but they’re still several hours out. 5:10 p.m. update: The high temperature in Washington, D.C. has hit 100 today for the eighth time this year, which puts 2012 in second place for 100-degree days behind the 11 in 1930. It’s also the seventh 100-degree day this month - a record for the most 100-degree days in any month. Monitor severe warnings issued by the National Weather Service and radar on our Severe Weather Tracking Station below. Also, comment below with conditions where you are. After morning clouds slowed temperature rises for a bit, the sun broke through and turned things toasty and pretty gross. Along with highs in the mid-and-upper 90s, we’ve been unfortunate enough to have heat indices as high as 105 to 110 thanks to oppressive humidity. The major severe weather event ongoing to the north should largely stay there, but we’ll watch to see if it skirts the area, as well as for some “home grown” pop ups before the day is out. Through Tonight: While we don’t expect widespread severe weather, we can’t rule out a few storms. Anything that does form in this environment could easily go severe, and in fact Storm Prediction Center has placed northern parts of the area under a moderate risk of severe storms. The main threat would be damaging winds with any storm, along with heavy rain and lightning. Chances of seeing a storm are around 20-40% (highest odds north). If you don’t get any rain, don’t expect to cool off fast. Lows only reach the mid-70s to near 80 most spots. Tomorrow (Friday): With a warm start to the morning, we should be off to the races in no time. Think today, but perhaps with a little less humidity if we’re lucky. Highs should reach the mid-90s to near 100 under partly cloudy skies. Storm chances are up late in the day, to about 30% or so, perhaps rising into the evening.

Water flowing over a steeper slope moves faster and causes more erosion. How water transports particles depends on their size. When water slows down, it starts depositing sediment. This process starts with the largest particles first. Runoff erodes the land after a heavy rain. It picks up sediment. Runoff carries most of the sediment to bodies of water. Mountain streams erode narrow, V-shaped valleys and waterfalls. Erosion and deposition by slow-flowing rivers create broad floodplains and meanders. Deposition by streams and rivers may form alluvial fans and deltas. Floodwaters may deposit natural levees. Erosion and deposition by groundwater can form caves and sinkholes. Stalactites and stalagmites are mineral deposits. They build up in caves as water continues to drip.

In a relationship, it is essential to respect each other's personal boundaries. A girl may have private parts that, when touched, can make her feel uncomfortable, especially if it's without her consent.

As usual with Preminger, this is a well-crafted movie with a notable opening credits sequence and enlivened by a good cast that also includes Karl Malden (as Andrews' incumbent superior), Tom Tully (as Tierney's motor-mouth taxi driver dad) and Neville Brand (as Merrill's chief thug), with notable support also coming from Craig Stevens (as the slimy, wife-beating victim), Bert Freed (as Andrews' sympathetic partner) and Robert F. Nolan (as Andrews' stern outgoing superior).

Steve Robson. PUBLISHED:. 07:40 EST, 16 August 2013. |. UPDATED:. 07:41 EST, 16 August 2013. Battle: Tom Brown, 67, says he has been the victim of a 'relentless pursuit' by the Post Office in the past five years. A sub-postmaster accused of stealing £85,000 by the Post Office has won a five-year battle to clear his name. Tom Brown, 67, from South Stanley, County Durham, has been told he will face no further action after the company said it could not enter any evidence just months before he was due to appear in a civil court case. Police launched an investigation when it emerged there was a £85,426 shortfall at North Kenton Post Office in 2007, but after four years looking into the claim, they told him he would not face criminal charges. Mr Brown, who was given a certificate of valour by the Post Office in the mid-90s after fending off a knife-wielding robber, has always maintained the shortfall was the result of a glitch in the company's controversial Horizon computer system. It is claimed more than 100 people. across the country have been the subjects of false allegations by the Post Office as a. result of a computer error. A campaign group, the Justice For Sub-postmasters Alliance, run by Alan Bates, of Old Colwyn, Conwy, helped in Mr Brown's fight. A number have registered an interest in suing the Post Office over the false accusations. Despite police dropping the case, lawyers acting for The Post Office Ltd pursued two charges of false accounting against Mr Brown through the civil courts. But the company has said it no longer pursuing the case because it is 'not in the public interest' and a judge has recorded not-guilty verdicts. Mr Brown, a grandfather-of-three, says he is relieved but has criticised Post Office bosses for their 'relentless pursuit' over the past five years. He said: 'I've lost nearly £300,000 in property, lost my home, been declared bankrupt and had my name dragged through the mud. I knew there was something wrong in the shop and I thought somebody was taking money but I kept it quiet for six months. 'That's the biggest mistake I made. When the Post Office did an audit they found all this missing money and I was suspended. 'Without my salary I couldn't afford to pay the staff and I couldn't afford to pay the bills. I was made bankrupt. They wanted to search my house and they went through my car. I said to them, 'You won't find £85,000 in there\\".' Mr Brown lost his wife, Carole, to breast cancer in 2003 at the age of 57. The couple had worked together since 1981 when they bought the Chester Moor post office before taking control of a site on Colliery Row Post Office in Fence Houses. Problems: Mr Brown always maintained the £85,000 shortfall was due to a computer glitch. Mr Brown said: 'Because my wife was ill - they said she only had 18 months to live, but she survived for three years - we gave up the branch and moved into a new house. 'After she died, I started working in Finlays in North Kenton and eventually bought the site. 'I had a three-bedroom detached house in West Pelton and a flat across the road, which I rented out. 'When I was suspended I lost all that and I lost £50,000 a year in Post Office salaries. All the staff I've ever worked with in Newcastle think I stole £85,000. They've dragged my reputation through the dirt. 'When I was told that it was all over I was over the moon, I was absolutely elated. But the hardest thing is knowing that my wife and I worked for so many years, doing so much to try to make sure my family was secure.' Mr Brown has now entered into a 'mediation' period with Post Office bosses as he wants compensation for five years of 'torture'. North Durham MP Kevan Jones has championed Mr Brown's fight and raised his plight in Parliament. Last night Mr Jones told The Journal it was a 'scandal', stating: 'The way Tom has been treated is verging on cruel. 'Ministers must now act to ensure victims of these Post Office allegations get the compensation they deserve. I have written to ministers today and will be pursuing Tom's case very hard.' Backtrack: Mr Brown was months away from appearing at Newcastle Crown Court for the civil case before it was dropped. Last year the Post Office instructed a firm of forensic accountants, 2nd Sight Limited, to conduct an independent review of 10 existing cases raised by a number of MPs and the law firm Shoosmiths. About 100 sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses have registered an interest in suing Post Office Ltd over its Horizon computer system, which records financial transactions in branches across the UK. The Post Office has repeatedly denied there is a problem with the system, saying the claims have been made by a very small number of people. But Mr Jones criticised Business Minister Jo Swinson during a Parliamentary debate last month, saying a report had found there was scope for the Post Office 'to improve aspects of its support and training for sub-postmasters'. A Post Office Ltd spokeswoman said: 'Post Office Ltd has determined that in this case it is no longer in the public interest to prosecute.' She added: 'The Post Office is committed to supporting its people and improving the way we do so. The interim review published recently by independent investigators Second Sight makes it clear that the Horizon computer system and its supporting processes function effectively across our network. 'As the review notes, it is used by around 68,000 people in more than 11,500 branches, successfully processing more than six million transactions every day. The review underlines our cause for confidence in the overall system.' In relation to other cases, she said: 'We would not comment on other cases. However, cases are only prosecuted where they meet and continue to meet the requirements of the code for Crown Prosecutors. That code requires both an evidential test and a public interest test to be applied. The code also requires the prosecution to keep under review whether or not that test continues to be met.'","response":"Once upon a time there was a man named Tom Brown who worked at the Post Office. He was accused of stealing a lot of money which made him very sad. But after five years of proving he didn't do anything wrong, he was finally told that he was not guilty and everyone left him alone. It turns out that a computer program at the Post Office was having problems which caused Tom and other people to be blamed for stealing money. Tom is happy that he was able to clear his name but he wants the Post Office to make sure this doesn't happen again, so other people don't have to go through the same troubles."},{"question":"Here is a dialogue: Jason: Check out this dog singing Rihanna Walt: Dude, aren’t you at work? Jason: Yeah, so? Walt: Nothing, never mind, here’s a cat video in return: What were they talking about?","response":"Jason and Walt were engaged in a casual conversation where they were sharing entertaining and amusing animal videos with one another. Jason initiated the dialogue by mentioning a video that showcases a dog that appears to be singing along to a song by the popular singer, Rihanna. The tone of their conversation appears to be light-hearted and fun, with both of them exchanging humorous content with one another. Walt, seemingly either concerned or curious, inquires if Jason is currently at work. It is possible that Walt may think it is inappropriate for Jason to be watching or sharing such content while he should be focusing on his job. On the other hand, he might simply be amazed that Jason has the time to engage in leisurely activities while at work. Jason responds by acknowledging that he is indeed at work, but he seems unfazed by Walt's inquiry, implying that he does not see watching or sharing such videos as problematic during work hours. Jason's response could also suggest that he does not seriously consider the consequences of his actions or he simply may be taking a break during the day to unwind. Walt apparently decides not to pursue the matter further, as he dismisses it with a nonchalant statement. Instead, he reciprocates by sharing a cat video, effectively joining in on the lighthearted exchange of humor. This act of sharing another animal video indicates that Walt does not have any strong objections to what Jason is doing; rather, he submits to the playful nature of their interaction. In summary, Jason and Walt were discussing and exchanging amusing animal videos with each other. Despite a brief moment of questioning the appropriateness of engaging in such banter during work hours, they continued sharing the content for enjoyment and fun."},{"question":"Instructions: In this task, you are given an article. Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence. Input: The sealed vessel was part of a major Viking hoard found at an undisclosed location earlier this year. It was considered too delicate to open so Historic Scotland teamed up with Borders General Hospital. The Â£485,000 unit, normally used on patients, revealed brooches, ingots and beads inside. Richard Welander, head of collections with Historic Scotland, said: \\"When I saw the results I was reminded of the words of Sir Howard Carter when Tutankhamen's tomb was opened in 1922 - \\"I see wonderful things\\". \\"We are all so grateful to the Borders General Hospital for allowing us to forensically examine one of the key objects of the hoard. \\"As with human patients, we need to investigate in a non-invasive way before moving onto delicate surgery. \\"In this case, that will be the careful removal of the contents and the all-important conservation of these items.\\" Retired businessman Derek McLennan, 47, discovered the vessel among more than 100 artefacts on Church of Scotland land at an undisclosed site in Dumfries and Galloway. When the find was made public by Scotland's Treasure Trove Unit last month, it was described as \\"one of the most significant Viking hoards ever discovered in Scotland\\". But the small pot with a sealed lid fascinated experts who believed it contained more objects. They knew from its ornate exterior that it hailed from the west European Carolingian period between 780 and 900 AD but had no idea what treasures it contained. That is when Mr Welander made the call to Dr John Reid, consultant radiographer at Borders General Hospital, a keen amateur archaeologist and chairman of the Trimontium Trust in Melrose. He had previously used the CT (Computed Tomography) Scanner to supervise the scanning of the remains of a Roman soldier's head discovered at Trimontium, a former Roman camp near Melrose. After obtaining permission from hospital chiefs, Dr Reid supervised the scanning of the pot. He said: \\"The conservationists did not want to guddle about and compromise this precious object. \\"I would like to assure people that this work takes place outwith normal hours and in no way impedes the important work we do for our human patients. \\"The scanner is both rapid and accurate, with the ability to produce 120 visual slices and is accurate to within half a millimetre.\\" A short video of the pot being scanned at the hospital is currently available on YouTube under the title \\"Scanning Viking Hoard\\". Output:","response":"Part 1: Summarize the article Usage: The article discusses officials at Borders General Hospital using a CT scanner to non-invasively examine a major Viking hoard, revealing hidden brooches, ingots, and beads within a sealed vessel without damaging the delicate contents. This meets the criteria as it captures the main point of the article, which is the use of modern technology to investigate the Viking hoard. Part 2: Include the context and significance of the find Usage: One of the most significant Viking hoards ever discovered in Scotland, containing a sealed vessel with hidden brooches, ingots, and beads from the Carolingian period, was non-invasively examined using a CT scanner at Borders General Hospital. This meets the criteria by providing context on the discovery's importance and dating it to a specific historical period. Part 3: Incorporate the method and location of the examination Usage: A CT scanner at Borders General Hospital was used to non-invasively examine a major Viking hoard, one of Scotland's most significant finds, revealing hidden brooches, ingots, and beads within a sealed vessel.

We have the information that Doris spent 6 from the cookie jar, and Martha spent half as much as Doris. After that, there was 15 left in the cookie jar. Step 1: Determine how much Martha spent. Since Martha spent half as much as Doris, and Doris spent 6: Martha's spending = 0.5 * Doris's spending = 0.5 * 6 = 3 Step 2: Calculate the total amount spent by Doris and Martha. Total spending = Doris's spending + Martha's spending = 6 + 3 = 9 Step 3: Find out the initial amount in the cookie jar by adding the total spending with the remaining amount in the jar.

Options: - (A) insects - (B) a fish - (C) sensory neurons - (D) sweating - (E) Sasquatches - (F) peachleaf willow - (G) athletes - (H) protect them Think carefully first, then make a decision. My thoughts:","response":"Various organisms can adapt to cold temperatures, including some insects, fish, and plants. However, in the list of options you provided, these can be considered: (A) Insects: Some insects, such as the Arctic woolly bear moth and the Antarctic midge, can survive in extreme cold environments by producing substances like glycerol to keep their body fluids from freezing. They also undergo a process called diapause, which is a kind of hibernation, where their metabolic rate is reduced, allowing them to survive harsh conditions. (B) A fish: Some fish, like the Arctic icefish and the Antarctic notothenioid fishes, have evolved various mechanisms to adapt to cold temperatures. These include producing antifreeze proteins and glycoproteins to prevent ice crystal formation in their blood and body fluids, as well as specializing their metabolism and physiology for living in cold water. (F) Peachleaf willow: The Peachleaf willow (Salix amygdaloides) is a cold-tolerant tree found in North America. It has adapted to cold temperatures by being deciduous (losing its leaves in winter), producing buds that can withstand freezing temperatures, and having shallow root systems that help the trees to obtain water when the ground is frozen. Other options are not organisms, or the organisms mentioned are not specifically known for their cold adaptations. For instance, (C) sensory neurons are cells, athletes (G) are humans who may have some cold resistance due to training, and (E) Sasquatches are mythical creatures with no scientific evidence for their existence."},{"question":"Based on the premise \\"I kept hoping that John Cleese would appear out of nowhere, and say, in the high dudgeon of his Dead Parrot routine, 'They're dead!\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"I hoped John Cleese would appear and say \\"they're dead\\" because I think it is so funny. \\" is true (see options)?

The development came hours before President Donald Trump called off the highly anticipated meeting. The South Korean government welcomed the North's unilateral nuclear concession to help facilitate a broader agreement with the United States to completely end its nuclear weapons program in exchange for ending punishing sanctions and security guarantees. \\"We are hoping that this action will become the opportunity for complete denuclearization in the future,\\" South Korea Foreign Ministry spokesman Noh Kyu-duk said. However, while the closure of the nuclear test complex is a significant symbolic gesture, analysts are skeptical it will seriously inhibit the Kim Jong Un government's ability to carry out further nuclear tests in the future. \\"That renders the test site unusable, but not forever and it's not like North Korea has a shortage of mountains or people to make new tunnels,\\" said Jeffrey Lewis, the director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California, during an interview with Vice News. North Korea conducted all six of its nuclear tests at the Punggye-ri underground site that includes at least two extensive tunnel systems, according the 38 North website that monitors the North's nuclear activities. Each nuclear test conducted at the site was progressively more powerful, with the first bomb detonated in 2006 producing an estimated 1-2 kiloton yield, much less powerful than the 16-kiloton bomb the United States used on Hiroshima during World War II, and the last test in 2017 producing close to a 250-kiloton yield. There were reports that the last nuclear test in September of 2017 triggered a tunnel collapse rendering the site unusable, but analysts say there were still two other tunnels that could be used for future tests.

Observation is Sarah's stronger suit, but not Carrie because","response":"Carrie has always been more of an action-oriented individual. While Sarah is content to sit back and absorb every minute detail of the world around her, Carrie jumps in headfirst and tackles any challenge thrown her way. The two have been best friends since their childhood days, growing up together in their quaint suburban neighborhood. Sarah's contemplative nature and keen observational skills perfectly complement Carrie's spirited drive and tenacity. The duo often relies on their combined strengths to overcome any difficulties they may face. As they ventured into their next escapade, both Sarah and Carrie were prepared to face it with their unique skill-set. It was a hot summer day, and they decided to head to the old, reportedly haunted mansion, tucked away on the outskirts of town. The mansion had been the subject of numerous urban legends and ghost stories, many of which the girls had grown up hearing. As Carrie approached the crumbling facade, a fire of excitement in her eyes, she imagined the many secrets that lay within its depths, just waiting to be discovered. Sarah, on the other hand, cautiously surveyed the scene, trying to pick up any subtle cues that might hint at the mansion's history. While venturing through the dimly-lit rooms, Sarah noted the remnants of opulence that seemed to defy the passage of time. Her inquisitive mind craved to learn more, absorbing each little detail wearily: from the somber family portraits looming overhead, to the faded moth-eaten tapestries which adorned the decaying walls. Carrie, meanwhile, was up ahead, impatiently knocking on walls and floors, searching for hidden traps or secret passageways. Sarah's collection of observations became vital as they stumbled upon a hidden library filled with dusty tomes and cryptic manuscripts. Painstakingly, Sarah pieced together her initial findings with the information gleaned from the library. She concluded that the last scion of the family who inhabited the mansion had dabbled in the dark arts, leading to their ultimate destruction. A tragic tale, to be sure, but filled with more questions yet to be answered. Carrie, who had little tolerance for investigation, felt uneasy about their findings. However, she knew that her friend was onto something important and instinct struggled with curiosity. It was in this moment that Carrie and Sarah discovered something unsettling—a well-concealed trapdoor, hidden beneath the thick layer of dust. Behind the trapdoor lay a set of narrow stairs spiraling downwards into a darkness that seemed to swallow their flickering flashlight beams. They looked at each other—a mixture of apprehension and excitement in their eyes—as they prepared to face the unknown together. It was then that the synergy between Sarah's observational prowess and Carrie's intrepid spirit shone the brightest, for they knew they were diving into treacherous waters. Soon, they found themselves in a crypt-like chamber. The air was damp and cold, smelling vaguely of ancient decay. Sarah scanned the room, her eyes quickly trailing over an intricate mural depicting the family's demise. It was apparent that whatever force had brought them to ruin still haunted the walls. Carrie, unafraid, began searching for signs of this malevolent presence, determined to face it head-on. As they delved deeper into this world which time seemed to have forgotten, they found themselves on the brink of solving a century-old mystery. Alternately relying on Sarah's methodical prowess and Carrie's dauntless exploration, they unlocked the secrets hidden within the mansion. Ultimately, it was because of their unique bond—that potent combination of keen observation and unbridled courage—that Sarah and Carrie succeeded in laying to rest the tortured spirits which inhabited the abandoned mansion. A testament to the power of friendship, and the value of recognizing the strengths in each other, their tale has become a part of the town's folklore—an inspiring reminder that when we embrace our individual talents, there is no challenge that we cannot conquer together."},{"question":"Next question: who won the olympic mens figure skating gold medal?","response":"To answer this question, I will need to find out the latest Olympic Games' results as well as the specific event of men's figure skating.

Vegetation clearance, along with irrigation, causes serious issues. Irrigation increases the water table and mobilizes salts, and vegetation clearance allows it to come in contact with water habitats and vegetation. This stresses species not adapted to high salinity. High levels of salinity reduces water uptake in plants, by causing stomatal closure, reducing photosynthesis. Forests undergo decline in areas of high salinity and shallow groundwater depths because these conditions make them more susceptible to droughts. Forests undergo decline in areas of high salinity and shallow groundwater depths making them more susceptible to droughts. In the sixteenth century the State of Michigan had forests all over. But that has long been gone. Especially, in the state's northeast part the vegetation has been cleared in the twentieth century. Wooded areas were replaced by farm lands. All these farmlands were under heavy Irrigation. At one time, in the sixteenth century, plant species like elm and oak used to be plentiful. We still had some elms and oaks in the twentieth century, but they were not great many in number. Which century saw northeast Michigan's water table increased, sixteenth century or twentieth century? A:","response":"The twentieth century saw northeast Michigan's water table increase, due to the significant changes in land use during that time. In the sixteenth century, Michigan was covered in forests, with plant species like elm and oak being plentiful. However, by the twentieth century, vast areas of vegetation, particularly in the state's northeast region, were cleared, and wooded areas were replaced by farmlands. The introduction of agriculture, specifically farm lands, brought about the need for heavy irrigation to sustain crop growth. This irrigation played a crucial role in increasing the water table and mobilizing salts in the area. As a result, groundwater salinization became a prominent issue, affecting the buffering properties of the ecosystems. Vegetation clearance further exacerbated this problem by allowing the salinized water to come into contact with water habitats and vegetation, causing stress to species not adapted to high salinity levels. Irrigation and vegetation clearance in the twentieth century led to a variety of negative consequences for the environment, including reduced photosynthesis and water uptake in plants due to high salinity levels. Furthermore, forests in areas with high salinity and shallow groundwater depths experienced a decline, making them more susceptible to droughts. In summary, it was during the twentieth century when the water table in northeast Michigan increased, mainly due to vegetation clearance and the introduction of farmlands that required extensive irrigation for crop growth. The sixteenth century, by contrast, was characterized by a largely forested landscape, with abundant elm and oak trees, and a relatively stable water table."},{"question":"Read the article and select the best answer.

Grant was a general in the American Civil War and Eisenhower was a hero in the Second World War. It happened that they graduated from the same school--West Point Military Academy . One may be surprised to learn that both of them did not do well in the school. Eisenhower, for example, was once fined because he broke the rules of the school. The jobs of U.

Possible A: drowsiness, sleeping in, insomnia, exercise, pregnancy Why is \\"pregnancy\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","response":"Pregnancy is an answer aligned with human common sense for this question because it encompasses various biological and lifestyle changes experienced by pregnant individuals that can result in weight gain and going to bed early. During pregnancy, the body undergoes several changes that contribute to these factors: 1. Hormonal changes: Pregnancy hormones, such as progesterone, can cause fatigue and drowsiness, making pregnant individuals feel the need to go to bed early. 2. Weight gain: Weight gain is a natural part of pregnancy as the body is supporting not only the growing fetus, but also the increased blood volume, amniotic fluid, and growing placenta. The body also stores extra fat as energy reserves for labor, birth, and breastfeeding. 3. Energy consumption: The increased energy demand due to the growing fetus may cause pregnant individuals to feel exhausted and require more sleep than usual. Additionally, feelings of nausea and discomfort during pregnancy can make it difficult to maintain a regular sleep cycle. 4. Physical changes: As the pregnancy progresses, physical changes such as a growing belly, swollen legs, or back pain can make it uncomfortable to sleep, leading to an increased likelihood of going to bed early to find a comfortable sleep position. 5. Lifestyle adjustments: Pregnant individuals may also have to adjust their lifestyle or daily routines to accommodate for their changing bodies, including taking more breaks, resting more frequently, and prioritizing sleep. Considering these factors, \\"pregnancy\\" is a reasonable answer for the question, as it can explain both the weight gain and the tendency to go to bed early."},{"question":"Pick your answer from: (a). nervous about swimming (b). very sad (c). very funny Given those answer options, answer the question: Riley was washed away by the tide at the ocean beach that day. Given the context: How would Others feel as a result? A:","response":"Given the context provided, Riley was washed away by the tide at the ocean beach that day. This is a very concerning and alarming situation. Consequently, the most appropriate answer from the provided options would be (b) very sad. When someone is in danger or goes through a distressing experience like being washed away by the tide, it is natural for others who are aware of the situation to feel concerned and empathetic towards that person. People in this scenario might experience a range of emotions including disbelief, fear, and sadness. Friends and family members of Riley would be particularly impacted by these emotions as they have a close relationship with him. They would be concerned about Riley's safety and well-being, and might blame themselves for not taking enough precautionary measures to avoid this incident or be more vigilant in monitoring the situation. Moreover, others who are part of a community, such as lifeguards or beachgoers on the scene, might also feel sad when they witness or hear about someone being carried away by the tide. Lifeguards, for instance, might question their ability to protect swimmers and keep them safe, especially if it happened under their watch. Beachgoers would feel vulnerable and alarmed, realizing that the beach could pose potential dangers and that they too could face similar situations. Furthermore, this incident might provoke a broader conversation about beach safety and the need for more stringent precautionary measures to protect swimmers. People might advocate for better lifeguard training, public awareness campaigns, emergency response preparedness, or even physical barriers to ensure that incidents like this do not happen again. The emotions from the collective community in response to Riley's experience would likely influence the level of support and engagement in these discussions. In summary, given the context that Riley was washed away by the tide at the ocean beach, others would likely feel very sad in response to the event. This sadness would stem from concern for Riley's safety, as well as feelings of responsibility, vulnerability, and a desire to prevent future tragedies."},{"question":"How is \\"Client Service Approach\\" said in French?","response":"In French, the term \\"Client Service Approach\\" can be translated as \\"Approche de Service à la Clientèle\\".

It is regarded as the most probable place in the solar system to host alien life. And now Jupiter’s moon Europa has been found to have tectonic activity like Earth. It is also the first time this specific type of geological activity has been observed in the solar system other than on our planet. Scientists have found evidence of plate tectonics on Jupiter's moon Europa (pictured) – the first sign of this geologic activity on a solar system world other than Earth, raising hopes that life could one day be found there Less than a year ago, scientists discovered plumes of water vapour erupting from Jupiter's moon’s south polar region, so it may be possible for a robotic probe to sample Europa’s liquid water at a distance without landing on it. Although","response":"the presence of tectonic activity and water vapor plumes made Europa a fascinating target for further scientific exploration, the international community realized that any mission to the moon needed to be cautiously planned to avoid contamination of the potentially life-harboring environment. After years of research, development, and discussion, a collaborative mission between space agencies, including NASA, ESA, and others, was launched to explore Jupiter's enigmatic moon. Equipped with state-of-the-art technology, a robotic probe called \\"Europa Explorer\\" began its journey to the distant moon. The spacecraft was designed to study Europa's surface and subsurface from a distance and, if possible, collect ice samples ejected by the geysers without touching the moon's surface. After a long journey through the solar system, the Europa Explorer finally entered Jupiter's orbit. As it approached Europa, the high-resolution cameras aboard the spacecraft captured stunning images of the moon's icy surface, revealing the intricate patterns of cracked ice and tectonic features. Scientists back on Earth were thrilled by the data, as it not only confirmed the earlier findings but also hinted at the presence of a vast subsurface ocean beneath the moon's icy crust. Europa Explorer carefully positioned itself to fly through the plumes of water vapor erupting from Europa's south polar region, successfully collecting samples without contaminating the environment. The instruments onboard analyzed the samples and sent the data back to Earth. To the astonishment of scientists, the analysis revealed complex organic molecules and traces of hydrothermal activity, which are essential building blocks for life. Following this discovery, the space community dedicated itself to further exploring Europa, focusing on searching for direct evidence of extraterrestrial life. While the debate about whether to send human missions or advanced robotic probes continued, it was clear that Europa had opened a new frontier in the field of astrobiology. In the years to come, Europa's subsurface ocean would be explored further, leading to the eventual discovery of multicellular microorganisms and extremophiles thriving in the moon's hidden depths. This momentous find would cause a paradigm shift in our understanding of existence within the solar system, ushering in a new era of interplanetary research, cooperation, and, ultimately, the quest to unearth the origins of life beyond Earth."},{"question":"Definition: In this task, you're shown a three-part story, with a beginning, middle, and ending.

He was the Chief Minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014, and is the Member of Parliament for Varanasi. During Modi's second term the rhetoric of the government shifted from Hindutva to Gujarat's economic development. Modi curtailed the influence of Sangh Parivar organisations such as the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) and the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP), entrenched in the state after the decline of Ahmedabad's textile industry, and dropped Gordhan Zadafia (an ally of former Sangh co-worker and VHP state chief Praveen Togadia) from his cabinet. When the BKS staged a farmers' demonstration Modi ordered their eviction from state-provided houses, and his decision to demolish 200 illegal temples in Gandhinagar deepened the rift with the VHP. Sangh organisations were no longer consulted or informed in advance about Modi's administrative decisions. Nonetheless, Modi retained connections with some Hindu nationalists. Modi wrote a foreword to a textbook by Dinanath Batra released in 2014, which stated that ancient India possessed technologies including test-tube babies. Modi's relationship with Muslims continued to attract criticism. Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee (who asked Modi for tolerance in the aftermath of the 2002 Gujarat violence and supported his resignation as chief minister) distanced himself, reaching out to North Indian Muslims before the 2004 Lok Sabha elections. After the elections Vajpayee called the violence in Gujarat a reason for the BJP's electoral defeat and said it had been a mistake to leave Modi in office after the riots. Questions about Modi's relationship with Muslims were also raised by many Western nations during his tenure as chief minister. Modi was barred from entering the United States by the State Department, in accordance with the recommendations of the Commission on International Religious Freedom formed under the aegis of the International Religious Freedom Act, the only person denied a US visa under this law. The UK and the European Union refused to admit him because of what they saw as his role in the riots. As Modi rose to prominence in India, the UK and the EU lifted their bans in October 2012 and March 2013, respectively, and after his election as prime minister he was invited to Washington. During the run-up to the 2007 assembly elections and the 2009 general election, the BJP intensified its rhetoric on terrorism. In July 2006, Modi criticised Prime Minister Manmohan Singh \\" for his reluctance to revive anti-terror legislation\\" such as the 2002 Prevention of Terrorism Act. He asked the national government to allow states to invoke tougher laws in the wake of the 2006 Mumbai train bombings. In 2007 Modi authored Karmayog, a 101-page booklet discussing manual scavenging. In it, Modi argued that scavenging was a \\"spiritual experience\\" for Dalits. However, this book was not circulated that time because of the election code of conduct. After the November 2008 Mumbai attacks, Modi held a meeting to discuss the security of Gujarat's 1,600-kilometre (990 mi)-long coastline, resulting in government authorisation of 30 high-speed surveillance boats. In July 2007 Modi completed 2,063 consecutive days as chief minister of Gujarat, making him the longest-serving holder of that post, and the BJP won 122 of 182 state-assembly seats in that year's election. As Chief Minister, Modi favoured privatisation and small government, which was at odds with the philosophy of the RSS, usually described as anti-privatisation and anti-globalisation. His policies during his second term have been credited with reducing corruption in the state. He established financial and technology parks in Gujarat and during the 2007 Vibrant Gujarat summit, real-estate investment deals worth Rs6.6 trillion were signed. The governments led by Patel and Modi supported NGOs and communities in the creation of groundwater-conservation projects. By December 2008, 500,000 structures had been built, of which 113,738 were check dams, which helped recharge the aquifers beneath them. Sixty of the 112 tehsils which had depleted the water table in 2004 had regained their normal groundwater levels by 2010. As a result, the state's production of genetically modified cotton increased to become the largest in India. The boom in cotton production and its semi-arid land use led to Gujarat's agricultural sector growing at an average rate of 9.6 percent from 2001 to 2007. Public irrigation measures in central and southern Gujarat, such as the Sardar Sarovar Dam, were less successful. The Sardar Sarovar project only irrigated 4-6% of the area intended. Nonetheless, from 2001 to 2010 Gujarat recorded an agricultural growth rate of 10.97 percent - the highest of any state. However, sociologists have pointed out that the growth rate under the 1992-97 INC government was 12.9 percent. In 2008 Modi offered land in Gujarat to Tata Motors to set up a plant manufacturing the Nano after a popular agitation had forced the company to move out of West Bengal. Several other companies followed the Tata's to Gujarat. The Modi government finished the process of bringing electricity to every village in Gujarat that its predecessor had almost completed. Modi significantly changed the state's system of power distribution, greatly impacting farmers. Gujarat expanded the Jyotigram Yojana scheme, in which agricultural electricity was separated from other rural electricity; the agricultural electricity was rationed to fit scheduled irrigation demands, reducing its cost. Although early protests by farmers ended when those who benefited found that their electricity supply had stabilised, according to an assessment study corporations and large farmers benefited from the policy at the expense of small farmers and labourers. During the 2012 campaign, Modi attempted to identify himself with the state of Gujarat, a strategy similar to that used by Indira Gandhi during the Emergency, and projected himself as protecting Gujarat against persecution by the rest of India. Despite the BJP's shift away from explicit Hindutva, Modi's election campaign in 2007 and 2012 contained elements of Hindu nationalism. Modi only attended Hindu religious ceremonies, and had prominent associations with Hindu religious leaders. During his 2012 campaign he twice refused to wear articles of clothing gifted by Muslim leaders. He did, however, maintain relations with Dawoodi Bohra. His campaign included references to issues known to cause religious polarisation, including to Afzal Guru and the killing of Sohrabuddin Sheikh. The BJP did not nominate any Muslim candidates for the assembly election of 2012. He had published a Gujarati book titled Jyotipunj in 2008, containing profiles of various RSS leaders. The longest was of M. S. Golwalkar, under whose leadership the RSS expanded and whom Modi refers to as Pujniya Shri Guruji (\\"Guru worthy of worship\\"). According to The Economic Times, his intention was to explain the workings of the RSS to his readers and to reassure RSS members that he remained ideologically aligned with them. Modi authored eight other books, mostly containing short stories for children. While campaigning for the 2012 assembly elections, Modi made extensive use of holograms and other technologies allowing him to reach a large number of people, something he would repeat in the 2014 general election. In the 2012 Gujarat Legislative Assembly elections, Modi won the constituency of Maninagar by 86,373 votes over Shweta Bhatt, the INC candidate and wife of Sanjiv Bhatt. The BJP won 115 of the 182 seats, continuing its majority during his tenure and allowing the party to form the government (as it had in Gujarat since 1995). In later by-elections the BJP won four more assembly seats and two Lok Sabha seats held by the INC, although Modi did not campaign for its candidates. In 2013, the Wharton India Economic Forum (WIEF) at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania cancelled a keynote video-conference speech by Modi following protests by Indian-Americans. After his election as prime minister, Modi resigned as the chief minister and as an MLA from Maninagar on 21 May 2014. Anandiben Patel succeeded him as the chief minister.

He never takes prescription drugs. He doesn’t drink to excess. He’s into acupuncture and alternative medicine. But he was working two jobs—by day, he does quantitative analysis and project management for a venture-capital-backed B2B start-up; by night, he’s developing a proprietary high-­frequency trading system for a Wall Street start-up of his own—and what he needed was more time to work. So a few months ago, Borden ordered a three-week supply by mail. (“It was a piece of cake,” he says.) He popped his first pill—“the maximum suggested dose”—as soon as the package arrived, and within a few hours he started feeling a pleasant fuzziness. “Not fuzzy-headed,” he says, “but crisp. A crisp softness to it.” Soon he was experiencing a level of concentration he’d never imagined. “My senses sort of shifted to the visual, and my auditory sense went down. Sounds didn’t even register. It was like walking around on a winter day when it just snowed. It was very easy to stay visually focused.” Next came a head rush. “I sensed it was blood actually moving to the optic nerve. Your eyes start to feel very sort of engorged, and your awareness comes to the front of your face, which is kind of a freaky sensation. I would describe it as being very much like Adderall, but without the speediness.” Tasks that were usually soul-crushing now had his undivided attention. He spent hours fine-tuning ad campaigns for his new business, and his output wasn’t just faster and longer—it was better. “I didn’t take as many breaks; I didn’t get as frustrated; the stuff came out with fewer errors,” he says. “I never felt, Oh, let’s just get it done. I polished things.” As long as he kept taking the pill, his focus never wavered. “Time took on an entirely different sort of quality.” He was even happier. “There were some very potent anti-anxiety effects. Which was strange. I didn’t think I was an anxious person, but I guess I was.” Modafinil, which is marketed as Provigil in the United States, was first approved by the FDA in 1998 for the treatment of narcolepsy, but since then it’s become better known as a nootropic, a “smart drug,” especially among entrepreneurs. More recently, it has attracted traders like Borden who don’t just need a pick-me-up to get through a deadline; they need to be on, without a break, for months, even years at a time. Modafinil Is Like… Reviews From Online Commenters “A Prius compared to a Ferrari … profound yet at the same time subtle and not overwhelming.” “A digital camera that took perfectly recognizable pictures, but now had a few more megapixels.” “A borderline anxiety attack.” And that’s modafinil’s reputation. It is rumored to be the model for the fictional pills in the movie Limitless that allowed Bradley Cooper’s character to use 100 percent of his brain. Timothy Ferriss, author of the best-selling The 4-Hour Work Week, recently dished about its effects with modafinil fan Joe Rogan, the former host of Fear Factor, on Rogan’s popular podcast. Probably its biggest booster is Dave Asprey, founder of the Bulletproof Executive web forum, where he blogged about the drug’s powers (headline: “Why You Are Suffering From a Modafinil Deficiency”). Last summer, ABC News did a segment on Asprey in which he compared taking it to the scene in The Wizard of Oz where everything blossoms from black-and-white to color. Last month, modafinil’s penetration into the culture was confirmed by the American Medical Association’s journal Internal Medicine, which published a University of California, San Francisco, study reporting that U.S. prescriptions increased almost tenfold over the past decade. Far and away, most of those were for off-label use. In New York, Borden is hearing more chatter about it among traders and hedge-funders, though they don’t tend to boast about it in the same way as the tech guys. “There’s something, I think, about guys who write code for a living that makes them very interested in hacking things—finding shortcuts, stuff like that,” he says. “Whereas with guys on Wall Street, it’s more testosterone-fueled; it’s more just power through it.” In a conversation on WallStreet­Oasis.com titled “Viagra for the Brain,” one commenter gushed, “This is not like ­caffeine or 5 Hour Energy. This is the big leagues.” Unlike Ritalin or Adderall, modafinil isn’t an amphetamine and doesn’t flood the body with dopamine in the same way. For this reason, scientists originally believed it to be non-habit-forming, though some are beginning to doubt this claim. Users on message boards talk about how modafinil doesn’t so much speed them up as clear their minds. “Most of the drugs that people do in our society are things like alcohol that make you stupider instead of smarter,” mobile-software entrepreneur Jesse Law­ler said in a recent podcast about modafinil for his website SmartDrugSmarts.com. The entrepreneur Daniel Tenner used modafinil to launch his first company while still working for the consulting firm Accenture. “Every day,” he wrote on swombat.com, a site for entrepreneurs, “I would sleep at 11 p.m. sharp. I would then wake up at 4 a.m., work until 7 a.m., then nap for an hour before going to work at my day job. I then also worked weekends.” Of course, its ascendancy is also cause for some alarm. No scientist has conducted a study of its long-term effects on healthy brains yet. At the very least, doctors have warned that modafinil can bring about sleep deprivation (or, in the words of the Internal Medicine paper, “hypersensitivity reactions and neuropsychiatric adverse effects”). The modafinil moment has even prompted a secondary conversation among sociologists and economists about the anxiety of staying ahead in today’s competitive economy, and microeconomic predictions about a future in which everyone sleeps less: fewer mattress sales, more dollars spent at bars and nightclubs, more sex, and more children. For Borden, life on modafinil really did feel like a real-life (if somewhat toned-down) Limitless. Things get hairy for the character in the movie—there’s addiction and withdrawal and tragedy before the tidy Hollywood ending. The first downside Borden noticed was in line with the film: He couldn’t drink. “I went out for a drink, and then I had another drink. And because I was so energized and focused, I got drunk faster. It kind of freaked me out, because time would sort of fly by. I’d be here, and then I’d be here. Almost like mini-­blackouts. I very quickly cut out alcohol.” Then he ran into an even bigger problem: Skip a dose, and there would be hell to pay. “I really would feel it. It was sort of like being thrust into dirty, messy reality, as opposed to a clean, neatly organized place. It was like crashing, and I actually found what would happen is the anxiety that got dialed down on the way in, when you were coming off it, all of a sudden you went through the reverse. So I got incredibly anxious. Eventually that concerned me.” He stopped after three weeks. He says he’s more comfortable trying to get the same effect through meditation and, of all things, getting a good night’s sleep. He remains a little in awe of the pill, though. “It’s a great hack.” ||||| CONTEXT: Modafinil, a wake-promoting drug used to treat narcolepsy, is increasingly being used as a cognitive enhancer. Although initially launched as distinct from stimulants that increase extracellular dopamine by targeting dopamine transporters, recent preclinical studies suggest otherwise. OBJECTIVE: To measure the acute effects of modafinil at doses used therapeutically (200 mg and 400 mg given orally) on extracellular dopamine and on dopamine transporters in the male human brain. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Positron emission tomography with [(11)C]raclopride (D(2)/D(3) radioligand sensitive to changes in endogenous dopamine) and [(11)C]cocaine (dopamine transporter radioligand) was used to measure the effects of modafinil on extracellular dopamine and on dopamine transporters in 10 healthy male participants. The study took place over an 8-month period (2007-2008) at Brookhaven National Laboratory. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were changes in dopamine D(2)/D(3) receptor and dopamine transporter availability (measured by changes in binding potential) after modafinil when compared with after placebo. RESULTS: Modafinil decreased mean (SD) [(11)C]raclopride binding potential in caudate (6.1% [6.5%]; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5% to 10.8%; P = .02), putamen (6.7% [4.9%]; 95% CI, 3.2% to 10.3%; P = .002), and nucleus accumbens (19.4% [20%]; 95% CI, 5% to 35%; P = .02), reflecting increases in extracellular dopamine.

CONCLUSIONS: ||||| A:","response":"Modafinil, marketed as Provigil, was first approved by the FDA in 1998 for the treatment of narcolepsy. It has since gained popularity as a nootropic or \\"smart drug,\\" especially among entrepreneurs and traders who need to maintain focus and alertness for extended periods. Modafinil is different from stimulants like Ritalin or Adderall as it doesn't flood the body with dopamine in the same way. Users on message boards describe how modafinil clears their minds rather than speeding them up. However, there are concerns about its long-term effects on healthy brains, and it can lead to sleep deprivation, hypersensitivity reactions, and neuropsychiatric adverse effects."},{"question":"Do these mean the same? Deposed in 1776 by the revolutionary government of New Jersey , William was arrested at his home in Perth Amboy at the Proprietary House and imprisoned for a time . William was deposed in 1776 by the revolutionary government of Perth Amboy and arrested in his home in New Jersey , Proprietary House , and imprisoned for a time .","response":"No, the two statements do not mean exactly the same thing. Although there are similarities between the two statements, they differ in a few key ways. Let's examine each statement and break down the differences. Statement 1: Deposed in 1776 by the revolutionary government of New Jersey, William was arrested at his home in Perth Amboy at the Proprietary House and imprisoned for a time. In this statement, it is mentioned that William was deposed in 1776 by the revolutionary government of New Jersey. The action was taken by the government of the entire state of New Jersey. Additionally, the statement specifies that William was arrested at his home in Perth Amboy, which is a city within New Jersey. The specific location of his arrest is the Proprietary House. Finally, he was imprisoned for a time, which does not provide the exact duration of his imprisonment. Statement 2: William was deposed in 1776 by the revolutionary government of Perth Amboy and arrested in his home in New Jersey, Proprietary House, and imprisoned for a time. In this statement, William is also deposed in 1776, but instead of being deposed by the revolutionary government of New Jersey, he is deposed by the revolutionary government of Perth Amboy, a city within New Jersey. This implies that the action was local and taken by the government of the city rather than the state. William's arrest location is described as his home in New Jersey, Proprietary House, but it is not explicitly stated that this house is in Perth Amboy as it was mentioned in the first statement. Similar to the first statement, he was imprisoned for a time with no specific duration provided. So, while both statements convey that William was deposed in 1776 and arrested in his home, which is Proprietary House, and subsequently imprisoned for an unspecified period, they differ in who was responsible for his deposition. In the first statement, it is the revolutionary government of New Jersey (the state); in the second statement, it is the revolutionary government of Perth Amboy (the city). Moreover, the exact location of Proprietary House, in Perth Amboy, is not explicitly expressed in the second statement."},{"question":"How does the sentence end? The man moved the television from the nightstand to the dresser because the Available options: [+] nightstand was sturdy.. [+] dresser was sturdy..","response":"To determine the best ending for the sentence, let's examine the context. The man moved the television from one location to another. Now, we need to understand the reason behind this action. Option 1: \\"nightstand was sturdy.\\" Option 2: \\"dresser was sturdy.\\" Step 1: Evaluate the options In Option 1, it seems counterintuitive that the man would move the television if the nightstand was sturdy because a sturdy piece of furniture would provide a good foundation for the television. Therefore, this option is less likely to be the correct ending. In Option 2, the reason for moving the television could be a sturdier dresser, which would provide better support and balance, reducing the risk of the television falling or getting damaged. Step 2: Choose the most appropriate ending Based on the context of the sentence and the evaluation of the two options, Option 2 seems to provide a more logical reason for moving the television. So, the sentence ends with: \\"The man moved the television from the nightstand to the dresser because the dresser was sturdy.\\""},{"question":"Is the following a factual statement? \\"Disgust ed is a common emotion when watching a murder mystery on television.\\" Options: - yes - no Step-by-step reasoning process:","response":"1. Understand the statement: The statement suggests that disgust is a typical emotion felt while watching a murder mystery on television. 2. Consider the genre: Murder mysteries typically involve suspense, curiosity, and intrigue as viewers attempt to solve the mystery. 3.

Analyze the phrasing: The statement says \\"disgust is a common emotion\\" but does not claim it is the dominant or the only emotion experienced. 5. Weigh the factors: Disgust may be experienced by some viewers, but it may not be the primary emotion for all viewers of murder mysteries. 6.

Movie title: I Can Do Bad All by Myself Movie plot: The movie opens with a house number at the Indigo Club (Rock Steady by Aretha Franklin). Nightclub singer April (Taraji P. Henson) takes the stage with the microphone in one hand and a glass of liquor in the other.Although talented, it is clear April is troubled and heavily dependent upon liquor; and we soon discover why: April's personal life is in shambles. She is seeing a married man, Randy (Brian White), who announces he has child support problems, his wife is pregnant again and he basically detests kids. In addition, its clear Randy is very controlling but April has tolerated his controlling and abusive nature because he pays the bills.As April sings, we break away to Madeas (Tyler Perry) home. Madea has been awakened upstairs in the middle of the night to sounds of her downstairs window breaking. Madea goes to her brother Joe's (Tyler Perry again) room and tells him someone is breaking into the house. In a comic exchange, Joe begins to tell Madea she can handle the intruders and then remembers his weed is downstairs where the intruders are so he decides to help Madea by following her downstairs.Madea goes downstairs and discovers the intruders are three children: Jennifer (Hope Wilson), Manny (Kwesi Boakye) and Byron (Frederick Siglar). Although upset, Madea invites the children in to eat and discovers there are several problems. First, Jennifer is very angry and distrustful of people (important later), Manny is very friendly but very ill due to Diabetes and Byron doesn't speak (important later). Madea soon discovers the children are very hungry and theyve been alone for about a week. Their grandmother left one day and never returned. The children declare their mother has died and their next of kin is their Aunt April. Madea decides to take the children to their aunt, partially motivated by the desire to make sure they're taken care of and partially motivated by the desire to recover the sum of 300 for her broken window.Madea arrives at April's home with the children in tow. April sees the kids and... Answer:","response":"In the movie \\"I Can Do Bad All by Myself,\\" April's boyfriend is Randy, portrayed by actor Brian White. Randy is a married man, and he and April are having an affair. He is controlling and abusive, but April tolerates his behavior because he pays her bills. It's clear that April is troubled and heavily relies on alcohol, which worsens her personal life. The plot revolves around April, a nightclub singer, and her journey of personal transformation after her troubled family has resurfaced. The story takes a turn when Madea, played by Tyler Perry, finds three children breaking into her house. These children, Jennifer, Manny, and Byron, are April's nieces and nephew; they have been left alone for a week after their grandmother disappeared. Madea then takes the children to April, who is their next of kin. At first, April is not enthusiastic about caring for the children and continues her reckless lifestyle. However, as the movie progresses, April's character starts to transform with the help of Sandino, a Colombian immigrant staying at her house, played by Adam Rodriguez. Sandino is not initially April's boyfriend, but through their interactions, their relationship develops. Sandino proves to be a positive influence on April's life, ultimately leading her to confront her demons and start living a healthier, more responsible life. Throughout the film, April learns to face her own issues while taking care of her family. Eventually, April ends her relationship with Randy and deepens her connection with Sandino, who becomes her new love interest. In summary, when asked about April's boyfriend, it's essential to differentiate between her initial boyfriend, Randy, the problematic and married man with whom she begins the story, and Sandino, the loving and supportive partner she eventually forms a meaningful relationship with as the film progresses. The movie \\"I Can Do Bad All by Myself\\" showcases April's personal growth and transformation, leading her away from her toxic relationship with Randy and towards a healthier, more fulfilling one with Sandino."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In this task you will be given a claim and a perspective.

Understand the given claim: The claim states that the European Union (EU) should considerably decrease the amount of money it spends on subsidies for agricultural production. 2. Analyze the provided perspective: The perspective provided is \\"Farmers can't survive.\\" This implies that without sufficient subsidies, it would be challenging for farmers to maintain their businesses and livelihoods. 3. Determine if the perspective supports or undermines the claim: In this step, you need to analyze whether the given perspective strengthens the claim (that the EU should reduce agricultural subsidies), or weakens it (suggesting that the EU should maintain or even increase the subsidies). 4. Consider if the perspective could convince someone with a different view: Think about whether the given perspective could sway someone with an opposing opinion on the matter. If it could, the perspective is supporting the claim; if not, it is undermining the claim.

By the end of the 1930s vinyl's advantages of light weight, relative unbreakability and low surface noise had made it the material of choice for prerecorded radio programming and other critical applications. When it came to ordinary 78 rpm records, however, the much higher cost of the raw material, as well as its vulnerability to the heavy pickups and crudely mass-produced steel needles still commonly used in home record players, made its general substitution for shellac impractical at that time. During the Second World War, the United States Armed Forces produced thousands of 12-inch vinyl 78 rpm V-Discs for use by the troops overseas. After the war, the wider use of vinyl became more practical as new record players with relatively lightweight crystal pickups and precision-ground styli made of sapphire or an exotic osmium alloy proliferated. In late 1945, RCA Victor began offering special transparent red vinyl De Luxe pressings of some classical 78s, at a de luxe price. Later, Decca Records introduced vinyl Deccalite 78s, while other record companies came up with vinyl concoctions such as Metrolite, Merco Plastic and Sav-o-flex, but these were mainly used to produce \\"unbreakable\\" children's records and special thin vinyl DJ pressings for shipment to radio stations.\\", answer the following question.

Choose a subject: I will choose \\"el gato\\" (the cat) as the subject of my sentence. 2. Choose a verb: I will choose \\"comer\\" (to eat) as the main action in my sentence. 3. Conjugate the verb: Since \\"el gato\\" is a singular noun, I need to conjugate the verb \\"comer\\" in the third person singular form of the present tense, which is \\"come\\" (eats). 4. Add extra information: I will add \\"pescado\\" (fish) as the object of the verb \\"comer,\\" so the sentence will describe what the cat is eating.

Here is a detailed explanation of the entire process, culminating in this final step: 1. Over 99% of the exocrine pancreas cells produce digestive juices, which primarily aid in breaking down food for nutrient absorption. 2. These cells secrete digestive juices 'externally' into the small intestine through a duct system. 3. The digestive juices contain enzymes, such as lipases, proteases, and carbohydrases, that break down fats, proteins, and carbohydrates, respectively. 4. The juices flow from the pancreas through an excretory duct - the pancreatic duct - and enter the small intestine at the ampulla of Vater, where they mix with bile from the liver and gallbladder. The combined juices contribute to the efficient digestion of food. 5. Once the food is broken down into smaller molecules in the small intestine, the nutrients are absorbed into the bloodstream. This causes blood sugar levels to rise, especially after a meal. 6. When blood sugar levels increase, the pancreas releases insulin, a hormone produced by the endocrine portion of the pancreas, specifically the beta cells of the islets of Langerhans. 7. Insulin helps regulate blood sugar levels by promoting the uptake of glucose (sugar) into cells, especially in the liver and muscles. This process drives cells to use glucose for producing energy or storing it as glycogen for future use. Consequently, blood sugar levels decrease and maintain a healthy balance. In summary, following the production, secretion, and action of digestive juices, the final step is the release of insulin in response to elevated blood sugar levels, ultimately helping regulate glucose uptake and maintain healthy blood sugar levels."},{"question":"Standoff: Goerge Pickering, pictured, allegedly threatened to kill a nurse. A distraught father who caused a four-hour standoff with police in a Texas hospital allegedly pointed his gun at a nurse and yelled 'I'll kill all of y'all'. Police said George Pickering, 57, made the threats from a hospital room after becoming inconsolable over the treatment of his son - a patient in critical care at Tomball Regional Hospital, near Houston. Armed police and a SWAT team descended on the medical center - and eventually convinced Pickering to surrender after a four-hour standoff on Saturday night. Pickering was charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and is being held on a 30,000 bond, a statement from the Tomball Police department said. Detectives said Pickering was in the room with his son and family, waited for a nurse to come, then aimed his 9mm pistol at her. He then allegedly barricaded the room and threatened to kill anybody who came in. At the start of the confrontation, another of Pickering's sons, who was with him in the hospital room, allegedly wrested the gun away from him and handed it to police. Standoff: George Pickering, 57, allegedly threatened to kill a nurse with his pistol at Tomball Regional Hospital, sparking a police standoff. Response: Police and a SWAT team arrived at the hospital. Pickering reportedly had one gun taken from him, but said he had a second. Pickering then allegedly said, 'You don't think that's the only weapon I have?', prompting fears of a second gun and causing the lengthy showdown with police. But when he gave himself up, police found that he was not in fact armed. Early reports stated that Pickering had taken two hostages, but law enforcement later said there were no captives. A spokesman for the Tomball police department said Picerking fell ill during the standoff and was treated in the hospital overnight - and was still there Sunday afternoon. He does not yet have an attorney. Tense: Pickering was said to be distraught over the condition of his son - a critical care patient.

Solve 3098*k - 3128*k + 180 = 0 for k.","response":"To solve the given equation, 3098*k - 3128*k + 180 = 0 for k, let's first simplify the equation by combining like terms. Step 1: Combine like terms The like terms in the equation are the terms with the variable k. Combine 3098*k and -3128*k: (3098 - 3128)*k = -30*k Now, the simplified equation is: -30*k + 180 = 0 Step 2: Isolate the variable k To isolate k, let's first move the constant term to the other side of the equation by subtracting 180 from both sides: -30*k + 180 - 180 = 0 - 180 -30*k = -180 Now, we have: -30*k = -180 Step 3: Solve for k To solve for k, divide both sides of the equation by -30: (-30*k) / (-30) = (-180) / (-30) k = 6 So, the solution for the given equation 3098*k - 3128*k + 180 = 0 is k = 6."},{"question":"Answer based on context: In September and October 1868, two notable actions happened with Troops H & I under the command of Brevet Lieutenant Colonel Louis H. Carpenter. The first was the rescue of Lieutenant Colonel G. A. Forsyth whose small party of 48 white scouts, was attacked and \\"corralled\\" by a force of about 700 Native American Indians on a sand island up the North Fork of the Republican River; this action became the Battle of Beecher Island. The second was two weeks after Carpenter had returned to Fort Wallace with the survivors of Forsyth's command. Troops H and I of the 10th Cavalry sallied forth for an escort and supply to the 5th Cavalry near Beaver Creek. Near there Carpenter combined command was attacked by a force of about 500 Indians. After a running fight and defensible stand the \\"hostiles\\" retreated. Carpenter would later receive the Medal of Honor for these two actions. For the next eight years, the 10th was stationed at numerous forts throughout Kansas and Indian Territory , including Fort Gibson starting in 1872. They provided guards for workers of the Kansas and Pacific Railroad, strung miles of new telegraph lines, and to a large extent built Fort Sill. Throughout this period, they were constantly patrolling the reservations and engaging \\"hostiles\\" in an attempt to prevent Indian raids into Texas. How many more Native American Indians were there than white scouts on the sand island?","response":"Alright, imagine there were 48 white scouts and about 700 Native American Indians on the sand island during the battle. To find out how many more Native American Indians there were, we can subtract the number of white scouts from the number of Native American Indians. So, 700 Native American Indians minus 48 white scouts equals 652 more Native American Indians than white scouts on the sand island during the battle."},{"question":"Article: Big anniversaries are a great time to reflect on how your organization got started and how it has since developed.

Input: Passage: Maurice had to continue the war against the Persians. In 586 his troops defeated them at the Battle of Solachon south of Dara. In 588, a mutiny by unpaid Byzantine troops against their new commander, Priscus, seemed to offer the Sassanids a chance for a breakthrough, but the mutineers themselves repulsed the ensuing Persian offensive. Later in the year they secured a major victory before Martyropolis. The Sassanid commander, Maruzas, was killed, several of the Persian leaders were captured along with 3,000 other prisoners, and only a thousand men survived to reach refuge at Nisibis. The Byzantines secured much booty, including the Persian battle standards, and sent them, along with Maruzas' head, to Maurice in Constantinople. In 590 two Parthian brothers, Vistahm and Vinduyih, overthrew King Hormizd IV and made the latter's son, Prince Khosrau II, the new King. The former Persian commander-in-chief, Bahram Chobin, who had rebelled against Hormizd IV, claimed the throne for himself and defeated Khosrau. Khosrau and the two Parthians fled to the Byzantine court. Although the Senate unanimously advised against it, Maurice helped Khosrau regain his throne with an army of 35,000 men. In 591 the combined Byzantine-Persian army under generals John Mystacon and Narses defeated Bahram Chobin's forces near Ganzak at the Battle of Blarathon. The victory was decisive; Maurice finally brought the war to a successful conclusion with the re-accession of Khosrau.

Once the eruptions had ceased, wave erosion rapidly wore the island away, and it disappeared beneath the waves on 24 October.During December 1965, more submarine activity occurred 0.9 km (0.56 mi) southwest of Surtsey, and another island was formed. It was named Jólnir, and over the following eight months it appeared and disappeared several times, as wave erosion and volcanic activity alternated in dominance. Activity at Jólnir was much weaker than the activity at the main vent, and even weaker than that seen at Syrtlingur, but the island eventually grew to a maximum size of 70 m (230 ft) in height, covering an area of 0.3 km2 (0.12 sq mi), during July and early August 1966. Like Syrtlingur, though, after activity ceased on 8 August 1966, it was rapidly eroded, and dropped below sea level during October 1966.Effusive eruptions on the main island returned on 19 August 1966, with fresh lava flows giving it further resistance to erosion. The eruption rate diminished steadily, though, and on 5 June 1967, the eruption ended. The volcano has been dormant ever since. The total volume of lava emitted during the three-and-a-half-year eruption was about one cubic kilometre (0.24 cu mi), and the island's highest point was 174 metres (571 feet) above sea level at that time.Since the end of the eruption, erosion has seen the island diminish in size.

You have to generate an answer to the question based on the information present in the context. Context: Compared with standard donors, kidneys recovered from donors after cardiac death (DCD) exhibit higher rates of delayed graft function (DGF), and DCD livers demonstrate higher rates of biliary ischemia, graft loss, and worse patient survival. Current practice limits the use of these organs based on time from donor extubation to asystole, but data to support this is incomplete. We hypothesized that donor postextubation parameters, including duration and severity of hemodynamic instability or hypoxia might be a better predictor of subsequent graft function.', 'We performed a retrospective examination of the New England Organ Bank DCD database, concentrating on donor factors including vital signs after withdrawal of support.', 'Prolonged, severe hypotension in the postextubation period was a better predictor of subsequent organ function that time from extubation to asystole. For DCD kidneys, this manifested as a trend toward increased DGF. For DCD livers, this manifested as increased rates of poor outcomes. Maximizing the predictive value of this test in the liver cohort suggested that greater than 15 min between the time when the donor systolic blood pressure drops below 50 mm Hg and flush correlates with increased rates of diffuse biliary ischemia, graft loss, or death.

Choose your answer from: [a]. unacceptable; [b]. acceptable;...I think the answer is","response":"[b]. acceptable. As an AI language model, I can provide a detailed explanation for my choice. Linguistically, the acceptability of a sentence is determined by various factors, including syntax, semantics, and sociolinguistic appropriateness. The sentence, \\"The drooling dog kissed the big boy,\\" appears to meet these criteria. Syntax: The sentence follows the standard syntactic rules of English. It has a clearly identifiable subject (\\"The drooling dog\\"), verb (\\"kissed\\"), and object (\\"the big boy\\"). The sentence is structurally sound, with the subject-verb-object (SVO) word order commonly used in English sentences. Additionally, the adjectives (\\"drooling\\" and \\"big\\") are appropriately placed before the nouns they modify (\\"dog\\" and \\"boy\\"). Semantics: Semantically, the sentence is also acceptable. Each word in the sentence carries meaning that contributes to the overall meaning of the sentence. While \\"kissed\\" is an action typically associated with humans, it can be understood metaphorically in the context of a dog's affectionate interaction with a person. This might include licking or nuzzling, which are common ways for dogs to express their affection. The use of \\"kissed\\" in this context aligns with the common understanding of interaction between a dog and a human. Sociolinguistic Appropriateness: The sentence also appears to be sociolinguistically appropriate. It does not contain any offensive or controversial language and is unlikely to be offensive or problematic in most social contexts. The sentence portrays a benign, affectionate interaction between a dog and a child, which is generally considered a positive, acceptable image. In conclusion, a linguist would likely rate the sentence \\"The drooling dog kissed the big boy\\" as linguistically acceptable, as it follows the proper syntax, maintains semantic coherence, and is sociolinguistically appropriate."},{"question":"Jesse made her decision and ruled that it was okay to drop out from school and start a new business.

The Hebrides generally lack the biodiversity of mainland Britain, but like most of the larger islands, Skye still has a wide variety of species. Observing the abundance of game birds Martin wrote: There is plenty of land and water fowl in this isle—as hawks, eagles of two kinds (the one grey and of a larger size, the other much less and black, but more destructive to young cattle), black cock, heath-hen, plovers, pigeons, wild geese, ptarmigan, and cranes. Of this latter sort I have seen sixty on the shore in a flock together. The sea fowls are malls of all kinds—coulterneb, guillemot, sea cormorant, &c. The natives observe that the latter, if perfectly black, makes no good broth, nor is its flesh worth eating; but that a cormorant, which hath any white feathers or down, makes good broth, and the flesh of it is good food; and the broth is usually drunk by nurses to increase their milk. Similarly, Samuel Johnson noted that: At the tables where a stranger is received, neither plenty nor delicacy is wanting. A tract of land so thinly inhabited, must have much wild-fowl; and I scarcely remember to have seen a dinner without them. The moor-game is every where to be had. That the sea abounds with fish, needs not be told, for it supplies a great part of Europe. The Isle of Sky has stags and roebucks, but no hares. They sell very numerous droves of oxen yearly to England, and therefore cannot be supposed to want beef at home. Sheep and goats are in great numbers, and they have the common domestic fowls.\\" In the modern era avian life includes the corncrake, red-throated diver, kittiwake, tystie, Atlantic puffin, goldeneye and golden eagle.

Step 1: Analyze the context and meaning of each sentence (1) No human situation is simple. In this sentence, the word \\"situation\\" refers to a circumstance or set of conditions affecting an individual or group of people. It suggests that, when it comes to human affairs, things are often complex and multifaceted. (2) The dangerous situation developed suddenly. Here, the word \\"situation\\" is also referring to a circumstance or set of conditions, but specifically one that is dangerous. The sentence implies that this hazardous context came into being abruptly. Step 2: Compare the meanings In both sentences, the word \\"situation\\" refers to a circumstance or set of conditions affecting people. While the specific focus and scope of the situations may differ (i.e., one is about human affairs in general, and the other concerns a dangerous context), the overall meaning of the word \\"situation\\" remains the same in both cases—a set of conditions or circumstances.

Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","response":"The hypothesis that \\"The guys appeal a lot\\" does seem to be entailed by the premise, as it emphasizes the appeal process and the waiting process as causes of aggravation. However, the premise does not necessarily quantify how much the guys appeal, only mentioning that they spend years in the waiting process. The premise conveys a situation in which the \\"guys\\" face a long and potentially arduous process of waiting, which could involve numerous appeals and is believed to be a major source of frustration. It can be inferred that this drawn-out process, characterized by the extended appeal and waiting period, seems to contribute to the aggravation experienced by those involved. However, despite the hypothesis being aligned with the premise to some extent, there are a few considerations needed to understand the relationship between the two fully. The premise is more focused on the duration and aggravation of the waiting process, while the hypothesis specifically claims that the guys appeal a lot. Although the extended waiting period mentioned in the premise implies that numerous appeals might be taking place, it does not directly state that these appeals are frequent or excessive. Furthermore, it may be essential to consider the premise's context, as it may not be apparent whether the aggravation comes solely from the appeal process or if it's derived from other external factors as well. Notwithstanding these limitations, the hypothesis does seem to be implied by the premise, drawing on the prolonged timeframe and frustration experienced by those involved in the appeal and waiting processes. In conclusion, while the hypothesis \\"The guys appeal a lot\\" is not explicitly stated within the premise, it can be reasonably inferred from the mention of the long and aggravating waiting process with presumed multiple appeals. However, the exact frequency of appeals is not clearly defined in the premise and might warrant additional context or information to further substantiate and strengthen the connection between the premise and the hypothesis."},{"question":"I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who is left to his thoughts? ?

The next scene is back home in England, where Gwen meets with the apparently Reverend Alan Bax for a job interview. We discover that Gwen suffered a nervous breakdown from whatever she experienced at the hand of the rebels when the school was attacked. Alan is impressed by Gwen and hires her to be the new head teacher at the small private school he and his sister, well-known journalist Stephanie Bax, run for the local children in the village of Heddaby.

Ice ocean had few submarine volcanoes, while Tropical ocean had thousands of active volcanoes on the ocean floor. Which ocean showed less discoloration of water because of volcanic gases? The answer to this question is:","response":"The Ice Ocean showed less discoloration of water because of volcanic gases compared to the Tropical Ocean. This difference can be attributed to the number and activity levels of the submarine volcanoes present in each ocean. In the Ice Ocean, there are only a few submarine volcanoes, which means fewer instances where volcanic gases can be released into the ocean water. In contrast, the Tropical Ocean has thousands of active volcanoes on the ocean floor, increasing the likelihood of volcanic gas emissions and their subsequent interaction with the ocean water. These gases, which often include sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen sulfide, can chemically react with water, affecting its color over areas close to submarine volcanic activity. Additionally, the colder temperature of the Ice Ocean may help dissolve the volcanic gases more efficiently, making the gases less likely to discolor the water. Conversely, warmer water in the Tropical Ocean may not dissolve volcanic gases as efficiently, which could result in the higher concentration of gases in the water and increase their potential to cause discoloration."},{"question":"Question: Who plays Steve Jobs?

Jobs is trying to convey his idea that \\"We're creating a completely new consciousness.\\" Scott is more concerned with the technical aspects of the commercial. Next in 1997 with Jobs, returning to Apple, and announcing a new deal with Microsoft at the 1997 Macworld Expo. His partner, Steve Wozniak or \\"WOZ\\" (Joey Slotnick), is introduced as one of the two central narrators of the story. Wozniak notes to the audience the resemblance between Big Brother and the image of Bill Gates (Anthony Michael Hall) on the screen behind Jobs during this announcement. Asking how they \\"got from there to here,\\" the film turns to flashbacks of his youth with Jobs, prior to the forming of Apple. The earliest flashback is in 1971 and takes place on the U.C. Berkeley campus during the period of the student anti-war movements. Teenagers Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak are shown caught on the campus during a riot between students and police. They flee and after finding safety, Jobs states to Wozniak, \\"Those guys think they're revolutionaries.

Options: - restlessness - starting early - tiredness - feeling tired - bloodshot eyes. Explanation:","response":"Bloodshot eyes is the correct answer to the statement \\"Getting up early was new for her, she needed some drops to clear up her what?\\" because it refers to a physical symptom that can be treated with eye drops. Bloodshot eyes are a common result of lack of sleep, eye strain, or irritation, and they appear red due to the dilation of blood vessels in the whites of the eyes. The other options, such as restlessness, starting early, tiredness, and feeling tired, are all related to a general sense of fatigue, but do not specifically refer to a symptom that can be treated with eye drops. In this context, bloodshot eyes are the most appropriate answer because they are directly related to the effects of getting up early and can be alleviated with the use of eye drops.

Carolyn Jones argues that the dog represents prejudice within the town of Maycomb, and Atticus, who waits on a deserted street to shoot the dog, must fight against the town's racism without help from other white citizens. He is also alone when he faces a group intending to lynch Tom Robinson and once more in the courthouse during Tom's trial. Lee even uses dreamlike imagery from the mad dog incident to describe some of the courtroom scenes. Jones writes, \\"[t]he real mad dog in Maycomb is the racism that denies the humanity of Tom Robinson .... When Atticus makes his summation to the jury, he literally bares himself to the jury's and the town's anger.\\" Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What is Atticus shooting the rabid dog symbolic of?","response":"Atticus shooting the rabid dog is symbolic of his fight against racial prejudice and injustice in the town of Maycomb. In the novel, the rabid dog represents the harmful and uncontrollable spread of racism, much like how a rabid dog's bite can transmit its deadly disease. By taking on the responsibility to shoot the dog, Atticus demonstrates his moral courage and willingness to confront and eradicate the town's deeply-rooted racism, even though it is not his designated role as a lawyer. Atticus's position as the sole person willing to step up and deal with the rabid dog highlights the lack of support he receives from the majority of white citizens in Maycomb, who passively or actively contribute to the racial injustice. The dog’s presence on a deserted street further emphasizes the loneliness and isolation Atticus faces in his battle against racism. Additionally, the connection between the mad dog incident and the courtroom scenes indicates that the trial of Tom Robinson is another arena where Atticus confronts the rampant racism in Maycomb. The dreamlike imagery used by Harper Lee serves to link both situations and emphasize how the prejudice operating in town is destructive and needs to be confronted and halted, much like the rabid dog. In conclusion, Atticus shooting the rabid dog is symbolic of his courageous stand against racial prejudice and his unwavering determination to address and eradicate the town's racism, in spite of being surrounded by a community that is largely unwilling to support or join him in this fight."},{"question":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Context: The classic Key West-style house just off Fleming looked much like the rest of the residences on the block - two-story wooden frame walls and peaked roofs with shallow porches nearly butting up against the sidewalk. Chloe's rusting blue Vespa was tucked away beside the house, in the narrow space separating it from the neighbors. To anyone walking by outside, everything looked quiet and peaceful. Inside, Chloe was pissed. Everything had been going great and then those stupid fuckers had decided to show up a week early, forcing her to scramble to pack a week's work into a single day. She wore a black bandana wrapped around her head, covering her buzz cut pink hair. Numerous smudges of dirt on her cheeks and the tip of her nose testified to the heavy-duty cleaning she'd been doing for the past five hours. She wore loose fitting shorts and a tight-fitting tank top that had once been white. In her bare feet she pushed a mop across the hardwood floors, grumbling to herself. She heard the door open and looked up to see Paul standing in the doorway. Even though it wasn't his fault, she glared at him as he came in. As much as Chloe liked a clean house, she hated housework, and this wasn't even her house. This particular space was sparsely decorated with just a few worn pieces of furniture and some bad condo art on the walls. After six months of being sealed up tight with the air conditioner off, it smelled of dust and mildew and needed a good airing out. \\"What are you doing?\\" asked Paul, closing the door behind him. \\"Mopping,\\" she said, her voice flat. \\"Right.

Marshall and his entourage, including his wife Grace (Wendy Crewson) and daughter Alice (Liesel Matthews), and several of his Cabinet and advisers, prepare to return to the United States on Air Force One. In addition, a number of members of the press corps have been invited aboard, including Russian terrorists and Radek loyalists disguised as journalists led by Ivan Korshunov (Gary Oldman). After takeoff, Secret Service agent Gibbs (Xander Berkeley), who has been a mole, enables Korshunov and his men to obtain weapons and storm the plane, killing many of the other agents and military personnel before taking the civilians hostage. Marshall is raced to an escape pod in the cargo hold while pursued by Korshunov's men but they are too late to capture him as the pod is ejected. Instead, Korshunov storms the cockpit and prevents the plane from making an emergency landing at Ramstein Air Force Base in Germany, and secures Grace and Alice separately from the other hostages. Several F-15s escort Air Force One as Korshunov has it piloted towards Radek-loyal airspace. Unknown to Korshunov, Marshall, a Vietnam War veteran and Medal of Honor recipient, has remained hidden in the cargo hold instead of using the pod and begins to observe the loyalists using his military training.

Secondly, the specific areas of dissatisfaction are also highlighted; the child is more engaged with the on/off button and cartridge insertion/removal than with the main features supposedly providing entertainment, such as the sounds and sights.

To iron the wax out of a wax silk painting. Available options: 1. Place a plastic bag over the painting and carefully iron the wax until it sticks to the plastic.. 2. Place a paper towel or newspaper over the painting and carefully iron the wax until it sticks to the paper..","response":"To iron the wax out of a wax silk painting, you have two available options: Option 1: Place a plastic bag over the painting and carefully iron the wax until it sticks to the plastic Steps for this option are as follows: 1. Prepare your working area: Set up a solid, flat, heat-resistant surface, preferably an ironing board, to place the painting on. Keep your iron nearby, with easy access to a power outlet, and make sure it's preheated to a low to medium heat. 2. Clean the painting: Gently dust off any dirt, lint, or debris from the painting using a clean, dry cloth. 3. Place a plastic bag over the painting: Choose a transparent plastic bag, making sure it is free from any print or texture. Lay the bag flat over the painting, ensuring that it fully covers the waxed areas. 4. Iron the painting: Begin to iron the painting, using gentle, even pressure, and moving the iron in slow, circular motions. As the wax melts and transfers to the plastic, you will notice the color of the plastic becoming cloudy, signaling the progress of the wax removal. 5. Check for wax transfer: Periodically lift the plastic bag to assess the effectiveness of the wax transfer. If it appears that all the wax has been removed from the painting, allow the silk and plastic to cool before separating them. 6. Additional ironing sessions: If wax still remains on the painting, repeat steps 3-5 with a new section of the plastic bag, or use a new bag altogether. Option 2: Place a paper towel or newspaper over the painting and carefully iron the wax until it sticks to the paper Steps for this option are as follows: 1. Prepare your working area: Set up a solid, flat, heat-resistant surface, like an ironing board, to place the painting on. Keep your iron nearby, with easy access to a power outlet, and make sure it's preheated to a low to medium heat. 2. Clean the painting: Gently dust off any dirt, lint, or debris from the painting using a clean, dry cloth. 3. Place a paper towel or newspaper over the painting: Choose either a paper towel or a piece of newspaper large enough to fully cover the waxed areas of the painting. Lay it flat over the painting, ensuring it is smooth and wrinkle-free. 4. Iron the painting: Begin to iron the painting, applying gentle, even pressure, and moving the iron in slow, circular motions. The wax will melt and transfer to the paper, which will become visibly darker in color as it absorbs the wax. 5. Check for wax transfer: Periodically lift the paper to assess the effectiveness of the wax transfer. If it appears that all the wax has been removed from the painting, allow the silk and paper to cool before separating them. 6. Additional ironing sessions: If wax still remains on the painting, repeat steps 3-5 with a fresh section of the paper towel or newspaper. Those are the detailed steps for both methods to iron the wax out of a wax silk painting. Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages, so select the option that best suits your needs and comfort level. Whichever method you choose, remember to practice patience and care when handling and ironing the painting to preserve its original quality."},{"question":"Question: What key details about dave kincaid can be extracted from the following bio?

Plus, the Eagles were dealing with injuries on defense to S Rodney McLeod, CB Ronald Darby and backup S Corey Graham leaving Malcolm Jenkins and Chris Maragos the only healthy safeties. Despite all of the setbacks, The Eagles hosted the 0-2 Giants who have only scored 13 points through the first 2 weeks of the season. Both teams started off in slow fashion, with no first quarter points. A LeGarrette Blount 1 yard touchdown run in the second quarter were the only points of the first half, after the Eagles stopped the Giants from reaching the end zone from 1 yard out to close out the first half. Coming out in the third quarter with a 7-0 lead, the Eagles added the only points of the third quarter with Carson Wentz finding tight end Zach Ertz for a 3-yard touchdown. The Eagles defense (who were playing a solid game) broke down in the fourth quarter allowing the Giants to score 21 unanswered points to start the fourth quarter, as quarterback Eli Manning found his all pro wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. twice for touchdowns, and second year wide receiver Sterling Shepard once for a 77-yard touchdown. Fletcher Cox left the game with a calf injury. Eagles rookie running back Corey Clement ran for a 15-yard touchdown to tie the score at 21. After exchanging field goals, Wentz and the Eagles offense took over, looking to move into field goal range. Wentz connected with Alshon Jeffery for a 17-yard pass, setting up a Jake Elliott 61 yard field goal attempt with 1 second remaining. Elliott converted on the 61 yard attempt, the longest in Eagles franchise history as time expired. Wentz was quietly efficient in the game, completing 21 of 31 attempts for 176 yards and one touchdown despite playing behind a struggling offensive line. The win came at an expense, as running back Darren Sproles was ruled out for the remainder of the season with a broken arm and torn ACL, both of which occurred on the same play. Despite this injury, the Eagles ran the ball efficiently through most of the game. With the close win, the Eagles advanced to 2-1 tying the Cowboys and the Redskins for first place in the NFC East while the Giants fell to 0-3 in the basement of the division. How many touchdowns did Eli Manning throw for in the 4th quarter?","response":"In the fourth quarter of the game, Eli Manning, the quarterback for the Giants, threw for three touchdowns. Manning found all pro wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. twice for touchdowns and second-year wide receiver Sterling Shepard once for a 77-yard touchdown.

Question: Jimmy and Tim like playing together. When they play for a long time they have to stop because they do what? Options: A. feeling happy B. get hungry C. learning D. grow up E. injury Answer:","response":"Option B. get hungry When Jimmy and Tim play together for a long time, they have to stop and take a break because they get hungry. As children engage in physical activities and expend energy, their bodies require nourishment to replenish nutrients and fuel their ongoing growth and development. Hunger is a natural response to sustained physical activity, as it signals that the body needs more energy to support the demands being placed on it. While the other options might have some associations with children and play, they do not provide a direct and reasonable reason for stopping play: Option A. feeling happy: Generally, feeling happy would encourage children to continue playing together rather than stop. Happiness strengthens relationships and promotes a positive environment for play and learning. Option C. learning: Playing together is indeed a form of learning, as children develop social, cognitive, and physical skills through interaction and collaboration. However, learning in itself would not typically be a reason for stopping play as it is an integral part of the play experience. Option D. grow up: Growing up is a gradual process that occurs over time and is not something that would cause children to immediately stop playing. While children's interests and preferences may change as they mature, this is not a reason for stopping play abruptly. Option E. injury: Although injuries can sometimes occur during play, they are not an expected outcome of playing together, and mentioning injuries as a general reason for taking a break from play unnecessarily puts a negative connotation on an otherwise positive and developmental activity. In conclusion, among the given options, it is common sense that Jimmy and Tim would need to stop playing when they get hungry, as hunger is a natural response to prolonged physical activity and energy expenditure. Taking breaks to eat and replenish their energy levels is important for the overall well-being and continued enjoyment of playtime."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the mother of girl who is dating a rebellious teen?

He was promoted to repertory player after his first year. His early years on the program were characterized by stage fright and an inability to properly interpret sketches that he did not write himself. He had to \\"re-learn\\" performing after years as a writer, and later felt his natural tendency to \\"overthink\\" things improved his performance. He was particularly uncomfortable portraying President George W. Bush, as he felt he was not the best impressionist and it paled in comparison to Ferrell's impersonation of Bush. His only role was often Bush, leaving him no chance for more \\"absurd\\" pieces he favored. He was nearly fired from the program following his third season (2004-05), but after two three-week extensions to decide his fate, he was brought back. Forte estimated it took five seasons for him to feel fully comfortable performing on the show. In 2004, he made his film debut in Around the World in 80 Days. Forte's humor at SNL has been described as bizarre, and he became known for many \\"10-to-1\\" sketches: pieces deemed too odd that air at the bottom of the show, preceding its conclusion. Among these were a sketch titled \\"Potato Chip\\", in which Forte plays an NASA recruiter that warns a candidate (Jason Sudeikis) not to touch a bowl of potato chips on his desk, or his turn as Jeff Montgomery, a sex offender posing as one for Halloween. He was also well known for his character Tim Calhoun, a politician, and the Falconer. Forte's favorite sketch on the show was one in which he played a motivational coach alongside football star Peyton Manning. He also co-starred with Andy Samberg in the first SNL Digital Short, \\"Lettuce\\". He often spent long hours crafting his sketches for the program, passing deadlines, but his pieces were often greeted warmly at table reads. During his time at the show, he costarred in and wrote the 2007 film The Brothers Solomon. The film was originally a pilot for Carsey-Werner, and its creation was an extension of his agreement to terminate his contract to appear on SNL. Forte's best-known character on SNL was MacGruber, a special operations agent who is tasked in each episode with deactivating a ticking bomb but becomes distracted by personal issues. The sketches were based on the television series MacGyver. It was created by writer Jorma Taccone, who pitched the idea relentlessly to Forte. He was initially reluctant to commit to the sketch, deeming it too dumb, but accepted after persuasion from Taccone. The first sketch aired in January 2007, and led to multiple more segments in the following years. In 2009, the sketches were spun off into a series of commercials sponsored by Pepsi premiering during Super Bowl XLIII that featured the actor behind MacGyver, Richard Dean Anderson, as MacGruber's father. The advertisements led the character and sketches to receive a wider level of popularity. Following the success of the advertisements, creator Lorne Michaels approached Forte, Taccone, and writer John Solomon with the idea to produce a MacGruber film. Regarding his experiences on SNL, Forte has remarked: Answer this question \\"Motivational coach for what team or sport\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","response":"Motivational coach alongside football star Peyton Manning."},{"question":"What happens next? A man is standing at a table with a blue mask on. he","response":"has a pile of blueprints, tools, and components spread out before him. He appears to be intently focused on constructing a complex mechanical device, carefully studying the design details and following the instructions outlined on the blueprint. The walls of the room in which he's working are lined with shelves filled with parts and equipment: gears, motors, wires, and other various pieces of technology and circuitry. With precision and determination, the man begins to assemble the device. He connects wires, solders components, and glues sections of the structure together, all while referring to his detailed blueprint. After hours of careful work, the device starts to take shape, evolving into an intricate mechanism, revealing the combination of engineering skills and dedication of its creator. As the man works, he occasionally glances at the door to make sure nobody interrupts his work. He is also very attentive to the timer set on the table; it seems that the clock is ticking for the completion of this project. This man is no ordinary inventor, and the device he is building carries great significance and a sense of urgency. Upon finalizing the assembly, the man attaches the last remaining piece – a small radio transmitter. He flips a switch and the device begins to hum softly, indicating that it's operational. The man removes his blue mask, revealing a satisfied yet apprehensive expression. He is well aware that the stakes are high and that his invention has the potential to change the world, for better or for worse. As he packs the blueprint and remaining components into a briefcase, he gets ready to leave his workshop. Taking extra caution to conceal the device, he knows that he will have to make his way discreetly to his final destination - a secretive meeting with some influential individuals who have a vested interest in this invention. The implications of this device could have a profound effect on global politics, economics, and even the environment, and as a result, there are various factions vying for control of this technology. Outside the workshop, a parked car awaits the man. A shadowy figure is standing next to the car, watching the entrance of the workshop intently. This figure is a spy from another faction who has been sent to intercept the device and foil the man’s ambitions. As the man exits the workshop, trying to keep a low profile, the spy approaches him, attempting to gain possession of the briefcase containing the invention. A sudden scuffle breaks out between the two individuals. The man fights skillfully, utilizing his experience in self-defense to try to fend off the stealthy attacker. Locked in struggle, they knock over a nearby trash can, drawing the attention of a passerby who pulls out their cellphone to notify the authorities. As the sirens draw nearer, the man finds an opportunity to break free and jump into his waiting car. With the briefcase safely at his side, he speeds away towards his meeting, constantly checking his rearview mirror to make sure the spy has not followed his trail. This high-stakes encounter ignites a complex series of events. As various factions vying for control of the man's invention engage in espionage, double crosses, and betrayal, one thing becomes clear: The man's invention is a groundbreaking technological development that could forever change the course of humanity. The inventor, along with his allies, must navigate these treacherous waters to ensure that his device ends up in the right hands – hands that will use its capabilities for the betterment of mankind and not for destruction and chaos. The world is on the precipice of a new era - one in which the consequences of this invention's potential will ripple far and wide, shaping the course of history once and for all."},{"question":"Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: The Carrier Sekani Tribal Council (familiarly known as CSTC) is a tribal council representing eight First Nations in the Central Interior of British Columbia.

It was cleaned every day, but it was always full of water and pee by morning. Where is the bathroom located? - school - at hotel - neighbor's house - college - flat The best answer is Answer:","response":"To determine the best answer to the question, let's consider the context and characteristics of the bathroom mentioned: 1. The bathroom is dirty and messy. 2. It is cleaned every day. 3. It is always full of water and pee by morning. These characteristics suggest that the bathroom is in a location with high usage and frequent visitors, which would result in the need for daily cleaning and the accumulation of mess by morning. Out of the options provided: - School: A common area with high usage and frequent visitors. Schools typically have daily maintenance, and bathrooms may become messy by morning due to a large number of students using them. - Hotel: Typically maintained and cleaned daily, but hotel guests usually keep their bathrooms clean and leave them in a reasonable state. - Neighbor's house: Unlikely, as this would describe a personal home and would not explain the daily messy state. - College: Similar to the school situation, a high possibility with lots of visitors and usage. - Flat: Residential, and unlikely to be in such a messy state every day. Based on these considerations, the most likely locations for the bathroom are at a school or college, as these places have high traffic and the need for daily cleaning. Therefore, it is difficult to provide a single best answer without more context.

Article: Sir Nicholas Winton, rescuer of children, died on July 1st,2015,aged 106. When the letters and the honor came knocking on the door of his house in Maidenhead, and the filmmakers came calling, Nicholas Winton always protested that he was no hero. Heroes faced danger; he never had. They put their lives on the line; he had just worked at home in Hampstead, after a day being a stockbroker in the City. They avoided bullets and the secret police; he wrote letters, made telephone calls,and composed lists. The fact that he had rescued 669 children from Czechoslovakia just as the Nazis invaded did not, in his mind, constitute heroism. He hadn't gone out there in 1938 with any burning urge to do good; just for a holiday, in fact. Nor had he gone looking for children to rescue. Instead they and their parents had come to him, as soon as word got round that he might be able to help them leave Prague and get to the West. From 6.00 a.m. the knocks would come at the door of his room in the Europa Hotel, and he would open it to find some shivering, starving, desperate figure. When faced with a problem, his instinct was to solve it. So he made lists of the children, took their photographs, got them Home Office entry permits, found them foster families and organised their departure on trains, via the Netherlands, to Liverpool Street. After just three weeks in Prague, he went back to Britain and carried on the work from there. The British Committee for Refugees from Czechoslovakia gave him almost no help, so he took sole charge himself. The Home Office was slow with entry permits, so he copied some illegally. In search of foster-parents for the children he put their photos in Picture Post; in the hope of farther havens for them he wrote to governors and senators in America and even to President Roosevelt, to no avail. He could have rescued at least 2,000 more, he said later, if America had been willing to take any. A hero might have got involved in the stress and distress of individual cases. He avoided that by treating them...

Options: - valley - wisconsin - wilderness - bridge - waterfall Let's think now! Step-by-step reasoning:","response":"1. Valley: A valley is a low area between hills or mountains typically with a river or stream flowing through it. This is a natural feature that a river can flow through. 2. Wisconsin: Wisconsin is a state in the United States. While rivers may flow through Wisconsin, the term does not describe a geographical feature that a river would flow through. 3. Wilderness: Wilderness refers to an area that has been largely untouched by human development, which could include forests, mountains, or deserts. A river can flow through such an area, but the term does not specifically indicate a feature the river would flow through. 4. Bridge: A bridge is a man-made structure that allows transportation (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians) to cross over a river or body of water. A river does not flow through a bridge but rather flows under it. 5. Waterfall: A waterfall is a feature where water from a river or stream flows over an edge, usually falling vertically or cascading down a steep slope. This is a type of natural feature that a river can flow through. In conclusion, a river can flow through a valley and a waterfall, whereas the other options either don't describe a geographical feature or refer to man-made structures interacting with the river (Bridge)."},{"question":"Question: Read the article and select the best answer.

It began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and merged into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery. The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history: classical antiquity, the medieval period, and the modern period. The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early, High, and Late Middle Ages. - iovo (pronounced ) is a small island located off the Adriatic coast in Croatia with an area of (length , width up to ), population of 5,908 inhabitants (2011) and its highest peak is 218 m (Rudine). - The Adriatic Sea is a body of water separating the Italian Peninsula from the Balkan peninsula and the Apennine Mountains from the Dinaric Alps and adjacent ranges. The Adriatic is the northernmost arm of the Mediterranean Sea, extending from the Strait of Otranto (where it connects to the Ionian Sea) to the northwest and the Po Valley. The countries with coasts on the Adriatic are Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Greece, Italy, Montenegro and Slovenia. The Adriatic contains over 1,300 islands, mostly located along its eastern, Croatian, coast. It is divided into three basins, the northern being the shallowest and the southern being the deepest, with a maximum depth of . The Otranto Sill, an underwater ridge, is located at the border between the Adriatic and Ionian Seas. The prevailing currents flow counterclockwise from the Strait of Otranto, along the eastern coast and back to the strait along the western (Italian) coast. Tidal movements in the Adriatic are slight, although larger amplitudes are known to occur occasionally. The Adriatic's salinity is lower than the Mediterranean's because the Adriatic collects a third of the fresh water flowing into the Mediterranean, acting as a dilution basin. The surface water temperatures generally range from in summer to in winter, significantly moderating the Adriatic Basin's climate. - Trogir (Ancient Greek: , \\"Tragyrion\\" or , \\"Tragourion\\" \\"Trogkir\\") is a historic town and harbour on the Adriatic coast in Split-Dalmatia County, Croatia, with a population of 10,818 (2011) and a total municipality population of 13,260 (2011).

It lies west of the city of Split. - A sovereign state is, in international law, a nonphysical juridical entity that is represented by one centralised government that has sovereignty over a geographic area. International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population, defined territory, one government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states. It is also normally understood that a sovereign state is neither dependent on nor subjected to any other power or state. - A castle (from ) is a type of fortified structure built in Europe and the Middle East during the Middle Ages by nobility. Scholars debate the scope of the word \\"castle\\", but usually consider it to be the private fortified residence of a lord or noble. This is distinct from a palace, which is not fortified; from a fortress, which was not always a residence for nobility; and from a fortified settlement, which was a public defence though there are many similarities among these types of construction. Usage of the term has varied over time and has been applied to structures as diverse as hill forts and country houses. Over the approximately 900 years that castles were built, they took on a great many forms with many different features, although some, such as curtain walls and arrowslits, were commonplace. - Kamerlengo ( Gradina Kamerlengo ) is a castle and fortress in Trogir , Croatia .

Parts of Venice are renowned for the beauty of their settings, their architecture, and artwork. The lagoon and a part of the city are listed as a World Heritage Site. - Croats are a nation and South Slavic ethnic group at the crossroads of Central Europe, Southeast Europe, and the Mediterranean Sea. Croats mainly live in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, but are an officially recognized minority in Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Italy, Montenegro, Romania, Serbia, and Slovakia. Responding to political, social and economic pressure, many Croats have migrated throughout Europe (especially Germany, Austria, Switzerland, France and Italy) and the Americas (particularly the United States, Canada, Argentina, and Chile), establishing a diaspora. - A palace is a grand residence, especially a royal residence, or the home of a head of state or some other high-ranking dignitary, such as a bishop or archbishop. - The Republic of Venice, or traditionally known as the Most Serene Republic of Venice, was a state originating from the lagoon communities in the area of Venice, now northeastern Italy. It existed from the late seventh century AD until 1797.

Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - Croatia, officially the Republic of Croatia, is a sovereign state between Central Europe, Southeast Europe, and the Mediterranean. Its capital city is Zagreb, which forms one of the country's primary subdivisions, along with its twenty counties. Croatia covers and has diverse, mostly continental and Mediterranean climates. Croatia's Adriatic Sea coast contains more than a thousand islands. The country's population is 4.28 million, most of whom are Croats, with the most common religious denomination being Roman Catholicism. - A mediterranean climate or dry summer climate is the climate typical of the lands in the Mediterranean Basin. The lands around the Mediterranean Sea form the largest area where this climate type is found, but it also is found in most of coastal California, in parts of Western and South Australia, in southwestern South Africa, sections of Central Asia, and in central Chile. - Split-Dalmatia County is the central-southern Dalmatian county in Croatia. The administrative center is Split. The population of the county is 455,242 (2011). The land area is 4540 km. - Most Serene Republic (\\"Serenissima Respublica\\" in Latin) is a title attached to a number of European states through history. By custom, the appellation \\"Most Serene\\" is an indicator of sovereignty (see also Serene Highness or Most Serene Highness for a sovereign prince); consequently \\"Most Serene Republic\\" emphasizes the sovereignty of the republic. - \\"Country House\\" is a song by English alternative rock band Blur. It was released as the lead single from the band's fourth album \\"The Great Escape\\" on 14 August 1995. \\"Country House\\" was the first of two Blur singles to reach number one on the UK Singles Chart (the second being 1997's \\"Beetlebum\\"). - Zagreb is the capital and the largest city of Croatia. It is located in the northwest of the country, along the Sava river, at the southern slopes of the Medvednica mountain. Zagreb lies at an elevation of approximately above sea level. In the last official census of 2011 the population of the City of Zagreb was 792,875. The wider Zagreb metropolitan area includes the City of Zagreb and the separate Zagreb County bringing the total metropolitan area population up to 1,237,887.

However, very small amounts of steel, (an alloy of iron and around 1% carbon), was always a byproduct of the bloomery process. The ability to modify the hardness of steel by heat treatment had been known since 1100 BC, and the rare material was valued for the manufacture of tools and weapons. Because the ancients could not produce temperatures high enough to melt iron fully, the production of steel in decent quantities did not occur until the introduction of blister steel during the Middle Ages. This method introduced carbon by heating wrought iron in charcoal for long periods of time, but the penetration of carbon was not very deep, so the alloy was not homogeneous. In 1740, Benjamin Huntsman began melting blister steel in a crucible to even out the carbon content, creating the first process for the mass production of tool steel. Huntsman's process was used for manufacturing tool steel until the early 1900s. What is the answer to this question: Heat treatment of steel has been know since what time?","response":"Heat treatment of steel has been known since around 1100 BC.

It is bounded in the east by the Isthmus of Corinth which includes the shipping-designed Corinth Canal and in the west by the Strait of Rion which widens into the shorter Gulf of Patras (part of the Ionian Sea) and of which the narrowest point is crossed since 2004 by the Rio-Antirio Bridge. The gulf is bordered by the large administrative divisions (prefectures): Aetolia-Acarnania and Phocis in the north, Boeotia in the northeast, Attica in the east, Corinthia in the southeast and south and Achaea in the southwest. The gulf is in tectonic movement comparable to movement in parts of Iceland and Turkey, growing by per year. - The Morea (or , , ) was the name of the Peloponnese peninsula in southern Greece during the Middle Ages and the early modern period.

Its chemical formula is HO, meaning that its molecule contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, that are connected by covalent bonds. Water strictly refers to the liquid state of that substance, that prevails at standard ambient temperature and pressure; but it often refers also to its solid state (ice) or its gaseous state (steam or water vapor). It also occurs in nature as snow, glaciers, ice packs and icebergs, clouds, fog, dew, aquifers, and atmospheric humidity. - An island or isle is any piece of sub-continental land that is surrounded by water. Very small islands such as emergent land features on atolls can be called islets, skerries, cays or keys.

The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria. - The Peloponnese or Peloponnesus (\\"Pelopónnsos\\"), is a peninsula and geographic region in southern Greece. It is separated from the central part of the country by the Gulf of Corinth. During the late Middle Ages and the Ottoman era, the peninsula was known as the Morea, a name still in colloquial use in its demotic form (). - An islet is a very small island. Types. As suggested by its origin as \\"islette\\", an Old French diminutive of \\"isle\\", use of the term implies small size, but little attention is given to drawing an upper limit on its applicability. - The even-toed ungulates (order Artiodactyla) are ungulates (hoofed animals) whose weight is borne equally by the third and fourth toes. By contrast, odd-toed ungulates, such as horses, bear their weight primarily on their third toe. The aquatic Cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) evolved from even-toed ungulate ancestors, and therefore modern taxonomic classification combines Artiodactyla and Cetacea into Cetartiodactyla. - The Philippines, officially the Republic of the Philippines, is a sovereign island country in Southeast Asia situated in the western Pacific Ocean. It consists of about 7,641 islands that are categorized broadly under three main geographical divisions from north to south: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. The capital city of the Philippines is Manila and the most populous city is Quezon City, both part of Metro Manila. Bounded by the South China Sea on the west, the Philippine Sea on the east and the Celebes Sea on the southwest, the Philippines shares maritime borders with Taiwan to the north, Vietnam to the west, Palau to the east and Malaysia and Indonesia to the south. - The sheep (\\"Ovis aries\\") is a quadrupedal, ruminant mammal typically kept as livestock. Like all ruminants, sheep are members of the order Artiodactyla, the even-toed ungulates. Although the name \\"sheep\\" applies to many species in the genus \\"Ovis\\", in everyday usage it almost always refers to \\"Ovis aries\\". Numbering a little over one billion, domestic sheep are also the most numerous species of sheep. An adult female sheep is referred to as a \\"ewe\\", an intact male as a \\"ram\\" or occasionally a \\"tup\\", a castrated male as a \\"wether\\", and a younger sheep as a \\"lamb\\". - Lake Island is an island on the coast of the Canadian province of British Columbia. It is located between Mathieson Channel and Lady Trutch Passage, and is flanked by Dowager Island (to the northwest), Lady Douglas Island (to the west), and a long finger shaped peninsula of the Canadian mainland to the east. Ironically, Lake Island is not a lake island, as it is in an inlet of the Pacific Ocean, and lies only some 6 kilometres from the open sea. - The Argolic Gulf (also \\"Gulf of Argolis\\" or \\"Gulf of Nafplio\\") is a gulf of the Aegean Sea off the east coast of the Peloponnese, Greece. It is about 50 km long and 30 km wide. Its main port is Nafplio, at its northwestern end. At the entrance to the gulf is the island Spetses. This gulf and its islands are sometimes combined with the Saronic Gulf and Saronic Islands, with the result called the Argo-Saronic Gulf and the Argo-Saronic Islands. It is surrounded by two regional units: Arcadia to the southwest and Argolis to the north and east. The river Inachos drains into the Argolic Gulf near Nea Kios. The main islands in the gulf are Psili, Plateia and Bourtzi, a small island with a Venetian fortress that protects the port of Nafplio. The surrounding mountains protect it from the strong summer Meltemi wind. - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water. - An archipelago, sometimes called an island group or island chain, is a chain, cluster or collection of islands. The word \\"archipelago\\" is derived from the Greek \\"- arkhi-\\" (\\"chief\\") and \\" pélagos\\" (\\"sea\\") through the Italian \\"arcipelago\\". In Italian, possibly following a tradition of antiquity, the Archipelago (from medieval Greek \\"*\\" and Latin \\"archipelagus\\") was the proper name for the Aegean Sea and, later, usage shifted to refer to the Aegean Islands (since the sea is remarkable for its large number of islands). It is now used to refer to any island group or, sometimes, to a sea containing a small number of scattered islands. - Dokos ( Greek : ) is a small Greek island of the Argo - Saronic Gulf , adjacent to Hydra , and separated from the Peloponnese by a narrow strait called on some maps \`\` the Hydra Gulf .

It contains the Argo-Saronic Islands. - A cay (or ), also spelled caye or key, is a small, low-elevation, sandy island on the surface of a coral reef. Cays occur in tropical environments throughout the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans (including in the Caribbean and on the Great Barrier Reef and Belize Barrier Reef). - Livestock are domesticated animals raised in an agricultural setting to produce commodities such as food, fiber, and labor. The term is often used to refer solely to those raised for food, and sometimes only farmed ruminants, such as cattle and goats. In recent years, some organizations have also raised livestock to promote the survival of rare breeds. The breeding, maintenance, and slaughter of these animals, known as animal husbandry, is a component of modern agriculture that has been practiced in many cultures since humanity's transition to farming from hunter-gatherer lifestyles. - Greece (' ), officially the Hellenic Republic (Greek: ' ), historically also known as Hellas (\\"\\" ), is a country in southeastern Europe. Greece's population is approximately 10.955 million as of 2015. Athens is the nation's capital and largest city, followed by Thessaloniki. - Ruminants are mammals that are able to acquire nutrients from plant-based food by fermenting it in a specialized stomach prior to digestion, principally through microbial actions. The process typically requires the fermented ingesta (known as cud) to be regurgitated and chewed again. The process of rechewing the cud to further break down plant matter and stimulate digestion is called rumination. The word \\"ruminant\\" comes from the Latin \\"ruminare\\", which means \\"to chew over again\\". - Ovis is a genus of mammals, part of the goat-antelope subfamily of the ruminant family Bovidae. Its five or more highly sociable species are known as sheep. The domestic sheep is one member of the genus, and is thought to be descended from the wild mouflon of central and southwest Asia. - In the history of Europe, the Middle Ages or medieval period lasted from the 5th to the 15th century. It began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and merged into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery. The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history: classical antiquity, the medieval period, and the modern period.

The day before his wedding, David meets Susan Vance by chance on a golf course when she plays his ball. She is a free-spirited, somewhat scatterbrained young lady unfettered by logic. These qualities soon embroil David in several frustrating incidents. Susan's brother Mark has sent her a tame leopard named Baby from Brazil. Its tameness is helped by hearing \\"I Can't Give You Anything But Love\\". Susan thinks David is a zoologist, and manipulates him into accompanying her in taking Baby to her farm in Connecticut. Complications arise when Susan falls in love with him and tries to keep him at her house as long as possible, even hiding his clothes, to prevent his imminent marriage. David's prized intercostal clavicle is delivered, but Susan's aunt's dog George takes it and buries it somewhere. When Susan's aunt arrives, she discovers David in a negligee. To David's dismay, she turns out to be potential donor Elizabeth Random. A second message from Mark makes clear the leopard is for Elizabeth, as she always wanted one. Baby and George run off.

Weir, executive director of the Legal Aid and Defender Association, Inc., the state's largest provider of legal services to the poor. Current federal funds of nearly 10.7 million from the Legal Services Corporation (LSC) will drop to 8.7 million for next year, according to Weir. She said that the reductions reflect a decline in the number of persons in the state who are living in poverty, according to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2000 census. LSC uses census data to determine funding across the nation, and according to the census, the state's poverty population fell from an estimated 1.2 million in 1990 to an estimated 968,000 in 2000. The state's legal aid agencies are also bracing for yet another cut in 2003 of some 600,000 of state funding. A portion of filing fees paid by litigants in the state's circuit courts, and a portion of interest on lawyers trust accounts (IOLTA) are earmarked for Michigan legal aid programs. These funds are expected to drop from currently 7.5 million in 2002 to 6.9 million when the Michigan State Bar Foundation makes distributions next year. Most of the decrease is attributed to the past year's low interest rates. \\"The irony of these funding cuts is that while there may be fewer poor people in Michigan today, the demand for service will not change because the poverty population remains so large and the legal aid funding so little that local providers will never able to serve all who need our service,\\" said Weir. \\"It's as if the poor will be victimized twice-once for being poor and again as victims of these funding cuts.\\" The U.S. Census Bureau, in spite of its best efforts, cannot locate every poor person living in a census tract, therefore the poor are also undercounted, added Weir. The brunt of these cuts will be felt most in Wayne County where according to the census some 333,000 poor people live, the largest concentration of poverty in the state. LAD will lose more than 870,000 for legal aid in Wayne County, nearly half of the state's total loss, said Weir. While difficult to measure, the loss of funds will mean that several thousand of Michigan's poor in need of legal service will not receive it, or they will receive significantly limited service. Cutbacks will include service in such civil legal matters as landlord-tenant, bankruptcy, consumer, child custody, predatory lending, mortgage foreclosure, utility shutoffs, social security, wills, and probate. \\"Local providers will have to work harder and smarter and use more technology instead of staff to provide as much service as we can with fewer dollars,\\" said Weir. \\"We will be providing more selfhelp training to clients enabling them to navigate the legal system on their own in routine matters, more assistance on the telephone, and less direct representation by attorneys in specific, high impact matters. Currently, Michigan has 13 legal aid agencies covering the state's 83 counties. Question: \\"How is Legal Aid and Defender Association planning to cope with the funding drops?\\" Answer: \\"Cutbacks in legal services\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","response":"No, the provided answer is not a direct and detailed answer to the question. Below is a more accurate and detailed answer: The Legal Aid and Defender Association (LAD) plans to cope with the funding drops by implementing several strategies to continue providing service to as many clients as possible under the reduced budget. Deierdre L. Weir, the executive director of LAD, mentioned the following approaches: 1. Working harder and smarter - LAD will refine its processes and increase efficiency to make the best use of available resources. 2. Leveraging technology - LAD will rely more on technology to provide services instead of staff, helping to reduce overhead costs. 3. Promoting self-help - LAD will offer more self-help training sessions to clients, empowering them to navigate the legal system independently for routine matters. 4. Emphasizing telephone assistance - LAD will provide more assistance over the phone to continue supporting clients without the need for face-to-face consultations. 5. Focusing on high impact matters - LAD will prioritize direct representation by attorneys in specific, high impact matters, ensuring that scarce resources are allocated to cases with the greatest potential for positive outcomes. By implementing these strategies, LAD aims to continue supporting Michigan's poor in need of legal assistance, even in light of the significant funding cuts. The organization is committed to adapting its operations to maintain a level of service that meets the demands of their clients."},{"question":"Premise: \\"The man in a dark blue shirt is squeezing a bottle filled with a gold-colored substance.\\" Based on this premise, can we conclude that the hypothesis \\"A man is squeezing a bottle of ketchup.\\" is true?

The hypothesis proposes that kofte is a dish composed of lamb meatballs in a tomato sauce. Step 4: Evaluate the logical relationship From the premise, we know that kofte refers to meatballs made of minced lamb and that they are usually served with a tomato sauce. The hypothesis agrees with this description by stating that kofte is a dish featuring lamb meatballs in a tomato sauce. The two statements share a direct logical relationship. Step 5: Draw a conclusion Given the consistency between the premise and the hypothesis, it is possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. This is because both statements refer to kofte as a dish consisting of lamb meatballs and a tomato sauce, and there is no contradiction between them."},{"question":"Q: I heard that While out hunting for Morel mushrooms, Carson got tired and flogged a log before plopping down on it.

But it is claimed that the doctrine is implicitly contained in the teaching of the Fathers. Their expressions on the subject of the sinlessness of Mary are, it is pointed out, so ample and so absolute that they must be taken to include original sin as well as actual.

But his argument is that all men are sinners; that they are so through original depravity; that this original depravity may be overcome by the grace of God, and he adds that he does not know but that Mary may have had sufficient grace to overcome sin \\"of every sort\\" (omni ex parte).\\". Can you tell me what it is? A:","response":"Based on the text provided, the description that was not used to describe Mary is \\"accursed\\". This deduction is obtained from the phrases used in the text such as \\"in every respect holy\\", \\"in all things unstained\\", \\"super innocent\\", and \\"singularly holy\\", and \\"the earth before it was accursed\\". All these epithets show Mary in a positive light, using words like \\"holy\\", \\"unstained\\", and \\"super innocent\\". When the text says \\"she is compared to Eve before the fall, as the ancestress of a redeemed people; she is the earth before it was accursed\\", it's saying she is likened to the earth before it fell under any curse. This implies she isn't described as \\"accursed\\", but as something pure and pristine instead. Thus, the description \\"accursed\\" wasn't used to describe Mary, based on this passage."},{"question":"Generate a question that has the following answer: Dan Aykroyd for the following movie plot: Yogi (Voiced by Dan Aykroyd) and Boo Boo (Voiced by Justin Timberlake) are two brown bears who have a penchant for stealing picnic baskets from visitors to Jellystone Park, while park rangers Smith (Tom Cavanagh) and Jones (T.J. Miller) are preventing them to do so. Meanwhile, Mayor R. Brown (Andrew Daly) realizes that Franklin City is facing bankruptcy due to profligate spending on his part. To solve it and fund his election campaign to be the next governor, the mayor decides to select Jellystone as a logging site, and Jellystone is prepared to be shut down. To save the park, Ranger Smith and his love interest, a woman named Rachel (Anna Faris), who was currently in Jellystone to film a documentary, hold a Centennial festival where Smith hopes to make a profit selling Season Passes. To sabotage the effort, Mayor Brown plays on Ranger Jones' desire to be head ranger and promises him the position if the funds are not raised. Yogi and Boo Boo had promised Smith to stay out of sight during the festival, but Jones convinces them otherwise. They try to please the crowd with a waterskiing performance, but Yogi inadvertently sets his cape on fire, causing the fireworks Smith set up to be knocked over and ignited prematurely, launching them into the crowd, who flee in a panic. After Jellystone is shut down, Ranger Smith is forced to stay in Evergreen Park, a small urban enclave choked with litter and pollution, but not after he tells Yogi that Yogi is not as smart as he thinks he is. Now seeing that their home is in danger of being destroyed, Yogi and Boo Boo travel to Evergreen Park and tell Smith about this, where he places the clues that Mayor Brown had given him, that Brown and his chief of staff (Nate Corddry) are planning to cut down Jellystone and its trees to make money. They return to Jellystone, and along with Rachel plan to stop the sale of the park.

Even after the emergence of the professional National Football League (NFL), college football remained extremely popular throughout the U.S. Although the college game has a much larger margin for talent than its pro counterpart, the sheer number of fans following major colleges provides a financial equalizer for the game, with Division I programs the highest level playing in huge stadiums, six of which have seating capacity exceeding 100,000. In many cases, college stadiums employ bench-style seating, as opposed to individual seats with backs and arm rests. This allows them to seat more fans in a given amount of space than the typical professional stadium, which tends to have more features and comforts for fans. (Only two stadiums owned by U.S. colleges or universities Papa John's Cardinal Stadium at the University of Louisville and FAU Stadium at Florida Atlantic University consist entirely of chairback seating.) - Basketball is a sport that is played by two teams of five players on a rectangular court.

Options are: [I] yes; [II] it is not possible to tell; [III] no;","response":"[II] it is not possible to tell; The statement \\"The northerner fell back, a spray of blood from his lips.\\" provides information about the northerner falling back, with the blood coming specifically from his lips.

In the original statement, there is no mention of the eyes or any injury that includes the eyes. The only observation focuses on the blood from the lips. It would be misleading to assume that blood is spewing from the northerner's eyes based solely on this information, as there is a lack of evidence to support this claim.

Stephen and Brian are brothers Answer:","response":"Title: Bond of Brotherhood Genre: Drama / Mystery / Family Plot Outline: The movie \\"Bond of Brotherhood\\" revolves around two estranged brothers, Stephen and Brian, who are brought together by a series of mysterious events unfolding in their small town. Set in the idyllic town of Evercrest, this complex drama filled with family secrets, love, tragedy and redemption, tells the story of brothers rediscovering their bond and joining forces to face a dark conspiracy that threatens not only their family but also the entire community. Act 1: The movie opens with a picturesque aerial view of Evercrest, showing how serene and peaceful this small town is. We then meet the Harper family, an influential family in the community. Stephen, the elder brother, works as a lawyer in town and is married to Emily, a school teacher. They have a daughter named Sarah. While Stephen struggles to balance his work and personal life, his younger brother, Brian, has always been the free-spirited one, traveling the world and staying away from the family business. Brian's unexpected return to Evercrest after years of being away surprises the community and, more importantly, shakes the delicate balance that Stephen is trying to maintain in his life. Brian's arrival raises questions about their past and the reasons for his sudden departure years ago. Act 2: As Stephen and Brian try to reconnect with each other, they start to uncover the truth about their family. Their journey makes them realize that their family is hiding a dark secret that threatens to shatter their bond. The brothers find out that the drowning of their father years ago may not have been an accident. This revelation forces them to dig deeper into the events leading up to his death. At the same time, Stephen starts to experience inexplicable occurrences, and figures from his and Brian's past begin to surface, bringing more questions about their family history. These encounters leave them feeling uncertain about whom they can trust and whether the people they grew up with may be involved in a conspiracy against them. Act 3: Stephen and Brian decide to confront their mother about the family secret, and she reveals hidden layers of their family history. The truth about their father's death and deep-seated deceptions within Evercrest's prominent families come to light. The shocking revelation of a secret sibling because of an extramarital affair their father had, turns their world upside down. Empowered by the truth, Stephen and Brian unite to face the people behind the conspiracy. Bravely, they gather evidence and work to bring justice to their family. Act 4: The climax of the movie involves a thrilling confrontation between Stephen, Brian, and the mastermind behind the conspiracy. They discover that the small-town leader, Mr. Carlson, orchestrated their father's murder because he was a threat to the corrupted schemes that kept the town's elite in power. Following an intense legal battle led by Stephen, with Brian's unwavering support, justice is served. Mr. Carlson and his accomplices are sentenced to prison for their crimes. Epilogue: Having overcome the trials that brought them together, Stephen and Brian forge a newfound bond and begin healing their family's wounds. Brian decides to stay in Evercrest and opens his own adventure travel agency, providing opportunities for others to experience adventure in a safe environment. Stephen, on the other hand, now more appreciative of his family, decides to give more time to them. Together they help the town rebuild after the scandal, fostering a stronger community and setting an example for what honest leadership entails. The movie ends with a powerful message of the importance of family, trust, and forgiveness in overcoming the darkest of times, leaving the audience with a sense of hope and unity."},{"question":"Is it possible to conclude that \\"The colorful streets of a SouthEast Asian city are lined with a few pedestrians, a few cyclists, but no automobiles.\\" if \\"The colorful streets of a SouthEast Asian city are lined with a few pedestrians\\"?","response":"Just because we know that \\"The colorful streets of a Southeast Asian city are lined with a few pedestrians\\", it doesn't necessarily mean we can conclude that there are also a few cyclists and no automobiles.

On the death of his uncle, he joined the British army in Portugal as a volunteer, at the age of sixteen. On 24 June 1811, at the age of nineteen, he received his first commission as 2nd Lieutenant in the 1st Battalion 95th Rifles (later the Rifle Brigade / Royal Green Jackets). Utilising his skills as a draughtsman of outstanding ability, he was occasionally employed in the Quartermaster-General's department under Sir George Murray. Context: Mitchell's fourth expedition was into Queensland in 1845-46. He was convinced that a significant river must flow north-west into the Gulf of Carpentaria, this being the main thrust of the endeavour. On 15 December 1845 Mitchell started from Boree (Buree in Mitchell's journal) with a large party including Edmund Kennedy as second in command (later speared to death at Escape River near Cape York). He struck the Darling River above Fort Bourke then continued to the Narran River, the Balonne, and the Culgoa. On 12 April 1846 he came to a natural bridge of rocks on the main branch of the Balonne which he called St.George Bridge, now the site of the town of St George. Kennedy was left in charge of the main body here, and was instructed to follow on slowly while Mitchell pushed ahead with a few men. Mitchell followed the Balonne to the Maranoa, and the Cogoon (now called Muckadilla Creek, near Roma). This rivulet led him to a magnificent pastoral district in the midst of which stood a solitary hill that he named Mount Abundance. He then crossed a low watershed to the Maranoa and awaited Kennedy's arrival. Kennedy rejoined Mitchell on 1 June 1846. Leaving Kennedy for a second time, he set out on an extensive excursion of more than four months. Mitchell traversed the country at the head of the Maranoa and discovered the Warrago River. Keeping north over the watershed, he traversed the Claude and Nogoa rivers, then reached the Belyando River, an upper reach of the Burdekin River. This had already been discovered by Ludwig Leichhardt on his expedition to Port Essington on 2 April 1845. Intensely mortified to find that he was on a tributary of the Burdekin River, and approaching the ground already trodden by Leichhardt, he returned to the head of the Nogoa and struck west, after dividing his party and forming a stationary camp. He continued west, making a new discovery which he was certain was the fabled north-west river. In honour of the sovereign of the time he decided to call it Victoria River. Having run out of time, he turned back towards the main party. It was here that Mitchell first noticed the well known grass that bears his name. On the homeward journey he trekked along the Maranoa River to St.George Bridge, arriving in Sydney 20 January 1847. Later that year, Kennedy proved beyond doubt that the Victoria did not continue north-west, but turned south-west and joined Cooper Creek. He renamed the watercourse the Barcoo River from a name mentioned by local Aborigines. Question: Did anything interesting happen during his exploration? Answer:","response":"Yes, sweetie, during his exploration, many interesting things happened. This man, Mr. Mitchell, went on a big, big journey to find a special river. He started his journey with a big group of friends, including a man named Mr. Kennedy. As they went along, they came across many rivers and found a beautiful area with lots of good land for farming and a hill that he named Mount Abundance. They traveled to a lot of places, discovering new rivers, but the most exciting thing happened when he found a river that no one else had found before. He thought he had found the river he was looking for and decided to name it Victoria River, after the queen. Isn't that sweet? During this journey, he also discovered a special type of grass, which now carries his name - can you imagine having a grass named after you? Sadly, they found out later that the river he thought was flowing northwest was actually flowing southwest and it was renamed to Barcoo River. Even explorers can make mistakes, you see, which is okay, because we can learn from them."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: The new university hospital in Trenton, which the Health Minister Victoria Culley has described as a \\"shining example\\" to hospitals all over the country, has been open now for over six months.

In spite of arriving early, I found that there were already long queues at the reception desks.

Eventually my turn came and I presented my doctor's letters to the receptionist, who informed me that I was in the X-ray queue and I'd have to go to another queue and start again! I couldn't believe it and asked her if it might be possible to give me an appointment card anyway without making me queue up again. She informed me it was no good arguing with her and I should have read the sign, an almost invisible piece of card saying \\"X-rays\\" just in front of her where very few people can have seen it.

To understand the connection between the two statements, we need to analyze each element mentioned. 1. \\"A boy\\" and \\"the kid\\": Both terms refer to a young male child. While \\"a boy\\" is general and could refer to any young male, \\"the kid\\" could denote that the speaker might have specific knowledge about the child, referring to a specific boy. 2. \\"Runs\\" and \\"ran\\": These are different verb forms in the present (runs) and simple past (ran), but they are related as they belong to the same verb \\"to run.\\" Based on this information, we can understand that the child is performing the same action in both statements; the only discrepancy is the time frame. 3. \\"Through the puddle\\" and \\"through the water on the ground\\": These phrases refer to similar settings but with slight variations. A puddle is generally defined as a small pool of liquid, typically water, on the ground. \\"Water on the ground\\" is a more general description that could include a puddle or any other body of water that happens to be on the ground. 4. \\"On his birthday\\": This phrase provides a specific time frame and context in which the event occurred. The child was running through the water on his birthday, and this context was not mentioned in the first statement. Based on the elements mentioned above, we can conclude that it is possible to draw a connection between the two statements, but we must take into consideration the differences in time frame and context. If we assume the simplified action of a boy running through the water on the ground and that \\"the kid\\" is indeed a boy, we can infer that \\"a boy runs through the puddle\\" is a simplified or more generalized version of the original statement. However, it's important to note that this conclusion is based on assumptions and lacks the specifics, mainly the time frame, that the child performed this action on his birthday. So to provide an accurate and comprehensive understanding, one could say: \\"On his birthday, a boy ran through the puddle,\\" ensuring that the context is maintained in the new statement."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: With almost two years left of my law degree, and with no intention of doing anything so idiotic as actually attending lectures or studying law, I had plenty of time to come up with my next bid for online fame. The Griff Rhys Jones TV project had stalled after a couple of meetings when everyone involved realised that the idea - to pipe broadband comedy programming into the nation's workplaces under the noses of bosses - was a bit of a non-starter. But I had become quite good friends with Rhys Jones's partner in the project, a comedy writer called Charlie Skelton, and he, Clare and I frequently met to brainstorm possible projects we might work on together. It was during one of these meetings that Clare proposed the idea of starting a comedy magazine - something like Private Eye, but for the Internet generation. My days as a school magazine publisher had taught me that printing magazines and distributing them was a royal pain in the arse and, anyway, if it was to be a magazine for the Internet generation then shouldn't it actually be on the Internet? The Zingin.com newsletter had attracted a ton of subscribers and had a distribution cost of basically nothing so why, I suggested, didn't we start a weekly comedy ezine, sent out by email? And, in a nod to Charlie's failed office comedy project, we could target it at bored office workers, sending the email to them on a Friday afternoon to cure the crushing boredom of those final few hours of the working week. And with that, The Friday Thing was born. To promote our fledgling publication we came up with a brilliant ruse: an online petition to have Friday afternoons declared a national holiday. British people worked harder than any other Europeans (we made up) and so it was only fair that our working week should end at noon on a Friday. We created an official website explaining our demands, registered a web address - letsgetitoff.com (snigger) - and sent a press release to the media. Clearly we had tapped into a seam of strong feeling among the nation's overworked... According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: How does the writer feel about attending lectures? Options: - They always bore him - not enough information - They are not interested - They make him stay at class late Answer:","response":"The writer feels that attending lectures is not of interest to them, as they have \\"no intention of doing anything so idiotic as actually attending lectures or studying law.\\" Their lack of interest in attending lectures is evident in their decision to focus on pursuing online fame and brainstorming other projects."},{"question":"Next question: when do doug and carol get married in er?","response":"In the TV show \\"ER,\\" Doug Ross and Carol Hathaway are two characters who care about each other very much.

And I was wondering How would Jan feel afterwards?","response":"After Jan had put Quinn's money in the safe for safekeeping, it is likely that Jan would experience a variety of emotions and thoughts. While I cannot definitively state how Jan would feel, as an AI, I can provide some possible emotional responses that Jan may have in this situation. 1. Responsible: Jan might feel a sense of duty and responsibility, as they are now in charge of keeping Quinn's money safe and secure. This sense of responsibility might lead to Jan being more careful in their actions and paying extra attention to the safety of their surroundings. 2. Trustworthy: Since Quinn trusted Jan with their money, Jan could feel a sense of pride in being considered trustworthy by their friend. This trust could strengthen their bond and make them more invested in the friendship. Additionally, Jan may feel an increased sense of self-worth and confidence in their personal integrity. 3. Appreciative: Jan might feel grateful that Quinn believed in their ability to safely store and protect the money. This appreciation could create a sense of loyalty towards Quinn, compelling Jan to ensure the money remains safe to the best of their ability. 4. Worried or Anxious: Depending on the amount of money, Jan could also experience some worry or anxiety about keeping the funds secure. They may worry about accidentally losing the money or that an external event, such as theft, could occur. This worry may lead Jan to continuously check on the money, take extra security precautions, or update Quinn regularly about the status of the funds. 5. Burdened: If Jan's concerns or anxieties about holding onto Quinn's money become overwhelming, they may begin to feel weighed down by the responsibility of maintaining the safety of the funds. Such burdens may manifest in feelings of stress or doubt in their ability to fulfill the task Quinn entrusted to them. Of course, it is important to remember that everyone's emotional response to a situation will be unique based on factors such as their personality, past experiences, and the specific details of the event. In this case, Jan's emotions could be influenced by factors like the amount of money involved, their history with Quinn, and their confidence in their ability to keep the money secure."},{"question":"Environ 1 Canadien sur 10 seulement exprime un faible niveau d’inquiétude face à l’éventualité de la circulation transfrontalière des renseignements personnels des Canadiennes et des Canadiens.

Part of is job involves checking the generators and transformers. His work schedule allows him to work on the generator tagged as gen A only on Mondays, and the transformer tagged as tran B only on Tuesdays. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which one would most likely be located in a power plant, gen A or tran B? The answer to this question is:","response":"Gen A would most likely be located in a power plant. To elaborate, the primary function of a power plant is to generate electricity by converting various energy sources, such as fossil fuels, nuclear energy, or renewable sources like wind and solar power. A generator, like Gen A, is an essential component in this process, as it converts the mechanical energy produced by turbines into electrical energy. Generators typically consist of an engine, an alternator, a voltage regulator, and other necessary operating components. On the other hand, transformers, like Tran B, are typically found in electrical substations, rather than inside the power plant itself. Transformers play a crucial role in transmitting the generated electricity to homes, businesses, and other establishments by regulating the voltage levels to match the needs of the electrical grid. They can either step up the voltage levels for long-distance transmission or step down the voltage levels for safe distribution to end-users. Given the fact that Bob checks Gen A on Mondays and Tran B on Tuesdays, it can be inferred that these devices are separate components of the power distribution system. The difference in their scheduling indicates that the two are not directly related and are likely serving different functions in the electricity generation and distribution process. In conclusion, based on the information provided, Gen A is more likely to be located in a power plant because it plays a vital role in generating electricity from various energy sources. Meanwhile, Tran B is more likely located in an electrical substation since its primary function is to transmit and regulate the voltage levels of the generated electricity."},{"question":"Translate to French: • Create and promote a collaborative work environment with bargaining agents;","response":"• Créer et promouvoir un environnement de travail collaboratif avec les agents de négociation ; Étape 1 : Identifiez les mots clés de la phrase en anglais. - \\"Create\\", \\"promote\\", \\"collaborative work environment\\", \\"bargaining agents\\".

Phrase: \\"been done before but never so vividly or with so much passion\\" Step 1: Identify key words and their sentiment: - \\"done before\\": neutral - \\"vividly\\": positive - \\"passion\\": positive Step 2: Analyze the sentiment of the overall phrase: The phrase acknowledges that something has been done before, which by itself could be seen as neutral. However, it goes on to say that it has \\"never\\" been done \\"so vividly\\" or \\"with so much passion.\\" Both \\"vividly\\" and \\"passion\\" are positive words indicating a high level of engagement or enthusiasm.

She longed to see distant places. Where might she imagine going? Options: - downtown area - centre of town - bedroom - europe - big city Step-by-step reasoning process below:","response":"1. Mandy lives in a train station, which means she is already frequently exposed to the downtown area and the centre of town since train stations are typically located in or near these areas. 2. Mandy longs to see distant places, indicating that she is looking for an experience different from her current location. 3. A bedroom is not a distant place and does not typically offer a unique or noteworthy experience compared to a train station. 4. Europe and a big city are more distant and offer new experiences compared to Mandy's current location at the train station. Therefore, Mandy might imagine going to Europe or a big city to explore new experiences and satisfy her longing to see distant places."},{"question":"Given the sentence \\"Some people in shadow walk by an escalator.\\" can we conclude that \\"The people are at the mall.\\"? Options: - yes - it is not possible to tell - no A step-by-step solution is:","response":"1. Analyze the sentence: \\"Some people in shadow walk by an escalator.\\" This sentence tells us that there are people walking by an escalator, and they appear to be in shadow. However, it does not specify the location of these people explicitly. 2. Consider the statement: \\"The people are at the mall.\\" This statement assumes that the people mentioned in the first sentence are at a mall. 3. Examine the potential connection: Escalators are found in a variety of locations, including malls, public transportation stations, office buildings, and more. While the presence of an escalator suggests an indoor location, it does not specifically indicate that the location must be a mall. 4. Determine the validity of the conclusion: Based on the information provided in the first sentence, it is not possible to confidently conclude that the people are at the mall. The presence of an escalator alone is not enough information to determine the specific location.

However, these occurrences are infrequent and do not detract significantly from the overall app experience. 2. Intrusive Ads: While it's understandable for a free app to have some ads to generate revenue, there are moments when they can be excessively intrusive. Implementing fewer or less intrusive ads would significantly improve the user experience. 3. Limited Customization Options: It would be great to see more options for customizing the app's interface, such as changing themes or rearranging buttons. This would allow users to tailor the app to their preferences, creating a more personalized experience. Conclusion: Overall, Barcode Scanner is a reliable and versatile QR code scanning app that provides an array of useful features without too much complication.

Article: St James's Palace has announced that while Miss Middleton will wear a wedding ring. Prince William has chosen not to. Rings are typically exchanged by couples during their wedding to represent commitment to each other. Does it matter if husbands don't wear a wedding ring? Prince William's father wears one, his grandfather doesn't and their decisions weren't seen as strange. But reactions to Prince William's decision show that wedding rings for husbands are now the norm. One young man, who spoke to the BBC, thinks William is setting a bad example, saying: \\"I think it's disgraceful . It's a tradition. You have to wear a ring really. And for someone of the royal family to do that, it's not right. \\" Broadly speaking, modem husbands tend to wear their wedding rings as a symbol of loyalty and faithfulness. So not wearing one can seem unusual or even dishonest to some, although men haven't always worn them. The wearing of wedding rings has been the done thing for centuries among wives but only became common practice among husbands during World War II. Men fighting overseas usually wore them as a reminder of wives and families back home. Wearing rings is a safety issue for men in certain manual jobs. But how does William explain his decision? A royal officer has said he \\"isn't one for jewelry\\". Question: What is the author's attitude towards Prince William's decision? Options: A: Subjective. B: Objective. C: Approving.

Article: Surprises often come in boxes. Birthday presents wrapped in colorful paper, brown paper packages mailed from a friend. No matter what kind of box it is, people like to open it up and see what's inside. In America, and in many other countries, one special kind of box contains the future. It's called a ballot box. What people put into the box on election day can change the course of history. Elections are the lifeblood of a democracy. The word democracy literally means \\"the people rule,\\" an important concept in American history. In the mid-1700s, England began passing laws that made the American colonies angry. The colonists had to pay more and more taxes and enjoyed less and less freedom. They felt the government of England didn't represent their interests. On July 4, 1776, the colonies declared their independence from England. They wanted to establish a democracy where people could have a voice in government. An effective democracy holds regular elections. In America, elections are held every two years for members of Congress. In these elections, all seats in the House of Representatives and one-third of the Senate seats are up for grabs. In addition, every four years, voters go to the polls to elect the nation's president and vice-president. Voters also regularly cast their ballots for state and city government leaders and local school board members. Sometimes they also have to vote on a proposed law. In the American electoral system, people don't really vote for presidential candidates. Instead, voters cast their ballots for \\"electors\\" who support each candidate. Each state has as many electors as the total number of its representatives in Congress. This equals two senators per state plus the number of its representatives in the House (which is based on the state's population). The candidate who has the most votes in a state wins all of the state's electors. To win the presidential election, a candidate must gain at least 270 of the 538 total electoral votes. Over the years, the U.S. has made a number of... Question: Which one is RIGHT about election reforms? Options: A: People have to pay a special tax to vote.

It essentially means that someone wants to have two desirable but incompatible options at the same time. It highlights the difficulty or impossibility of maintaining such a scenario where one retains the desired thing as well as its consumption. The origin and development of this phrase provide insights into its meaning and how it has evolved over time. The earliest known written instance of this phrase can be traced back to a letter by Thomas, Duke of Norfolk, in 1538, where he writes, \\"A man can not have his cake and eat his cake.\\" Although the wording varies slightly from the present form, the core meaning remains intact. The phrasing continued to evolve over time. A version appeared in John Heywood's 1546 collection of proverbs, titled \\"A dialogue Conteinyng the nomber in effect of all the Prouerbes in the Englishe tongue.\\" Here, Heywood writes, \\"Wolde ye both eate your cake, and haue your cake?\\" This publication makes it clear that by the mid-16th century, the proverb was well-known in English literature and gaining widespread usage. From the 16th to the 18th century, the phrase underwent many variations, such as \\"You cannot eat your cake and have it\\" and \\"You cannot eat your cake and keep it.\\" These variations reflect how the English language evolved, with the core meaning and essence of the idiom remaining intact. By the early 20th century, the present version of the phrase \\"have your cake and eat it too\\" began to gain prominence. It is believed that the rearrangement of the phrasing in this current form is intended to put emphasis on the idea that one cannot retain the cake after eating it. This alteration might have been made in response to the growing use of the phrase in negative contexts. The proverb's origin and development in the English language demonstrate a drive to convey the impossibility of having or maintaining two contradictory or incompatible things simultaneously. This saying has been commonly used in several areas of life, including relationships, career choices, politics, and personal decisions, emphasizing the inevitability of making a choice between two options. In conclusion, the phrase \\"have your cake and eat it too\\" is an English proverb that has deep historical roots dating back to the 16th century. Though it has undergone several transformations in wording over the centuries, the core meaning has remained consistent, emphasizing the impossibility of possessing two incompatible outcomes simultaneously. The development of the phrase reflects how the English language, society, and culture have evolved over time, while still retaining the wisdom embedded in this timeless adage."},{"question":"Answer the following question: I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

Why are many people finding it increasingly difficult to start and keep close relationships? Does modern life really make it harder to fall in love? Or are we making it harder for ourselves? It is certainly the case today that nowadays couples benefit in different ways from relationships. Women no longer rely upon partners for economic security or status. A man doesn't expect his wife to be in sole charge of running his household and raising his children. But perhaps the knowledge that we can live perfectly well without a partnership means that it takes much more to persuade people to abandon their independence. In theory, finding a partner should be much simpler these days. Only a few generations ago,your choice of soul mate was limited by geography, social convention and family tradition. Although it was never clear, many marriages were essentially arranged. Now those barriers have been broken down. You can approach a builder or a brain surgeon in any bar in any city on any given evening. When the world is your oyster , you surely have a better chance of finding a pearl. But it seems that the traditions have been replaced by an even tighter restriction:the limitation of choice. The expectations of partners are made greater to an unmanageable degree:good looks, impressive salary, kind to grandmother, and so on. There is no room for error in the first impression. We think that a relationship can be perfect. If it isn't,it is intended to be thrown away. We work to protect ourselves against future heartache and don't put in the hard emotional labor needed to build a strong relationship. Twelve-hour work at the office makes relaxed after-hours dating difficult. The cost of housing and child-raising creates pressure to have a stable income and career before a life partnership. Options: A they can't bear arranged marriages B they want to have more choices C they don't want to follow traditions D they think they can live happily alone Answer: D they think they can live happily alone Question: The answer is:","response":"Based on the article, why do many people find it increasingly difficult to start and maintain close relationships? A) They can't bear arranged marriages B) They want to have more choices C) They don't want to follow traditions D) They think they can live happily alone"},{"question":"\\"People lived around Lake Baikal before the sixth century.\\" Is the above claim true?

Options: - supermarket - factory - juice - hostel - cabinet reasoning:","response":"The best option for storing a large container would be in a factory. The reasoning behind this is that factories typically have ample storage space and are designed to handle large equipment, materials, and containers. Additionally, they often have the necessary equipment, such as forklifts and pallet racks, to move and store large items safely and efficiently. In comparison, supermarkets and hostels usually have limited storage facilities and are not designed to accommodate large containers.

Grammar: The sentence is grammatically correct, with a subject (Johnny Cash), a verb (played), an object (the Tuba), and a prepositional phrase (in a band). 2. Context: Johnny Cash was a famous musician, so it makes sense that he could be involved in playing an instrument in a band. However, he was primarily known as a singer-songwriter and guitarist. In the context of Johnny Cash's life, it is not widely known for him to have played the Tuba in a band. Thus, the sentence may not accurately represent his musical career. However, the sentence still makes sense as a hypothetical statement or in a fictional context. Answer: yes"},{"question":"Tim had always a red bike.

Time If Melania Trump is first lady, she'll focus efforts on putting an end to bullying on social media. In her first solo speech since the Republican National Convention, Melania Trump on Thursday called for an end to online bullying of children and teenagers, saying, it is \\"absolutely unacceptable when it’s done with no name hiding on the internet.\\" “Technology has changed our universe. But like anything that is powerful it can have a bad side. We have seen this already. As adults, many of us are able to handle mean words — even lies. Children and teenagers can be fragile.

She did not make any reference to the fact that her husband has engaged throughout the campaign in bare-knuckled personal attacks on his political opponents, the media, random celebrities and a host of others. Hello! We’ve got complete midterm election coverage right here. Let’s begin! Her speech in Berwyn, Pa. — a suburb of Philadelphia — was directed at suburban women, a group that could be critical if Trump wants to pull-off a win next week. \\"People have asked me, if Donald is the President, what kind of First Lady will you be?\\" Melania Trump said. \\"It will be my honor and privilege to serve this country. I will be an advocate for women and for children.\\" Trump’s wife has stayed mostly out of the spotlight since her speech at this year’s Republican National Convention, which included a section taken directly from Michelle Obama’s 2008 convention speech. She was joined on the trail Thursday by Indiana Gov. Mike Pence's wife Karen — who gave a glowing introduction. Melania Trump focused on her upbringing in Slovenia and making it to America. \\"I'm an immigrant and let me tell you no one values the freedom and value of opportunity more than me,\\" Melania Trump said. She said it took her 10 years to become a U.S. citizen. \\"Love for this country is something we immediately shared when I met Donald.\\" \\"He certainly knows how to shake things up — doesn’t he?\\" she asked, eliciting cheers from the crowd. Washington Post-ABC News tracking polls released this week have Donald Trump losing white, college-educated women by roughly two dozen points. Mitt Romney won the group by 6 points according to exit polls. One way the campaign has tried to appeal to suburban voters in Pennsylvania is to dispatch some of his less bombastic surrogates to the area. His daughter Ivanka Trump held a series of “coffee with Ivanka” events in the Philadelphia suburbs last month. Melania Trump delivers remarks at a campaign rally in Berwyn, Pa. Nov. 3, 2016. (Photo: Mandel Ngan, AFP/Getty Images) Pennsylvania is one of a handful of states critical to Donald Trump's election. Currently, Clinton leads by an average of 3 points, but polls over the last week have shown a tightening in the race. “Pennsylvania is a state that we are confident winning. It’s a state (whose) makeup fully relates to Mr. Trump’s message as well as Mrs. Trump’s message,” Boris Epsteyn, a senior adviser to the campaign, told USA TODAY on Thursday. The campaign has spent a significant amount of time in Chester County, a Philadelphia suburb, where the city of Berwyn is located. It’s a county in battleground Pennsylvania full of white, college-educated voters, a demographic with which Donald Trump has struggled. Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2eYmJvH ||||| Here is our bleak present: a time in which Melania Trump can stand before a Pennsylvania audience to denounce “mean words” and bullying on social media. In a speech on Thursday, Melania Trump—a woman who has utilized her own social media presence to encourage the harassment of journalist, and is the wife of a man who uses Twitter as a place to settle personal affronts, perceived or otherwise—described “our culture” as “too mean and too rough.” In a speech rich with apparently unnoticed irony, Trump said: Like anything that is powerful, it can have a bad side. We have seen this already. As adults, many of us are able to handle mean words, even lies. Children and teenagers can be fragile. They are hurt when they are made fun of or made to feel less in looks and intelligence. [...] Our culture has gotten too mean and too rough, especially for children and teenagers. It’s never okay when a 12-year-old child is mocked. [...] We have to find a better way to talk to each other, to disagree with each other, to respect each other... Advertisement Trump’s speech was a carefully threaded needle that differentiated between adults, some of whom are “able to handle” mean words and lies, and children who are victims of a culture of meanness (Who created this culture? Who’s to say?). Mocking a 12-year-old is, apparently, out of bounds, but ogling teenage girls is fine. Also fine, we can assume: sexual assault, harassing female journalists, calling adult women “mean words,” boy’s talk, and unabashed racism. The only delineation is that such tactics cannot be employed against anyone under 18; once someone is old enough to vote, then go ahead. Just a quick recap: words can hurt children, but the looming threat of political correctness hurts us all. ||||| (CNN) Melania Trump says she'd work to improve a social media culture that has gotten \\"too mean and too tough\\" -- riddled with insults based on \\"looks and intelligence\\" -- if she becomes first lady. But she didn't make any mention of the Twitter activities of her husband, Donald Trump, who has relentlessly attacked his political foes, journalists, critics and other entertainers for years with demeaning comments based on their appearances and intelligence. In a rare appearance on the campaign trail -- and her first solo speech since the convention this summer -- the wife of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump discussed her vision for her role in the White House for the first time Thursday in suburban Philadelphia. \\"It is never OK when a 12-year-old girl or boy is mocked, bullied or attacked. It is terrible when it happens on the playground, and it is absolutely unacceptable when it is done by someone with no name hiding on the internet. We have to find a better way to talk to each other,\\" Melania Trump said. \\"We must find better ways to honor and support the basic goodness of our children, especially in social media,\\" she said. \\"It will be one of the main focuses of my work, if I am privileged enough to become your first lady.\\" In September, after Clinton cited Trump's reference to 1996 Miss Universe Alicia Machado as \\"Miss Piggy\\" and \\"Miss Housekeeper\\" during their first presidential debate, Trump said in a 3 a.m. Twitter rant that Machado is \\"disgusting\\" and a \\"con\\" and directed followers to check out a non-existent Machado sex tape. Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said Melania Trump's speech will not serve to highlight her husband's most controversial and inflammatory tweets. \\"It won't for responsible journalists who wish to cover her entire speech/life journey,\\" Conway said, adding a shot at the Democratic nominee and the FBI investigation into her private email server. \\"And under that premise, would President Hillary Clinton never be able to talk law enforcement or corruption investigations again? Would she just abolish the DOJ and FBI?\\" It was Melania Trump's first speech since her appearance at the Republican National Convention, where her remarks triggered controversy because one section plagiarized Michelle Obama's 2008 Democratic National Committee speech. A speechwriter later apologized. She cast her husband as someone who's in touch with America's working class. \\"Every time my husband learned of a factory closing in Ohio or North Carolina or Pennsylvania, I could see him get very upset,\\" she said as she made the case that the Republican nominee can fix the nation's economic woes. Trump opened the speech by discussing her youth in Slovenia before immigrating to the United States, saying that \\"America meant if you could dream it, you could become it.\\" She said she went through a 10-year process of becoming a United States citizen, which she called \\"the greatest privilege in the world.\\" \\"I'm an immigrant, and no one values the freedoms and opportunities of America more than me,\\" she said. Melania Trump hasn't had a very public role on the campaign trail and has made it clear, publicly and privately, that her first priority is raising their 10-year-old son, Barron. But her speech Thursday was the first of what Donald Trump said in an interview with ABC would be two or three major speeches before the November 8 election. The speech took place in Berwyn, Pennsylvania -- in the suburbs of Philadelphia -- and was designed to help Trump win over the middle-class women in the region who could tip the balance of Pennsylvania's 20 electoral votes for Trump or Clinton. Conway worked with Melania Trump on the speech and was in attendance Thursday. Conway, Trump advisers said, has built a positive relationship with Melania over the course of the campaign. And Melania has privately been very supportive of Conway's role as the head of her husband's campaign. Melania Trump was introduced by Karen Pence, the wife of the Republican nominee's running mate Mike Pence. \\"I know that America will fall in love with her just as much as she loves the American people,\\" Karen Pence said. ||||| What is a summary?","response":"In her first solo speech since the Republican National Convention, Melania Trump, wife of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, pledged to combat cyber-bullying as the first lady.

Step 2: Analyzing the options We are given two choices: more or less. We need to decide whether a smaller than average physical heart will need to beat more frequently or less frequently to pump blood.

To maintain the same volume of blood flow, it would need to pump more frequently. Step 4: Choosing the right answer Since a smaller heart would have a smaller stroke volume, and to maintain the same volume of blood flow, it would need to compensate with a higher heart rate.

Finally, I'll analyze if the two categories overlap. Step 1: Identifying the goals ====== Best questions: The goal of the best questions is to thoroughly evaluate the candidate's qualifications, experience, and fit for the job and the company culture. They should also allow the interviewee to showcase their skills, problem-solving abilities, and values that align with the company's mission. Most interesting questions: The goal of the most interesting questions is to engage the candidate in a deep conversation and reveal unique and personal traits. These questions can lead to unexpected answers and insights, allowing the candidate to think outside the box and demonstrate their creativity and intelligence. Step 2: Listing examples of the best questions ====== 1. Can you please describe your job history and significant achievements within those roles? 2. What makes you the ideal candidate for this position? 3. Can you describe a challenging situation you faced at work and how you handled it? 4. How do you stay updated with industry trends and new technologies? 5. What types of work environments do you thrive in, and how do you contribute to a positive team culture?

It also helps prevent kickback if you’re using an electric saw. Ensure you’re using a blade meant for cutting plastic. Use a thicker blade so the plastic does not melt and stick back together. If you are trying to cut out smaller windows in larger sheets or making small handheld crafts, use a craft blade to chip away small bits of plastic. Drill holes to use as starting points for the blade and shave away the plastic until you reach the guide lines. Clamp a piece of straight wood across the plastic with the line you intend to cut hanging slightly over the edge to cut a straight line. Guide the saw through the plastic sheet, keeping your hand on the wide portion of the saw shoe. Jigsaws allow for better mobility as you make curved cuts into the plastic. Using a blade with 10 teeth per inch, turn the plastic to make the shapes you need. Drill holes in the plastic along the guide lines so your blade has places to start and stop easily. Make straight relief cuts from the outside of the plastic to the curves. This will help prevent the plastic from warping and shortens the cutting distance. Leave room between the guide lines you’ve drawn and where you cut. You can always file these down later. This type of saw makes cuts only when you pull it, unlike other hand saws that cut when you push and pull it. A pull saw helps make a cleaner, smoother line in your plastic and may be easier for making shorter straight cuts than an electric saw. Use your thumb to guide the blade when you make the initial cut. From there, place the saw into the line you’ve made and pull the saw through.

Answer the above question based on the context below: After the publication of the L'Orfeo score in 1609, the same publisher (Ricciardo Amadino of Venice) brought it out again in 1615. Facsimiles of these editions were printed in 1927 and 1972 respectively. Since Eitner's first \\"modern\\" edition of L'Orfeo in 1884, and d'Indy's performing edition 20 years later—both of which were abridged and adapted versions of the 1609 score—there have been many attempts to edit and present the work, not all of them published. Most of the editions that followed d'Indy up to the time of the Second World War were arrangements, usually heavily truncated, that provided a basis for performances in the modern opera idiom. Many of these were the work of composers, including Carl Orff (1923 and 1939) and Ottorino Respighi in 1935. Orff's 1923 score, using a German text, included some period instrumentation, an experiment he abandoned when producing his later version.In the post-war period, editions have moved increasingly to reflect the performance conventions of Monteverdi's day. This tendency was initiated by two earlier editions, that of Jack Westrup used in the 1925 Oxford performances, and Gian Francesco Malipiero's 1930 complete edition which sticks closely to Monteverdi's 1609 original. After the war, Hindemith's attempted period reconstruction of the work was followed in 1955 by an edition from August Wenzinger that remained in use for many years. The next 30 years saw numerous editions, mostly prepared by scholar-performers rather than by composers, generally aiming towards authenticity if not always the complete re-creation of the original instrumentation. These included versions by Raymond Leppard (1965), Denis Stevens (1967), Nikolaus Harnoncourt (1969), Jane Glover (1975), Roger Norrington (1976) and John Eliot Gardiner. Only the composers Valentino Bucchi (1967), Bruno Maderna (1967) and Luciano Berio (1984) produced editions based on the convention of a large modern orchestra.

Teacher: Let's think:","response":"The two sentences describe different actions and objects. In the first sentence, \\"A woman performing with a hula hoop on the street,\\" the focus is on a woman who is using a hula hoop, which is a circular object that is typically twirled around the waist, limbs, or neck for amusement or exercise. The action taking place is that the woman is performing on the street with a hula hoop. In contrast, the second sentence, \\"A woman jumps on a pogo stick,\\" describes a different action and object. Here, the woman is using a pogo stick, which is a device used for jumping off the ground by balancing on a spring-loaded platform held between one's legs. The action in this sentence is the woman jumping on the pogo stick. Given the distinctions in both the objects used (hula hoop vs. pogo stick) and the actions performed (performing with a hula hoop vs. jumping on a pogo stick), it is not true to say that \\"A woman performing with a hula hoop on the street\\" is the same as \\"A woman jumps on a pogo stick.\\" These are two separate and unrelated actions, involving different objects and activities."},{"question":"\\"the entire point of a shaggy dog story \\" How would the sentiment of this sentence be perceived -- Select from the following. 1. negative. 2. positive.

Answer:","response":"The first step of the process, which involves various physical, chemical, and biological factors contributing to rock breakdown, is called \\"weathering.\\" Weathering is the natural process that breaks down rocks and minerals into smaller fragments and alters their structure through exposure to the atmosphere, water, and organisms. In the context of the scenarios mentioned in the question, the first step would particularly involve the formation of cracks and crevices in rocks for subsequent events to follow. This can occur through various mechanisms such as thermal expansion, chemical reactions, and physical actions: 1. Thermal expansion and contraction: Fluctuations in temperature cause rocks to expand and contract. When heated, rocks tend to expand, while they contract upon cooling. This repeated process weakens the rock structure, leading to the formation of cracks and ultimately breaking the rock apart. 2. Chemical weathering: Water and other chemicals, such as acids, can react with rocks and minerals, weakening them and causing cracks and fissures to form. For example, minerals like feldspar found in granite can react with water to form clay, which expands when wet, causing stress on the rocks and making them more vulnerable to cracking. 3. Physical actions: Forces exerted by natural elements, such as wind, water, and ice, can cause cracks to form in rocks. For instance, water can seep into the cracks and fissures, and when it freezes and expands, it exerts pressure on the rock, causing it to split further. This process, known as freeze-thaw or frost wedging, results in rock fragmentation. Once the cracks and crevices are formed in the rocks through these processes, other factors like ice formation, clay expansion, and plant root penetration can further contribute to the rock breakdown. Therefore, the first step in this degradation process would be the initiation of cracks and fissures within the rock structure through exposure to atmospheric, chemical, and physical factors, setting the stage for the subsequent events to take place."},{"question":"Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who was the captain of the Indian limited-overs team in 2008, was bought by the Super Kings for 1.5 million at the 2008 players' auction.

He is famous for several accomplishments, particularly his innovations in crop rotation and alternative crops, and his numerous peanut-related inventions. Below are some key points that highlight his life and achievements: 1. Born into slavery: Carver was born into slavery during the American Civil War era. Despite the countless challenges he faced, he pursued an education and earned a Bachelor's and Master's degree in agricultural science from Iowa State Agricultural College, where he was the first black student and faculty member. 2. Promoting alternative crops: Carver is well-known for his work on promoting alternative crops, such as peanuts and sweet potatoes, in the southern United States. He aimed to help African-American farmers improve their economic situation and soil fertility by introducing these crops. This helped to break the dependency on cotton-farming, which had depleted the soil of nutrients and caused widespread poverty. 3. Crop rotation: Carver's promotion of crop diversification also led to his advocacy of crop rotation practices. He encouraged farmers to alternate planting cotton one year with nitrogen-fixing plants, like peanuts or legumes, the next year. This process helped to improve soil health and prevent soil depletion while increasing agricultural productivity. 4. Peanut innovations: Carver is most famous for his extensive work with peanuts. He discovered and developed over 300 uses for peanuts, including products such as peanut butter, dyes, cooking oil, livestock feed, cosmetics, and soil conditioners. These innovations helped establish peanuts as a valuable cash crop in the United States. 5. Teaching and research: Carver spent most of his career teaching and conducting research at the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, a historically black college founded by Booker T. Washington. His work and studies on agricultural practices significantly impacted agriculture in the southern United States while also improving the lives of many African-American farmers. Overall, George Washington Carver is renowned for his innovative agricultural research, most notably with peanuts, crop rotation, and alternative crops, which had a profound impact on the farming practices in the southern United States. He successfully overcame racial barriers and worked tirelessly to uplift African-American farmers and communities through education and improved agricultural techniques."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: Given an Amazon customer review, write a title for the review.

Matter is a fundamental concept in the field of physics and is classified into various types based on the properties, composition, and structure of the particles that constitute the object. All objects in the universe are composed of matter, and it is the physical substance that interacts with other objects through fundamental forces such as gravitational, electromagnetic, and nuclear forces. The mass of an object is a measure of the amount of matter contained within it, and it is typically expressed in units of kilograms (kg) or grams (g). Matter occupies space, which is an attribute that defines the region or volume in which matter exists. The volume of an object is the quantity of three-dimensional space it occupies and is generally measured in units like liters (L) or cubic meters (m³). The fact that matter occupies space also prevents two objects from being in the same location at the same time, which is referred to as the Pauli Exclusion Principle. Matter can be classified into various categories, including: 1. Solid: In this state, matter has a fixed shape and volume, with the particles (atoms, ions, or molecules) bonded tightly together in a fixed pattern. Examples of solids are metals, plastics, wood, and rocks. 2. Liquid: In this state, matter has a fixed volume but takes on the shape of its container. The particles have weaker bonds that allow for a certain degree of movement while remaining in contact with one another. Examples of liquids are water, oil, and alcohol. 3. Gas: In this state, matter does not have a fixed shape or volume, with the particles being far apart from one another and having a high degree of motion. Examples of gases are air, oxygen, and helium. 4. Plasma: In this state, matter consists of charged particles such as ions and free electrons, which results in it having unique electromagnetic properties. Plasma is found in stars such as the sun and in some laboratory conditions, like neon light tubes. 5. Bose-Einstein condensate: In this extremely low-temperature state, matter behaves like a superfluid and a superconductor, with very low viscosity and greatly reduced resistance to electric current. This state of matter was first observed in the laboratory in 1995. Besides these primary classifications, matter can be further divided into elements, compounds, and mixtures based on its composition: 1. Elements: These are the simplest forms of matter, composed of only one type of atom, like hydrogen, oxygen, or carbon. Elements cannot be broken down further by ordinary chemical means. 2. Compounds: These are formed when two or more elements chemically bond together in fixed proportions to create a new substance with different properties than its constituent elements. For example, water is a compound formed by the bonding of hydrogen and oxygen atoms. 3. Mixtures: These are formed when two or more substances are combined without undergoing a chemical reaction. Mixtures can be separated into their constituent substances by physical means and can have varying composition. Examples of mixtures include saltwater, air, and fruit salad. In summary, an object that has mass and occupies space is categorized as matter, a fundamental concept in physics with various states and classifications based on the properties, composition, and structure of its constituent particles."},{"question":"Write a sentence that about [Buzz Aldrin WAS_A_CREW_MEMBER_OF Apollo 11; Buzz Aldrin DATE_OF_RETIREMENT \\"1971-07-01\\"; Buzz Aldrin ALTERNATIVE_NAMES \\"Edwin E.

True antique is a collectable at least a century old, according to the majority of antique dealers. This is based on tradition and the customs laws of various countries, though some societies define it as anytime before 1930. True antiques are considered desirable because of their age, beauty, rarity, condition, or personal connection. Near antique is an item between 75 to 99 years old. Vintage is a broad definition that means 'of a certain time'. It is the description used for a range of collectibles, and especially those from the 40s, 50s and 60s. Collectables are any items valued or sought at by collectors. These can be from any era and vary in price depending on rarity and condition. The best antique buys are ones that match your personal interests. Suppose you're an art lover, for example. What would you like to obtain? A certain kind of object, such as antique sculptures? A piece from a certain artist? Artwork from a certain period (ie: post-impressionism)? Think about your personal interests and use that to narrow your search. Read guides about your special interests to determine what exactly you want to collect. Within a certain era or type of item, there are many different brands or styles to consider. The value of your item will vary greatly depending on age, brand, and condition. Keep these three criteria in mind as you research. If you're collecting as a hobby, buy what you love, not what is most valuable. You'll want to collect what you enjoy, not what costs most. If you want to make money buying and selling antiques, research valuable antique items within a certain era or subset. You will work much more efficiently if you can narrow your focus. Choose a focus with high value among antique hobbyists and current trending interest. Whether you collect or sell, have your items appraised. This is to make sure your insurance covers the value of all your antiques in the event of theft, damage or loss. Appraisal will also give you a good idea of what your items are worth. Before you begin shopping, decide beforehand how much you want to spend on antiques. Even the most seasoned antique buyers can get carried away and buy more than they can afford. Keep a close eye on your funds and promise yourself not to exceed them, even if you want to later. If you are selling your items, think about how quickly you will be able to sell the item and for how much (in as accurate an estimate as you can). When you find a valuable item that you think will sell quickly, you may justify going over your budget a little. Use your best judgment, and don't buy anything that will put you in serious debt. Learn from your mistakes. If you overpay on an item or bought something worth less than you thought, that's just part of antique collecting. Like other hobbies, you'll get better as you go along.","response":"This article teaches you about different types of old things, like true antiques, near antiques, vintage, and collectables, and gives tips on how to buy, sell, and enjoy them based on what you like and what is valuable."},{"question":"Select from the following.

B. microwave made the vegetables taste crunchier.","response":"Clara decided to boil vegetables on the stove instead of the microwave because the stove made the vegetables taste crunchier. While the microwave was a quicker and more convenient option, she was aware that using it for boiling vegetables could result in a softer, less appealing texture. In contrast, boiling them on the stove allowed her to maintain the desired crunchiness of the vegetables, giving her dishes a more inviting and satisfying quality for herself and her family. Moreover, Clara found that the stove-top method presented her with more control over the cooking process, enabling her to monitor and adjust heat settings and cooking time as needed. This versatility was particularly useful when preparing different types of vegetables, from leafy greens to root vegetables, each requiring unique cooking durations and techniques to reach their optimal taste and texture. Additionally, Clara had noticed that vegetables cooked on the stove tended to retain more nutrients, color, and natural flavor compared to their microwaved counterparts. It was imperative for her to provide her family with wholesome, nutrient-rich meals that were full of flavor without compromising on texture, and the stove proved to be an ideal method for preserving the vital minerals and vitamins found in fresh produce. Clara also found that her stovetop allowed her to multitask and prepare her entire meal effortlessly as she could simmer or sauté other elements of her dishes simultaneously, cutting down the overall meal preparation time. The intense heat in the microwave often led to uneven cooking, causing some portions of the vegetables to overcook while others remained raw. By boiling her vegetables on the stove, Clara could successfully avoid these issues while perfecting her culinary skills. To sum up, Clara chose to boil vegetables on the stove instead of the microwave because it resulted in a crunchier texture, provided her with greater control over the cooking process, helped retain crucial nutrients, and enabled her to multitask efficiently during meal preparation. The stove ultimately proved to be the superior method for preserving the natural taste, texture, and nutritional value of her vegetables, ensuring that her family enjoyed wholesome, home-cooked meals every day."},{"question":"Crossroads International How does Crossroads work?

The fresh discoveries, made in recent weeks at Hammerwich, near Lichfield, include what is thought to be a part of a helmet and an eagle-shaped object, Staffordshire County Council said. Speaking at a press conference in Stoke-on-Trent, council leader Philip Atkins confirmed that many of pieces weighed less than a gram. Newly discovered Anglo Saxon treasure is unveiled at a press conference at the Potteries Museum and Art Gallery in Stoke on Trent, Staffordshire today. Eighty-one of the items were declared treasure trove. They include part of a helmet, an eagle and a cross. The new items were found in the same. field where over 3,900 pieces of gold, silver and some copper alloy. objects were found in 2009. The first discovery was made by a metal detectorist, who had permission to scan the land. Archaeologists discovered the largest ever find of Anglo Saxon gold and. silver metal work from this country. In total the hoard included over 5kg of gold, 1.5kg of silver and thousands of small garnets. Mr Atkins said: 'The ploughing of the same field has unearthed a small number of other gold and silver finds. 'While it is far too early to say exactly what they are, or how old they are, they are certainly interesting finds.' South Staffordshire Coroner Andrew Haigh is expected to rule whether the haul of 90 items should be declared treasure at an inquest on January 4. The five hectare field was examined by a team of archaeologists - who have previously worked on battlesites at Bosworth and Hastings - once it had been ploughed at the end of November. South Staffordshire Coroner Andrew Haigh will rule at an inquest planned for January 4 if the metalwork pieces are part of the Anglo Saxon collection and should be declared treasure. Staffordshire County Council Leader Philip Atkins, said: 'The Staffordshire Hoard was an amazing discovery, and we have been immensely proud to play our part in helping to discover and tell the story of a collection of such international importance. 'We will now have to wait for the inquest, to discover if the objects are a significant part of our national history.' The new items were found in the same field where over 3,900 pieces of gold, silver and some copper alloy objects were found in 2009. The new artefacts have tentatively been dated to the 7th or 8th centuries, placing the origin of the items in the time of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Mercia. The latest find includes parts of a helmet. The team has been using x-ray images to piece together objects they find. The first discovery was made by a metal detectorist, who had permission to scan the land. Following the discovery three years ago, English Heritage immediately recognised the exceptional significance of the finds and provided emergency funding at the start of the dig together with continued expert advice, support and funding for the research and preservation of the Staffordshire Hoard. Archaeologists working with Staffordshire County Council later carried out the excavation of the field and discovered the largest ever find of Anglo Saxon gold and silver metal work from this country. In total the hoard included over 5kg of gold, 1.5kg of silver and thousands of small garnets. Treasure is defined by the law as any gold or silver objects, or coins, more than 300 years old which were deliberately hidden. Under the 1996 Treasure Act, any treasure found in England and Wales belongs to the Crown. Anyone who finds what they suspect may be treasure must report it to the local coroner within 14 days of discovery. If they don't, they risk a three-month jail sentence or a £5,000 fine. If an inquest declares that a find is treasure, it is offered to the British Museum or a local museum who has it officially valued by an independent board of antiquities experts. If they want the find, they must pay the market value of the treasure to the finder and/or landowner. If they don't, the finder can keep it. Normally, any treasure belongs to the landowner. However, a landowner can agree to split the reward with a metal detector enthusiast. They include a bishop’s pectoral cross, a large folded cross, a helmet cheek piece, a filigree seahorse and numerous sword fittings including hilt plates and pommel caps. The pieces appear to date from the seventh century, although there is some debate among experts as to when the hoard first entered the ground. The dig was closed when archaeologists were confident they had retrieved everything that was recoverable at the time. Last month, a team of archaeologists and experienced metal detectorists from Archaeology Warwickshire returned to the field when it was ploughed and recovered further material. These are currently being examined and x-rayed at a specialist archives laboratory. After the Staffordshire Hoard was declared treasure a huge fundraising campaign was launched to bring the treasure back to the West Midlands. The discovery, circled in red, was made in the same field where the Staffordshire Hoard, the largest collection of Anglo Saxon treasure was recovered in 2009. Staffordshire County Archaeologist Stephen Dean addresses a press conference about newly discovered Anglo Saxon treasure at the Potteries Museum and Art Gallery in Stoke on Trent, Staffordshire. The Hoard was valued at £3.3m by independent experts at the British Museum - the most valuable treasure discovery ever made. The fundraising campaign was led by The Art Fund, and featured a major donation from the National Heritage Memorial Fund. The Staffordshire Hoard is the largest collection of Anglo-Saxon gold and silver metalwork ever found, anywhere in the world. The two men who fell out over £3.3million after finding Saxon treasure. could scoop another fortune - after more artefacts were found in the. same field. Terry Herbert, 57, discovered the ancient gold and silver haul on 68-year-old farmer Fred Johnson's land three years ago. Their find, dubbed the Staffordshire Hoard, was sold to museums after. becoming an international sensation after the discovery on July 5, 2009. - leaving the men rich. But the duo fell out over the cash, with Terry claiming Fred wanted it all for himself. He even said his find of 3,900 artefacts - Britain's largest ever. haul of Anglo-Saxon treasure - was a curse and blamed it on ruining his. friendship with Fred. But yesterday it emerged the pair, who have not spoken since their. rift, are set to earn hundreds of thousands of pounds more after 90. gold and silver items were unearthed close to the original find. Experts are currently examining the finds and South Staffordshire. Coroner Andrew Haigh will rule at an inquest on January 4 if the pieces. are part of the Anglo-Saxon collection. If they are ruled to be from the same collection they will be officially declared treasure before being valued. The proceeds from the sale of the treasure will then be split between Terry and Fred. Discovered in a field near the village of Hammerwich, on 5 July 2009, it consists of more than 3,900 items. The artefacts have tentatively been dated to the 7th or 8th centuries, placing the origin of the items in the time of the Kingdom of Mercia.

In October, MacDonald introduced Thomson to Dr. James MacCallum. A frequent visitor to the Ontario Society of Artists' (OSA) exhibitions, MacCallum was admitted to the Arts and Letters Club in January 1912. There, he met artists such as John William Beatty, Arthur Heming, MacDonald and Harris. MacCallum eventually persuaded Thomson to leave Rous and Mann and start a painting career. In October 1913, MacCallum introduced Thomson to A. Y. Jackson, later a founder of the Group of Seven. MacCallum recognized Thomson's and Jackson's talents and offered to cover their expenses for one year if they committed themselves to painting full time. MacCallum and Jackson both encouraged Thomson to \\"take up painting seriously, [but] he showed no enthusiasm. The chances of earning a livelihood by it did not appear to him promising. He was sensitive and independent, and feared he might become an object of patronage.\\" MacCallum wrote that when he first saw Thomson's sketches, he recognized their \\"truthfulness, their feeling and their sympathy with the grim fascinating northland ... they made me feel that the North had gripped Thomson as it had gripped me since I was eleven when I first sailed and paddled through its silent places.\\" He described Thomson's paintings as \\"dark, muddy in colour, tight and not wanting in technical defects\\". After Thomson's death, MacCallum helped preserve and advocate for his work.Thomson accepted MacCallum's offer under the same terms offered to Jackson. He travelled around Ontario with his colleagues, especially to the wilderness of Ontario, which was to become a major source of inspiration. Regarding Algonquin Park, he wrote in a letter to MacCallum: \\"The best I can do does not do the place much justice in the way of beauty.\\" He ventured to rural areas near Toronto and tried to capture the surrounding nature. He may have worked as a fire ranger on the Mattagami reserve. Addison and Little suggest that he guided fishing tours, although Hill finds this unlikely since Thomson had only spent a few...

This draft, which was completed in 1957, is set 20 years after the time period depicted in To Kill a Mockingbird but is not a continuation of the narrative. This earlier version of the story follows an adult Scout Finch who travels from New York to visit her father, Atticus Finch, in Maycomb, Alabama, where she is confronted by the intolerance in her community. The Watchman manuscript was believed to have been lost until Lee's lawyer Tonja Carter discovered it; although this claim has been widely disputed. Watchman contains early versions of many of the characters from To Kill a Mockingbird. According to Lee's agent Andrew Nurnberg, Mockingbird was originally intended to be the first book of a trilogy: \\"They discussed publishing Mockingbird first, Watchman last, and a shorter connecting novel between the two.\\" This assertion has been discredited however by the rare books expert James S. Jaffe, who reviewed the pages at the request of Lee's attorney and found them to be only another draft of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\". The statement was also contrary to Jonathan Mahler's description of how \\"Watchman\\" was seen as just the first draft of \\"Mockingbird\\".

It was empty apart from the manager. We were told to find ourselves a table, so we sat in an attractive area sort of like a small stage. No waitress came by for 10 minutes, so we decided to visit the restroom; there was just one, with one toilet. But a woman rushed in ahead of us, carrying a bundle of clothes. Several minutes later, when she reappeared, we realized this was our waitress—arriving late and pushing us customers out of the way so she could change. OK… We each used the restroom and returned to our table. But it was not our table anymore. Along came the manager to explain she needed to set aside the stage-like area for a very special group. My daughter and I had already been debating whether to stay or leave. We stayed only because we were very hungry and worried that we’d have to start waiting all over again if we tried a different place. We were led to our new table: a lonely little table in the hall leading to the toilet. I was ready to get out of there, pronto, but my daughter spotted her favorite meal on the menu. But after another 15 minutes, with the lone waitress not appearing, we both shook our heads and got up… Oh, here’s the waitress! We ordered. Fifteen minutes later, no food. We got up again and exited past the stage-like area, which was just as empty as it had been when we were ejected. The very special people had not arrived—so (had we been served) we could have enjoyed our meal right there. We did find food elsewhere. The first place closed in less than a month. Good riddance!

Article: After 21 years of marriage, my wife wanted me to take another woman out to dinner and a movie. The other woman my wife wanted me to visit was my mother, who has been a widow for 19 years, but the demands of my work and my three children had made it impossible to visit her often. That Friday after work, when I arrived at her house, my mother waited in the door with her coat on. She had curled her hair and was wearing the dress that she had worn to celebrate her last wedding anniversary. We went to a restaurant that, although not elegant, was very nice and comfortable. My mother took my arm as if she were the First Lady. During the dinner, we had an agreeable conversation, nothing extraordinary but catching up on recent events of each other's life. We talked so much that we missed the movie. As we arrived at her house later, she said, \\"I'll go out with you again, but only if you let me invite you.\\" I agreed. A few days later, my mother died of a massive heart attack. It happened so suddenly that I didn't have a chance to do anything for her.

[substeps] As with every potential clue, it's possible she is just admiring another woman without having a sexual attraction to her. Can we infer the following? Women always show open appreciation. pick from the following. I. Yes II. It's impossible to say III. No The answer is:","response":"III. No It is not accurate to say that women always show open appreciation for other women. People express themselves differently and have their unique preferences and attractions. It is essential to keep in mind that a woman's appreciation for another woman may or may not be linked to her sexuality or sexual orientation. To tell if another woman is bisexual, consider the following indicators: 1. Communication: The most direct way to find out if someone is bisexual is asking her. Open communication can be a respectful and reliable method. However, be aware that these conversations should happen in a safe and comfortable environment. 2. Open appreciation for women and men: As mentioned earlier, check if she appreciates not only women but also men. Demonstrating attraction to both genders could be an indication of bisexuality. 3. Social media behavior: Observe her presence on social media. Is she openly discussing bisexuality? Does she follow and react positively to content relating to bisexuality? Her social media interactions may reveal her sexual orientation. 4. Relationship history: If you are aware of her past relationships and know that she has dated both men and women, it might indicate that she is bisexual. 5. Community involvement: If she is actively involved in LGBTQ+ organizations or attends events, there could be a possibility of her connection to bisexuality or other orientations. 6. Personal disclosure: Sometimes, people discuss their sexual orientation in casual conversations with friends or acquaintances. She might reveal her orientation through stories or experiences that she shares. 7. Behavior in social settings: Observe her behavior when she is around a mixed group of people. Does she express attraction to both men and women? Does she get too close or flirt with individuals of both sexes? Please remember that none of these indicators are definitive proof or evidence of bisexuality. Assumptions based on these cues should always be approached with caution and respect for individual privacy."},{"question":"News article: Appointing Billie Jean King to the Sochi Olympics 'US delegation' isn't enough Only one world leader has said they won't attend the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi because of anti-LGBT abuses in Russia. Photograph: ZUMA / Rex Features President Obama has been getting great press in the past 24 hours for his decision to include tennis legend – and out lesbian – Billie Jean King in the United States delegation attending the 2014 Winter Olympics. He's being lauded for sending a \\"clear message\\" to Russia about its treatment of LGBT people. Don't get me wrong, I'm a true Billie Jean King fan, but here's why I'm not joining the chorus praising Obama – or other leaders. There's no mention of Russia's human rights abuses in the US president's announcement, or any suggestion of genuine political action. Just the use of the word \\"diversity\\" twice. It hardly qualifies as a \\"strong signal\\", but that hasn't stopped the American press from spinning it that way. In the past 10 days alone, five western political leaders have said they'll be skipping the 2014 winter games in Sochi. There wasn't much response to the first public declaration, by Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk. But German President Joachim Gauck soon followed suit, as did European Union Commissioner for Justice, Citizenship and Fundamental Rights, Viviane Reding. The next day's announcement by President Obama that he was \\"unlikely\\" to attend was followed closely by French President Francois Hollande's declaration that neither he nor any high-ranking French officials would appear. None but Reding has publicly declared their decision to be a boycott of Sochi, or said anything about Russia's draconian anti-LGBT legislation. Still, the press has quickly, and perhaps mistakenly, concluded that the brutal oppression of LGBT Russians is these figures' primary concern – a conclusion that may make them seem more courageous than they really are, and handily covers for other agendas. In the absence of any declarations or salient political responses to Russia's anti-LGBT laws from Germany, the US, France, or Poland, it seems reasonable to wonder if, in fact, something else is at play here. Fear of being caught on the wrong side of history? Or a desire to humiliate and isolate Russian President Vladimir Putin for doing virtually everything imaginable to tick off the west, from sheltering Edward Snowden to jailing protestors from Greenpeace to Pussy Riot, to supporting the Syrian and Ukrainian regimes, while posing as the voice of reason in the New York Times? But why get into all of this nastiness when it's possible to stay home, remain silent, and have your behavior construed as moral rectitude? Whatever the true feelings of any of these western leaders when it comes to LGBT rights, this much is safe to say: none of them is eager to have a photo op with Putin right now. Not when his aggressive consolidation of power and quashing of any opposition is so blatant. And not at an event where there's so much potential for violence and bad press – all of it recorded in real time by dozens of broadcasters and blasted across the universe via Twitter and Facebook and through every imaginable online site. All of the signs of potential danger are flashing yellow. Months ago, Putin declared virtual martial law in Sochi, banning all protests, marches, and public gatherings for the duration of the Olympics. Unsurprisingly, the \\"protest zones\\" that Putin unveiled recently, in an attempt, one supposes, to calm increasingly anxious corporate sponsors and western nations, will be something of a joke – more of a snare for catching dissidents than a venue for free speech. And who will be the brave political advisor to tell the president that having Russian security forces kill four alleged terrorists near Sochi earlier this week may in fact not be the kind of thing that makes the average American feel better about visiting? And yes, it's a particularly bad time for world leaders to be seen with Putin, now when the true implications of Russia's anti-LGBT laws and the atmosphere of violence they've encouraged have become so readily apparent. On Monday, Tonight Show host Jay Leno conveyed to his millions of viewers the same message that LGBT journalists and activists have been trying to get across for months, and that NBC, which has paid 4bn to broadcast in the United States, has been so eager to downplay: contemporary Russia looks increasingly like early Nuremberg-era Germany, with its insistence that Jews were a threat to the purity of its bloodline and the moral fiber of its children. Each successive day's news makes it harder to ignore Russia's movement towards fascism – or the similarities between the Kremlin's venal campaign and what came to be Germany's Final Solution. Not with last week's call, by a Russian TV star before a cheering audience, for a Holocaust rerun – for his kids' sake. Ivan Okhlobystin, the star of a Russian copy of \\"Scrubs\\", told fans in the city of Novosibirsk on Sunday: I'd burn them all alive in ovens. It's Sodom and Gomorrah, as a religious person I can't be indifferent to it, it's a living threat to my children. It would be one thing if Okhlobystin were a lone outlier. But he isn't the only Russian celebrity to have made such pronouncements to an enthusiastic crowd. Last year, that honor fell to Russia's leading news anchor, Dmitry Kiselyov, who said – before a live TV audience in the run-up to the enactment of the anti-LGBT laws: I believe it is not enough to impose fines on gays for engaging in the propaganda of homosexuality among adolescents. We need to ban them from donating blood and sperm, and if they die in car accidents, we need to bury their hearts in the ground or burn them, as they are unsuitable for the aiding of anyone's life. Will Kiselyov bring his same flare for Third Reich rhetoric to Russia's TV coverage of the Sochi Olympics this winter? Viewers will have a chance to see, now that he's been appointed head of the new Kremlin-dominated network that Putin created last week, after liquidating RIA Novosti, and with it any pretense of an independent media outlet. It remains to be seen whether there will be any truly brave, outspoken political opposition to Putin's witch-hunt. Certainly Germany's Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and Britain's Prime Minister, David Cameron, are now under pressure to act. But more interesting is the question of whether others will prod Western leaders from Europe and the United States into genuine political engagement with Russia over its human rights abuses. Imagine how the stakes will rise if Argentina's President, Cristina Elisabet Fernández de Kirchner – who took on her country's Catholic hierarchy and staked her reputation on making LGBT marriage legal years before Germany, France, or the United States – decides to offer political asylum to the thousands of LGBT Russians terrified that a new law will strip LGBT people with children of their parental rights? What if Chile's President-elect Michele Bachelet puts the politicians responsible for the country's draconian anti-LGBT laws on a visa ban list? It would certainly be a welcome change from what we're seeing now: these low-risk, high-gain gestures from Gaucke, Obama and Hollande. The kind that tap the gAyTM at reelection time and earn plenty of free publicity, but without the expenditure of any serious political capital. What are the most important parts of this news article?","response":"This news article talks about how President Obama chose Billie Jean King, a famous tennis player who is openly gay, to be part of the United States delegation at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. Some people think that this sends a strong message to Russia about how the United States feels about the way Russia treats LGBT people. However, the article also mentions that other world leaders have decided not to attend the Olympics, but they have not said that their decisions are because of Russia's treatment of LGBT people.

PUBLISHED:. 11:50 EST, 6 January 2013. |. UPDATED:. 17:46 EST, 6 January 2013. A dental assistant fired because her boss thought she was too attractive wants the Iowa Supreme Court to reconsider its decision rejecting her discrimination lawsuit. Melissa Nelson's attorney asked the all-male court Friday to withdraw its Dec. 21 ruling, which she called a 'significant blow to gender equality.' The court ruled that Nelson's firing by Fort Dodge dentist James Knight might've been unfair but wasn't illegal. Fired: Melissa Nelson was so attractive, Iowa dentist James Knight fired her out of fear she'd make him want to stray from his marriage. Hello ladies: Despite Nelson being 21 years younger than him, married, and 'not interested in a relationship,' Knight believed it would be too hard not to start an affair with her. The court - and specifically Justice. Edward Mansfield, who penned the decision - ruled firings of. employees who are an 'irresistible attraction' to bosses do not violate. the Iowa Civil Rights Act because they're motivated by feelings and emotion, not. gender. Nelson's filing says the court erred because her gender played a role in her termination. Knight said he fired Nelson because he'd grown too close to her and worried he'd try to start an affair. The court ruled 7-0 bosses can sack. employees they see as an 'irresistible attraction,' even if they have. not engaged in flirtatious behavior or otherwise done anything wrong. Talking with CNN recently, Nelson said of the decision, 'I don't think this is fair. I don't think this is right.' An attorney for Knight said the decision, the first of its kind in Iowa, is a victory for family values because Knight fired Nelson in the interest of saving his marriage, not because she was a woman. But Nelson's attorney said Iowa's all-male high court, one of only a handful in the nation, failed to recognize the discrimination women see routinely in the workplace. Nelson insisted she was never interested in Knight romantically, regardless of his own feelings. 'Absolutely not,' she said. 'I'm happily married.' Content: Happily married with children Nelson said she saw Knight as a father figure and had 'absolutely' no interest in him romantically. Since Knight fired her she has worked as a waitress six nights a week. While her former boss claimed her clothes were so tight he couldn't look at her without being aroused, Nelson said the only outfit she wore to work was standard scrubs worn by many nurses and assistants in dental offices. Asked if she saw herself as irresistibly attractive, Nelson laughed at the question. 'I'm just an ordinary girl,' she said. 'Just an ordinary mom.' Her attorney, Paige Fiedler, said, 'These judges sent a message to Iowa women that they don't think men can be held responsible for their sexual desires and that Iowa women are the ones who have to monitor and control their bosses' sexual desires. If they get out of hand, then the women can be legally fired for it.' Nelson, 32, worked for Knight for 10 years, and he considered her a stellar worker. But in the final months of her employment, he complained that her tight clothing was distracting, once telling her that if his pants were bulging that was a sign her clothes were too revealing, according to the opinion. He also once allegedly remarked about her infrequent sex life by saying, 'that's like having a Lamborghini in the garage and never driving it.' 'That's like having a Lamborghini in the garage and never driving it.' Knight and Nelson — both married with children — started exchanging text messages, mostly about personal matters, such as their families. Knight's wife, who also worked in the dental office, discovered the messages and demanded Nelson be fired. The Knights consulted their pastor, who agreed that terminating Nelson was appropriate. Knight fired Nelson and gave her one month's severance. He later told Nelson's husband he worried he was getting too personally attached and feared he would eventually try to start an affair with her. Family man: Knight's wife, who also works in the dental office, demanded Nelson be fired when she discovered text messages. Ordinary mom: Nelson has been working as a waitress since she lost her dental job and is unsure of her future career path. Nelson was stunned because she viewed. the 53-year-old Knight as a father figure and had never been interested. in starting a relationship, Fiedler said. Nelson filed a lawsuit alleging gender discrimination, arguing Knight wouldn't have terminated her if she was male. She did not allege sexual harassment because Knight's conduct may not have risen to that level and didn't particularly offend her, Fiedler said. However, it has been revealed Knight sent Nelson raunchy text messages about six months before her dismissal asking how often she 'experiences orgasms.' 'The motives. behind Dr. Knight terminating Mrs. Nelson were quite clear: He did so. to preserve his marriage. Knight argued Nelson was fired not because of her gender, but because her continued employment threatened his marriage. A district judge agreed, dismissing the case before trial, and the high court upheld that ruling. Mansfield noted that Knight had an all-female workforce and Nelson was replaced by a woman. He said the decision was in line with state and federal court rulings that found workers can be fired for relationships that cause jealousy and tension within a business owner's family. One such case from the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a business owner's firing of a valued employee who was seen by his wife as a threat to their marriage. In that case, the fired employee had engaged in flirtatious conduct. Jurisprudence: Justice Edward Mansfield penned the Iowa Supreme Court's decision on Knight's dismissal of Melissa Nelson. Mansfield said allowing Nelson's lawsuit would stretch the definition of discrimination to allow anyone fired over a relationship to file a claim arguing they would not have been fired but for their gender. Knight's attorney, Stuart Cochrane, said the court got it right. The decision clarified that bosses can make decisions showing favoritism to a family member without committing discrimination; in this case, by allowing Knight to honor his wife's wishes to fire Nelson, he said. Knight is a very religious and moral individual, and he sincerely believed that firing Nelson would be best for all parties, he said. 'While there was really no fault on the part of Mrs. Nelson, it was just as clear the decision to terminate her was not related to the fact that she was a woman,' he said. 'The motives behind Dr. Knight terminating Mrs. Nelson were quite clear: He did so to preserve his marriage. 'I don't view this as a decision that was either pro-women or opposed to women rights at all. In my view, this was a decision that followed the appropriate case law.' What are highlight points for this article?","response":"1. In 2013, dental assistant Melissa Nelson was fired by her boss, dentist James Knight, because he found her too attractive. He feared that he might try to start an affair with her, which could jeopardize his marriage. To prevent this from potentially happening, he terminated her employment. 2. Nelson filed a discrimination lawsuit claiming that her firing was a case of gender discrimination. She suggested that if she were a man, she would not have been terminated. However, according to the Iowa Supreme Court, this firing did not violate the Iowa Civil Rights Act, because the motivation was based on feelings and emotions, not gender. The court ruled 7-0 in favor of this. 3. The dentist justified his decision, claiming that his action was motivated by the interest of saving his marriage, rather than by the fact that Nelson was a woman. This was considered a victory for family values by Knight's attorney. 4. Despite Nelson insisting she had no romantic interest in him, the Court concluded that bosses could fire employees they consider an 'irresistible attraction', even if they have not engaged in flirtatious behavior or done anything wrong. 5. Nelson's attorney, Paige Fiedler, was critical of the judgement, stating that the legal decision places the onus on women to control their bosses' sexual desires, otherwise risking the possibility of being legally fired if male sexual desires get out of hand. 6. Nelson was a dedicated employee who worked for Knight for 10 years before her termination. During the final months, Knight complained about Nelson's tight scrubs, claiming they were distracting and provocative. Nelson denied this allegation, refuting that she wore standard scrubs just like nurses and other dental office assistants. 7. After firing Nelson, Knight replaced her with another female staff, indicating his workforce was all-female. The court maintained that Knight's actions were in line with state and federal court rulings that workers can be fired for relationships causing jealousy or tension within a business owner's family. 8. The case garnered significant attention, as it challenged the legal limits of discrimination and gender-equality within the workplace, and resulted in polarizing opinions regarding whether the ruling empowers workplace misconduct or in fact, preserves family values."},{"question":"did someone email you a tcd file and you're not sure how to open it? maybe you have found a tcd file on your computer and wondering what it's for? windows might tell you that you can't open it, or in the worst case, you might encounter a tcd file related error message.

The main opposition Democratic Party -- which accuses Lee of using the ship's sinking for political gain, and whose leaders have stridently criticized an investigation that blames the incident on North Korea -- won seven major races, returns showed. About 48 percent of voters supported candidates from the Democratic Party and two other opposition parties, while 40 percent voted for candidates from Lee's ruling Grand National Party (GNP), according to the election commission. In midterm elections four years ago, GNP candidates won more than 50 percent of the vote. In Seoul, the capital and largest city, Mayor Oh Se-hoon of the GNP won a narrow reelection victory, while independent candidates and small parties won the other major races. Still, the Democratic Party claimed a victory. \\"The people handed a solemn judgment to the Lee Myung-bak administration,\\" spokesman Woo Sang-ho said, calling the results a \\"public verdict against the Lee government's arrogance and self-righteousness.\\" A ruling party spokesman, Cho Hae-jin, said the GNP \\"humbly accepts the voice of the public expressed in this election.\\" Party chief Chung Mong-joon said Thursday that he would resign in the wake of the setback. Turnout was unusually high, nearly 55 percent, the highest for a non-presidential election in 15 years. \\"The public sentiment to check the GNP and keep the balance seemed to have reduced the gap between the ruling and opposition parties,\\" said Jeong Han-wool, executive director at the East Asia Institute, a Seoul-based research group. \\"The ship incident seems to have reinforced the existing conservative votes for the ruling party, but was not enough to change the minds of independent and left-leaning voters.\\" Even before the ship sank two months ago, killing 46 sailors and triggering a major international security crisis, Lee and his ruling party appeared likely to lose ground in nationwide voting to fill nearly 4,000 local positions. An international investigation -- run by South Korea with the help of experts from the United States, Australia, Sweden and Britain -- determined two weeks ago that a North Korean mini-submarine fired a North Korean-made torpedo that ripped apart the 1,200-ton Cheonan in late March. Evidence showed overwhelmingly, the investigation said, that the North Korean military plotted to sink the ship. As part of punitive measures against the North, Lee last week announced trade and transport sanctions, as well as anti-submarine exercises to be held with U.S. Navy ships in the Yellow Sea. Those exercises are scheduled to begin next week. Recent polls had shown that most voters would take the Cheonan's sinking into consideration. They also showed that Lee's move to punish North Korea had majority support and that the president's popularity had risen from the mid-40s to just over 50 percent. The main opposition Democratic Party, however, has accused Lee's party of manipulating news about the ship's sinking to win votes. Special correspondent Yoonjung Seo contributed to this report. What are the most important parts of this text?","response":"The most important aspects of this text highlight the results and implications of the South Korean midterm elections. The ruling party led by President Lee Myung-bak, the Grand National Party (GNP), faced setbacks, winning only six out of 16 mayoral and gubernatorial races. In contrast, the main opposition Democratic Party (DP) won seven major races. The total vote shares showed a drop in support for the GNP, garnering only 40% compared to 50% four years prior. The opposition Democratic Party accused the GNP of using the Cheonan ship sinking incident for political gain in the elections. The high voter turnout, the highest for a non-presidential election in 15 years, up to 55%, indicates the public's desire for a more balanced political landscape in South Korea. Although President Lee Myung-bak's popularity and support for his decision to punish North Korea had increased, it wasn't enough to sway independent and left-leaning voters. Overall, the election results demonstrate the public's dissatisfaction with Lee Myung-bak's administration and their desire for more political balance in the country."},{"question":"Who directed the 1945 film Gregory Peck starred in?

A: A:","response":"Tadpoles play a vital role in their aquatic ecosystem by clearing out excess organic matter, primarily algae, detritus, and other microscopic plant debris, from waterways. Algae are microscopic plants that grow in the water and can be detrimental to the aquatic life if left uncontrolled. As tadpoles consume algae, they help maintain a balanced ecosystem, prevent algal blooms, and improve water quality. Algal blooms, when left unchecked, can lead to oxygen depletion, blocking sunlight penetration, and even producing toxins that can negatively affect other organisms and the aquatic environment. Detritus is decaying organic material, such as leaves, twigs, and dead organisms, present in water bodies. Tadpoles can feed on detritus directly or indirectly by consuming the microorganisms (such as bacteria and fungi) that break down these materials. By doing so, tadpoles contribute to the process of decomposition, recycling nutrients, and preventing the accumulation of organic waste in waterways, which otherwise could lead to eutrophication and oxygen depletion. In summary, tadpoles clear out waterways by feeding on excess algae, detritus, and other organic matter, contributing to the well-being of aquatic ecosystems and maintaining water quality."},{"question":"Identify the most salient words in this sentence: religious leadership title greets the crowds while arriving .","response":"The most important words in this sentence are: 1. religious 2. leadership 3. title 4. greets 5. crowds 6. arriving These words are important because they help you understand the main idea: that someone with a religious leadership title is greeting many people as they arrive."},{"question":"Q:I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

Monsters vs Aliens is skilfully animated and spasmodically funny, but you get the impression the film's seven (!) writers ran out of ideas two-thirds of the way through. 2. ...the first really memorable film of 2009, and clearly the most fun. 3. Engagingly nerdy movie in-jokes are clearly a step in the right direction for DreamWorks after the rather crass and bombastic approach of the Shrek movies. 4. A comprehensively entertaining package. If there's a lack of originality, the film is bolstered by the sheer verve of the animation and effects. 5. The movie never grows a heart, which doesn't stop it trying to tattoo one onto its chest. By the whizz-bang climax inside the alien mothership, I was fidgeting like a four-year-old at Cosi fan tutte. 6. It's all very good value, although I have a vague feeling that a gallery of freaky sci-fi creatures, as in Monsters Inc, may not engage the young audience's sympathies as much as humanoids. Great fun, anyway. 7. Despite being second out of the 3D traps after Bolt, their first special-specs-required outing is at least as eye-catching as Pixar's Oscar-nominated pacesetter. Occasionally, it's even better. 8. Heart and soul are sacrificed for sequences of loud characters pinballing across the screen in search of an easy laugh. The whole endeavour is an unsubtle, in your face CG-animated assault from DreamWorks. 9. A snappy script and some neat 3D make for an above-average romp with plenty of in-jokes for cineastes and fan-boys alike. 10. DreamWorks Animation tries something new, but we prefer its talking-animal comedies Madagascar and Kung Fu Panda.

Hinduism has ideas like karma, which means that good actions lead to good outcomes, and bad actions lead to bad outcomes. This belief helps people to make good choices in their lives. Hinduism also believes in an afterlife, which means that when people die, they go to a different place or are born again as a different person or animal. Sometimes, Hindus practice animal sacrifice as a way to show respect or gratitude to the gods, but this isn't something that all Hindus do.

Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip also wore all-black ensembles were adorned with the signature poppy pin. Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, also followed suit, and sported similar somber looks.

He has stated that Leonard was an alcoholic who left the family when Oldman was seven years old. Oldman attended West Greenwich School in Deptford, leaving school at the age of 16 to work in a sports shop. He was a pianist as a child, and later a singer, but gave up his musical aspirations to pursue an acting career after seeing Malcolm McDowell's performance in the 1971 film The Raging Moon. Oldman was charged with drunk driving in 1991 after a night out in Los Angeles with actor Kiefer Sutherland. A deputy city attorney stated that Oldman's blood alcohol content was found to be more than twice California's limit for legal intoxication. Some media outlets reported that Oldman was unhappy with The Contender (2000) because DreamWorks had edited the film to reflect pro-Democratic leanings, stirring controversy. The claims were declared \\"sloppy sensationalism\\" by Oldman's manager, Urbanski, who said that Oldman was \\"the least political person he knew\\", that \\"neither he nor Oldman had made the statements attributed to them,\\" that they had \\"produced the film every last cut and frame,\\" and that \\"DreamWorks did not influence the final cut or have anything to do with it.\\" It has been suggested that Oldman was blacklisted in Hollywood for several years as a result. In an interview in the July/August 2014 issue of Playboy magazine while promoting Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, Oldman criticized what he saw as excessive political correctness in American media and the entertainment industry's own discriminating hypocrisy, and argued in support of former controversial celebrities Mel Gibson and Alec Baldwin. He stressed that he did not relate with most of their viewpoints, but regarding the former, agreed, \\"Gibson is in a town that's run by Jews\\" (referring to Hollywood). After criticism from the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), Oldman apologised to them in an open letter. ADL director Abraham Foxman acknowledged that Oldman was remorseful, but felt his letter was insufficient and asked for \\"a little more introspection, a little more understanding and a little more education\\". Oldman then made a public apology on the 25 June edition of late-night talk show Jimmy Kimmel Live!, where he stressed that he was \\"profoundly sorry\\" for his \\"insensitive, pernicious and ill-informed\\" remarks. How about more controversies that Oldman has been involed in?","response":"Gary Oldman, an actor, was involved in a controversy when he said some things that upset people in an interview.

One of the first links was to a journal article by Heidi Philipsen entitled ‘Constraints in Film Making Processes Offer an Exercise to the Imagination’. Interestingly enough the first sentence of her article states: “I would like filmmakers interested in thinking “outside the box” to recognize that they can benefit from being placed “inside a box.” I wonder if Paul had contemplated this whilst choosing the name for this studio. Throughout her article Philipsen challenges the notion that creativity is an intangible innate quality, existing within the mind of one source, but rather creativity arises from a multitude of sources. Alike all things shared she suggests that creativity is easier to enhance by changing environmental conditions, rather than encouraging people to ‘think more creatively’. Perceiving creativity in this way allows you to see it as an organisationally influenced phenomenon, rather than a psychological and individual phenomenon. Which enables you to have more control over creativity and to encourage creativity once being aware of how it can be environmentally enhanced. As Csikzentmihalyi (1996) states “a genuinely creative accomplishment is almost never the result of a sudden insight, a lightbulb flashing on in the dark, but comes after years of hard work”. Constraints, as Philipsen suggests is one such way to manipulate the environment to enhance creativity. Students who attended The Film School in Denmark, who were forced into working with constraints for their projects eventually considered constraints to be both useful and inspirational. Such constraints included: making a scene with a specific theme, within a specific deadline and with other specific conditions concerning the use of camera, sound, actors etc. Students stated that these constraints ultimately made them feel secure, inspired and focused and... After this passage, the writer probably A. thought about it B. researched more about it C. wrote more D. not enough information A:","response":"The writer likely proceeded to research more about it and write more on the topic. The author seems to be in an exploratory phase of the subject, researching and analyzing various sources related to constraints in filmmaking. This is evident in how they started by searching for 'constraints in filmmaking' online, then delving into the article by Heidi Philipsen. They critically examined Philipsen's views and linked it with other sources such as Csikzentmihalyi, pointing out the correlation between the environment and creativity. The author seems intrigued by the idea of constraints positively influencing creativity by suggesting that it provides a sense of security, inspiration, and focus to those who are given a specific set of conditions to work within. The author's detailed discussion and analysis indicates they are planning to delve further into the subject. They also briefly mentioned the example of students at The Film School in Denmark, indicating a possible exploration of real-life instances or case studies where these theories are applied. Therefore, it can be inferred that the author might have researched more about the impact of constraints on creativity, especially in the context of filmmaking, before proceeding to write more about it. The author also seems to enjoy the idea of 'the box' acting as a creative enhancer rather than a restrictor. This is a potent metaphor the author could continue to explore in their writing. As the author mentioned, they were surprised by the correlation in the naming of the studio and the idea of enhancing creativity within constraints - 'inside the box'. This indicates a possible exploration of the studio environment itself as a case study or example in their writing or further research. Hence, there is a strong likelihood that the author proceeded to research more into this topic and subsequently wrote more based on their findings and analysis."},{"question":"Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: How long is this historic east–west, large-wheeled wagon route and emigrant trail in the United States on whch Barlow Pass is on?

The South does not exactly match the geographic south, but is predominantly located in the southeastern corner; Arizona and New Mexico, which are geographically in the southern part of the country, are rarely considered part of the Southern United States, while West Virginia, which separated from Virginia in 1863, commonly is. Some scholars have proposed definitions of the South that do not coincide neatly with state boundaries. While the states of Delaware and Maryland, as well as the District of Columbia permitted slavery prior to the start of the Civil War, they remained with the Union. Since the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s, they became more culturally, economically, and politically aligned with the industrial Northern states, and are often identified as part of the Mid-Atlantic and/or Northeast by many residents, businesses, public institutions, and private organizations.

Today we're going to talk about how a taxi app from London called Hailo stopped working in the United States and let two other popular apps, Uber and Lyft, run the show instead. Once upon a time, there were many taxi apps in the world, and one of them, from London, was called Hailo. Hailo was a special app that helped people find taxis really easily. All they had to do is tap on their phone, and a friendly taxi would come to take them where they wanted to go. But Hailo wanted to make even more people happy, so it decided to try working in the United States too. In the United States, there were already two very popular taxi apps called Uber and Lyft. These apps were also helping people find rides, just like Hailo. When Hailo arrived in the United States, it tried super hard to make people happy and show them that it could be as good as Uber and Lyft. But it wasn't easy because Uber and Lyft were already very popular, and they had lots and lots of friends who liked using them. Hailo tried so hard, but it wasn't easy for them. People in the United States liked Uber and Lyft more, and Hailo couldn't find enough people who wanted to use their app. As we know, even our favorite superhero needs to be strong to keep fighting the big battles. Sadly, Hailo wasn't strong enough, and it didn't win against Uber and Lyft in the United States. So, after some time, Hailo decided that it couldn't keep fighting Uber and Lyft in the United States. It decided to go back to London and other places where people liked it and used it every day. Hailo knew it just couldn't win this battle in the United States, and it was time to focus on making people happy in other countries. Even though Hailo didn't win in the United States, it still works hard every day to help people find taxis and get where they need to go in other parts of the world. Hailo learned that sometimes, it's okay not to win every battle, as long as you keep trying and doing your best where you can. And that's the story, little friends, of how the London Taxi App Hailo stopped working in the United States and let Uber and Lyft take over. But remember, just like Hailo, sometimes you'll win some, and some you'll lose, but you should always keep trying your best!"},{"question":"News article: The death Thursday of Taylor Hayes — the 7-year-old girl who had struggled to survive for two weeks after being shot — has once again elicited anger about Baltimore’s notorious “no-snitching” ethos. Taylor’s homicide is the latest high-profile case in which detectives believe an individual has information on who killed a child — but won’t cooperate. Taylor, a second-grader, was riding in the back seat of a Honda Accord in Southwest Baltimore on July 5 when a bullet struck her in the back. She died after “fighting for her life,” Baltimore police spokesman T.J. Smith said. The driver, Darnell Holmes, 33, was arrested July 6 and charged with six gun- and drug-related counts after police said they recovered a loaded gun, a digital scale and heroin from the glove box of her Accord. Police have said she is not cooperating with investigators. Councilman Brandon Scott, who has been outspoken about violence in Baltimore, said a “code of silence” that protects criminals must end. “There are people who know who shot this little girl,” Scott said. “A real person would step up and say, �?I did it.’ A real person would step up and say, �?This is who did it.’ ” Taylor’s shooting death follows other child killings in previous years in which investigations were obstructed by witnesses or people who police said were withholding information. In 2014, 3-year-old McKenzie Elliott was killed when a stray bullet struck her while she was standing on a porch in Waverly. Two other people were shot and survived. Immediately after the shooting, then-Baltimore police Commissioner Anthony W. Batts and other public officials repeatedly urged people to come forward with information. McKenzie Elliott, the 3-year-old killed last year when she was struck by a bullet on her front porch, would be four this month, and is be remembered at an event that includes a renaming of a part of the street after her. (Amy Davis, The Baltimore Sun) (Amy Davis, The Baltimore Sun) \\"We know who the group is, but we don't have any people outside that says, �?That's the person,’ ” Batts said in January 2015. \\"We know what happened. We have information from a confidential informant. We just need someone to come forward to say, 'That's the person.' \\" It wasn’t until April of 2017 that investigators believe they identified McKenzie’s killer, an alleged neighborhood gang member arrested after federal authorities charged him with use of a firearm resulting in death. Terrell Plummer was charged in federal court last spring for the toddler’s killing. His lawyers could not be reached for comment Thursday. The case is pending. All records in the case have been sealed by the court. The reason was not immediately clear. In 2013, 1-year-old Carter Scott was shot to death in the back seat of a car after police say his father, Rashaw Scott, had been lured to a parking lot in Cherry Hill. Masked men opened fire on the vehicle, wounding Scott, who police said was the target, and killing Carter. Rashaw Scott refused to appear in court to testify against the five men accused in his son’s killing until a judge issued a bench warrant. On the stand, he declined to corroborate an initial statement he had made to investigators alleging a friend had set him up. “I don’t remember,” he told a prosecutor at trial when asked about a photo lineup with his signature on it. “That could be anybody’s. It could be yours. I’m not an analyst.” All five men charged in the boy’s death were ultimately convicted. Baltimore has developed a national reputation as a city with a strong street code that prohibits “snitching” or turning in those engaged in illegal activity. In the early 2000s, a popular video glorifying drug culture and discouraging witness cooperation titled “Stop Snitching” spread quickly throughout Baltimore neighborhoods. But the reasons some do not cooperate with police are complex. People may fear retaliation, distrust police to keep them safe, dislike police or desire revenge themselves — which can lead to a string of violence over months or years. Baltimore police released a video on July 7 of a white Mercedes-Benz that was seen in the area of the shooting that fatally injured Taylor. Officials have urged the driver of the car to turn themselves in. Investigators have also been looking for Holmes’ boyfriend, whom they have not labeled a suspect. Holmes’ daughter also was riding in the back seat of the car at the time of the shooting, but was not injured. The bullet that struck Taylor entered the car through the trunk, police have said. Investigators said they recovered shell casings from at least two guns at the scene, and that some of the casings matched the gun they found in Holmes’ glove box. Holmes’ attorney, Staci L. Pipkin, did not respond to a request for comment Thursday. Those who knew Taylor recall a vibrant child who loved reading, dancing and singing. She enjoyed telling her Reading Partners volunteers about her family or weekend and would end every one-on-one reading session with a big hug. “Taylor made waking up early to go read to her a joy for me,” said Carrie Wells, a former Baltimore Sun reporter who read to Taylor. “She would beg to play games like Go Fish, and it was hard to say no to her because of the way her eyes would light up when you would say yes.” “I'm truly heartbroken,” Wells said, “and I hope people can surround her family with love and support during this unimaginable tragedy.” Staff of Robert Coleman Elementary School, where Taylor attended, spent Thursday comforting one another, Baltimore City Public Schools spokeswoman Edie House-Foster said. On social media, at least one public event was being planned in honor of Taylor. “Neighborhood Night Out: A Pizza Party for Peace,” featuring fundraising, “food, fun, games, face painting, prayer,” was scheduled at 6:30 p.m. Friday at Edmondson and Loudon avenues. Taylor’s death came on the same day Mayor Catherine E. Pugh’s campaign emailed a statement to supporters touting crime declines. “Murder is down 20 percent over last year and shootings are down 13 percent,” the fundraising statement said. “Since I took office, reducing the high rate of crime has been a top priority. We are addressing the root causes of violence in our streets and the lack of equity in our neighborhoods.” ||||| Tweet with a location You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

By a stunning and tragic coincidence, Amy Hayes is the younger sister of Taylor Hayes, a 7-year-old child who was fatally shot in July, according to two sources with knowledge of the situation. Taylor was shot this summer while sitting in the back seat of a car in Southwest Baltimore. She died two weeks later.

The 5-year-old was shot on the 1000 block of McKean Ave. in Sandtown-Winchester around 6:20 p.m. Police said she was caught in the crossfire between suspects in an unidentified vehicle and on foot. On Monday, neighbor Doretha Carpenter said she had ducked for cover in her home when she heard the shots fired on her block — about six of them. It wasn’t until she came outside that she learned the girl, who is also her godchild, had been injured. “I saw her doll baby in the street,” Carpenter said. Family photo Amy Hayes seen with Santa.

(Family photo) After being shot in the groin, Amy dropped the baby doll and the money she was carrying. The items remained on the street as detectives combed the scene for evidence an hour later. Carpenter said Amy, who had just turned 5, had been on her way to the corner store when the shots were fired. Her favorite snacks are Cheetos and sunflower seeds, said the store’s owner, Eduardo Torres. He was stricken by news of her injury and prayed to God for her full recovery. Kenneth K.

By about 9 p.m. Monday, she emerged from the operating room and was expected to survive, police said. The area sees a significant portion of the city’s crime. So far this year, 38 of 278 total homicides — around 14 percent — in Baltimore this year have been reported in the 21217 ZIP code, which encompasses Sandtown-Winchester. Mayor Catherine Pugh said Tuesday she was “outraged” by the shooting, and was “shocked” to learn of the girl’s connection to Taylor Hayes. “No child should have to live through this. No child should have to experience this,” said Pugh, who visited Amy Hayes in the hospital Monday night. City Councilman Brandon Scott, who chairs the public safety committee, called the shooting an act of a “pure coward.” “Only a pure coward would shoot a baby and leave her in the street,” Scott tweeted. “Somebody needs to buck up and tell us who shot this baby.” Detectives are asking for anyone with information to contact them at 410-396-2221 or Metro Crime Stoppers at 1-866-7lockup. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","response":"The shooting death of 7-year-old Taylor Hayes in Baltimore has reignited anger over the city's \\"no-snitching\\" culture, which has seen witnesses and individuals with information about child killings unwilling to cooperate with police.

Mode 9 was born on June 14 , 1975 as the third child of his parents in the state of Osun , but claims ( London ) as his origin .","response":"While these two sentences from Wikipedia convey similar information about Mode 9's birth and origin, there are subtle differences in their structure and presentation. 1. The first sentence places the emphasis early on in the sentence by mentioning the location of Mode 9's birth (Osun State). However, it later adds the information about his connection to London: \\"maintains London as his origin.\\" The word \\"maintains\\" adds a connotation of a consistent affirmation or assertion. This means that Mode 9 might have consistently and actively claimed London as his origin. 2. In the second sentence, the details of Mode 9's birth and rank among his siblings are grouped together before mentioning his connection to London. The phrasing \\"claims (London) as his origin\\" suggests that Mode 9 might have simply stated London as his origin, but it doesn't imply the same level of active affirmation as \\"maintains\\" does in the first sentence. Despite the presented differences, the main points conveyed by both sentences remain the same: Mode 9 was born on June 14, 1975, as the third child of his parents in Osun State, and he has a connection to London as his origin. The distinctions in wording and structure can impact the emphasis and interpretation for each sentence, but ultimately, the overall meaning is very similar."},{"question":"Q: A certain car uses 12 gallons of gasoline in traveling 360 miles.

But there's been a major push for foreign investors to be exposed to more stringent dealings when snatching up properties. A change.org petition, calling for tougher rules on foreign ownership of Australian property, has now reached more than 29,000, a jump of more than 20,000 in the last month. Foreign investors are growing in Australia, the Chinese making up a big part of that. A change.org petition is hoping to enforce tougher rules for foreign investment on Australian properties. Simon Hocking who launched the petition argues it is hard for Australian's to purchase properties overseas so why can't we implement the same sort of rules. 'I would not be able to buy property in China, Sri Lanka with 100% tax on foreign freehold purchases, Thailand and Singapore generally prohibited with strict limitations, Indonesia prohibited and many emerging economies requiring citizenship,' he said. 'I am not suggesting no foreign investment, but a more thorough testing of foreign buyers and purchases and a toughening of regulations by the Foreign Investment Review Board.' The FIRB current foreign investor rules state that they need to notify the government and get prior approval to acquire interest in certain types of real estate. 'Interest' has been defined as buying real estate, obtaining or agreeing to enter into a lease or license or financing or profit sharing arrangements. It also states that regardless of value, foreign persons generally need to notify the Government and get prior approval to take an interest in residential real estate, vacant land or to buy shares or units in Australian urban land corporations or trusts. The FIRB current foreign investor rules state that they need to notify the government and get prior approval to acquire interest in certain types of real estate. 'We predict Chinese property investment will increase in Australia by 15 to 20 per cent over the next 12 months,' Simon Henry, co-CEO of Juwai.com told Domain. In the FIRB annual report for 2012/2013 it was found that the real estate sector recorded 12,025 foreign investment approvals, compared with 10,118 approvals in 2011‑12. It was determined as the most popular sector for foreign investment with approvals in 2012‑13 of 51.9 billion. A parliamentary inquiry into foreign investment was investigating concerns raised that foreign investment in Australian real estate is causing a distortion in the market and making housing less accessible and affordable.’ Leading the inquiry, Kelly O’Dwyer said ‘this inquiry is not focused on investors from any particular country into Australia’s real estate market'. 'The committee will take a very broad and holistic approach to examining whether the current policy settings in this regard are delivering the best possible outcomes for Australia.’ The Foreign Investment review board's annual report for 2012/2013 found that the real estate sector recorded 12,025 foreign investment approvals, compared with 10,118 approvals in 2011‑12. The Sydney Morning Herald reports it has been suggested that the FIRB has not prosecuted a single case since 2006, though the FIRB has said there were 33 ongoing investigations. Simon Henry, the co-CEO of Juwai.com, a Chinese property website, predicted interest by foreign investors has increased. 'We predict Chinese property investment will increase in Australia by 15 to 20 per cent over the next 12 months,' Mr Henry, told Domain. 'The average price of a property a Chinese person is buying in Australia is around US1.36 million,' he said. Mr Hocking said 'the FIRB and Treasury connections are formidable adversaries.

If you repeatedly beat a woman, you'll probably get the same fine. In 2001, county judges heard 98 Protection From Abuse cases, finding the defendant guilty in 48 percent of those cases, either after a hearing or through a technical violation or plea. Of those found guilty, the majority were ordered to pay court costs, plus a 100 fine. No defendants were ordered to pay more than a 250 fine for violating the court order. In 27 percent of the cases, the charges were dismissed or the defendant was found not guilty. In the rest of the cases, charges were withdrawn or the matter is not yet resolved. Sarah T. Casey, executive director of Schuylkill Women in Crisis, finds it disturbing that in most cases, the fine for violating a PFA is little more than the fine someone would get for cruelty and abuse toward an animal. \\"In most of the counties surrounding Schuylkill County, the penalties given for indirect criminal contempt are much stiffer than those in Schuylkill County,\\" Casey said. \\"What kind of message are we sending those who repeatedly violate Protection From Abuse orders? That it's OK to abuse women in Schuylkill County, because you'll only get a slap on the wrist?\\" Under state law, the minimum fine for contempt of a PFA is 100; the maximum fine is 1,000 and up to six months in jail. Like others who are familiar with how the county's legal system does and doesn't work for victims of domestic violence, Casey believes some changes are in order. Valerie West, a manager/attorney with Mid-Penn Legal Services, with offices in Pottsville and Reading, regularly handles domestic violence cases. She finds fault with the local requirement that a custody order must be established within 30 days after a PFA is filed. West said she feels a custody order should be allowed to stand for the full term of the PFA - up to 18 months - as it does in many other counties in the state. \\"It places an undue burden on the plaintiff, in terms of cost, finding legal representation and facing their abuser - not to mention a further burden on the system to provide those services,\\" West said. \\"It may be difficult for the parties to reach an agreement so soon after violence has occurred.

His attempts to land a job lead him to Benjamin Franklin's printing shop. He helps Franklin erase his debts, create a successful newspaper, invent new devices, and even helps make him more popular and respected with the people of the city.After Franklin involves Amos, without his permission, in the famous kite electricity experiment that nearly kills him, Amos is outraged and leaves him. Franklin's attempts to work alone prove disastrous such as a failed diplomatic mission to the King that pushes the colonies to open armed revolt.They finally reconcile in 1776 when Franklin begs Amos to return and agrees to sign a contract drafted by the mouse for more considerate treatment. Furthermore, as Franklin examines the agreement, Thomas Jefferson arrives to ask for help for the beginning of the Declaration of Independence he is writing.

Look on the label for how much trans fat is in a product. Ideally, you should be eating a product with zero trans fat. You can find trans fat listed underneath fat and saturated fat. Manufacturers now are required to list trans fat content on their labels. Look for the phrases \\"partially hydrogenated,\\" \\"hydrogenated,\\" or \\"shortening.\\" These types of ingredients contain trans fat. If a product says 0 grams (0.0 oz) of trans fat, it might not be zero. Look for the word \\"hydrogenated\\" in the ingredients. This means the food contains trans fat. The FDA allows food manufacturers to list trans fat as 0 grams (0.0 oz) if it contains less than 0.5 grams (0.02 oz) of trans fat. Multiple servings of foods with hydrogenated oils, even if it says zero grams of trans fat, can negatively affect your health. When eating out, ask the server what oil is used to prepare your food. If possible, request a healthier oil. Another option is to skip the deep fried foods and opt instead for grilled, steamed, sauteed, or baked. Steamed and grilled items are the least likely to contain trans fats. Be careful with added items such as salad dressing and condiments, which can contain trans fats.

Alana is sequestered in a locked compartment for her safety, but the killer is still aboard, stalking her. The killer enters the compartment but Alana escapes, and is pursued by the killer through the train. In the final scene, the masked killer is revealed to be Kenny who was disguised half the time as the magician's female assistant. Kenny refuses Alana's apology and forces her to kiss him, but the kiss causes Kenny to relive his memories of the prank, driving him deeper into insanity.

Between then and its own merger with Boeing in 1997, it produced a number of well-known commercial and military aircraft such as the DC-10 airliner and F-15 Eagle air-superiority fighter. - The Kamov Ka - 118 is a projected light multirole helicopter with the NOTAR ( NO TAil Rotor ) configuration based on the McDonnell Douglas design . - The Douglas Aircraft Company was an American aerospace manufacturer based in Southern California. It was founded in 1921 by Donald Wills Douglas, Sr. and later merged with McDonnell Aircraft in 1967 to form McDonnell Douglas. Douglas Aircraft Company largely operated as a division of McDonnell Douglas (MD) after the merger. MD later merged with Boeing in 1997. - The Coand effect (or ) is the tendency of a fluid jet to stay attached to a convex surface. A better definition has been provided by Henri Coand in different patents and have been reported by Merriam Webster dictionary: \\"the tendency of a jet of fluid emerging from an orifice to follow an adjacent flat or curved surface and to entrain fluid from the surroundings so that a region of lower pressure develops.\\" The pressure effect, which is usually not indicated, is fundamental for the comprehension of the Coand effect. - In physics and fluid mechanics, a boundary layer is an important concept and refers to the layer of fluid in the immediate vicinity of a bounding surface where the effects of viscosity are significant. - The tail rotor is a smaller rotor mounted so that it rotates vertically or near-vertically at the end of the tail of a traditional single-rotor helicopter. The tail rotor's position and distance from the center of gravity allow it to develop thrust in the same direction as the main rotor's rotation, to counter the torque effect created by the main rotor. Tail rotors are simpler than main rotors since they require only collective changes in pitch to vary thrust. The pitch of the tail rotor blades is adjustable by the pilot via the anti-torque pedals, which also provide directional control by allowing the pilot to rotate the helicopter around its vertical axis. - The McDonnell Aircraft Corporation was an American aerospace manufacturer based in St. Louis, Missouri. The company was founded on July 6, 1939 by James Smith McDonnell, and was best known for its military fighters, including the F-4 Phantom II, and manned spacecraft including the Mercury capsule and Gemini capsule. McDonnell Aircraft later merged with the Douglas Aircraft Company to form McDonnell Douglas in 1967. - A helicopter is a type of rotorcraft in which lift and thrust are supplied by rotors. This allows the helicopter to take off and land vertically, to hover, and to fly forward, backward, and laterally. These attributes allow helicopters to be used in congested or isolated areas where fixed-wing aircraft and many forms of VTOL (vertical takeoff and landing) aircraft cannot perform. - Hughes Helicopters was a major manufacturer of military and civil helicopters from the 1950s to the 1980s. - NOTAR (\\"no\\" \\"ta\\"il \\"r\\"otor) is the name of a helicopter system which avoids the use of a tail rotor. It was developed by McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Systems (through their acquisition of Hughes Helicopters). The system uses a fan inside the tailboom to build a high volume of low-pressure air, which exits through two slots and creates a boundary layer flow of air along the tailboom utilizing the Coand effect. The boundary layer changes the direction of airflow around the tailboom, creating thrust opposite the motion imparted to the fuselage by the torque effect of the main rotor. Directional yaw control is gained through a vented, rotating drum at the end of the tailboom, called the direct jet thruster. Advocates of NOTAR believe the system offers quieter and safer operation. - The Boeing Company is an American multinational corporation that designs, manufactures, and sells airplanes, rotorcraft, rockets, and satellites worldwide. The company also provides leasing and product support services. Boeing is among the largest global aircraft manufacturers; it is the second-largest defense contractor in the world based on 2015 revenue, and is the largest exporter in the United States by dollar value. Boeing stock is a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. - The fuselage (from the French \\"fuselé\\" \\"spindle-shaped\\") is an aircraft's main body section that holds crew and passengers or cargo. In single-engine aircraft it will usually contain an engine, although in some amphibious aircraft the single engine is mounted on a pylon attached to the fuselage which in turn is used as a floating hull. The fuselage also serves to position control and stabilization surfaces in specific relationships to lifting surfaces, required for aircraft stability and maneuverability. What is the relationship between 'kamov ka-118' and 'aircraft'? The answer to this question is:","response":"The Kamov Ka-118 is a projected light multirole helicopter with the NOTAR (NO TAil Rotor) configuration based on the McDonnell Douglas design.

Marlin rode low in the saddle, his shoulders curled against the hungry wind. His hat was pulled down tight and his eyes didn't move as he passed the crude shacks at the edge of town.

When he turned to face the room they were all watching him. \\"I'm looking for a man named Kraamer,\\" Marlin said. \\"Anybody here know of him?\\" One of the cowboys turned casually and rang the spittoon with a stream of tobacco juice. Marlin knew the long, thin face from somewhere, the blond hair that fell limply to his shoulders. He smiled at Marlin and showed his brown-stained teeth. Marlin felt the lines in his own face, the gray in his hair, the chill in his bones. He was too old for this. He set a half dollar on the bar and started for the door. \\"Don't get in a huff,\\" the bartender said. Marlin looked back. \\"Kraamer lives about a mile west of town.

Movie title: The Dentist Movie plot: Dr. Alan Feinstone is a successful dentist. However, everything changes on the day of his wedding anniversary, when he discovers his wife Brooke is cheating on him with the poolman, Matt. After they finish, Alan retrieves his pistol and follows Matt in his car. He is led to Paula Roberts's house, a friend of Brooke's. Alan invents a story about a surprise party for Brooke and watches Paula invite Matt inside. Paula's dog attacks Alan, and he shoots it in self-defense. After returning to his car, he drives to work. At his dental practice, Alan's first appointment goes poorly when he hallucinates a child has rotten teeth and accidentally stabs him. As Detective Gibbs investigates the death of Paula's dog, Alan sees his second patient, April Reign, a beauty queen. Alan hallucinates she is his wife, and, while she is unconscious, takes off her pantyhose and fondles her before choking her. As she wakes, Alan snaps out of it and hides her pantyhose. Alan tells his manager, Steve Landers, she is still dizzy from nitrous oxide. When Steve realizes what really happened, he returns, punches Alan, and threatens a lawsuit. Alan ends the day early and sends his staff and patients home, including Sarah, a teenager who wants to have her braces removed. Later that night, Brooke meets Alan at a new opera-themed room at his practice. After sedating her under the premise of cleaning her teeth, he pulls out her teeth and cuts off her tongue. Detective Gibbs and his partner Detective Sunshine arrive at Alan's house the next morning to ask him questions. After the policemen leave, Matt discovers Brooke, who is still alive but sedated. Alan stabs Matt to death. Sarah and Paula are waiting for Alan at his practice. Alan sees Paula first, much to Sarah's disappointment. When Paula's conversation turns to how good a job Matt does for her, Alan overly-aggressively drills into her tooth, destroying it.

It is hardly a sequel of Ninja Scroll. Do not waste your money on this. Animation is little better than some saturday American-made cartoons. Is the review positive or negative? A:","response":"The review provided is negative in nature. The reviewer has expressed multiple unfavorable opinions about the video, suggesting that it is not a good purchase. Firstly, the review states that the video is \\"definitely not for kids,\\" indicating that the content may be inappropriate for younger audiences. This point would likely dissuade potential buyers who are looking for family-friendly content. Secondly, the reviewer claims that the video is \\"hardly a sequel of Ninja Scroll,\\" signaling disappointment with the lack of connection to a well-known title. By introducing the context of a desirable predecessor, the review implies that the video falls short of expectations that may have been set by fans of the original Ninja Scroll. Moreover, the reviewer advises others not to waste their money on this video, reinforcing the negative tone of the review. This strong statement serves to further dissuade potential buyers from investing in the video, as it implies that there is little value in the content. Lastly, the review comments on the lackluster animation quality, comparing it to \\"some Saturday American-made cartoons.\\" This comparison suggests that the video has an underwhelming visual aesthetic, as opposed to the high-quality animation that may be expected from a well-done sequel to Ninja Scroll. By criticizing this aspect of the video, the reviewer is pointing out another con that deters potential buyers from purchasing it. In conclusion, the review exhibits a negative sentiment towards the video as it highlights several disappointing elements, such as unsuitable content for children, weak connection to a well-known title, poor value for money, and subpar animation quality. These factors collectively paint a disapproving picture of the video, discouraging potential buyers from considering it as a viable entertainment option."},{"question":"Slaking California’s Thirst-if Politics Allows Israel has made the desert bloom, but the task hasn’t always been an easy one.

Whereas in the First Great Awakening, Methodist and Baptist preachers had opposed slavery and urged manumission, over the decades they made more of an accommodation with the institution. They worked with slaveholders in the South to urge a paternalistic institution. Both denominations made direct appeals to slaves and free blacks for conversion. The Baptists particularly allowed them active roles in congregations. By the mid-19th century, northern Baptists tended to oppose slavery. As tensions increased, in 1844 the Home Mission Society refused to appoint a slaveholder as a missionary who had been proposed by Georgia. It noted that missionaries could not take servants with them, and also that the Board did not want to appear to condone slavery. Please answer a question about this article.

Always a fan favorite at the U.S. Open, and the 2003 champion, Andy Roddick headed into retirement with a 6-7 (1), 7-6 (4), 6-2, 6-4 loss to Juan Martin del Potro of Argentina in the fourth round at Flushing Meadows on Wednesday. It was an emotional farewell for Roddick, who sat in his changeover chair, covering his face with a white towel, after sailing a running forehand long on the last point.

Hopefully I'll come back to this place someday and see all of you again.\\" While most eyes were on Roddick, a packed card of matches featuring eight Grand Slam champions were in action after Tuesday's persistent rain, in which just two of six singles matches were completed. Play got underway about two hours late just after 1 p.m. ET due to early sprinkles, but soon Maria Sharapova and Marion Bartoli were barking and fist-pumping furiously in a quarterfinal clash on Ashe. The 2006 champion from Russia improved to 12-0 in three set matches this year by beating No. 11 seed Bartoli of France 3-6, 6-3, 6-4. Sharapova trailed 0-4 on Tuesday when play was halted.

The No. 3 Scot stormed back from a 1-5 second-set deficit to hold off Marin Cilic of Croatia 3-6, 7-6 (7-4), 6-2, 6-0 in a match played on Louis Armstrong Stadium. The 2008 U.S. Open runner-up will face No. 6 Tomas Berdych, who stunned top-ranked Roger Federer 7-6 (7-1), 6-4, 3-6, 6-3 in the second night match on Arthur Ashe Stadium. Federer was bidding for his sixth U.S. Open title and 18th major championship. \\"There is no better moment than this one so far,\\" said Berdych, who made it to the finals of Wimbledon in 2010 before losing to Rafael Nadal. In men's fourth-round action, defending champion Novak Djokovic advanced to face del Potro when his opponent, No. 18 Stanislas Wawrinka, stopped because of illness while trailing 6-4, 6-1, 3-1. Djokovic's Serbian Davis Cup teammate, No. 8 Janko Tipsarevic, beat No. 19 Philipp Kohlschreiber of Germany 6-3, 7-6 (7-5), 6-2.

She showed the famous Roddick wit is a family trait. \\"He must have known I was running out of clothes,\\" she laughed. ||||| Andy Roddick sure knows how to make an exit. Since announcing last week that the 2012 US Open will be the final tournament of his career, Roddick's been all the talk on the men’s side. Yet he’s still around, and finds himself as the last American man in the draw for the 17th time in his career in a Grand Slam. However, it didn't come easily. Roddick came into the game after a dominant era of American tennis, dealing with constant pressure and criticism from the press. “From the beginning of my career, [I’ve] been up against it,” Roddick said via US Open.org. “I’m following the greatest generation ever from one place. That was never going to be an easy path.” Roddick didn’t let history or the negativity of the press get to him, and carried U.S. expectations better than any other American player in the last decade. One of the main reasons Roddick was the top American for the majority of his career was because of his health. Mardy Fish, James Blake, Robby Ginepri and Sam Querrey all had major health concerns throughout their careers which took them out of the game for long periods. Since establishing himself at the top of the tour in 2003, Roddick has withdrawn from only two Grand Slams—the 2008 and 2011 French Open—which is quite an accomplishment for a player that averaged 130 miles per hour on his serve. Also, Roddick’s game was the strongest compared to his compatriots. Yes, it was based on a massive serve and forehand and not much else. But it was enough to make the second week of Slams, and be in the top tier of the men’s game for nine consecutive years. Julian Finney/Getty Images Andy Roddick celebrates after defeating Andy Murray at the 2009 Wimbledon Championships. Bottom line: Roddick channeled his firepower into consistent results. No other American man during the past decade did it as well as Roddick, which is why he should never be remember for what he didn’t accomplish. Yes, he’s the only American man of his generation with a Slam, but he didn’t fade away like some other one-time winners. He found ways to reinvent his game (see either the 2006 or 2009 seasons) to compete with arguably the hardest tennis generation of the Open era. As Roddick so artfully articulates in his press conferences, he was pretty good for playing the game “wrong.” “I’m the most successful bad player ever. I used to hear a lot that all I could do was hit a serve, I couldn’t volley, I can’t hit a backhand, I don’t return well, and then people would turn around and tell me I’m underachieving. Well, all I’d say is you can’t have it both ways. For a guy who can’t hit a shot, I’ve done OK.” He has done more than OK, and American tennis will sorely miss Roddick as he heads into the next chapter in his life. |||||","response":"Andy Roddick, the 2003 US Open champion and fan favorite, ended his tennis career with a 6-7 (1), 7-6 (4), 6-2, 6-4 loss to Juan Martin del Potro of Argentina in the fourth round at the US Open.

Rationale: Swordfish are an animal native to the ocean and live exclusively there. The question and answer:","response":"Question: What adaptations do swordfish have for surviving in the ocean environment? Answer: Swordfish (Xiphias gladius) are well-adapted to their oceanic environment due to several distinctive features and physiological adaptations. Firstly, their elongated, bill-like upper jaw, which resembles a sword, is a unique characteristic allowing them to slash through schools of fish, making it easier to catch their prey. Secondly, they have a streamlined body shape with a large, crescent-shaped caudal fin, facilitating rapid and agile swimming, reaching speeds up to 50-60 miles per hour. Thirdly, swordfish are known for their excellent eyesight, which is crucial for locating and capturing prey under low-light conditions in the ocean depths. Finally, they possess a specialized heating organ near their eyes and brain, helping them maintain body temperature while diving into the cold depths of the ocean. This adaptation enables swordfish to hunt in a wider range of depths and temperatures than many other marine species."},{"question":"Ask a question about American Idol.","response":"Who are the judges on American Idol, and what do they do?

Sales of other mediums including individual digital tracks, digital albums and compact discs have fallen, the latter having the greatest drop-in-sales rate. Q: What was unique to vinyl sales in 2014?","response":"In 2014, vinyl sales experienced a unique resurgence in the music industry, standing out as the only physical music medium to witness an increase in sales compared to the previous year. This revival of interest in vinyl records was highlighted when artist Jack White sold 40,000 copies of his second solo release, Lazaretto, on vinyl, which beat the largest sales in one week for vinyl records since 1991. This record was previously held by Pearl Jam's Vitalogy, with 34,000 copies sold in one week back in 1994. This upswing in vinyl sales was distinct in a time when sales of other music mediums, such as individual digital tracks, digital albums, and compact discs, were experiencing a decline, with compact discs showing the most significant drop in sales. There are several factors that contributed to the unique appeal and resurgence of vinyl records in 2014. 1. Nostalgia: The vinyl format carries a sense of nostalgia for older generations who grew up with the medium and might have extensive collections they still enjoy. The resurgence also extends to younger generations looking to partake in that nostalgic experience and embrace the \\"retro\\" aesthetic. 2. Tangibility: Vinyl records offer a physical experience that the digital age of music lacks, including album artwork, liner notes, and the tactile feel of handling the record itself, which can foster an emotional connection to the music. 3. Sound Quality: Many music enthusiasts argue that vinyl offers a warmer and more authentic sound quality compared to digital formats, emphasizing the slight imperfections, such as crackles or pops, that can make listening to a vinyl record a unique experience. 4. Collectability: Vinyl records have become highly collectible items, with rare pressings and limited edition releases often fetching high prices on the collector's market. Some fans enjoy the thrill of hunting for these valuable records. 5. Community: Record stores and vinyl communities have earned a loyal following, fostering social connections among music enthusiasts who share their passion for collecting and discussing music in a physical form. In conclusion, the unique growth in vinyl sales in 2014 signifies the enduring appeal of this music format, as well as the evolving preferences of music lovers who appreciate the authentic sound, tangible experience, and collectability aspect that vinyl records offer, setting it apart from other mediums during that time."},{"question":"Options: +To force people to keep in learning new skills throughout their working life.; +To provide teachers with extra income.; +To allow people to have chances to receive education throughout their life.; +To prevent students from learning at school.; Read the following article and answer the question.

The movie is set in 1985, in the fictional town of Quatssack, New Hampshire. Quatssack seems like a nice, ordinary town, but it harbors a dark and deadly secret: it is the home of the Children of the Yeti, an evil cult that worships a yeti that lives in the woods. The yeti was captured in the Himalayas and brought to the town as an old man′s sideshow, but had escaped, and is reportedly the last of its kind. Each night, Debra, one of its members, lures young men to the cult with the intention of offering it up to the yeti as a means of keeping it sexually sated. The movie opens up with such an example, with Debra and Raymond, the cult′s leader, looking on while laughing sadistically. Five college students—fraternity brothers Adam and Dick, their girlfriends Sally and Emily, and a fifth member named Joe—are coming to Quatssack on a camping trip, unaware of the town′s secrets. On their first night, Joe is killed while going to the bathroom in the woods, and since he was the one who had the car keys, the remaining four cannot leave town. The old man, who now owns a hideous-looking creature called \\"Tentacle Boy\\" and displays it as a sideshow, informs them of the yeti that he used to own now living somewhere in the woods. Emily goes into a nearby church to pray for Joe′s safety, and while she is in there, she is discovered by a priest as a \\"Chosen One\\" that was prophesied to take down the Children of the Yeti.

I love the hot weather, the skimpy clothes, the summer fruits and the party seasons. I only have good memories of summer - Christmas time, six weeks holidays when in school then three months off whilst at uni. In my eyes, there is not one bad thing about summer. That is why I hate the First of March. Yes, it is still hot. Yes, my summer fruits are still in season and I can still wear my skimpy clothes, but, in my mind, it means that winter is near. The weather is only going to get colder and my favourite time of the year is official over. In an attempt to lift my end of Summer blues I decided to give myself a bright, cheerful manicure. The colour I choose was a luscious purple cream from butter LONDON called Molly-Coddled. It was just about opaque after one coat, just ever so slightly streaky. Two coats, completely opaque and streak free. If you haven't previously heard of butter LONDON, it is a nail polish brand with a massive range of high fashion colours and it's products are formulated without the use of the harmful ingredients like Formaldehyde, Toluene, DBP or Parabens. butter LONDON was the first company to sell 3 Free nail lacquer in the United States.

Under the draft proposal, the president would be able to serve up to two additional five-year terms, officials who saw the draft told Reuters. The president would have sweeping power and would not need to consult his parliament on most executive matters. ISRAEL APPOINTS FIRST AMBASSADOR TO TURKEY SINCE GAZA SPAT The report said the party was looking to hold a referendum next spring and was searching for support to win approval. Any constitutional change would need at least 367 out of 500 deputies in the assembly to give the OK, Reuters added. “We will continue to seek a base for consensus with the other parties,” Prime Minister Binali Yildirim told a conference of AKP provincial heads in Ankara. “After that, the decision lies with the people.” SYRIAN PRESIDENT ASSAD CLAIMS TRUMP COULD BE A 'NATURAL ALLY' The report said Erdogan has benefited from nationalist support after the failed military coup in July, and has cracked down on dissent in big ways. Close to 37,000 people have been arrested, more than 100,000 people dismissed or suspended from government jobs, and 170 media outlets and scores of businesses and associations have been shut down over alleged ties to a movement led by Fethullah Gulen, the Pennsylvania-based Muslim cleric whom Turkey accuses of masterminding the coup attempt. Turkish police detained the chief editor and at least 11 senior staff of Turkey's opposition Cumhuriyet newspaper last week. The detentions involving Cumhuriyet — one of Turkey's oldest newspapers — come amid accusations by opposition parties and human rights groups that Turkey's government is using the state of emergency imposed following a failed military coup to clamp down not only on alleged coup plotters, but on all government critics.

The answer is:","response":"Title: Strawberry Shortcake: Saints, Sinners and Strings Plot: In the small town of Willowridge, the local church has been struggling to attract younger parishioners to attend services. The traditional organ music and hymns just aren't appealing to a younger audience. Father Fitzgerald, the passionate and caring spiritual leader of the community, is desperate to bring in new worshippers and connect with the youth. One day, Father Fitzgerald's nephew, Ben, comes to visit. Ben is a rebellious, talented musician who's just been kicked out of his rock band, Strawberry Shortcake, for being too wild and unpredictable. Needing a place to stay and a purpose, he reluctantly accepts his uncle's offer to spend a few months in Willowridge. As Ben spends more time at the church, he starts to befriend a group of local teenagers who share his love of music. They form a bond and begin to play music together. This gives Ben the idea to \\"jazz up\\" the church music by introducing a new band to replace the organ. With mixed feelings, Father Fitzgerald allows Ben and his new friends to form the rock band Strawberry Shortcake and perform during services. The new music quickly becomes an attraction and the church starts to transform from a dying institution to a lively and vibrant place. As the congregation grows, so does the band's popularity, and Strawberry Shortcake soon becomes the talk of the town. But this newfound success also brings challenges and temptations. The band members must navigate fame, relationships, and potentially losing the very essence that brought them together in the first place. In the midst of all this, they also discover a hidden secret about the church's past, revealing a connection between Strawberry Shortcake's music and an ancient legend.

In 1059, during the pontificate of Nicholas II, cardinals were given the right to elect the pope under the Papal Bull In nomine Domini.

Presley's only child, Lisa Marie, was born on February 1, 1968, during a period when he had grown deeply unhappy with his career. Of the eight Presley singles released between January 1967 and May 1968, only two charted in the top 40, and none higher than number 28. His forthcoming soundtrack album, Speedway, would rank at number 82 on the Billboard chart. Parker had already shifted his plans to television, where Presley had not appeared since the Sinatra Timex show in 1960. He maneuvered a deal with NBC that committed the network to both finance a theatrical feature and broadcast a Christmas special.Recorded in late June in Burbank, California, the special, simply called Elvis, aired on December 3, 1968. Later known as the '68 Comeback Special, the show featured lavishly staged studio productions as well as songs performed with a band in front of a small audience—Presley's first live performances since 1961. The live segments saw Presley dressed in tight black leather, singing and playing guitar in an uninhibited style reminiscent of his early rock and roll days. Director and co-producer Steve Binder had worked hard to produce a show that was far from the hour of Christmas songs Parker had originally planned. The show, NBC's highest rated that season, captured 42 percent of the total viewing audience. Jon Landau of Eye magazine remarked, \\"There is something magical about watching a man who has lost himself find his way back home.

After the kerogen molecules crack and break up into shorter and lighter molecules composed almost solely of carbon and hydrogen atoms, these molecules further undergo a process of diagenesis and catagenesis. As temperature and pressure continue to increase in the sedimentary basin, these shorter and lighter molecules transform into a complex mixture of hydrocarbon compounds, which are the main components of fossil fuels. During the diagenesis stage, any water trapped within the sediment is expelled, and the kerogen starts to decompose into smaller molecular fragments. This stage occurs at relatively low temperatures (50°C to 100°C) and pressures in the subsurface. As the temperature and pressure continue to rise beyond the diagenesis stage, the catagenesis stage begins. Catagenesis occurs at temperatures ranging from 100°C to 200°C and involves the thermal cracking of the complex organic molecules into simpler hydrocarbon compounds. This results in the formation of oil, natural gas, and other hydrocarbon by-products. Some of the gaseous by-products formed during catagenesis are methane, ethane, propane, and butane, which are collectively known as natural gas. Eventually, the transformed hydrocarbon compounds, along with any remaining water, migrate upwards through the porous and permeable rock layers due to buoyancy, as they are lighter than the surrounding rock and water. This upward migration continues until the hydrocarbons are trapped by an impermeable rock layer, known as a cap rock, or until they escape to the Earth's surface and dissipate into the atmosphere. The trapped hydrocarbons form oil and gas reservoirs, which can be found in various geological structures, such as anticlines, faults, and stratigraphic traps. These reservoirs can later be discovered and tapped into for the extraction and production of the valuable fossil fuels – oil and natural gas – that power the modern world. In summary, the final step in the described process is the formation and accumulation of hydrocarbons, leading to the creation of oil and natural gas reservoirs. These fossil fuels are crucial resources for meeting global energy demands and supporting modern society."},{"question":"Here is a news article: Washington (CNN) Republicans and Democrats in the Senate don't agree on much.

The Jester sacrifices himself with a bomb to allow Luthor a chance to get away, killing J'edd J'arkus (the Martian Manhunter's opposite) and Angelique (Hawkgirl's counterpart) who has just stabbed him with her flaming sword, in the process. Lex Luthor is confronted by the remaining Syndicate members, only to activate his dimensional travel device and escape to the Earth of the heroic Justice League, they are delayed thinking his device is a weapon. Once there, he turns himself over to the police, who he knows will think he's the evil Luthor from this world and thereby summon the Justice League. Superman's x-ray vision confirms Lex Luthor's reversed organs mean that he's from a parallel Earth, and that \\"their\\" Lex Luthor is still in the Stryker's Island prison, so the League agrees to hear Lex out. Lex tells his story and asks the League for help: his Earth is being extorted by the Syndicate, who have taken control of all of Earth and systematically eliminated Luthor's Justice League members. The only thing holding them in check is the threat of a nuclear response. While waiting outside the League's meeting room, he hides the Quantum Trigger. All members of the League agree, except for Batman, who argues that the League is spread too thin for the problems of their own world, let alone Luthor's. Luthor transports the remaining members of the League to his universe, while Batman stays behind to finish building the Watchtower. Arriving at Justice League headquarters on Lex's parallel Earth, they find the Syndicate and must soon retreat.

On a tally of 58 to 42, a procedural vote failed to get the supermajority 60 votes it needed to advance. Supporters of the USA Freedom Act, a rare mix of liberal Democrats and libertarian Republicans, hoped public outrage over the secret mass collection of phone and Internet records -- revealed by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden -- would lead to passage of the reforms. But many opponents argued the changes would hamper the National Security Agency's ability to track nimble and elusive terrorists. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell led the charge against the bill, saying the new rules would prevent the United States from capturing the terrorists who killed Peter Kassig, a U.S. citizen doing aid work in Syria. Kassig was executed over the weekend. \\"Many of these fighters are familiar with America's intelligence capabilities, and many are savvy with communications. These are terrorists who know how to use encryption, and they how to change devices quickly,\\" he said. \\"This is the worst time to be tying our hands behind our backs.\\" \\"It basically takes us back to a pre-9/11 lack of capacity to identify terrorists making telephone calls in the United States, said Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the second-ranking Senate Republican. \\"I think that sort of unilateral disarmament would be bad for the country.\\" McConnell also argued the measure should be debated and voted on in the new Congress next year, not by lawmakers in a lame duck session who are leaving Washington. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, the bill's principal author, disputed the critics saying that while it puts checks on the NSA's powerful capabilities, it \\"does so responsibly.\\" \\"The bill contains key reforms to safeguard Americans' privacy by prohibiting the indiscriminate collection of their data. It also provides for greater accountability and transparency of the government's surveillance programs,\\" he said. \\"The bill also ensures that the intelligence community has the tools it needs to keep our country safe.\\" Under the bill, the government could no longer store massive amounts of call information in its databases, a practice President Barack Obama said he wanted to end. That job would fall to the large telecommunication companies. But the government could get permission from a secret surveillance court to review specific call information if it could show it might be linked to terrorists. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, said this arrangement \\"solves\\" a \\"very practical problem\\" raised by those who are uncomfortable with the government storing calling records of Americans. But Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said the public's privacy would be better protected by strict federal government safeguards of that information than by the thousands of employees at private phone companies. In a statement Monday, the White House urged passage of the bill. \\"This legislation will help strengthen Americans' confidence in the government's use of these important national security authorities. Without passage of this bill, critical authorities that are appropriately reformed in this legislation could expire next summer. The administration urges Congress to take action on this legislation now, since delay may subject these important national security authorities to brinksmanship and uncertainty.\\" The bill is supported by a coalition of technology companies, including Google, Apple, AOL, Microsoft and Yahoo, who have deep concerns that their customers' privacy is being violated by the current NSA techniques. Supporters suffered a setback last week when Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, who had favored the measure, announced he would not back it. However, other like-minded Republicans such as Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Sen. Mike Lee of Utah voted to advance the bill.","response":"1.

Answer: It is not possible to tell. Justification: Natural disasters encompass a wide range of events such as earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods, among others. Each of these events is governed by an intricate web of variables and factors that contribute to their formation and severity. The complexity of these events and our limited understanding of the exact conditions that trigger them make it impossible for us to accurately predict every natural disaster before it occurs. For instance, to predict an earthquake, scientists would need to monitor tectonic plate movement, stress levels, and other geological factors, but even then, their predictions would be based on probabilities rather than certainties. In the case of hurricanes and tornadoes, meteorologists take into account air pressure, temperature, humidity, and wind patterns, but the chaotic nature of the Earth's weather systems still poses significant challenges to accurate prediction. Besides this inherent unpredictability, our prediction capabilities are also limited by the accessibility and reliability of our monitoring techniques, as well as the precision of our prediction models. While substantial progress has been made in early warning systems and disaster preparedness in recent years, these limitations still prevent us from making precise and accurate predictions about every natural disaster that might occur. In conclusion, despite ongoing advancements in technology and our growing understanding of the earth's processes, accurately predicting every natural disaster remains beyond our reach, justifying the answer that \\"it is not possible to tell.\\""},{"question":"Russian girls think he is the ideal boyfriend.

With no fresh creative inspiration, he worked in the British Museum to transcribe the music of English composer Cipriani Potter, and made a solo version of \\"Bethlehem Down\\" with organ accompaniment. On the evening of 16 December Heseltine met with Van Dieren and his wife for a drink and invited them home afterwards. According to Van Dieren, the visitors left at about 12:15 a.m. Neighbours later reported sounds of movement and of a piano in the early morning. When Peache, who had been away, returned early on 17 December, she found the doors and windows bolted, and smelled coal gas. The police broke into the flat and found Heseltine unconscious; he was declared dead shortly afterwards, apparently as the result of coal gas poisoning.An inquest was held on 22 December; the jury could not determine whether the death was accidental or suicide and an open verdict was returned. Most commentators have considered suicide the more likely cause; Heseltine's close friend Lionel Jellinek and Peache both recalled that he had previously threatened to take his life by gas and the outline of a new will was found among the papers in the flat. Much later, Nigel Heseltine introduced a new theory—that his father had been murdered by Van Dieren, the sole beneficiary of Heseltine's 1920 will, which stood to be revoked by the new one. This theory is not considered tenable by most commentators. The suicide theory is supported (arguably), by the (supposed, accepted) fact that Heseltine/Warlock had put his young cat outside the room before he had turned on the lethal gas.Philip Heseltine was buried alongside his father at Godalming cemetery on 20 December 1930. In late February 1931, a memorial concert of his music was held at the Wigmore Hall; a second such concert took place in the following December.In 2011 the art critic Brian Sewell published his memoirs, in which he claimed that he was Heseltine's illegitimate son, born in..., what would be the answer ?

Willow town used hardwoods, while Pine town used softwoods. But I can use this background: Conifers have many uses. They are important sources of lumber and are also used to make paper. Resins, the sticky substance you might see oozing out of a wound on a pine tree, are collected from conifers to make a variety of products, such as the solvent turpentine and the rosin used by musicians and baseball players. The sticky rosin improves the pitcher’s hold on the ball or increases the friction between the bow and the strings to help create music from a violin or other stringed instrument.

Jon departs from a specific place or situation Step 2: Compare both sentences to determine entailment, contradiction, or independence.

Sentence 1 states that Jon did not remain in a specific place or situation, while sentence 2 states that Jon departed from a specific place or situation. Step 3: Determine if entailment exists. If Jon did not stay, it implies that he must have left or decided not to remain in the place/situation.

Context: Creating a self portrait is not your typical selfie! When I taught in the traditional classroom, creating self portraits was something I had students do whether they were four or nine. In fact, I’d have them draw one on the first day of school and one toward the end of the year and to see the change over time was always so interesting. At least once during the year, likely toward the beginning, I would center a lesson around self portraits. In younger classes, there would be more than one. Creating a self portrait teaches students to be aware of themselves. Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs? It also teaches children spatial awareness. Where should he begin…with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper? A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself. I am going to start with my head.” Use your hands to show your actual head on yourself so students are aware of what you talking about. The visuals also help English Language Learners (if you’re teaching in an English speaking classroom.) and build vocabulary for all students.

A station wagon drives into town. Young Charlie Brown (Gary Crutcher) tells the townsfolk that the sheriff will be bringing the body into town. There have been other incidents involving livestock. His sister, Ann Brown (Jolene Brand) nods in agreement. The incidents seem to be localized to Devil's Crag. Sheriff Parker (Bob Steele) pulls up in a pickup truck. Parker explains that \\"The coroner's report shows Banks died of a brutal beating at the hands of a person or persons unknown.\\" The Café Owner (Oliver Blake) pulls back the tarp covering the body.

Another tells Ann to talk to some of the Indians that still populate the town. A well inebriated Indian Joe (Billy Dix) sitting on the stoop of the bait and tackle shop giggles and warns, \\"All white men die.\\" He then laughs maniacally. The Sheriff asks Joe is he knows anything about the death of Banks. Joe is annoyed that the white men think he's crazy. Joe reluctantly leaves town, but first warns the sheriff, \\"People who walk on Indian grave die.\\" The sheriff puts Devil's Crag off limits.

These methods are dependent on factors such as your budget, available utilities and resources, and how urgently you need the garlic press. Below are three different approaches that make sense for acquiring a garlic press: 1. Purchasing a Garlic Press: The most straightforward and efficient approach is to buy a garlic press from a store or online marketplace. Here are the steps for going about it: a. Research: Start by gathering information on the best garlic presses available in the market. Look for reviews and compare prices to ensure you get the best value for your money. Consider factors such as material, easy cleaning, durability, and ease of use. b. Select a Platform: Once you have gathered sufficient information, choose whether to buy from a physical store or an online marketplace. Online marketplaces tend to offer a wider variety of products and allow you to read reviews from previous buyers. Physical stores, on the other hand, enable you to examine the product in person before purchasing. c. Make a Purchase: Place your order or buy the garlic press in-store, and pay for it using your preferred payment method. d. Use the Garlic Press: After receiving the product, follow the manufacturer's guidelines to clean and use the garlic press effectively. 2. Borrowing a Garlic Press: If you only require the garlic press for a short while or on a one-time basis, borrowing from a friend or family member may be the most practical solution. Here are the steps to follow: a. Identify Contacts: Get in touch with friends, family, or neighbors who may have a garlic press that they are willing to lend. b. Borrow the Garlic Press: Arrange to pick up the garlic press at a time that works for both parties. Be sure to express your gratitude and clarify the duration for which you will need the press. c. Clean and Use the Press: Before using the borrowed garlic press, clean it thoroughly, then follow the necessary guidelines while cooking. d. Return the Press: After using the garlic press, clean it again, and return it to the owner within the agreed time frame, preferably sooner than expected to show your appreciation. 3. DIY Garlic Press: If you are unable to purchase or borrow a garlic press, you may consider creating a makeshift garlic press using readily available materials. Here are some ideas: a. Fork and Cutting Board: Place the unpeeled garlic cloves on a cutting board and use the back of a fork to press down on them. Then, scrape the crushed garlic from the fork and use it as required. b. Chef's Knife: You can also use the side of a wide blade chef's knife to crush individual garlic cloves. Place the clove on a cutting board, lay the knife blade flat on it, and using the heel of your hand, press down on the blade until the garlic is crushed. Be sure to exercise caution while handling the knife. Each of these methods has its advantages and drawbacks. Purchasing a garlic press is straightforward but may incur an additional expense; borrowing is cost-effective but relies on the availability of a lender; and DIY solutions may be resourceful but not as effective or convenient as using an actual garlic press. Choose the method that best aligns with your needs and circumstances to accomplish your goal of obtaining a garlic press."},{"question":"Answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"Who was brought up in the conversation of Mary's holiness?\\" is in \\"It is admitted that the doctrine as defined by Pius IX was not explicitly mooted before the 12th century. It is also agreed that \\"no direct or categorical and stringent proof of the dogma can be brought forward from Scripture\\". But it is claimed that the doctrine is implicitly contained in the teaching of the Fathers. Their expressions on the subject of the sinlessness of Mary are, it is pointed out, so ample and so absolute that they must be taken to include original sin as well as actual. Thus in the first five centuries such epithets as \\"in every respect holy\\", \\"in all things unstained\\", \\"super-innocent\\", and \\"singularly holy\\" are applied to her; she is compared to Eve before the fall, as ancestress of a redeemed people; she is \\"the earth before it was accursed\\". The well-known words of St. Augustine (d. 430) may be cited: \\"As regards the mother of God,\\" he says, \\"I will not allow any question whatever of sin.\\" It is true that he is here speaking directly of actual or personal sin. But his argument is that all men are sinners; that they are so through original depravity; that this original depravity may be overcome by the grace of God, and he adds that he does not know but that Mary may have had sufficient grace to overcome sin \\"of every sort\\" (omni ex parte).\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","response":"The answer to the question \\"Who was brought up in the conversation of Mary's holiness?\\" is not explicitly mentioned in the given text. However, the text does provide detailed information on the development of the doctrine of Mary's sinlessness and how it was perceived by various early Christian theologians and the church. In the passage, it is stated that the doctrine of Mary's sinlessness, as defined by Pius IX, was not explicitly discussed before the 12th century. The text acknowledges that there is no direct or categorical evidence of this dogma in the Scripture. However, it is argued that the doctrine is implicitly contained in the teachings of the early Church Fathers. Several epithets such as \\"in every respect holy\\", \\"in all things unstained\\", \\"super-innocent\\", and \\"singularly holy\\" were applied to Mary in the first five centuries. She was often compared to Eve before the fall, as the ancestress of a redeemed people. Furthermore, she was described as \\"the earth before it was accursed\\", implying her sinlessness. St. Augustine (d. 430) was one of the prominent Church Fathers who touched upon the subject of Mary's sinlessness. In his writings, he stated, \\"As regards the mother of God, I will not allow any question whatever of sin.\\" Although his statement is mainly referring to actual or personal sin, his argument suggests that all individuals are sinners through original depravity. According to St. Augustine, this original depravity can be overcome through God's grace, and he speculates that Mary may have had sufficient grace to overcome sin in every aspect (omni ex parte). In summary, although the text doesn't explicitly mention who was brought up in the conversation of Mary's holiness, it does provide an in-depth analysis of how the doctrine of Mary's sinlessness developed over time, the expressions used by early Church Fathers, and the theological perspectives on the concept of original sin and grace. Prominent theologians like St. Augustine contributed to this discussion, emphasizing the potential sinlessness of Mary through God's grace."},{"question":"Sal's Pizza<br>Sal owned a popular pizza restaurant in New York.

Not at all, No, Maybe, Yes, or Definitely? Answer:","response":"Based on the single-word review provided, which is \\"Nice,\\" it can be difficult to draw a comprehensive and accurate conclusion on whether or not to recommend this app to a friend, as the review lacks specific details that could reveal the strengths and weaknesses of the app. However, since the reviewer used a positive term to describe their experience, we can at least assume that they had a favorable impression of the app to some extent. Considering this information, in this situation I would recommend the app to a friend with a \\"Maybe\\" rating. The reason for choosing \\"Maybe\\" over a more definite answer lies in the limitation of the review. While \\"Nice\\" suggests that the app has some redeeming qualities, it doesn't provide any insights into the app's features, usability, reliability, or user satisfaction. In fact, it is entirely possible that the reviewer just had a satisfactory experience or considered the app to be decent, but not necessarily exceptional or remarkable. If more detailed and informative reviews were available, I could provide a more definitive answer, as they would shed light on the aspects of the app that could be particularly appealing or problematic. Moreover, reviews from a larger pool of users would provide a broader perspective on the overall satisfaction with the app and give a clearer indication of its usefulness, relevance, and value. In conclusion, I would recommend the app with a \\"Maybe\\" rating based on the limited information provided in the given review. My recommendation would be to look for more comprehensive and detailed reviews or, if possible, try the app firsthand before making a definite decision on whether or not to recommend it to a friend."},{"question":"Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: How often do you go on holiday? Going on holiday makes you feel good while you're there-you gain the health benefits for months, new research shows. Jetting off to exotic destinations such as the Maldives cuts your blood pressure, helps you sleep better and bounce back from stress, it found. The benefits last at least a fortnight longer than the vacation and can be felt for months in some cases where it is claimed. Experts say workers should always take their full holiday entitlement each year-as many as one in three don't-to get the benefits. The study compared key health markers in holidaymakers visiting Thailand, Peru or the Maldives, with people who stayed at home and continued working. The average blood pressure of those on holiday dropped by 6% while the workers saw their blood pressure rise by 2% over the same period. The sleep quality of holiday-makers improved by 17% while that of the non-holidaymakers _ by 14%. The study also found the ability of vacationers to recover from stress--known as the stress-resilience test-improved by 29%. There was a 71% fall in stress resilience scores among workers. Test showed a fall in blood glucose levels, reducing the risk of diabetes, trimmer waistlines and enhanced mood and energy levels, with the effects sustained for at least 2 weeks after returning home.

The boat is disabled but manages to free itself and return to Pearl Harbor. Tissue from a huge sea creature is discovered jammed in the submarine's dive planes. A man-and-woman team of marine biologists, Lesley Joyce (Faith Domergue) and John Carter (Donald Curtis), is called in; they identify the tissue as being a small part of a gigantic octopus. The military authorities scoff, but are finally persuaded after receiving reports of missing swimmers and ships at sea being pulled under by a large animal. Both scientists conclude the sea beast is from the Mindanao Deep, having been forced from its natural habitat by hydrogen bomb testing in the area, which has made the giant creature radioactive, driving off its natural food supply.[3] The scientists suggest the disappearances of a Japanese fishing fleet and a Siberian seal boat may be the work of the foraging sea beast. Both Pete and the Navy representatives express doubt and demand further proof. Later, as Pete assists John and Lesley, a report comes in of an attack on a French shipping boat; several men escaped in a raft. The French survivors are questioned by psychiatrists, and when the first sailor's description of a creature with giant tentacles is met with skepticism, the other sailors refuse to testify. Lesley is able to convince the first sailor to repeat his story for government officials, who then have the evidence they need.

Given the question \\"Due to this Robin will feel how?\\", is \\"pleased\\" a valid answer? A:","response":"No, \\"pleased\\" is not a valid answer in this context. The idiom \\"putting the cart before the horse\\" implies that someone has done things in the wrong order or acted prematurely.

Disappointment: Robin might be disappointed as she was unable to make the sale, which might have been crucial for her career or financial situation. 2.

This greatly increased the efficiency of fertilization over wind-spread pollen, which might or might not actually land on another flower. To take better advantage of this “animal labor,” plants evolved traits such as brightly colored petals to attract pollinators. In exchange for pollination, flowers gave the pollinators nectar. I am facing a new situation today: Joy had a field full of flowering plants , that he used for medicinal and honey making purposes.

He was also the younger brother of Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor. Despite being epileptic, Charles achieved respect both as a commander and as a reformer of the Austrian army. Context: The caution which the archduke preached so earnestly in his strategic works, he displayed in practice only when the situation seemed to demand it, though his education certainly prejudiced him in favor of the defensive at all costs. He was at the same time capable of forming and executing the most daring offensive strategy, and his tactical skill in the handling of troops, whether in wide turning movements, as at Wurzburg and Zurich, or in masses, as at Aspern and Wagram, was certainly equal to that of any leader of his time, with only a few exceptions. According to the Encyclopaedia Britannica Eleventh Edition, his campaign of 1796 is considered almost faultless. That he sustained defeat in 1809 was due in part to the great numerical superiority of the French and their allies, and in part to the condition of his newly reorganized troops. His six weeks' inaction after the victory of Aspern is, however, open to unfavorable criticism. As a military writer, his position in the evolution of the art of war is very important, and his doctrines had naturally the greatest weight. Nevertheless, they cannot but be considered antiquated even in 1806. Caution and the importance of strategic points are the chief features of his system. The rigidity of his geographical strategy may be gathered from the prescription that \\"this principle is never to be departed from.\\" Again and again he repeated the advice that nothing should be hazarded unless one's army is completely secure, a rule which he himself neglected with such brilliant results in 1796. Strategic points, he says, not the defeat of the enemy's army, decide the fate of one's own country, and must constantly remain the general's main concern, a maxim which was never more remarkably disproved than in the war of 1809. The editor of the archduke's work is able to make but a feeble defense against Clausewitz's reproach that Charles attached more value to ground than to the annihilation of the foe. In his tactical writings the same spirit is conspicuous. His reserve in battle is designed to \\"cover a retreat.\\" The baneful influence of these antiquated principles was clearly shown in the maintenance of Koniggratz-Josefstadt in 1866 as a strategic point, which was preferred to the defeat of the separated Prussian armies, and in the strange plans produced in Vienna for the campaign of 1859, and in the almost unintelligible Battle of Montebello in the same year. The theory and the practice of Archduke Charles form one of the most curious contrasts in military history. In the one he is unreal, in the other he displayed, along with the greatest skill, a vivid activity which made him for long the most formidable opponent of Napoleon. He was the 831st Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece in Austria. Question: what was his biggest achievement? Answer:","response":"Archduke Charles of Austria's biggest achievement was his impressive command and tactical skill in handling troops during various battles, such as Würzburg, Zurich, Aspern, and Wagram. He was highly respected as a commander and a reformer of the Austrian army. Despite the antiquated principles in his strategic writings, his actions on the battlefield showcased his brilliance in executing both defensive and daring offensive strategies, making him one of the most formidable opponents of Napoleon during his time.

Translate to Russian","response":"Глобализация способствовала росту все более серьезных различий между своими участниками – сравните Колумбию и Афганистан или Чили и Судан – что затрудняет превращение простого количества в согласованное влияние. Глобализация несет в себе множество вызовов, и одним из них является то, что она подпитывает все более широкие расслоения между своими участниками. Например, если сравнить Колумбию и Афганистан или Чили и Судан, становится очевидно, что разрыв между этими странами основан на многих и разных факторах. Разнообразие в уровне экономического развития, политической стабильности и культурных особенностей этих стран создают ряд проблем для интеграции и взаимодействия на мировой арене. Одним из следствий глобализации является увеличение числа стран, которые активно участвуют в мировой экономической и политической жизни. Однако большое количество участников в современной мировой системе на самом деле может затруднять превращение численного превосходства в конкретное и влиятельное действие. Для преодоления этого разрыва и установления согласованных отношений между странами требуется тесное сотрудничество и кооперация на многих уровнях – начиная с более эффективной системы международной торговли и заканчивая углубленными двусторонними переговорами о взаимовыгодных проектах. К сожалению, на нашем пути к согласованному влиянию ряд препятствий. Во-первых, экономические различия между развитыми и развивающимися странами могут привести к проблемам, таким как социальное неравенство, миграции и конфликты. Во-вторых, политические разногласия между странами может затруднить установление конструктивного диалога и принятие коллективных решений в области решения международных проблем. Наконец, культурные различия и непонимание между нациями могут порождать стереотипы, предубеждения и даже враждебность, что, в свою очередь, вредит налаживанию взаимовыгодного и крепкого сотрудничества. В заключение можно сказать, что глобализация ставит перед мировым сообществом сложные задачи, требующие принятия согласованных усилий, и только факт наличия большого количества стран-участников мирового сообщества не гарантирует превращение этой связи в сильное международное влияние. Важной задачей для каждого участника глобализации является создание путей для тесного сотрудничества, учет разнообразия интересов и обеспечение равных возможностей для участия в мировом развитии и решении проблем, стоящих перед нашей планетой."},{"question":"Question: Process: - Bacteria enters the body - Bloodstream - Cells in the body are attacked - Cells are killed - Different kinds of sickness are formed. Question: suppose the plant is in a city with lots of people exhaling near it happens, how will it affect LESS cells being damaged. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","response":"Since plants absorb carbon dioxide (CO2) during photosynthesis and humans exhale CO2, the presence of many people near a plant could increase the amount of CO2 that plant can use for photosynthesis. This potentially could enhance the plant's health and vitality and even enhance its ability to potentially counteract various pathogens, including bacteria. However, it is important to note that your question seems to suggest a correlation between plant health and the decrease in damaged human cells from sickness, which is not directly connected. On the supposition that the plant's health is reflected in less harmful bacteria in the environment, it could perhaps indirectly contribute to fewer cells in the human body being attacked and killed by bacteria. But it's also worth mentioning that the majority of bacterial pathogens that affect humans are not the same that affect plants. So the presence of people exhaling near a plant poses a \\"more effect\\" on the plant's health due to increased levels of CO2 for photosynthesis. Nevertheless, it may have \\"no effect\\" or \\"less effect\\" on the occurrence of damaged human cells, as the pathogens that a healthy plant can counteract typically aren't those that cause illnesses in humans. In general, the bacteria that enter the human body and cause damage to cells leading to sickness are far more complexly associated with the overall environment, personal health and immunity, lifestyle factors, etc., which are not directly affected by the health of plants in close proximity to humans."},{"question":"Solve 0 = -45*w - 27*w - 137059 + 135187 for w.. What is the answer??","response":"Let's solve the equation step by step. 1. Combine the terms with w: 0 = -45w - 27w - 137059 + 135187 2. Add 45w and 27w: 0 = (-45w + 27w) - 137059 + 135187 0 = -18w - 137059 + 135187 3. Add 137059 to both sides of the equation: 0 + 137059 = -18w + 135187 + 137059 137059 = -18w + 272246 4. Subtract 135187 from both sides: 137059 - 135187 = -18w 1872 = -18w 5.

It doesn't mention how many essential elements there are. In the second sentence, the statement is made that there are 4 essential elements of interventions. Step 2: Compare the information provided in both sentences The first sentence discusses the need to identify essential elements of interventions, while the second sentence claims that there are 4 essential elements. However, the first sentence does not provide any specific information about the number of essential elements. Step 3: Determine if the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence Since the first sentence does not provide any information about the number of essential elements, it cannot be inferred that there are specifically 4 essential elements based on the information provided in the first sentence.

The primary aim of these companies was to tap into the lucrative spice trade, an effort focused mainly on two regions; the East Indies archipelago, and an important hub in the trade network, India. There, they competed for trade supremacy with Portugal and with each other. Although England ultimately eclipsed the Netherlands as a colonial power, in the short term the Netherlands' more advanced financial system and the three Anglo-Dutch Wars of the 17th century left it with a stronger position in Asia. Hostilities ceased after the Glorious Revolution of 1688 when the Dutch William of Orange ascended the English throne, bringing peace between the Netherlands and England. A deal between the two nations left the spice trade of the East Indies archipelago to the Netherlands and the textiles industry of India to England, but textiles soon overtook spices in terms of profitability, and by 1720, in terms of sales, the British company had overtaken the Dutch.

In order to better understand the differences, let's first define the terms and then explore the disparities in detail. 1. Definition: a. Theory of Plate Tectonics: The theory of plate tectonics is a comprehensive and widely accepted scientific theory that explains the large-scale movements of Earth's lithosphere. It describes how the Earth's outer shell, known as the lithosphere, is divided into a number of large, rigid plates that move over the partially molten and ductile asthenosphere. These plates interact with each other at their boundaries, resulting in various geological processes, such as the creation of mountains, earthquakes, and volcanic activity. b. Hypothesis Regarding a Certain Aspect of Plate Movement: A hypothesis is a proposed explanation for a specific phenomenon or observation, which can be tested through experiments, observations, or other investigative means. A hypothesis regarding a certain aspect of plate movement would be a provisional explanation of a specific feature or process related to the movement or interaction of tectonic plates. 2. Scope and Focus: a. The theory of plate tectonics is comprehensive and provides a general framework for understanding various aspects of Earth's geological processes and history. It encompasses the movement, interaction, and behavior of tectonic plates, and covers a wide range of geological phenomena. b. A hypothesis regarding a certain aspect of plate movement is focused on an individual feature or process, and its predictions and implications are limited to the specific aspect of plate tectonics being studied. This hypothesis aims to provide a detailed explanation or prediction for a particular observation related to plate movement. 3. Scientific Acceptance: a. The theory of plate tectonics is well-established and widely accepted by the scientific community. Developed over several decades, it incorporates evidence from multiple disciplines such as geology, geophysics, and paleontology, and is now considered the unifying theory of Earth sciences. b. A hypothesis regarding a certain aspect of plate movement, on the other hand, is a proposed explanation that has not yet been proven or disproven. It must undergo rigorous testing, and only after accumulating substantial evidence and withstanding critical assessment by the scientific community, may a hypothesis advance to the status of an accepted theory or become part of a larger theory. 4. Validation and Evidence: a. A significant amount of evidence supports the theory of plate tectonics, including the global distribution of earthquakes and volcanoes, the age and distribution of the oceanic and continental crust, and paleomagnetic data from ancient rocks. Multiple lines of converging evidence from various scientific fields reinforce and validate this theory. b. A hypothesis for a certain aspect of plate movement needs to provide specific predictions that can be tested and validated. The available evidence for a hypothesis may be limited at the outset, and it might require additional data collection and experimental results to confirm or refute the proposed explanation. In conclusion, the theory of plate tectonics represents a widely accepted, comprehensive framework explaining the large-scale movement and interaction of the Earth's lithosphere, with a substantial body of evidence to support it, whereas a hypothesis regarding a certain aspect of plate movement is a focused, provisional explanation for a specific observation that requires further testing and validation before being integrated into the broader scientific understanding of plate tectonics."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Question: Where is Malik after mother goes to work?

On Monday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and European Council President Donald Tusk agreed there was still time for Ceta to be signed as planned on Thursday. But for the most part, Canada is letting European politics unfold. \\"The Europeans are still hard at work. I wish them every success,\\" Ms Freeland said in Ottawa. \\"If Europe is ready to sign the agreement on October 27, we'll be there.\\" On Friday, she was close to tears as she expressed her deep disappointment at the prospect of the deal unravelling. The Liberal government has been pushing hard to get the deal - originally negotiated with the EU by Canada's former conservative government - through. It even sought to improve the controversial Investor to State Dispute Settlements (ISDS) mechanisms - a system through which companies can sue countries for alleged discriminatory practices - by preserving a government's right to regulate. Belgium confirmed on Monday it could not sign Ceta, missing a deadline set by the European Commission. The stalemate comes after Wallonia's government, a French-speaking region in Belgium, voted to block it on 14 October. Mr Trudeau is broadly in favour of free trade, which Liberals see as a path to improving Canada's sluggish economy and job market. The Canada-EU deal potentially surpasses the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) in scope. A joint Canada-EU study estimated Ceta would inject over CA12b (8.9bn/£7.3bn) of new revenue into the Canadian economy and increase trade by 20%. According to the European Commission, the value of bilateral trade in goods between the EU and Canada was CA92.5bn (69.1bn/£56.6bn) in 2015. Canada is the EU's 12th most important trading partner. From canola and barley growers to pork producers, automobile manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies and the aerospace industry, Ceta has strong support from Canadian business sectors seeking greater access to the EU's 508 million customers. The backlash against the deal is not as strong in Canada as in Europe, where there have been lawsuits, petitions and street protests. In fact, the few polls that have taken the temperature of the Canadian public on the issue suggest about 20% to 30% have no opinion on the deal at all. Still, there is opposition. Canadian dairy farmers fiercely oppose the deal, saying they are concerned with the level of access given to fine cheeses from Europe. There has also been concerns it would increase pharmaceutical costs, hurt farmers and the manufacturing sectors, and erode Canadian sovereignty.","response":"Canada is prepared to sign the Canada-European Union Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), according to International Trade Minister Chrystia Freeland. While Belgium has so far refused to sign the agreement due to a deadlock, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and European Council President Donald Tusk remain optimistic that the agreement will be finalised by the planned Thursday 27 October deadline. The joint Canada-EU study estimates that CETA could inject up to CAD 12bn of new revenue into the Canadian economy, while also increasing trade by 20%. It has received significant support from Canadian business sectors, looking to access the EU's 508 million customers."},{"question":"Q: The input is taken from a negotiation between two participants who take the role of campsite neighbors and negotiate for Food, Water, and Firewood packages, based on their individual preferences and requirements.

It contains the westernmost islands of the Outer Hebrides of Scotland. The largest island is Hirta, whose sea cliffs are the highest in the United Kingdom. Three other islands (Dùn, Soay and Boreray) were also used for grazing and seabird hunting. The islands are administratively a part of the Comhairle nan Eilean Siar local authority area.The origin of the name St Kilda is a matter of conjecture. The islands' human heritage includes numerous unique architectural features from the historic and prehistoric periods, although the earliest written records of island life date from the Late Middle Ages. The medieval village on Hirta was rebuilt in the 19th century, but illnesses brought by increased external contacts through tourism, and the upheaval of the First World War contributed to the island's evacuation in 1930. The story of St Kilda has attracted artistic interpretations, including Michael Powell's film The Edge of the World and an opera.Permanent habitation on the islands possibly extends back at least two millennia, the population probably never exceeding 180 (and certainly no more than 100 after 1851). The entire remaining population was evacuated from Hirta (the only inhabited island) in 1930. The islands house a unique form of stone structure known as cleitean. A cleit is a stone storage hut or bothy; whilst many are still to be found, they are slowly falling into disrepair. There are known to be 1,260 cleitean on Hirta and a further 170 on the other group islands. Currently, the only year-round residents are military personnel; a variety of conservation workers, volunteers and scientists spend time there in the summer months.The entire archipelago is owned by the National Trust for Scotland. It became one of Scotland's six World Heritage Sites in 1986, and is one of the few in the world to hold mixed status for both its natural and cultural qualities.... Guess a valid title for it!

Q: I heard that Bailey threw things because they got so mad that they could not speak any more. And I was wondering Why did Bailey do this? A:","response":"It appears that Bailey was experiencing intense emotions which led to them throwing things as an expression of their anger. Several factors might have contributed to this behavior, which we can explore in detail to better understand why Bailey reacted this way and how they might cope with their emotions more effectively in the future. 1. Overwhelming emotions: When people experience strong emotions such as anger, frustration, or sadness, it can become difficult to express themselves verbally. In some cases, they may feel so overwhelmed that they lose control over their reactions and resort to physical actions like throwing things as an outlet for their intense emotions. 2. Inability to communicate effectively: It's possible that Bailey was struggling to articulate their thoughts and feelings clearly. This difficulty in communication could have left them feeling trapped, unable to express their anger and resentment through words. Consequently, they may have resorted to throwing things as a way to release some of the pent-up energy and convey their feelings. 3. Lack of emotional regulation skills: Not everyone is taught how to identify, process, and manage their emotions in a healthy manner. If Bailey has not developed effective emotional regulation strategies, they may be more prone to reacting impulsively to strong emotions, which can include throwing things when angry. 4. Past experiences and learned behaviors: It is also essential to consider Bailey's past experiences and upbringing. If they grew up in an environment where physical expressions of anger were normalized, they may have internalized this behavior as an appropriate response. Additionally, past traumas or unresolved issues may trigger intense emotional responses in certain situations. To help Bailey in the future, it is important to address these factors and develop a plan that promotes healthier emotional processing and coping strategies. Here are a few suggestions: 1. Encourage open communication: Bailey should be encouraged to express their feelings, thoughts, and emotions openly and honestly, without fear of judgment or reproach. This can be done by creating a safe and supportive environment, practicing active listening, and asking open-ended questions. 2. Teach emotional regulation skills: Bailey could benefit from learning techniques to manage their emotions more effectively. This may include deep-breathing exercises, mindfulness practices, or grounding techniques to help them stay calm in the face of strong emotions. 3. Develop appropriate coping strategies: As part of learning emotional regulation, Bailey should also be introduced to alternative coping mechanisms for dealing with anger and frustration. For example, they might try journaling, engaging in physical activity, or seeking social support to process their feelings. 4. Consider therapy or counseling: If Bailey continues to experience difficulty communicating, managing their emotions, or expressing anger in healthier ways, seeking professional help from a therapist or counselor can be beneficial. A trained professional can guide them through exploring underlying issues and developing personalized coping strategies to improve emotional well-being. By addressing these factors and implementing positive coping strategies and support, Bailey can learn to navigate their emotions more effectively and avoid resorting to destructive behaviors, such as throwing things, when they are angry."},{"question":"I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. - Water is a transparent and nearly colorless chemical substance that is the main constituent of Earth's streams, lakes, and oceans, and the fluids of most living organisms. Its chemical formula is HO, meaning that its molecule contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, that are connected by covalent bonds. Water strictly refers to the liquid state of that substance, that prevails at standard ambient temperature and pressure; but it often refers also to its solid state (ice) or its gaseous state (steam or water vapor). It also occurs in nature as snow, glaciers, ice packs and icebergs, clouds, fog, dew, aquifers, and atmospheric humidity.

One-sixth of all fruit exports from Country Y are orange exports. If country Y generates 4 million from its orange exports, how much money does it generate from its yearly total of exports? Options: (A) 21.25m (B) 25.5m (C) 106.25m (D) 120m (E) 153m Let's think first. Stream of consciousness:","response":"To find the total yearly exports from Country Y, we first need to determine the total fruit exports and then use that information to calculate the yearly exports. Here's the step-by-step process: 1. Calculate the revenue from fruit exports in Country Y. Since one-sixth of fruit exports are orange exports, we can use the information provided and work backwards to determine the total fruit export revenue. We know that 4 million is the revenue generated by orange exports. So, let's write down the equation: (Orange Export Revenue) = (1/6) * (Fruit Export Revenue) 4,000,000 = (1/6) * (Fruit Export Revenue) Now, we solve for Fruit Export Revenue: Fruit Export Revenue = 4,000,000 * 6 Fruit Export Revenue = 24,000,000 2. Calculate the total yearly exports for Country Y. Now that we know the revenue from fruit exports, we can determine the total yearly exports using the given percentage information: 20% of Country Y's yearly exports = Fruit Export Revenue 0.2 * (Yearly Export) = 24,000,000 Now, we solve for Yearly Export: Yearly Export = 24,000,000 / 0.2 Yearly Export = 120,000,000 Thus, the total yearly exports from Country Y amount to 120 million, which corresponds to option (D)."},{"question":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Well yes, if you exclude the dwarfs, the cast of thousands, the great special effects, the big battles, the strong characterization, the decent plot, the good acting, the classy direction and everything else. Which leaves you with the walking. And boy, does this film do walking! If Mr Piano had his way, this would probably be an uninterrupted three hours of hardcore walking through the Wisconsin countryside, but every 40 minutes or so these pesky Martians pop up for a few seconds to interrupt him before he goes for another bit of a ramble. You've never seen so much walking in a movie. If this really had a 20m budget, most of it must have gone on Mr Piano's shoes, because he had to get through plenty of pairs with all the walking he does. Which explains why there's no money left for decent effects, a decent video camera or proper actors. Honestly, it's like watching some bizarre fetish video for people with a thing about going for long walks in period costumes. Even on fast-forward, this is a looonnnggg walk. As for the sci-fi stuff, I think it was a mistake to put Martians in the film: they only get in the way of the walking, which is clearly much more interesting to the director than the story.

What was the first name of the sister of British monarch Queen Elizabeth II?","response":"The first name of the sister of British monarch Queen Elizabeth II is Margaret. Born Margaret Rose Windsor, she was affectionately referred to as Princess Margaret throughout her life. Princess Margaret was the younger sister and the only sibling of Queen Elizabeth II, and together they shared a close bond and friendship during their childhood and later years. Princess Margaret was born on August 21, 1930, to the Duke and Duchess of York, who later became King George VI and Queen Elizabeth (later known as the Queen Mother). Margaret and her elder sister Elizabeth were brought up in a loving and protective environment, initially living at 145 Piccadilly in London and later at the Royal Lodge in Windsor Great Park. Margaret's early education was private and took place mostly at Buckingham Palace, just like her sister's. The royal siblings frequently spent time together, with Margaret often being the more extroverted and sociable of the two. They both participated in the wartime efforts during World War II, with Margaret joining her sister in radio broadcasts as part of the Children's Hour radio series. In later years, Princess Margaret became known for her glamorous social life, stylish fashion choices, and artistic patronage, as well as her romantic associations. Margaret's personal life was often a topic of public interest and speculation, most notably her romantic relationship with Group Captain Peter Townsend, a decorated war hero, and a divorced man. This romance ended due to the controversy surrounding their relationship and the church's opposition on the grounds of Townsend's divorce. On May 6, 1960, Princess Margaret married Antony Armstrong-Jones, a talented photographer, and later became known as Lord Snowdon. The couple had two children, David, Viscount Linley, and Lady Sarah Armstrong-Jones. However, their marriage ended in divorce in 1978, which was the first divorce in the British Royal Family since King Henry VIII's time. Princess Margaret continued her public work and remained devoted to her elder sister, Queen Elizabeth II. As a patron of numerous organizations and charities, she used her position to advance the causes she cared about, particularly in the fields of arts, dance, and theatre. Margaret's health deteriorated during her later years, and she passed away on February 9, 2002, at the age of 71. In conclusion, the first name of the sister of British monarch Queen Elizabeth II is Margaret. Princess Margaret Rose Windsor played a significant role in the British Royal Family's public life and was known for her glamour, sense of style, and devotion to the arts. Despite facing several challenges, Margaret maintained a close bond with her sister throughout their lives, and her legacy remains an important part of British royal history."},{"question":"Translate to Russian: In Chad, the World Health Organization (WHO) public health team has worked with UNHCR, UNICEF and health partners to deliver emergency support to IDPs, refugees and local population for disease and nutritional surveillance, early warning and outbreak response systems.

The Shawshank Redemption, a 1994 drama directed by Frank Darabont, is a quintessential example of a cinematic masterpiece that continues to captivate audiences and leave them awestruck. Plot Summary: Based on a novella by Stephen King, the film follows the story of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a banker who is wrongly convicted of a double murder and sentenced to life at the infamous Shawshank State Penitentiary. Despite the grievous injustice, Andy remains hopeful and adapts to prison life. His friendship with Red (Morgan Freeman), an experienced inmate, adds depth to the movie as they navigate the harsh realities of prison life together. Direction, Acting, and Other Elements: Frank Darabont's impeccable direction and storytelling, coupled with powerful performances from the ensemble cast, make this film a true gem. Tim Robbins delivers a remarkable performance as the stoic and intelligent Andy Dufresne, while Morgan Freeman's unforgettable portrayal of Red ensures viewers care about their fates. The cinematography, by Roger Deakins, picks up on the mood of the film and creates a palpable atmosphere of despair and hope. Thomas Newman's original score complements the movie's tone, enriching the emotional impact. General Opinions: The Shawshank Redemption is more than a movie about two men in prison. It's a story of friendship, redemption, and the resilience of the human spirit. The intriguing plot, filled with unexpected twists and turns, keeps viewers engaged from beginning to end. Moreover, the film's memorable quotes and life lessons have resonated with audiences for more than two decades.

In Sentence A, the subject is \\"Jack\\" and the action is \\"put the stack of cards in his desk.\\" In Sentence B, the subject is \\"Jack\\" and the action is \\"put the stack of buses in his desk.\\" Step 2: Evaluate the objects of the action. In Sentence A, the object is \\"a stack of cards,\\" which is a small and manageable item. In Sentence B, the object is \\"a stack of buses,\\" which is a large and unmanageable item in terms of size and weight. Step 3: Assess the plausibility of each action based on the objects. In Sentence A, it is logical for Jack to put a stack of cards in his desk, as cards are small and can easily fit inside a desk. In Sentence B, it is not logical for Jack to put a stack of buses in his desk, as buses are large, heavy, and cannot fit inside a desk. Step 4: Compare the logical validity of each sentence. Sentence A is logical because the action (putting a stack of cards in a desk) is feasible.

Chihiro is whiny and unhappy about the move, especially when she notices that the bouquet her friend gave her as a good-bye gift is wilting.

The road ends at a tunnel leading to an abandoned theme park.

Relocating to England in 1973 with a new manager, John Hewlett, founder of John's Children, and a deal from Island Records, thanks in part to the exposure garnered by their BBC Two Whistle Test performance, they placed an ad in music weekly Melody Maker (\\"Wanted bass player for Sparks. Must be beard free and exciting\\") and through this hired Martin Gordon. With Adrian Fisher on guitar and Norman \\"Dinky\\" Diamond on drums, in the midst of power cuts and a threatened vinyl shortage, they recorded their breakthrough Kimono My House in 1974, scoring a No. 2 hit with the single \\"This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us\\", despite Elton John betting producer Muff Winwood that the song would not break into the charts. Sparks became a UK teen sensation appearing on the cover of Melody Maker, Record Mirror and countless other pop magazines in the UK and Europe. Hits such as \\"This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us\\", \\"Amateur Hour\\" and \\"Never Turn Your Back on Mother Earth\\" led to many appearances on the BBC's flagship music show Top of the Pops. Russell's hyperactive movements were in sharp contrast to the keyboard-bound, soberly dressed Ron's expressionless squint and Charlie Chaplin-esque moustache. Gordon and Fisher were later replaced by Trevor White and Ian Hampton. In 1975, the revised band returned to the US to tour supporting the Kimono and Propaganda albums which had gained strong cult attention in New York City, Cleveland, Chicago, San Francisco and Los Angeles primarily from FM radio play and a national TV appearance on Don Kirshner's Rock Concert. Flo & Eddie were the supporting act. Influential 1970s progressive FM radio station powerhouse WMMS in Cleveland and its famed DJs such as Kid Leo initially championed the band in America. Sparks also performed on American Bandstand in 1975 with host Dick Clark mugging with Ron and on countless other TV shows in the US and abroad post 1977. The follow-up albums, Propaganda and Indiscreet, the latter produced by Tony Visconti, were similarly successful and produced the hit singles \\"Looks, Looks, Looks\\", \\"Never Turn Your Back on Mother Earth\\" and \\"Something for the Girl with Everything\\".

Although she wrote \\"went off very well\\" in her diary, Ferrier was disappointed with her performance, and concluded that she needed further voice training. She approached the distinguished baritone Roy Henderson with whom, a week previously, she had sung in Mendelssohn's Elijah. Henderson agreed to teach her, and was her regular voice coach for the remainder of her life. He later explained that her \\"warm and spacious tone\\" was in part due to the size of the cavity at the back of her throat: \\"one could have shot a fair-sized apple right to the back of the throat without obstruction\\". However, this natural physical advantage was not in itself enough to ensure the quality of her voice; this was due, Henderson says, to \\"her hard work, artistry, sincerity, personality and above all her character\\". Ferrier's performances in the Glyndebourne run, which began on 12 July 1946, earned her favourable reviews, although the opera itself was less well received. On the provincial tour which followed the festival it failed to attract the public and incurred heavy financial losses. By contrast, when the opera reached Amsterdam it was greeted warmly by the Dutch audiences who showed particular enthusiasm for Ferrier's performance. This was Ferrier's first trip abroad, and she wrote an excited letter to her family: \\"The cleanest houses and windows you ever did see, and flowers in the fields all the way!\\" Following her success as Lucretia she agreed to return to Glyndebourne in 1947, to sing Orfeo in Gluck's opera Orfeo ed Euridice. She had often sung Orfeo's aria Che farò (\\"What is life\\") as a concert piece, and had recently recorded it with Decca. At Glyndebourne, Ferrier's limited acting abilities caused some difficulties in her relationship with the conductor, Fritz Stiedry; nevertheless her performance on the first night, 19 June 1947, attracted warm critical praise.Ferrier's association... answer the following question: What is the last name of the person who sang with Roy in Mendelssohn's Elijah?

Most people also have a decline in strength and stamina. Their senses may start failing, and their reflex time typically increases. Their immune system also doesn’t work as well as it used to. As a result, common diseases like the flu may become more serious and even lead to death. The majority of late adults develop arthritis, and as many as one in four develop Alzheimer’s disease.

Gemini took a year longer than planned to accomplish its first flight, allowing the Soviets to achieve another first, launching Voskhod 1 on October 12, 1964, the first spacecraft with a three-cosmonaut crew. The USSR touted another technological achievement during this mission: it was the first space flight during which cosmonauts performed in a shirt-sleeve-environment. However, flying without spacesuits was not due to safety improvements in the Soviet spacecraft's environmental systems; rather this innovation was accomplished because the craft's limited cabin space did not allow for spacesuits. Flying without spacesuits exposed the cosmonauts to significant risk in the event of potentially fatal cabin depressurization. This feat would not be repeated until the US Apollo Command Module flew in 1968; this later mission was designed from the outset to safely transport three astronauts in a shirt-sleeve environment while in space.

Artificial Intelligence Before Minsky, computers were more like calculators, performing math operations at speeds much faster than humans. Minsky was the first to say that computers can one day be as intelligent as human beings. He was so convinced about this, that in 1959, he and his friend John McCarthy invented the term \\"Artificial Intelligence\\" at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Minsky wrote a book called Perceptrons, describing a particular type of \\"artificial neural network\\". Neural networks have made a comeback in a new field of Computer Science called Deep Learning. Deep Learning is used to recognize things and people in pictures (as seen in Facebook and Google Photos), language translation( try Google Translate sometimes), and so on.

He pitched from 1965 to 1988 for six different teams in his career, but it is his time with the Philadelphia Phillies where he received his greatest acclaim as a professional and won four Cy Young Awards. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1994. Carlton has the second-most lifetime strikeouts of any left-handed pitcher (4th overall), and the second-most lifetime wins of any left-handed pitcher (11th overall). Carlton slumped in 1973, losing 20 games. The media's questioning of his unusual training techniques led to an acrimonious relationship between them and Carlton. In 1976, upon the advice of his lawyer Edward L. Wolf, decided to sever all ties with the media, and refused to answer press questions for the rest of his career with the Phillies. This reached a point where, in 1981, while the Mexican rookie Fernando Valenzuela was achieving stardom with the Los Angeles Dodgers, a reporter remarked, \\"The two best pitchers in the National League don't speak English: Fernando Valenzuela and Steve Carlton.\\" Media charges of bigotry and anti-Semitism In 1994 he agreed to an interview with writer Pat Jordan at his home in Durango, Colorado. The result was the story \\"Thin Mountain Air\\" in the April 1994 issue of Philadelphia magazine. This article was noted by the New York Times as being the source of numerous claims about Steve Carlton's political and social beliefs: \\"According to Pat Jordan, the writer of the article, Carlton alternately said that the world is ruled or controlled by the Russian and United States Governments, which 'fill the air with low-frequency sound waves,' the Elders of Zion, British intelligence agencies, '12 Jewish bankers meeting in Switzerland' and 'a committee of 300 which meets at a roundtable in Rome.' Not only that, but Carlton also charges, according to Jordan, that President Clinton has 'a black son' he won't acknowledge and that the AIDS virus was created at a secret Maryland biological warfare laboratory to get rid of gays and blacks.'\\" This same New York Times article notes that teammate Tim McCarver defended Carlton against charges of being a bigot and an anti-Semite, though he acknowledged \\"If he's guilty of anything, it's believing some of the material he reads. Does he become confused with his reading about radical things? Yes. I've told him that. Does that translate into him being anti-Semitic? No.\\" what was he view on the media","response":"Steven Norman Carlton, widely known as \\"Lefty,\\" and celebrated as a former Major League Baseball left-handed pitcher, held a complicated relationship with the media. His relationship with the press was marked by contention and resistance, especially after 1973. Carlton’s performance deteriorated notably in that year, during which he lost 20 matches. The press seized the opportunity to scrutinize his unorthodox training techniques, leading to friction-filled interactions between Carlton and the media. Consequently, he sought legal counsel from his lawyer, Edward L. Wolf, who advised him to break away from all engagements with the media. Heeding this advice, Carlton stopped responding to press questions for the remainder of his career with the Philadelphia Phillies. This decision apparently created an intense situation to the extent that in 1981, a reporter commented about him and fellow pitcher Fernando Valenzuela, \\"The two best pitchers in the National League don't speak English: Fernando Valenzuela and Steve Carlton.\\" A decisive shift in Carlton’s view on the media seemed to occur in 1994. He agreed to participate in an interview with writer Pat Jordan at his home in Durango, Colorado. The discussion unfolded into the feature story \\"Thin Mountain Air\\" in the April 1994 issue of Philadelphia magazine. The narrative would soon earn a mention in The New York Times for the controversial insights it offered into Carlton's social and political beliefs. These claims, disputable in nature, generated a backlash and led to allegations of bigotry and anti-Semitism against Carlton. Notwithstanding these charges, former teammate, Tim McCarver, stoutly defended Carlton, asserting that the accusations against him were baseless. In McCarver's view, Carlton's flaw lay in his gullibility towards radical thoughts and ideas, which often led to confusion, but that did not translate into him being anti-Semitic. In summary, Carlton demonstrated a complex perspective regarding the media. His dealings with the press evolved from initial resistance and avoidance to a brief period of détente before being marred by controversy following the revealing 1994 interview. Despite these ups and downs, his reputation as one of the greatest left-handed pitchers in Major League Baseball has remained intact."},{"question":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Brad did some blood tests and found out he has very high cholesterol levels, while his partner Dale had normal cholesterol levels, and was very healthy. Brad got scared and started worrying. Which friend was more at risk for heart disease? Answer:","response":"Based on the given information, Brad seems to be at a higher risk for heart disease due to his elevated cholesterol levels compared to Dale's normal cholesterol levels. Cholesterol is an essential substance that the body needs to function properly. However, having too much cholesterol in the blood, particularly low-density lipoprotein (LDL) or \\"bad\\" cholesterol, can lead to the buildup of fatty deposits, also known as plaques, in the arteries. This condition is known as atherosclerosis. Over time, atherosclerosis can cause narrowing of the arteries, which reduces blood flow to vital organs, including the heart. When blood flow to the heart is restricted, it can cause chest pain (angina) or ultimately result in a heart attack (myocardial infarction) if the blood supply to a part of the heart muscle is blocked. High cholesterol levels often don't cause any signs or symptoms, which is why regular check-ups and blood tests, as Brad and Dale did, are essential for identifying potential cardiovascular risks. It is important to note that high cholesterol is only one of many risk factors for heart disease. Other factors include age, gender, family history of heart disease, hypertension (high blood pressure), smoking, obesity, physical inactivity, diabetes, and an unhealthy diet. It's crucial to consider one's overall risk profile rather than solely focusing on cholesterol levels. Although Dale has normal cholesterol levels, it doesn't mean he is immune to heart disease, as other risk factors may still play a role in his overall risk. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle, which includes exercising regularly, eating a balanced diet, not smoking, and controlling blood pressure and blood sugar levels, is essential for both Brad and Dale to minimize their chances of developing heart disease. In conclusion, based on the information provided, Brad is at a higher risk for heart disease due to his elevated cholesterol levels. However, it is important for both Brad and Dale to have a comprehensive understanding of their individual risk factors and maintain a healthy lifestyle to reduce their chances of developing heart disease."},{"question":"Information: - Stony Stratford (often shortened to Stony) is a constituent town of Milton Keynes (in north Buckinghamshire, England) and is a civil parish with a town council within the Borough of Milton Keynes.

Would Alabama have stable or declining waterfowl species? Both Alabama and Florida boast great wetlands. The State of Alabama has experienced extensive drainage system due to expansion of farmlands. Their neighboring state Florida had similar system. But recently Florida had dismantled many of their drainage systems, mostly because of pressure from different environmental groups. Hint: Ecologically, the expansion of drainage systems has had tremendous negative effects. Hundreds of thousands of wetland species experienced significant population declines as their habitat was increasingly fragmented and destroyed. Although market hunting within the Central Flyway was a contributing factor in the decline of many waterfowl species' numbers in the early decades of the twentieth century, loss of breeding habitat to agricultural expansion is certainly the most significant. Early maps of midwestern states depict many lakes and marshes that are either nonexistent or significantly reduced in area today. Channelization, a related process of concentrating and facilitating the flow of water from agricultural areas, also contributed to this degradation.

No Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what has a negative impact on the body?\\" is \\"air\\", given that disease-causing microorganisms have a negative impact on the body? Answer:","response":"While selecting either Yes or No might be a direct response to the given options, I would like to provide a more detailed and comprehensive answer to the question about whether \\"air\\" is the right answer to the question \\"what has a negative impact on the body?\\" given that disease-causing microorganisms have a negative impact on the body. Air is an essential component for all living beings, including humans. It consists of several gases, including oxygen, which is vital for various biological processes such as respiration. To function properly, our bodies need a constant supply of oxygen. However, it is important to consider that air, when contaminated with pollutants and pathogens, can have a negative impact on the body. Disease-causing microorganisms, also known as pathogens, can be present in the air and spread through various means such as coughing, sneezing, and contact with contaminated surfaces. Some common airborne pathogens include viruses, bacteria, and fungi. These microorganisms, when inhaled, can lead to several respiratory illnesses, including the common cold, flu, pneumonia, and tuberculosis. Moreover, air pollution caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels, industrial processes, and other sources significantly contributes to poor air quality. This polluted air contains various harmful substances, including particulate matter, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and ground-level ozone. Breathing polluted air can cause a host of negative health impacts, ranging from minor respiratory symptoms to more severe consequences, including lung cancer, cardiovascular problems, and even premature death. It is worth mentioning that not all components or aspects of air have a negative impact on the body. As mentioned earlier, oxygen is a crucial element in maintaining our lives and overall well-being. However, when considering the presence of contaminants and pathogens in the air, it does have the potential to harm the body. In conclusion, when answering the question \\"what has a negative impact on the body?\\" it is valid to say that \\"air,\\" when containing disease-causing microorganisms or pollutants, can potentially negatively impact our health. While air itself is not inherently harmful, it is essential to differentiate between clean air, which sustains life, and polluted air, which can adversely affect our well-being. Consequently, efforts should be made to minimize air pollution and promote clean and healthy environments for everyone."},{"question":"In 1852 Peirce introduced methods into the theory of errors applied to observations which would allow faulty observations to be discarded Please fix the punctuation.","response":"In 1852, Peirce introduced methods into the theory of errors.

HERTA MULLER'S third novel begins in a women's university dormitory in Nicolae Ceausescu's Romania, where Lola, a poor girl from the provinces, has come to study Russian. In a Communist country short on consumer goods, Lola and her roommates dream of ''whisper-thin'' nylon stockings while making do with what they have: ''Under the pillows in the beds were six pots of mascara. Six girls spat into the pots and stirred the soot with toothpicks until the black paste grew sticky. Then they opened their eyes wide. The toothpicks scraped against their eyelids, their lashes grew black and thick. But an hour later gray gaps began to crack open in the eyelashes. The saliva dried up and the soot crumbled onto their cheeks.'' Lola, unprepared for city life by her village childhood, has brutal sexual encounters, hangs herself with a belt and is posthumously expelled from the Communist Party. The narrator of the novel is one of her roommates, soon herself an object of political suspicion, so that when she finally leaves the university, packing her pot of mascara, she finds an unpleasant surprise in her bed: ''When I picked up the blanket to pull off the cover, I found a pig's ear in the middle of the sheet. That was the girls' way of saying farewell. I shook the sheet but the ear didn't move, it was sewn on in the middle like a button.'' ''The Land of Green Plums'' is a novel of graphically observed detail in which the author seeks to create a sort of poetry out of the spiritual and material ugliness of life in Communist Romania. The book was not, however, written in Romanian. Herta Muller is a German writer who lived in Romania as part of that country's German minority; in 1987, she left Romania for Germany, where her novels have been published and acclaimed. In the 18th century, the Hapsburg rulers in Vienna encouraged German settlers to pioneer the Hungarian lands that had recently been regained from the Ottoman Empire. Some of these lands, with their descendant German communities, passed to Romania after World War I, and the German minority there, receiving special protection during Romania's alliance with Hitler, maintained its distinctive national character into the era of Communist rule. Ceausescu, seeking to mobilize Romanian nationalism around his dictatorship, perpetrated the general harassment of the German minority, which Ms. Muller experienced as a young woman in the 70's and 80's, and which she has worked into fiction in this novel about relentless persecution in a police state. ''My mother tongue is German,'' Ms. Muller said in a 1989 interview with Amnesty International. Like Kafka writing German in Prague, Ms. Muller in Romania found in her mother tongue the painfully direct expression of profound alienation. Michael Hofmann has produced a powerful English translation, though since an important purpose of the novel is to represent cultural survival through the German language, any translation necessarily obscures some of the work's significance. Furthermore, the issue of Germanness in the novel is very much attuned to the national sensitivities of German readers today. The narrator and her friends, persecuted as dissidents in Romania, must also confront their own family histories of sentimental loyalty to Hitler. ''My father was a member of the SS; I know what I'm talking about,'' Ms. Muller commented in the 1989 interview. In the novel, the narrator feels inevitably awkward in relation to Romania's Jewish survivors: ''It was Herr Feyerabend. He was shuffling his feet and pulled a white handkerchief out of his pocket. I withdrew my head, as if the white handkerchief could feel that someone like myself was staring at a Jew.'' While the narrator may look away from the handkerchief, Ms. Muller unflinchingly confronts the complexity of the 20th century in Eastern Europe, with its terrible permutations of persecution from generation to generation. The narrator watches the Romanian police guards in the streets of the city as they greedily pocket green plums. She herself had been warned as a child, by her father, that it was dangerous to eat green plums, but the guards do not hesitate: ''They knew where the plum trees were in every precinct they policed. . . . The plumsuckers were peasants. The green plums made them stupid. They ate themselves away from their duty. They reverted to childhood, stealing plums from village trees.'' Ms. Muller's vision of a police state manned by plum thieves reads like a kind of fairy tale on the mingled evils of gluttony, stupidity and brutality. The narrator watches the guards as they grab at young women in the streets. It might have been one of these men who followed Lola and mauled her, with ''the greedy desire of a starved dog.'' As the narrator ponders Lola's pathetic fate, the novel encompasses not only the political persecution of dissidents and the harassment of a national minority but also the particular kinds of oppression and vulnerability that women experience under a regime of policemen. Most of the literary accounts of Communist Eastern Europe have come from male writers, and it is especially interesting to have from Ms. Muller this work composed in a woman's voice. In the end, the narrator decides not to kill herself, as Lola did, but to immigrate to Germany, as most of Romania's Germans have done, both before and since the fall of Ceausescu in 1989. This marks the end of many communities that had survived from the 18th-century reign of the Empress Maria Theresa into our own less enlightened century. Ms. Muller conveys a certain sadness over the historical implications of emigration, the impending doom of her own native culture and society. She also offers a potent and repellent depiction of the world she left behind in Romania. A friend of the narrator works as an engineer in a slaughterhouse: ''Kurt told me every week about the slaughterhouse. The workers drank warm blood when they slaughtered the animals. They stole organ meats and brains. . . . Their wives and children are accomplices, Kurt said. The wives use the stiff cow tails for bottle brushes, and the children get the supple ones to play with.''

Spend 30 to 60 minutes weighing yourself each day and then consider consulting a registered dietitian. This can help your weight change gradually rather than indefinitely..","response":"(A). Many studies have shown that getting on the scale at least once a week is important for weight maintenance long-term. Those who were more regular with weigh-ins had an easier time maintaining their weight and could maintain it long-term. In addition to weighing yourself, it's crucial to track your progress and adjust your habits if you see any fluctuations in your weight. First, it's essential to maintain a well-balanced, nutritious diet. Consistently consuming wholesome foods, including lean proteins, whole grains, healthy fats, and plenty of fruits and vegetables, can help you preserve that lean physique. Furthermore, practicing mindful eating habits, such as eating slowly, chewing thoroughly, and paying attention to hunger cues, can also contribute to managing your weight effectively. Second, make regular physical activity a part of your lifestyle. Combining cardiovascular exercise with strength training can help build and maintain lean muscle mass, which contributes to a higher metabolic rate, ultimately helping in weight maintenance. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity per week, along with strength training exercises for all major muscle groups at least two days per week. Getting enough rest and recovery is another critical factor to maintaining a lean physique. Sleep plays a vital role in weight management, as it affects your appetite-regulating hormones, ghrelin, and leptin. Strive for at least 7 to 8 hours of quality sleep each night to keep your hormones in check and prevent overeating or making poor food choices. Addressing stress management is also integral. High stress levels can lead to emotional eating and a disrupted hormonal balance, causing weight gain. Incorporating stress-reducing activities such as meditation, yoga, or engaging in relaxing hobbies can help you handle stress effectively and keep your weight in check. Lastly, accountability and support are crucial for maintaining a lean physique. Connect with friends, family, or online communities to share experiences, seek advice, and ultimately stay accountable for your actions. In conclusion, maintaining a lean physique involves a holistic approach that includes regular weigh-ins, a balanced diet, consistent exercise, adequate sleep, stress management, and social support. By incorporating these strategies, you'll be well-equipped to sustain a healthy, lean body in the long run."},{"question":"yeah you sure did what grade did you teach or Does it follow that \\"What grade did you teach for.\\"?

I think this is the detailed solution:","response":"First, let's assign variables to the given information: Let G represent the number of goats and S represent the number of sheep on the farm. We are given the ratio of goats to sheep: G/S = 5/7. Now, we're given the total number of animals on the farm: G + S = 360. To make the fractions easier to work with, we'll use the technique of cross multiplication. 7G = 5S (multiplying both sides by 7S). Now, we need to express G or S in terms of the other. Let's express G in terms of S: G = (5/7)S. We can then substitute this back into the total animals equation: (5/7)S + S = 360. To simplify the equation, we can find a common denominator: (5 + 7*7/7)S = 360 (12/7)S = 360 Now, we can solve for the number of sheep: S = (7/12) × 360 S = 210 Now that we have the number of sheep, we can find the number of goats: G = (5/7) × 210 G = 150 Now we can find how much money Mr. Mathews makes from selling half of the goats and 2/3 of the sheep: Half of the goats = 150 / 2 = 75 2/3 of the sheep = (2/3) × 210 = 140 Money made from selling goats = 75 × 40 = 3000 Money made from selling sheep = 140 × 30 = 4200 Total money made = 3000 + 4200 = 7200 So, Mr. Mathews makes 7200 from the sale of the animals."},{"question":"Can you tell me the answer to who won last men's soccer world cup??","response":"The last men's soccer World Cup was in 2018, and it was held in Russia.

(September 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Directly after the events of Quarantine, on a flight from Los Angeles to Nashville, one of the passengers, Ralph Bundt becomes violent and attempts to enter the cockpit, demanding he be let off the plane. Ralph had been bitten by a hamster which is really a lab rat, brought onto the plane by Henry (Josh Cooke) for his school students. Ralph is restrained, but not before he bites one of the flight attendants, Paula, on the face, much to her friend, Jenny's (Mercedes Mason), horror. Disobeying orders, Captain Forrest and his co-pilot Willsy find a jetway operated by a baggage handler Ed Ramirez (Ignacio Serricchio). Everyone escapes the plane, except for the elderly couple Bev Stevens and her paralyzed mute husband Doc Stevens, and the pilots, who try to keep the violent Ralph contained in an aircraft bathroom. However, they learn that they have been locked out of the airport. Soon, armed soldiers and what appear to be CDC scientists surround the terminal. Ed shows them a door that will lead them to tarmac level but it is locked. One of the passengers, a military medic named Shilah Washington (Noree Victoria), reveals she has a medical kit in her bag in the plane's cargo hold. Jenny, Henry, Ed, Niall, and Preston sneak back into the plane to retrieve it, to find that Ralph has escaped from the bathroom, whereabouts unknown. Preston retrieves Doc and waits outside. They retrieve Shilah's kit and Niall's handgun and try to leave the hold. While in the plane, Jenny is attacked by an infected Captain Forrest and Niall shoots and kills him, but it seems that some of the captain's blood had gotten into Niall's eye. As they are leaving, they find Preston's body, and an infected Bev who tries to attack the group before they escape. When they meet up with the rest of the group, they begin to realize...

Article: When I was in primary school, sometimes I would meet a girl of the same age as me. Lisa was never active, but she was always very sweet and nice. In the 5th grade she came to my class. She was absent a lot , and one day I had the courage to ask why. She told me she was sick, and she explained she wore a wig because her medicine made her lose her hair. We left it at that. Anytime Lisa came to class--seldom--I would hang around with her on the playground. I received much ridicule from my friends for this because they thought I was ignoring them for Lisa. My family education taught me to be nice, and I felt Lisa's needs were much more important than others I knew. It had been months since Lisa was in our class, and one day our teacher was crying. She explained Lisa died the day before and would no longer be our classmate. She told us Lisa had fought a battle with cancer for years. I was shocked. Lisa never spoke of her illness as if it could kill her. Well, all these years I have kept Lisa in my mind and heart. When I go through the important events in my life, I think of Lisa. I've had a strong wish recently to find her mother and father. I'd like to tell them that though they never met me, their daughter had a sweet effect on my life. I have no idea what her parents' first names are. I write to your column and hope you can point me in the right direction. Lisa was such a lovely girl. Maybe her parents would be comforted by the fact that after all these years they are not the only ones who remember her. Question: What did the author learn from Lisa?

They need to be your size or bigger than you. If you don't have the perfect pair, take a trip to the thrift shop! Jeans, khakis, chinos, slacks -- all types will work. If the pants are too big, you'll need to rip up the side seam, cut out the unnecessary fabric, and sew it back together to match your waistline. Make sure it lies flat; you don't want any material bunching or bubbling -- it should naturally lie flush to the table. If your cut isn't perfectly straight, that's fine! As long as it's a clean line, it doesn't matter what angle it's at. In fact, a steeper angle can give your skirt a more refined, less patched-together look. If you want to use the legs for the rest of your skirt (right now it's too short), don't throw them away just yet! You probably want another six inches (in width) or so of fabric, if not more. If you have some scraps lying around from an old project, use those! Or you can use the pant leg of the ones you just tore up. Does the thigh or the calf give you the width you'd like? Cut 1/2\\" (1.25 cm) wide than you need for a seam allowance. Make sure the fabric is long enough to wrap around the entirety of the skirt. If you're using your old jeans, you may need to rip out the seam that meets the skirt -- otherwise that's a lot of thread going on in one place. And because of the cut of the jean, make sure the fabric lines up (width-wise) front and back. Using your 1/2\\" seam allowance, pin your fabric to the edge of the skirt, leaving the extra on the inside, rendering it invisible. Flip the skirt inside out and begin either hand stitching or blazing through with a sewing machine. If your fabric requires it, create a seam on the bottom edge, too. Just don't make it too short! If your fabric is giving you any guff, iron it flat. It'll be much easier to work with then. Your skirt's done!

'well, good luck' and i headed back to my desk. 2:05pm: i got through the last 2 hours, keeping my head down, just waiting for them to get access to the camera system. they never got access to it and seemed to have given up. also people had started to make funny names for the culprit: midnight bomber, phantom pooper, and lucky logger are some of the names. everyone was trying to figure out who laid a steamer on the toilet seat. finally the day was over and i left the office...what a hectic, 'shitty' day. next few days: the next few days people in the office were still referencing the shit. 'who do you think was the midnight bomber?' hr had added a sign to both bathrooms stating to please clean up after yourself, no standing on the toilets, and no soiling the toilet seats. fast forward two weeks and the cto fires rod miller. i don't know why he was fired, but i wanted to stay as far away as possible. this happened 4 years ago, and to this day i've only told some close friends. they love this story and make me tell it all the time. at work people still make references to the midnight bomber and the phantom pooper...little do they know i am still amongst them. edit: some people asking what it looked like. i found one on ebay that looks similar: http://www.ebay.com/itm/realistic-fake-human-turd-poop-gross-gag-gift-prank-joke-crap-toilet-trick-/111384263608 Student:","response":"\\"Steve\\", under a pseudonym, caused a hilarious situation at his workplace by placing a realistic-looking fake poop on a toilet seat, triggering an office-wide investigation, including examination of security footage and building access logs, which ended with a colleague being unfairly suspected and later dismissed."},{"question":"In Euclidean geometry, a parallelogram is a simple (non-self-intersecting) quadrilateral with two pairs of parallel sides.

The congruence of opposite sides and opposite angles is a direct consequence of the Euclidean parallel postulate and neither condition can be proven without appealing to the Euclidean parallel postulate or one of its equivalent formulations. Is the following statement correct based on the text are all sides the same length on a parallelogram","response":"Based on the text provided, it is not correct to say that all sides of a parallelogram have the same length. The text states that a parallelogram is a quadrilateral with two pairs of parallel sides. It also mentions that the opposite or facing sides of a parallelogram are of equal length. This information implies that while the opposite sides have the same length, the adjacent sides can have different lengths. To clarify, let's consider a parallelogram with sides AB, BC, CD, and DA. In this case, side AB must be parallel to side CD, and side BC must be parallel to side DA. The lengths of the opposite sides are equal, so AB = CD and BC = DA, but the lengths of AB and BC (or any adjacent sides) may not be equal. In a special case, when all four sides of the parallelogram have the same length, the parallelogram is called a square or a rhombus. In these specific types of parallelograms, it is correct to say that all sides are the same length.

Electric blues guitarists began experimenting with hard rock elements such as driving rhythms, distorted guitar solos and power chords in the 1950s, evident in the work of Memphis blues guitarists such as Joe Hill Louis, Willie Johnson, and particularly Pat Hare, who captured a \\"grittier, nastier, more ferocious electric guitar sound\\" on records such as James Cotton's \\"Cotton Crop Blues\\" (1954).

Congress should address this problem. We have considered various alternatives: A joint committee on the old model of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy is one. A single committee in each house of Congress, combining authorizing and appropriating authorities, is another. The new committee or committees should conduct continuing studies of the activities of the intelligence agencies and report problems relating to the development and use of intelligence to all members of the House and Senate. We have already recommended that the total level of funding for intelligence be made public, and that the national intelligence program be appropriated to the National Intelligence Director, not to the secretary of defense. We also recommend that the intelligence committee should have a subcommittee specifically dedicated to oversight, freed from the consuming responsibility of working on the budget. The resolution creating the new intelligence committee structure should grant subpoena authority to the committee or committees. The majority party's representation on this committee should never exceed the minority's representation by more than one. Four of the members appointed to this committee or committees should be a member who also serves on each of the following additional committees: Armed Services, Judiciary, Foreign Affairs, and the Defense Appropriations subcommittee. In this way the other major congressional interests can be brought together in the new committee's work. Members should serve indefinitely on the intelligence committees, without set terms, thereby letting them accumulate expertise. The committees should be smaller-perhaps seven or nine members in each house-so that each member feels a greater sense of responsibility, and accountability, for the quality of the committee's work. The leaders of the Department of Homeland Security now appear before 88 committees and subcommittees of Congress. One expert witness (not a member of the administration) told us that this is perhaps the single largest obstacle impeding the department's successful development. The one attempt to consolidate such committee authority, the House Select Committee on Homeland Security, may be eliminated. The Senate does not have even this. Congress needs to establish for the Department of Homeland Security the kind of clear authority and responsibility that exist to enable the Justice Department to deal with crime and the Defense Department to deal with threats to national security.

Let's solve step-by-step:","response":"To determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, we need to analyze the statements given in the premise and hypothesis. Let's break it down: Premise: \\"Three children pose for a photograph by a rock.\\" - There are three children present. - The children are posing for a photograph. - The location of the photograph is near a rock. Hypothesis: \\"Three kids grin ear to ear.\\" - There are three kids (which we can assume refers to the same group of children mentioned in the premise). - The kids are grinning (smiling) broadly. Now we can assess if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. 1. Both premise and hypothesis mention three children or kids, so this part is consistent. 2. The premise states that the children are posing for a photograph, while the hypothesis states that the kids are grinning. These two actions are not mutually exclusive, as people often smile or grin when posing for a photograph. However, the premise does not explicitly mention that the children are grinning. 3. The location (by a rock) is irrelevant to whether the kids are grinning or not, so it does not affect the analysis. Based on the available information, we cannot conclude with certainty that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. While it is common for people to grin or smile when posing for a photograph, the premise does not directly mention this detail. Therefore, it is uncertain whether the kids in the premise are grinning ear to ear."},{"question":"Choose how you want this story to end. (CNN) -- Fresh reports of global espionage.

When a series of enigmatic deaths falls upon the community, renowned monster-hunter and expert in paranormal activities, Van Helsing, is called upon to unravel the mystery. What starts as a search for horrifying truths soon unveils an ancient power hungry for blood - that of Count Dracula himself. With the lines between the living and the undead blurring, it is up to Van Helsing to confront and defeat this age-old nemesis. Detailed Plot Outline: Act 1: Two grave-robbers make their way into an ancient cemetery, where they unintentionally break the seal on a crypt containing the slumbering Count Dracula. His awakening releases the dark magic, once again unleashing him into the world to feed upon the blood of the living. As daylight fades, whispers of vampires seducing their prey and sinister occurrences grow rampant. Alarmed by the troubling happenings, the city's authorities call on Van Helsing, a legendary monster hunter, to investigate the gruesome events. Act 2: Van Helsing arrives in London and meets a young, resourceful street urchin named Jack. Recognizing the boy's potential, he takes him under his wing, training him in the art of tracking and slaying monsters. Together, they follow a trail of blood and terror, discovering that these attacks are the work of a single, powerful vampire - Count Dracula. Unbeknownst to them, Dracula has a sinister plan for London's citizens. He intends to manipulate a solar eclipse and unleash an army of undead to overthrow the city and plunge the world into eternal darkness. Desperate to protect humanity, Van Helsing's search for clues leads him to a mysterious and wise Romani woman known as Madam Ilona. She tells them about the prophecy of the Nightfall, when darkness will consume the whole world. Act 3: As the solar eclipse looms near, Van Helsing and Jack prepare to defeat Dracula and his bloodthirsty legions. Armed with silver stakes, holy water, and garlic, they storm Dracula's lair, hidden deep within the catacombs beneath London. In a thrilling battle against the hordes of undead that guard the dormant Dracula, Van Helsing and Jack fight their way through close encounters and narrow escapes. However, they are not alone in their quest; Madam Ilona and a group of Romani fighters join forces with them to stop the menace. The climax unfolds as Van Helsing, Jack, and their newfound allies confront Dracula in his throne room. As the eclipse reaches its apex, a fierce battle ensues. Dracula proves to be an overwhelmingly powerful foe, with the ability to shape-shift and withstand their attacks. However, his thirst for blood proves to be his ultimate downfall. Luring him into a trap using Madam Ilona's blood magic, Van Helsing seizes the opportunity to deliver the fatal blow. Dracula is impaled upon a silver stake, his dark magic dissipated as sunlight banishes the eclipse. Act 4: After defeating Dracula and averting the prophecy of the Nightfall, the city of London celebrates its newfound freedom, commending Van Helsing and his companions for their bravery. Jack, now a skilled monster hunter, pledges to continue fighting for the forces of light against evil. Van Helsing bids farewell to his friends and continues his quest to rid the world of the creatures that prey upon humanity. As he exits the city, a new dawn breaks over London, vanquishing the darkness that once haunted the streets, and promising a brighter future for its citizens."},{"question":"Does the sentence \\"East Prussia had been occupied by Russian forces over the winter and would remain under their control until 1762, although Frederick did not see the Russians as an immediate threat and instead entertained hopes of first fighting a decisive battle against Austria that would knock them out of the war.\\" answer the question \\"What turned the battle for Olmutz against Frederick?\\"","response":"No, the sentence provided does not directly answer the question \\"What turned the battle for Olmutz against Frederick?\\" However, it does provide some relevant historical context to the events leading up to the battle. The sentence describes East Prussia being occupied by Russian forces over the winter and remaining under their control until 1762 during the Seven Years' War (1756-1763). It also mentions that King Frederick the Great of Prussia did not perceive the Russians as an immediate threat and focused on defeating Austria. The Battle of Olmutz took place on June 20, 1758, between the armies of Prussia, led by Frederick the Great, and Austria, led by Marshal Leopold Joseph von Daun. The question asks about the factors that led to the Prussian defeat. To answer this question, let's focus on some of the primary reasons for the unfavorable outcome for Frederick: 1. Underestimation of opposing forces: Frederick was deluded about the strength of the Austrian forces, specifically because of his focus on defeating them, as mentioned in the provided sentence. The Austrian army displayed exceptional strength compared to what Frederick had assumed, making it challenging for the Prussian forces to overcome them in battle. 2. Failure to prevent the Austrian reinforcement: One critical aspect that turned the battle against Frederick was his inability to stop Marshal Daun's army from reinforcing the Austrian garrison at Olmutz. Daun's resourceful tactics, including constructing a series of well-defended supply depots, allowed him to resupply the besieged garrison, making it extremely difficult for the Prussian forces to maintain the siege. 3. Tactical errors in the deployment of troops: Although the Prussian forces began the battle with a numerical advantage, Frederick made mistakes in deploying his troops and coordinating their movements. This led to significant confusion, which severely hampered their performance. 4. Ill-timed and heavily opposed retreat: Lastly, the decision to retreat came at an inopportune time. With the Austrian forces bearing down and Frederick's army in disarray, the retreat was carried out ineffectively, leading to many casualties. In conclusion, the sentence provided does not directly answer the question of what turned the Battle of Olmutz against Frederick. Nonetheless, it presents some background information on the political context and Frederick's preoccupations. To fully answer the question, it is crucial to examine the military tactics and decisions that led to the Prussian defeat, such as underestimating Austrian forces, failing to prevent reinforcements, tactical errors in deploying troops, and a disorganized retreat."},{"question":"Creatively image a question and justification for this answer: outer space","response":"Question: What is the best theme for a science fiction movie to inspire wonder and encourage discussions about the mysteries of the universe?

An earthquake in Old Jerusalem might be behind the famous image of the Shroud of Turin, says a group of researchers led by Alberto Carpinteri of the Politecnico di Torino in Italy in an article published in Springer’s journal Meccanica. They believe that neutron radiation caused by an earthquake could have induced the image of a crucified man – which many people believe to be that of Jesus – onto the length of linen cloth, and caused carbon-14 dating done on it in 1988 to be wrong. The Shroud has attracted widespread interest ever since Secondo Pia took the first photograph of it in 1898: about whether it is Jesus’ purported burial cloth, how old it might be, and how the image was created. According to radiocarbon dating done in 1988, the cloth was only 728 years old at the time. Other researchers have since suggested that the shroud is much older and that the dating process was incorrect because of neutron radiation – a process which is the result of nuclear fusion or nuclear fission during which free neutrons are released from atoms – and its interaction with the nuclei of other atoms to form new carbon isotopes. However, no plausible physical reason has yet been proposed to explain the origin of this neutron radiation. Now Carpinteri’s team, through mechanical and chemical experimentation, hypothesizes that high-frequency pressure waves generated in the Earth’s crust during earthquakes are the source of such neutron emissions. This is based on their research into piezonuclear fission reactions, which are triggered when very brittle rock specimens are crushed under a press machine. In the process, neutrons are produced without gamma emissions. Analogously, the researchers theorize further that neutron flux increments, in correspondence to seismic activity, should be a result of the same reactions. The researchers therefore believe that neutron emission from a historical earthquake in 33 A.D. in Old Jerusalem, which measured 8.2 on the Richter Scale, could have been strong enough to cause neutron imaging through its interaction with nitrogen nuclei. On the one hand, this could have created the distinctive image on the Shroud through radiation imagery, while on the other, it could have increased the level of carbon-14 isotopes found on the linen fibres that could have confused the 1988 radiocarbon dating tests. “We believe it is possible that neutron emissions by earthquakes could have induced the image formation on the Shroud’s linen fibres, through thermal neutron capture on nitrogen nuclei, and could also have caused a wrong radiocarbon dating,” hypothesizes Carpinteri. Contributing Source : Springer Science ||||| The authenticity of the Shroud of Turin has been in question for centuries and scientific investigations over the last few decades have only seemed to muddle the debate. Is the revered cloth a miracle or an elaborate hoax? Now, a study claims neutron emissions from an ancient earthquake that rocked Jerusalem could have created the iconic image, as well as messed up the radiocarbon levels that later suggested the shroud was a medieval forgery. But other scientists say this newly proposed premise leaves some major questions unanswered. The Shroud of Turin, which bears a faint image of a man's face and torso, is said to be the fabric that covered Jesus' body after his crucifixion in A.D. 33. Though the Catholic Church doesn't have an official position on the cloth, the relic is visited by tens of thousands of worshippers at the Turin Cathedral in Italy each year. [Religious Mysteries: 8 Alleged Relics of Jesus] Carbon and quakes Radiocarbon dating tests conducted at three different labs in the 1980s indicated the cloth was less than 800 years old, produced in the Middle Ages, between approximately A.D. 1260 and 1390. The first records of the shroud begin to appear in medieval sources around the same time, which skeptics don't think is a coincidence. Those results were published in the journal Nature in 1989. But critics in favor of a much older date for the cloth have alleged that those researchers took a sample of fabric that was used to patch up the burial shroud in the medieval period, or that the fabric had been subjected to fires, contamination and other damaged that skewed the results. The new theory hinges on neutrons released by a devastating earthquake that hit Old Jerusalem around the same time that Jesus is believed to have died. [Who Was Jesus, the Man?] All living things have the same ratio of stable carbon to radioactive carbon-14, but after death, the radioactive carbon decays in a predictable pattern over time. That's why scientists can look at the carbon-14 concentration in organic archaeological materials like fabrics, bones and wood to estimate age. Carbon-14 is typically created when neutrons from cosmic rays collide with nitrogen atoms in the atmosphere (though it can be unleashed by manmade nuclear reactions, too). The group of scientists, led by Alberto Carpinteri of the Politecnico di Torino in Italy, suspect high-frequency pressure waves generated in the Earth's crust during this earthquake could have produced significant neutron emissions. (They simulated this by crushing very brittle rock specimens under a press machine.) These neutron emissions could have interacted directly with nitrogen atoms in the linen fibers, inducing chemical reactions that created the distinctive face image on the shroud, the scientists say. The reactions also could have led to \\"a wrong radiocarbon dating,\\" which would explain the results of the 1989 experiments, Carpinteri said in a statement. Giulio Fanti, a professor of mechanical engineering at Padua University, published a book last year \\"Il Mistero della Sindone,\\" translated as \\"The Mystery of the Shroud,\\" (Rizzoli, 2013), arguing that his own analysis proves the shroud dates to Jesus' lifetime. In an email, Fanti said he is not sure if a neutron emission is the only possible source responsible for creating the body image. (His own theories include a corona discharge.) However, he wrote that he is \\"confident\\" the 1980s radiocarbon dating \\"furnished wrong results probably due to a neutron emission.\\" Shaky science? Even if it is theoretically possible for earthquake-generated neutrons to have caused this kind of reaction, the study doesn't address why this effect hasn't been seen elsewhere in the archaeological record, Gordon Cook, a professor of environmental geochemistry at the University of Glasgow, explained. \\"It would have to be a really local effect not to be measurable elsewhere,\\" Cook told Live Science. \\"People have been measuring materials of that age for decades now and nobody has ever encountered this.\\" Christopher Ramsey, director of the Oxford Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit, had a similar issue with the findings. \\"One question that would need to be addressed is why the material here is affected, but other archaeological and geological material in the ground is not,\\" Ramsey wrote in an email. \\"There are huge numbers of radiocarbon dates from the region for much older archaeological material, which certainly don't show this type of intense in-situ radiocarbon production (and they would be much more sensitive to any such effects).\\" Ramsey added that using radiocarbon dating to study objects from seismically active regions, such as regions like Japan, generally has not been problematic. It seems unlikely that the new study, published in the journal Meccanica, will settle any of the long-standing disputes about how and when the cloth was made, which depend largely on faith. \\"If you want to believe in the Shroud of Turin, you believe in it,\\" Cook said.

As Greeneville ascended to periscope depth, Waddle checked the sonar displays and the fire control station monitors, but reported later that he heard and saw nothing to suggest that the previously detected vessels in the area were now any closer to the submarine's position than had been reported before the submarine began the high speed maneuvers. Because the AVSDU was not working, Greeneville's executive officer, Lieutenant Commander Gerald K. Pfeifer, entered the sonar room and observed the contacts on the sonar screens. Pfeifer then stood in the doorway between the sonar and control rooms, but did not communicate any updated sonar information to Waddle in the control room. At 13:34, sonar gained a new contact, designated S-14. Because Greeneville had not maintained a steady, slow course for a sufficient amount of time, the sonar data available to the Fire Control Technician of the Watch did not allow accurate determination on Ehime Maru's range or course. Also, due to time constraints placed by Waddle, the ship did not perform normal maneuvers which would be used to obtain accurate course and range information on the sonar contacts prior to proceeding to periscope depth.At 13:38, Greeneville reached periscope depth (about 60 feet (18 m) below the surface). At this time, Ehime Maru was about 2,315 yards (2.117 km) or 1.14 nautical miles (2.1 km) away from the submarine and heading in her direction. Although sonar data began to more accurately depict Ehime Maru's true range and bearing at this point, this was not evident to the sonar operators. Lieutenant, Junior Grade Michael J. Coen, the officer of the deck, conducted an initial low magnification periscope search of the area and sighted no nearby ships. Waddle then took the periscope before Coen could complete the normal high magnification search. Since waves were washing over the periscope, Waddle ordered the submarine to go up another few feet to increase the distance the periscope can view. Waddle then looked through the periscope at the...

(August 2014) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In 1792, Spain reels amid the turmoil and upheaval of the French Revolution. Francisco Goya (Stellan SkarsgÃ¥rd) is a renowned painter, who, among others, does portraits for the royal family as the Official Court Painter to the King and Queen. The Spanish Inquisition is disturbed by part of Goya's work. Brother Lorenzo Casamares (Javier Bardem) is hiring Goya to paint a portrait and defends him, saying that his works are not evil, they just show evil. He recommends the Church step up the fight against anti-Catholic practices. He requests and is put in charge of intensifying the Inquisition. When posing in Goya's studio, Lorenzo asks Goya about a young model he uses, InÃ©s (Natalie Portman), daughter of a rich merchant, TomÃ¡s BilbatÃºa (JosÃ© Luis GÃ³mez) who also has a son named Ãngel (Unax Ugalde). InÃ©s is spotted by Inquisition spies (trained by Lorenzo) declining a dish of pork in a tavern. The Holy Office of the Inquisition orders InÃ©s to come to the office. There she is arrested and accused of \\"judaizing\\", i.e. spreading Jewish rituals, because she did not eat pork the other evening. She is stripped naked and tortured by strappado (\\"put to The Question\\"), confesses, and is imprisoned. Naturally, the Inquisition's archives had already revealed that one of her father's ancestors had converted from Judaism to Christianity in 1624 upon arrival in Spain from Amsterdam. TomÃ¡s begs Goya for help, who in turn asks Lorenzo to find out about InÃ©s's situation. Lorenzo visits InÃ©s in prison telling her that he is going to help her and will pass a message to her family if she wishes. He offers to pray with InÃ©s, but is clearly struggling with his desire to rape her as she prays in the nude with him at his request.

This was initially termed \\"splat cooling\\" by doctoral student W. Klement at Caltech, who showed that cooling rates on the order of millions of degrees per second is sufficient to impede the formation of crystals, and the metallic atoms become \\"locked into\\" a glassy state. Amorphous metal wires have been produced by sputtering molten metal onto a spinning metal disk. More recently a number of alloys have been produced in layers with thickness exceeding 1 millimeter. These are known as bulk metallic glasses (BMG). Liquidmetal Technologies sell a number of zirconium-based BMGs. Batches of amorphous steel have also been produced that demonstrate mechanical properties far exceeding those found in conventional steel alloys. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What type of metal makes better alloys than traditional steel?","response":"Alright, imagine you are playing with different kinds of building blocks. Normally, when you build something with blocks, they stick together in a nice pattern, just like the atoms in regular metal do. But, if you cool down some melted metals really, really fast, it's like the blocks are freezing before they can find their perfect spot. This makes a special kind of metal called amorphous metal. It's different from regular metals because it doesn't have a neat pattern, and instead, it looks like a jumble of blocks. People discovered that sometimes, these amorphous metals can be stronger and more interesting than regular metals, like steel. One example of a metal that can make better alloys than traditional steel is a mix of zirconium, which Liquidmetal Technologies makes. These are called Bulk Metallic Glasses (BMG) because they are thicker than usual amorphous metals. So, zirconium-based amorphous metals can be a better choice than traditional steel!"},{"question":"Generate a tweet that has the following sentiment: negative","response":"Oh no! 🙁 Today is just not going well.

It's a shame The Child isn't better as it works from a decent idea that takes in a couple of sometimes successful horror themes. We have the idea of a vengeful child, which worked so well in classic films such as The Bad Seed and then we have the central zombie theme, which of course has been the backbone of many a successful horror movie. The plot is basically this: young girl blames a load of people for the death of her mother, so she goes to the graveyard and raises the dead to get revenge (as you do). This is all well and good, except for the fact that it's boring! Nothing happens for most of the film, and although it does pick up at the end with some nice gore; it's not enough of a finale to justify sitting through the rest of it.

Chelsea Attonley, 30, who was born a boy and called Matthew, said she now finds being a woman 'exhausting', is tired of putting on make-up and wearing heels, and now accepts that she should always have stayed a man. Chelsea said she had struggled with her identity while growing up in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, and as a child she would dress up in women's clothes. In her twenties she became a drag queen known as Miss Malibu, drawing on glamour model Katie Price's look for inspiration. Scroll down for video. Chelsea Attonley, 30, who was born a boy and called Matthew, had a £10,000 sex change on the NHS to become a woman. She now wants the taxpayer to foot the bill for a further £14,000 of surgery so she can become a man again. An initial bid for a sex change to become a woman was turned down by a doctor, sending Chelsea into a spiral of depression, she said. But then the former drag queen, who copied Jordan's style by wearing a blonde wig, mini skirts and stilettos, had a chance meeting with her idol in a nightclub in 2007. The glamour model told her to 'go for it' and her words inspired Chelsea to return to her GP and push once again for the gender reassignment surgery, costing £10,000. But now, seven years after surgery to become a woman, Chelsea wants to go back to being a man - and wants the taxpayer to foot the bill. Chelsea, who lives on welfare benefits, told a magazine yesterday she finds dressing and acting as a girl 'exhausting' and feels she has never been fully accepted as a real woman. She is aiming to have a breast reduction on the NHS and painful gender reassignment surgery to give her back a penis at a total cost of £14,000. Chelsea, who changed her name by deed poll from Matthew in 2008 after a £5,000 boob job in Thailand partly funded by benefit money, says she gradually began having doubts about the sex change. Chelsea, now living in London, said: 'I have always longed to be a woman, but no amount of surgery can give me an actual female body and I feel like I am living a lie. 'It is exhausting putting on make-up and wearing heels all the time. Even then I don't feel I look like a proper woman. 'I suffered from depression and anxiety as a result of the hormones too. 'I have realised it would be easier to stop fighting the way I look naturally and accept that I was born a man physically.' Chelsea, who spoke on ITV's This Morning earlier this year about Katie Price's encouragement, says she does not feel guilty about asking the taxpayer to pay for her reversion. 'Now I have decided I want to live as Matthew, I am desperate to have my FF-cup boobs removed,' she said. 'I can't afford to have them done privately, so I am hoping to have the op on the NHS. 'I can't work at the moment because I am too upset after what I have been through. 'I am considering having penis reconstruction too. I don't feel bad about the NHS paying for the surgery as I don't consider it a choice. 'I need to have these operations for the sake of my mental health. I am lucky enough to live in a country where there is free health care.' Chelsea, who changed her name by deed poll from Matthew in 2008 after a £5,000 boob job in Thailand partly funded by benefit money, says she gradually began having doubts about the sex change. She said: 'I thought the surgery would make me feel complete, but it didn't. 'I knew deep down that, even though I had had surgery, I had still been born a man. 'But I tried my best to block out my feelings.' Chelsea said living as a woman is exhausting. 'No matter how much make-up I put on or how I dressed, I knew people would not know me as a real woman. Chelsea, now living in London, said: 'I have always longed to be a woman, but no amount of surgery can give me an actual female body and I feel like I am living a lie' 'It was draining to constantly think about how to walk and speak like a girl. 'I was fighting a losing battle. When people found out about my past, they treated me like a liar and a fake. I suffered from anxiety and depression.' She said she lost the support of her mother when she died from a heart attack. She said : 'I could not keep up the act of pretending to be a woman any more. It was making me miserable. 'I had to go back to living as Matthew.' She said she had always struggled with her identity while growing up in Chesterfield, Derbyshire. As a child she would dress up in women's clothes, and in her twenties she became a drag queen known as Miss Malibu. Chelsea has already had testosterone injections to begin her transition to becoming a man again. She has also had testosterone injections to stimulate hair growth and has cut his hair. She added: 'If people criticise me for wanting treatment on the NHS, it does not bother me. 'I know I need these changes to make me happy and no one should deny me that.' The TaxPayers' Alliance yesterday insisted the NHS should not be expected to pay out again. Research director Alex Wild said: 'The NHS must prioritise crucial frontline services over ridiculous vanity operations. 'This whole saga has simply cost far too much. If the Health Service is to be properly funded, this sort of waste must be cut out.'

After initially having a £10,000 sex change on the NHS to become a woman, Chelsea now wishes for taxpayers to cover a further £14,000 of surgery costs for her to become a man again. Chelsea, born as Matthew, had struggled with her identity growing up in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, and in her twenties, became a drag queen called Miss Malibu. She had initially been turned down for gender reassignment surgery, but after meeting glamour model Katie Price in 2007, Chelsea was inspired to return to her general practitioner and push for the surgery. However, seven years after becoming a woman, Chelsea finds dressing and acting as a girl exhausting and feels she has never been fully accepted as a real woman. She aims to have a breast reduction and painful gender reassignment surgery on the NHS to give her back a penis, at a total cost of £14,000. Chelsea, who is living on welfare benefits, does not feel guilty about asking taxpayers to pay for the reversion, stating she needs the operations for the sake of her mental health. She believes she is lucky enough to live in a country with free healthcare. Nevertheless, the TaxPayers' Alliance insists that the NHS should not be expected to pay out again, with research director, Alex Wild, stating that the NHS must prioritize crucial frontline services over what he calls \\"ridiculous vanity operations.\\""},{"question":"Q: Context: \\"Let It Be\\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles, released in March 1970 as a single, and (in an alternate mix) as the title track of their album Let It Be. At the time, it had the highest debut on the Billboard Hot 100, beginning its chart run at number 6. It was written and sung by Paul McCartney. It was their final single before McCartney announced his departure from the band. Both the Let It Be album and the US single \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" were released after McCartney's announced departure from and the subsequent break-up of the group. The alternate mix on their album Let It Be features an additional guitar solo and some minor differences in the orchestral sections. Question: who wrote the lyrics to let it be? Let's give stream of consciousness first:","response":"When thinking about the song \\"Let It Be\\" by the Beatles, it's important to consider the context in which it was released and its significance to the band. Released in March 1970, it gained notoriety on the Billboard Hot 100, which highlights the song's popularity. Furthermore, recalling that it was the band's last single before the announcement of Paul McCartney's departure provides some clues as to who may have been responsible for writing the lyrics. In this case, it was indeed written and sung by Paul McCartney. So, the answer to the question of who wrote the lyrics to \\"Let It Be\\" is Paul McCartney."},{"question":"Find the right ending to this passage.

The fighters were flooding into the airport and about 80 percent of the complex was under their control, according to an Afghan security official. A Reuters eyewitness said there were was heavy fighting around the airport. Earlier Tuesday, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani vowed to retake Kunduz from the militants, urging his nation to trust Afghan troops to do the job. In a televised address to the nation, Ghani said the military had launched a counter-offensive with the help of a U.S. airstrike. The U.S. military said it carried out the airstrike \\"in order to eliminate a threat to the force,\\" in the words of U.S. and NATO missions spokesman Col. Brian Tribus. The Associated Press did not elaborate if more airstrikes would follow. The AP also noted that there were no U.S. or NATO troops in Kunduz at the time of the airstrike. Sarwar Hussaini, a provincial police spokesman, told the Associated Press Afghan forces had launched an operation on several fronts around Kunduz to try and retake the city of approximately 300,000 people. The Defense Ministry vowed in a statement to Reuters that the city would soon be retaken. Reuters reported that government forces had spent the night holed up at Kunduz's airport after being driven out of the city itself the day before. The Defense Ministry claimed that the city's prison and the provincial police headquarters had been retaken. That claim could not independently be verified as the city was off limits to media. An Afghan government official in the city told Reuters that there was heavy fighting in the city and said most residents were without electricity and phone service. Residents reached over the phone by The Associated Press said sporadic gunfire could still be heard around the city on Tuesday morning. The city fell Monday, after hundreds of Taliban gunmen launched a coordinated, multi-pronged attack at several points around the city. After a day of fierce fighting, they managed to overrun government buildings and hoisted their flag in the city square. The fast-moving assault took the military and intelligence authorities by surprise. During the Taliban assault on the city on Monday, the insurgents had freed around 600 inmates -- including 144 members of the Taliban -- from Kunduz prison, officials said. In Kabul, the National Security Council was to meet later Tuesday over the fall of Kunduz, a government official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss government plans. After taking the city Monday, Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Mansour issued a statement aimed at calming the city's residents and calling on the Afghan government to admit defeat. \\"These conquests are result of almighty Allah's support and the mujahideen (fighters) sacrifices. Therefore, officials in Kabul have to admit their defeat with courage,\\" the statement said. \\"Kunduz residents should not be worried about their lives and property. They should continue as normal without any tension The International Red Cross said it had evacuated two of its three international staff from Kunduz, flying them to the nearby city of Mazar-I-Sharif. The U.N. office in Kunduz was also evacuated. The city's fall comes as President Ashraf Ghani marks one year in office. The president, who has staked his presidency on pledges of bringing peace to Afghanistan and who seeks to draw the Taliban to peace talks, was to address the nation later Tuesday. Kunduz is one of the largest and wealthiest cities in Afghanistan, and the surrounding province, also called Kunduz, is one of the country's chief breadbaskets. It lies on a strategic crossroads connecting Afghanistan to Pakistan, China and Central Asia. The Associated Press contributed to this report. What is a short summary of the above article?","response":"There are some people called the Taliban who are trying to take over a city called Kunduz in Afghanistan by attacking a big airport there. They are fighting against the Afghan soldiers who are trying to protect the city. The President of Afghanistan, Ashraf Ghani, promised that they will try their best to take the city back and make it safe for the people who live there.

Stream of Consciousness Reasoning: The asked question seeks to determine the sum of the first four odd prime numbers. The key here is to recognize two things: first, \\"odd\\" refers to numbers that have a remainder of 1 when divided by 2; second, \\"prime numbers\\" are those that are divisible only by 1 and themselves. It is important to note that the only even prime number is 2, the smallest prime number. Since the question specifically concerns odd prime numbers, 2 will be excluded from the consideration. Now, let's identify the first four odd prime numbers. The smallest odd number is 3, but is it a prime number as well? Yes, as it is only divisible by 1 and 3, it is an odd prime number. Next, 5 is the next odd number. It is also only divisible by 1 and 5, qualifying it as a prime. The subsequent odd number is 7, which is divisible by 1 and 7 only and is thus another odd prime number. Continuing the search, the next odd number is 9, which is divisible by 3. As a result, it is not a prime number, so it is disregarded. The next odd number, 11, is only divisible by 1 and 11. This means it is the fourth odd prime number. With the four odd prime numbers identified (3, 5, 7, and 11), the task is now to find the sum of these numbers. Adding them together: 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 = 26 However, upon closer examination, the sum of 26 doesn't justify the given answer of 17. After reevaluating the question and stream of consciousness reasoning, there doesn't seem to be a clear justification for the answer 17."},{"question":"How does the sentence end? So Options are: [a].

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) took a break ... to read bedtime stories to his two young girls. He said that his two daughters were watching C-SPAN2 at home — he told them to turn on the station at 8 p.m. Cruz read his daughters verses from the Bible. And then he moved on to the Dr. Seuss classic, \\"Green Eggs and Ham.\\" Jason Johnson, Cruz's chief campaign strategist, tweeted a photo of Cruz's daughters watching him on television at home: Below is video of Cruz's dramatic rendition on the Senate floor. He concluded by telling his daughters, \\"Daddy's going to be home soon, to read to you in person.\\" And, yes, \\"Green Eggs and Ham\\" will now forever be in the Senate record. ||||| Updated Sept. 25, 12:31 p.m. Republican Sen. Ted Cruz’s more than 21 hour, overnight talk-a-thon against Obamacare had its share of memorable moments from the bizarre to the cringe-worthy. The Tea Party favored Texas senator had vowed to speak in support of defunding Obamacare “until I am no longer able to stand“–and beginning Tuesday afternoon at 2:41 p.m. EST he did just that, quoting “words of wisdom” from Duck Dynasty to Darth Vader impressions. Cruz’s full day faux-filibuster (to a virtually empty Senate chamber) ended around noon Wednesday. The Senate was expected to decide shortly to move ahead with a vote on the House spending bill that strips funding from Obamacare. The Democrat-controlled Senate will likely send back a new version of the spending bill to the House, setting up the possibility of a government shutdown if the two sides can’t find a compromise before the budget year ends, Sept. 30. While Cruz’s overnight tirade against the Affordable Care Act was pointless in terms of effecting Senate outcome, it did get Washington talking. Here are 11 of the most talked about moments in what was dubbed “#tedtalks” by the Twitterverse. Green Eggs and Ham Cruz said that his father “invented” green eggs and ham. Bringing the “Green Eggs and Ham” story full circle, Ted Cruz read the Dr. Seuss book to his two daughters as a bedtime story. (He also read a Bible story.) Cruz linked the famous Dr. Seuss story to Obamacare: “Americans tried it, they did not like it…with a fox, in a box, in a house, or with a mouse.” In fact, the popular story is about trying something you thought you wouldn’t like and, in the end, liking it. This video is playable across all supported devices. Texas Senator Ted Cruz reads two bedtime stories to his daughters at home and likens Obamacare to “Green Eggs and Ham.” More stories “One of my favorite children’s stories, actually from when I was a kid, was ‘The Little Engine That Could.’ The Little Engine That Could, the train going up that said over and over again, ‘I think I can, I think I can. I think I can.’ You know, if you listen to a lot of the members of this body, the message would be simple: that little engine can’t.” Nazis, Cold War, and revolutionaries Cruz likened the uphill battle against Obamacare to other unlikely triumphs throughout history, like leaders who stood against the Nazis, put a man on the moon, ended the Cold War, or started the American Revolution. “If you go to the 1940s, Nazi Germany…look, we saw Britain, Neville Chamberlain, who told the British people, ‘accept the Nazis. Yes, they’ll dominate the continent of Europe but that’s not our problem. Let’s appease them. Why? Because it can’t be done. We can’t possibly stand against them.” This video is playable across all supported devices. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, talks about difficult situations that Americans have faced during his Tuesday speech on the Senate floor against the Affordable Care Act. Burgers “I like their little burgers…I’m a big fan of eating White Castle burgers.” Fashion choices “I do feel this is a confession of sorts,” Cruz said of his decision to wear comfortable black tennis shoes over his typical “argument boots” on the Senate floor. “I will embarrassingly admit that I took the coward’s way out.” Ashton Kutcher Cruz gave a shout-out to Ashton Kutcher, praising the actor’s Teen Choice Awards speech earlier this year and supporting his message of hard work. “It was a great message to young people,” Cruz said. “I don’t know Mr. Kutcher. I’ve watched his TV shows and his movies. I don’t know him personally, but you know what? He can speak to millions of young people who…would never listen to me.” Great American anthems Around 2 a.m. Cruz mentioned and spoke the lyrics of Toby Keith’s “Courtesy of the Red, White, and Blue.” While he did not sing, he did censor when he came to the point in the song that says “’cause we’ll put a boot in your – posterior.” The new ‘Lost Generation’ Cruz blamed Obamacare for creating a new “lost generation” of young people who cannot find jobs and are instead moving home with their parents. ‘Duck Dynasty’ “I want to point out some words of wisdom from Duck Dynasty,” Cruz said in the early hours of the morning. He then pointed out “Redneck rule number one: most things can be fixed with duct tape and extension cords,” as well as some other words to live by from the DD cast of the popular A&E series. Star Wars…and a little guy named Darth Vader “That phrase of ‘rebellion against oppression’ reminded me of the rebel alliance fighting against The Empire – The Empire being the Washington, D.C. establishment. And upon hearing that phrase I wondered if at some point we were going to see a tall gentleman, in a mechanical breathing apparatus, come forward and say in a deep voice, ‘Mike Lee, I am your father.’” Cruz did that last part in his best Darth Vader voice. This video is playable across all supported devices. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, uses a famous line from the \\"Star Wars\\" series in the 18th hour of his Senate address against Obamacare and its pending omission from the Senate's government funding bill. Arguing over the rulebook Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid joined Cruz on the floor just before his time expired before lunch, engaging in a spirited debate over rules of the Senate floor. As soon as Cruz’s time expired, Reid addressed the chamber: “I’m not sure we learned anything new…but it’s been interesting to watch.” Then, calling the faux-filibuster what it was: “It’s been a big waste of time.” Reporting contributed by NBC’s Kasie Hunt and Kelly O’Donnell ||||| Ted Cruz finally released his grip on the Senate floor after more than 21 hours of speaking about the need to defund Obamacare. The Texas Republican seized control of the Senate floor on Tuesday about 2:42 p.m. vowing to “speak in support of defunding Obamacare until I am no longer able to stand.” Cruz could have spoken all the way up to a 1 p.m. procedural vote on moving spending bill forward, but he relented at noon. Text Size - + reset Top 10 Cruz floor quotes Debt ceiling: By the numbers “It is my it intention to accept the end of this at noon,” Cruz said. After his 20th hour holding the floor, Cruz asked Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) to come to the floor to listen to a pair of requests that sparked a bizarre exchange. Cruz asked to waive Wednesday’s vote and move a high-stakes procedural vote to Friday rather than Saturday to allow more people to watch. “I think it is better for this country that this vote is visible,” Cruz said. “Sticking it on Saturday in the middle in the middle of football games would disserve that objective.” Reid ignored Cruz’s requests and asked for far more time to be yielded back to allow the House more time to consider what the Senate will send back. “There’s a possibility that they may not accept what we send them and they may want to send us something back,” Reid said. Cruz cut off Reid, accusing him of “making a speech” rather than asking Cruz a question. Despite his Ironman stand on the floor of the upper chamber, Cruz could not stop a Senate already in motion from eventually returning a clean continuing resolution to the House scant days before a government shutdown is scheduled to take effect on Oct. 1. Under Senate rules, the latest the upper chamber could take the first procedural vote on a House spending bill that defunds Obamacare is 1 p.m. on Wednesday — a reality Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) broadcast to the world Tuesday morning when he opened the Senate and again on Wednesday. (PHOTOS: Longest filibusters in history) “This is not a filibuster. This is an agreement that he and I made that he could talk,” Reid said Wednesday. In other words, from the beginning it was all over save for the theatrics. But Cruz offered plenty Tuesday by holding the Senate floor for hours about why Obamacare should cease to exist. He was flanked at times by Republican Sens. David Vitter of Louisiana, Mike Lee of Utah, Jeff Sessions of Alabama, Pat Roberts of Kansas, Mike Enzi of Wyoming, James Inhofe of Oklahoma, Jim Risch of Idaho, Marco Rubio of Florida and Rand Paul of Kentucky, who recommended Cruz wear comfortable shoes and not eat food on national television. Cruz touched on a wide variety of subjects during his marathon, from Dr. Seuss to college kids’ inability to find White Castle burgers during the wee hours because of Obamacare. He read tweets from constituents and related stories from a “lost generation” of young people plagued by the Affordable Care Act. (PHOTOS: Key quotes from Ted Cruz) He also read bedtime stories to his children, who he said were at home watching him on C-SPAN. One was the Seuss tale “Green Eggs and Ham.” Cruz was even joined by Democrats, including Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia and Majority Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois, who pointedly questioned Cruz both Tuesday night and Wednesday morning. Kaine sparred with Cruz for 30 minutes and argued some voters had sent people to Washington to preserve Obamacare. Kaine won his Senate seat in 2012 by besting former Sen. George Allen (R-Va.), who had staked his election on repeal. Durbin on Tuesday explained why he voted for the health care law and argued the law made it easier for one of his constituents to qualify for Medicaid. Durbin asked if — given Cruz’s Ivy League education — he knew he did not have the votes to defund Obamacare in the Senate. (WATCH: Cruz’s speech: 10 colorful quotes) “Certainly the senator realizes that it takes 60 votes,” Durbin told Cruz. “I would note that I’m quite familiar with what is necessary to defund Obamacare,” Cruz shot back. Cruz bashed his colleagues in Washington for accepting that stopping Obamacare is impossible and charged that the outcome of the drama in the Senate this week is predetermined, comparing it to professional wrestling. He also dinged anonymous staffers and Republican lawmakers for criticizing him in the press, yet also divulged a conversation between Lee and an anonymous House member. According to Cruz, that lawmaker told Lee of the House sending over its defund bill: “You guys should be grateful. We gave you your vote.” (QUIZ: Do you know Ted Cruz?) “Why should we feel gratitude for a vote that’s destined to lose?” Cruz asked of other Republicans, referring to Reid’s procedural upper-hand. “Symbolic votes are great for getting elected.” A potential 2016 presidential candidate, Cruz is playing to the GOP base as much as he is bashing business as usual inside the Capitol. He said some lawmakers are too concerned with hitting the D.C. cocktail circuit, taking show votes and giving speeches to change the way Washington works, asking at one point: “Where is the outrage?” “A lot of members of this body have — at least so far — not showed up to battle,” Cruz said, repeatedly referring to the empty chairs in the Senate chamber while he talked. “The chattering class is quick to discipline anyone who doesn’t fall in line.” (Also on POLITICO: Hillary Clinton defends Obamacare, slams defunding efforts) Cruz said his speech was meant to “celebrate” the American democratic system and that if senators listened to their constituents back home, he and his conservative allies truly could win. “The vote would be 100-0 to defund Obamacare,” he said ||||| The Senate voted, 54-44, along party lines to approve the continuing resolution, a bill to fund the federal government past September 30th, the end of the fiscal year. The original House measure funded the federal government at current sequester levels of 986.3 billion through December 15 and defunds the Affordable Care Act (ACA), but the Senate passed an amendment, offered by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV), to remove the defunding of the health care law from the bill as well as moving the length of the CR from December 15 to November 15, on a straight party-line vote, 54-44. The House of Representatives is awaiting receipt of the Senate’s changes to the bill and House leaders have announced plans to hold weekend sessions so lawmakers can take action on the bill. At that time, House Speaker Boehner and the Republican leadership will then have to decide whether to accept the Senate CR or pass yet another version and risk not meeting the September 30 deadline. Beginning Tuesday afternoon, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) spoke for more than 21 hours about his opposition to the ACA and why he wants to block the continuing resolution. In this latest series of votes, he voted against ending debate, and against the amended bill. On Thursday afternoon, Sen. Reid offered a unanimous consent motion to move to an immediate vote on the bill in order, he said, to give the House of Representatives more time to work. Sen. Cruz and Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) objected to that motion, leading to a debate between those senators and Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN) over the path of the bill. ||||| Write a summary.","response":"In 2013, during his marathon speech on the Senate floor in opposition to the Affordable Care Act, Senator Ted Cruz took a break to read bedtime stories to his two young daughters, who were watching C-SPAN2 at home.

I was approximately 8 years and it happened to be summer. Baseball was a true love and my brothers and friends played daily. In the summer, all we wore were cut off jeans and nothing else. I had stepped on a rusty nail and it became infected. Time for a Tetanus shot! This was a typical occurrence for us during the summer. There was only one doctor within a one hundred square mile area and his name was Doctor Brandenbury. He was a very unpleasant, elderly man that my brothers and I did not care for since he was just a mean, old bastard. So I am shuffled off to his office and of course after hearing what had a occurred and examining my foot agreed I needed the Tetanus shot. I make a very innocent request as he is about to give me the shot. Since I knew the shot would stiffen my arm and essentially cause pain I would take it in my left arm so my throwing arm would not be affected. I tried to request this from the doctor but he did not wish to hear anything from me. He said \\"I don't give a fuck what arm you get it in.\\" He grabbed me roughly by the right arm and used the needle like a dart and just slammed it into my arm. I had never had a problem with shots before but that REALLY hurt. I started crying. He instructed my mother \\"To get me the Hell out of his office.\\" Needless to say my mother never took any of us to see this old, miserable bastard again. She found another doctor that actually treated us like we were human.

Needless to say, it was too hot to do anything outside. But it was also scorching in our apartment. This was 1962, and I would not live in a place with an air conditioner for another ten years. So my brother and I decided to leave the apartment to find someplace indoors. He suggested we could see a movie. It was a brilliant plan. Movie theaters were one of the few places you could sit all day and--most important --sit in air conditioning. In those days, you could buy one ticket and sit through two movies. Then, the theater would show the same two movies again. If you wanted to, you could sit through them twice. Most people did not do that, but the manager at our theater. Mr. Bellow did not mind if you did. That particular day, my brother and I sat through both movies twice, trying to escape the heat. We bought three bags of popcorn and three sodas each. Then, we sat and watched The Music Man followed by The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. We'd already seen the second movie once before. _ had been at the theater since January, because Mr. Bellow loved anything with John Wayne in it. We left the theater around 8, just before the evening shows began. But we returned the next day and saw the same two movies again, twice more. And we did it the next day too. Finally, on the fourth day, the heat wave broke. Still, to this day I can sing half the songs in The Music Man and recite half of John Wayne and Jimmy Stewart's dialogue from The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance! Those memories are some of the few I have of the heat wave of 1962. They're really memories of the screen, not memories of my life. Question: What do we know about Mr. Bellow?

It was indeed — until 1869. Grants of tax-free land over the years had been made to Buddhist temples and members of the court aristocracy. The most powerful families thus carved out for themselves whole regions that were to become the fiefdoms of Japanese feudalism. By the end of the eighth century the clans had created a hierarchy of shiki, or rights, from the highest to the lowest ranks of society. The aristocrat or court patron lent his prestige to a powerful provincial proprietor, who employed a competent estate-manager to oversee smallholders, who in turn worked their farms with dependent laborers. This elaborate structure of interdependent rights and obligations was to serve Japanese society right into the 20th century. Meanwhile, Heian court life blossomed in an effusion of aesthetic expression. Princes and princesses judged the merits of birds, insects, flowers, roots, or seashells. Literary party games held in ornate palace gardens required each guest to compose a small poem as his wine cup floated toward him along a miniature winding channel of water. Expeditions were organized to the best viewing points for the first spring cherry blossoms, and special pavilions were built to watch the rising of the full moon. Every gesture, from the most banal opening of an umbrella to the sublimest act of lovemaking, had its appropriate ceremonial. Conversation often took the form of elegant exchanges of improvised verse. The changing role of Chinese culture in Japanese life was epitomized in the language itself. In the absence of an indigenous alphabet, Japanese scholars had with the greatest difficulty tried to adapt the complex ideograms of monosyllabic Chinese to the essentially polysyllabic Japanese. Thus developed the katakana system used as a vehicle for writing Buddhist names and concepts. After rival Fujiwara factions had been struggling for years to gain control of the imperial throne, they turned to the Taira and Minamoto armies in 1156 to wage the four-year war that heralded the end of the golden age of the Heian court. The Taira, controlling the region along the Inland Sea, defeated the Minamoto armies based in the Kanto province east of the capital. Do you have any questions?","response":"Yes, I have a few questions to better understand the context and details of the Golden Heian Era: 1. What were the primary factors that led to the choice of Heian-kyo (Kyoto) as the imperial family's auspicious site? 2.

Can you provide some examples of the influence of Chinese culture on Japanese aesthetic expressions during this period? 4. What particular characteristics and practices made the Heian Era's court life unique compared to other periods in Japanese history? 5. Was there any significant impact of the changing landscape of the Japanese language during this time (such as the development of the katakana system)? 6. What was the primary cause of the Fujiwara factions' struggle for control of the imperial throne, and how did their struggles impact the society and political landscape of Japan during the Heian Era? 7.

The earliest records of the Games go back to 776 B.C.. These contests were held every four years. They were important to the Greeks. When they took place, all wars were stopped. No one dared to break the truce of Olympic. Criers announced the names of winning athletes everywhere in the land. Artists made statues of them. Poets wrote about the Olympic heroes. The first Olympians raced the length of the stadium at Olympia--about 200 yards. But later other events were added:longer races, broad jumping, the javelin throw, the marathon race, and the discus throw. Then boxing, wrestling and horseback riding were also added. In the beginning, only Greeks competed in the Games. But in later centuries, athletes from other lands joined. In 146 B.C. the Romans conquered Greece. Soon the Games began to change. Under the Romans, they became rougher, wilder, and bloodier. Many professionals took part, which was against the spirit of the Olympics. Finally, Emperor Theodosius of Rome decided that the Olympics were a public danger. He died away with them after the Games of A.D. 392. They had lasted over 1,000 years. Fifteen hundred years passed.

The tweet seems to be referencing a statement or question made by another user, but without the context of that statement, it is challenging to decipher the sentiment.

Many glaciers from temperate, alpine and seasonal polar climates store water as ice during the colder seasons and release it later in the form of meltwater as warmer summer temperatures cause the glacier to melt, creating a water source that is especially important for plants, animals and human uses when other sources may be scant. Within high altitude and Antarctic environments, the seasonal temperature difference is often not sufficient to release meltwater. Do Earth's lakes or glaciers hold the most freshwater?","response":"Glaciers hold the most freshwater on Earth. While lakes have some water, glaciers have much more. They store water as ice and release it as meltwater during warmer seasons. This water is important for plants, animals, and humans.

M: That makes sense for a genetic major. What did you do? Clean the cages? W: This is a wild life center, not a zoo. This place breeds endangered species and tries to prepare them for life in the wild. M: You mean the endangered species like the tiger and the panda? W: Well, endangered species, yes. But not tigers or pandas. I work with whooping cranes and sandhill cranes. I taught the baby crane how to eat and drink, and I help the vets to give medical check-ups. M: I can see it was hard to leave that job. But how did you teach a bird how to eat and drink? W: We covered ourselves up with cloth and used puppets made out of stuffed crones to show the baby chicks what to do. Then the chicks copied what the puppets did. M: Cloth? Puppets? Sounds like fun. W: It was. The cloth and puppets are the key tools. We all covered ourselves up, the scientists, the vets, the junior staff, everybody. You see, baby cranes will become attached to their caretakers. M: So if the caretaker is a person, the crane will stay in places where people are. W: Yeah. And their chances for survival aren't very good. But by covering ourselves and using cloth and puppets the chicks are more likely to seek out other birds rather than people. And their transition to the wild has a better chance of being successful. M: A chance of being successful? Hasn't this been done before? W: It's been done with sandhill cranes and everyone is optimistic about its work with whooping cranes too.

David Hogg, one of the most outspoken survivors of the Valentine’s Day bloodshed which left 17 dead, first gained headlines after it emerged he interviewed class mates while the massacre was taking place. The teenager has since become a prominent voice in the debate around gun control and addressed a crowd of thousands at the Washington DC March For Our Lives rally last month. He welcomed demonstrators to the “revolution” for stricter gun laws and called for politicians who are supported by the National Rifle Association to get their “resumes ready”. Stallone, an actor who is the younger brother of Sylvester Stallone, has provoked a ferocious backlash for his remarks about Mr Hogg. \\"This David Hogg p***y is getting a little big for his britches. I'm sure someone from his age group is dying to sucker punch this rich little b****,” Stallone said in a now-deleted tweet. “Watch him run home like the coward he is. He's the worst rep for today's youth headline grabbing punk”. Stallone also lashed out at Emma Gonzalez - a fellow gun activist and student survivor from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. ”Emma Gonzalez is another headline grabbing clown. She thinks she it she ain’t s***,” he said. Despite the fact both tweets have been deleted and his account is now protected - so only visible to certain users - screenshots of the tweets have circulated on Twitter.

Translate to Romanian Romanian:","response":"Mulți lideri europeni - colegii dvs. - urmăresc evaluările popularității. În ultimii ani, am observat o creștere a atenției acordate evaluarilor popularității printre liderii politici şi cei europeni, în principal din cauza schimbărilor dramatice și a instabilității care au caracterizat scena politică globală. Evaluările popularității reprezintă un instrument relevant pentru a măsura susținerea publică pentru anumite politici și lideri, precum și pentru a evalua direcția țărilor și regiunilor în ansamblu. Unele dintre motivele pentru care liderii europeni ar urmări evaluările popularității includ: 1) O înțelegere a tendințelor electorale din fiecare țară și regiune și potențialul lor impact asupra politicii europene în ansamblu. Acest lucru poate ajuta la anticiparea schimbărilor în cadrul diverselor partide politice și la identificarea problemelor potențiale care ar putea afecta agenda Uniunii Europene (UE). 2) Monitorizarea impactului politici europene asupra opiniilor publice și percepțiilor locale. Evaluările popularității pot oferi date valoroase cu privire la eficacitatea politicii UE și la modul în care cetățenii Europei primesc și percep aceste politici. Aceasta informație poate fi folosită pentru a adapta și a îmbunătăți strategiile politice existente. 3) Identificarea problemelor sau a crizelor iminente care s-ar putea să genereze nemulțumiri sau nemulțumiri în rândul cetățenilor europeni. Prin analiza evaluarilor popularității în diferite țări și regiuni, liderii politici pot interveni in timp util pentru a aborda aceste probleme și a menține stabilitatea și coeziunea în cadrul UE. 4) Evaluarea performanței propriilor partide sau a liderilor lor în comparație cu alți lideri politici europeni. Acest lucru poate servi drept baza pentru benchmarking și poate ajuta liderii să identifice oportunități de cooperare sau competiție cu ceilalți lideri la nivel european. 5) Înțelegerea traiectoriei diferitelor mișcări și partide politice din întreaga Europă și capacitatea lor de a influența agenda europeană. Acest lucru poate oferi liderilor politici un avantaj strategic în cadrul negocierilor și a proceselor de luare a deciziilor la nivel european. În concluzie, evaluările popularității sunt un instrument important pentru liderii europeni în urmărirea tendințelor politice și a percepțiilor publice, identificând problemele critice și anticipând schimbările în scena politică. Prin monitorizarea atentă a acestor evaluări și prin adaptarea strategică la evoluțiile înregistrate, liderii politici pot contribui la menținerea stabilității și progresului în cadrul Uniunii Europene."},{"question":"Question: What type of details about mimi so can be gathered from the following bio?

All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy creates an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters or rarely as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ). I am facing a new situation today: Two brothers loved geology. Bob studied sedimentary rocks while Dan studied about earthquakes and their location.

He was a Pediatric Cardiologist at UCLA back in 1971 who saved my life. I was eight years old at the time with a severe heart problem and I needed heart surgery. My Mom did not have the money, and without the surgery there was a real good chance I would not live to be thirteen years old. After contacting several organizations Dr. Vincent was able to get financial help for me through United Way, a Crippled Children's Organization. Dr. Vincent was a handsome man; he was also very gentle and caring. I remember being in the hospital for an Angiogram test, and during the procedure I was crying terribly, so the medical staff called in Dr. Vincent to calm me down, and he was able to comfort me when no one else could. Then the time came for me to have heart surgery; there was a fifty- percent chance that I would not make it through the surgery because it was experimental. At the time I was only the second or third person to have this procedure done. I was absolutely terrified, and again Dr. Vincent reassured me he would see to it that everything would be all right. I had a lot of confidence and trust in Dr. Vincent; He came to see me after the surgery, which was extremely painful but very successful, and brought me a stuffed animal. I was so surprised to get this gift from Dr. Vincent; I gave him a hug. I guess Dr. Vincent must have known I was feeling very lonely and scared. You see, I had no family or friends visit me while I was in the hospital except for my Mom, and I am not sure why. I do know one thing; I had a wonderful doctor who took the time to help a scared little girl who felt all alone. This was twenty eight years ago, so wherever you are Dr. Vincent, I want to thank you for not only saving my life, but you helped me live a normal productive life, and for showing me that you truly cared, for that I will be eternally grateful to you.

Options: - say thank - smile - looking for - get more - show appreciation Please answer and provide answer explanation.","response":"When we are thankful for getting something, we typically: 1. Say thank you: Expressing our gratitude verbally is one of the most common ways to acknowledge someone's kindness or gesture. 2.

In addition to these two options, another way to demonstrate our thankfulness is to: 3. Show appreciation: This can be done through actions, such as writing a thank-you note, giving a gesture like a hug, or returning the favor in some way. Demonstrating appreciation can strengthen relationships and encourage positive interactions in the future.

Based on that paragraph can we conclude that this sentence is true? Ottawa controls the distribution of medicare Pick your answer from: (1). Yes. (2). It's impossible to say. (3). No.","response":"(2). It's impossible to say. Based on the provided paragraph, it cannot be conclusively determined whether Ottawa controls the distribution of medicare. The paragraph states that the richest provinces have been cutting taxes and services while demanding more money for medicare from Ottawa. However, this does not explicitly clarify Ottawa's role in the control and distribution of medicare. To fully answer the question, it is important to first understand the context of medicare in Canada. In Canada, healthcare is primarily a provincial responsibility, with each province and territory managing their own healthcare system. That said, the federal government in Ottawa plays a role in funding healthcare and establishing national standards and principles through the Canada Health Act. Medicare is a term used to describe the public health insurance system in Canada, which covers medically necessary services delivered by hospitals, doctors, and other healthcare providers. The federal government, via Ottawa, provides financial support for provincial and territorial healthcare programs through the Canada Health Transfer (CHT), a system of block grants. The CHT helps ensure provinces and territories can fund healthcare services that adhere to the national principles of the Canada Health Act, such as accessibility, portability, and comprehensiveness. While it is true that Ottawa contributes financially to provincial and territorial healthcare systems, it does not directly control the distribution of medicare in each jurisdiction. Rather, each province and territory is responsible for managing and delivering its own healthcare services. As a result, the relationship can be described as a partnership between the federal and provincial or territorial governments, with Ottawa playing a supporting role through financial assistance and enforced national standards. Given this context, it is inaccurate to conclude that Ottawa solely controls the distribution of medicare based on the provided paragraph. Although the paragraph acknowledges that provinces are requesting more funding for medicare from Ottawa, it does not clarify whether or to what extent Ottawa exercises control over the distribution and management of these funds within each province or territory."},{"question":"- imagesize is 200px - death place is near paris , france - notableworks is '' the stone age '' - death date is 24 june 1950 - genre is fiction - birth date is 3 october 1873 - image is shmelyov ivan.jpg - birth place is moscow , russia Given the details above, guess who could this information be about.

But I can use this background: When soil is flooded, hypoxia develops, as soil microorganisms consume oxygen faster than diffusion occurs. The presence of hypoxic soils is one of the defining characteristics of wetlands. Many wetland plants possess aerenchyma, and in some, such as water-lilies, there is mass flow of atmospheric air through leaves and rhizomes. There are many other chemical consequences of hypoxia. For example, nitrification is inhibited as low oxygen occurs and toxic compounds are formed, as anaerobic bacteria use nitrate, manganese, and sulfate as alternative electron acceptors. The reduction-oxidation potential of the rhizhosphere decreases and metal ions such as iron and manganese precipitate. Aerenchyma is a modification of the parenchyma. What is an answer for this question: Would Mojave Desert be less or more prone to hypoxia than Mississippi Delta? Answer:","response":"Step 1: Understand the context of the two geographical areas mentioned - the Mississippi Delta and the Mojave Desert. Step 2: Recall the background information provided: hypoxia develops in flooded soils as microorganisms consume oxygen faster than it can be replaced. Wetlands like the Mississippi Delta tend to have hypoxic conditions. Step 3: Consider the Mojave Desert's characteristics - it receives very little precipitation and is not prone to flooding. Step 4: Compare the two geographical areas: the Mississippi Delta is a wetland with a higher likelihood of flooding, while the Mojave Desert has little precipitation and is not prone to flooding. Step 5: Analyze the susceptibility of hypoxia in both areas: Based on the information provided, the Mojave Desert would be less prone to hypoxia than the Mississippi Delta, as it has significantly less water and reduced likelihood of soil flooding."},{"question":"Answer the following question.

Refused is composed of vocalist Dennis Lyxzen, guitarist Kristofer Steen, drummer David Sandstrom, and bassist Magnus Flagge. Guitarist Jon Brannstrom was a member from 1994, through reunions, until he was fired in late-2014. Their lyrics are often of a non-conformist and politically far-left nature. Refused started as a \\"fresh-faced positive hardcore band\\" and their music became increasingly progressive and radical, as did their lyrics. The record This Just Might Be the Truth was characterized for its \\"massive hardcore sound\\", mostly influenced by various bands from the New York hardcore scene (such as Earth Crisis). On its follow-up, Songs to Fan the Flames of Discontent, the band had a heavier, more intricate style, which is generally attributed to their Slayer inspiration, and Lyxzen adopted screaming vocals rather than shouting. With the third album, The Shape of Punk to Come, \\"came the leap into the unknown\\" as the band mixed their previous style with unorthodox chord progressions, sampling, \\"ambient textures, jazz breakdowns\\", electronica and monologues, and other deviations from the hardcore punk music. Refused's lyrics soon began to focus on far-left politics, drawing on anarchism, socialism, among others ideologies. By the time of their first album, the band already had a strong anti-establishment profile. The group's members were all vegan straight edge until their last show in 1998 and a couple of their songs dealt with these topics. Today, some of them no longer follow these lifestyles. In their live performances, vocalist Lyxzen usually delivers political speeches between songs. Before the Umea hardcore phenomenon went into full bloom, the band was seen as part of the scene centered around youth-oriented venue Galaxen, along with the punk-rock scene as well as metal bands such as Meshuggah. Among the biggest influences of Refused were ManLiftingBanner, Born Against, Slayer, and Ian Svenonius's projects (The Make-Up, The Nation of Ulysses and Cupid Car Club). Other bands that have influenced them are Fugazi, Inside Out, and Snapcase. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Was this popular?","response":"The above article does not provide a direct quote determining whether Refused was popular or not."},{"question":"Continue writing the following text.

A later tradition recorded his entry into Jerusalem: according to Josephus, Alexander was shown the Book of Daniel's prophecy, presumably chapter 8, which described a mighty Greek king who would conquer the Persian Empire. He spared Jerusalem and pushed south into Egypt. However, Alexander met with resistance at Gaza. The stronghold was heavily fortified and built on a hill, requiring a siege. When \\"his engineers pointed out to him that because of the height of the mound it would be impossible... this encouraged Alexander all the more to make the attempt\\". After three unsuccessful assaults, the stronghold fell, but not before Alexander had received a serious shoulder wound. As in Tyre, men of military age were put to the sword and the women and children were sold into slavery. Alexander advanced on Egypt in later 332 BC, where he was regarded as a liberator. He was pronounced son of the deity Amun at the Oracle of Siwa Oasis in the Libyan desert. Henceforth, Alexander often referred to Zeus-Ammon as his true father, and after his death, currency depicted him adorned with rams horn as a symbol of his divinity.

People who are nearsighted can only see things that are very close to their eyes. Many people who do a lot of close work, such as writing and reading, become nearsighted. Then they have to wear glasses in order to see distant things clearly. People who are farsighted face just the opposite problem. They can see things that are far away, but they have difficulty reading a book if they don't hold it at arm's length. If they want to do much reading, they must get glasses too. Other people do not see clearly because their eyes are not exactly the right shape. This, too, can be corrected by glasses. Some people's eyes become cloudy because of cataracts . Long ago these people often became blind. Now, however, it is possible to operate on the cataracts and remove them. When night falls, colors become fainter to the eyes and finally disappear. After your eyes have grown used to the dark, you can see better if you use the side of your eyes rather than the centers. Sometimes, after dark, you see a small thing to one side of you. It seems to disappear if you turn your head in its direction. This is because when you turn your head, you are looking at the thing too directly. Men on guard duty sometimes think they see something moving to one side of them. When they turn to look straight at it, they cannot see it anymore, and they believe they were mistaken.

It is essential to clarify the referent of the pronoun. c) \\"and he did not join the diamond\\": Similarly, the pronoun \\"he\\" is ambiguous in this sentence. It is unclear who did not join the diamond. \\"i.e., who the \\"the diamond\\" refers to. 2. \\"Diamond and Batts lost the match after Sabin pinned Batts, and he did not join the Diamonds.\\" In this sentence: a) \\"Diamond and Batts lost the match\\": Similar to the first sentence, this part tells us that Diamond and Batts were defeated in a match. b) \\"after Sabin pinned Batts\\": This part is clearer than the first sentence because it specifies that Sabin was the one who pinned Batts. c) \\"and he did not join the Diamonds\\": While still a bit ambiguous, it is more evident that \\"he\\" refers to Batts here since he was the last person mentioned before the pronoun. This part tells us that Batts did not join the Diamonds. Comparison: Both sentences convey the idea that Diamond and Batts lost the match. However, the second sentence is clearer regarding the action taken (Sabin pinned Batts) and the person who did not join the Diamonds (Batts). So, while the sentences have a similar meaning, they do not exactly mean the same due to the ambiguity present in the first sentence. The second sentence is clearer and easier to understand."},{"question":"Question: Information: - Pong is one of the earliest arcade video games and the very first sports arcade video game. It is a table tennis sports game featuring simple two-dimensional graphics. While other arcade video games such as \\"Computer Space\\" came before it, \\"Pong\\" was one of the first video games to reach mainstream popularity. The aim is to defeat an opponent in a simulated table-tennis game by earning a higher score. The game was originally manufactured by Atari, which released it in 1972. Allan Alcorn created \\"Pong\\" as a training exercise assigned to him by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell. Bushnell based the idea on an electronic ping-pong game included in the Magnavox Odyssey, which later resulted in a lawsuit against Atari. Surprised by the quality of Alcorn's work, Bushnell and Atari co-founder Ted Dabney decided to manufacture the game. - Atari, SA (ASA) is an international French holding company headquartered in Paris, France. It was originally called Infogrames Entertainment, SA (IESA). Its subsidiaries include Atari London Studio, Atari Interactive and Atari, Inc.. Because of continuing pressures upon the company, and difficulty finding investors, it sought bankruptcy protection under French law in January 2013; its subsidiaries in the United States have sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection there as well. All three subsidiaries have since exited bankruptcy, and are all going through a vigorous turnaround campaign. - Home computers were a class of microcomputers entering the market in 1977, and becoming common during the 1980s. They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming. - Ted Dabney is the co-founder of Syzygy and Atari. While working at Ampex Dabney met Nolan Bushnell and the two jointly created Syzygy with their first product being \\"Computer Space\\", which was manufactured and sold by Nutting Associates. Following Computer Space, Ted Dabney's video circuit that was created for Computer Space was used by Al Alcorn to create \\"Pong\\", with assistance from Dabney and Bushnell. Dabney remained out of the public eye after departing Atari and his role in creating the first commercially produced coin-op video game as well as Syzygy and Atari was often omitted or marginalized with several myths attached. Dabney appeared on the RetroGaming Roundup podcast in October 2010 and told his story in a two-hour interview. - IMAGE (from Imager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration), or Explorer 78, was a NASA MIDEX mission that studied the global response of the Earth's magnetosphere to changes in the solar wind.

Released on September 11, 1977, it is credited with popularizing the use of microprocessor-based hardware and ROM cartridges containing game code, a format first used with the Fairchild Channel F video game console in 1976. This format contrasts with the older model of having non-microprocessor dedicated hardware, which could only play the games that were physically built into the unit. - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images.

These acids then mix with water droplets in the air and fall to the ground as acid rain, making waters in lakes, streams, and other bodies of water more acidic. Step 2: Waters absorb aluminum from soil Justification: Acidic waters cause the soil to release aluminum that is naturally bound within it. Acidification of the soil increases the solubility of aluminum, causing more aluminum ions to be released and absorbed by nearby waters. Step 3: The acidic and aluminum-filled water runs off from the soil into lakes, streams, etc. Justification: As the water moves through the soil and across land surfaces, it carries with it the dissolved aluminum from the soil. The aluminum-laden water eventually makes its way into lakes, streams, and other aquatic ecosystems. Step 4: Fish and their eggs die Justification: The aluminum and acidity in water can be toxic to fish and their eggs. High levels of aluminum can interfere with fish gill function, leading to decreased oxygen intake and ultimately death. Additionally, acidity can harm fish eggs, reducing their ability to hatch and develop properly. Step 5: Frogs and plants die Justification: Many amphibians, like frogs, are highly sensitive to acidic water, as their skin is permeable and can absorb toxins from their environment. Consequently, they can die from the toxic effects of aluminum and acidity in their habitat. Likewise, aquatic plants can also suffer as acidification can lead to declines in water quality and nutrient availability, potentially causing their death. Step 6: Insects and other wildlife die Justification: The death of fish, frogs, and plants will have cascading effects on the rest of the ecosystem. Insects and other wildlife, such as birds and mammals, that depend on fish, frogs, and plants as sources of food and habitat will also be negatively affected, resulting in their decline or death due to the lack of available resources. Final step (Step 7): The ecosystem becomes imbalanced and destabilized Justification: The loss of biodiversity from fish, frogs, plants, insects, and other wildlife dying leads to an imbalance within the ecosystem. This can cause a chain reaction of further species loss, affecting the structure and stability of the ecosystem over time."},{"question":"Jon Garth Murray (November 16, 1954 – September 29, 1995) was the second son of late controversial activist Madalyn Murray O'Hair, the first president and founder of American Atheists, Inc., in 1963.

Where can you see a cannon and learn about the past? Options: - war - fort - pirate ship - warship - war museum","response":"To see a cannon and learn about the past, the most suitable options among the ones provided are: 1. Fort 2. Warship 3. War Museum Let's break down each option step by step: 1. Fort: Reasoning: Forts have been historically used as military strongholds or defensive structures. They often contain cannons and other weapons for protection against enemy attacks. These locations also provide historical context and information about the period they were built and the battles fought in their vicinity. 2. Warship: Reasoning: Warships, like naval vessels or ships of the line, have a history of being equipped with cannons. These ships played a crucial role in naval warfare and can also provide historical information about the wars they participated in, the technology used, and the life of sailors onboard. Note, however, that seeing an original warship with cannons intact might be less common compared to visiting a fort or a war museum. 3. War Museum: Reasoning: War Museums are dedicated to preserving and showcasing artifacts and information about wars, military history, and technology. This includes cannons, firearms, military vehicles, and equipment. A war museum presents a wide range of historical context about various periods, wars, and battles, making it a comprehensive place to see a cannon and learn about the past. In conclusion, while all options relate to cannons and history to some extent, the most suitable places to see a cannon and learn about the past are forts, warships, and war museums. These locations provide the necessary context, artifacts, and historical information needed to understand the history and role of cannons in warfare."},{"question":"Add spaces: ineachapartment,theyinviteyoutorelaxandunwind.","response":"In each apartment, they invite you to relax and unwind.

Once upon a time, during a huge clash called the Fourth Ottoman-Venetian War, which was like a really big, long-lasting argument between team Ottoman and team Venetian, the team leader or, you might say, the 'captain' of the Ottoman Empire was a sultan. Sultan is like a king. So, the Sultan's name was Mehmed the Conqueror. Can you imagine him? He had a big, important job because he had to make all the decisions for his team during that fourth big spat with the Venetians. It's a little like when you play captains in a playground game; the captain decides the best way for his team to win. Sultan Mehmed took the throne, which is like becoming a captain when he was super young, just like you. Because of his leadership, the Ottoman Empire became stronger. He was a big deal in his time and is remembered even today. And that's who led the Ottoman Empire in the Fourth Ottoman-Venetian War. Cool, huh? Now you know a little bit about history. The story of Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror shows that even if you're young, you can do great things if you have courage and use your smarts."},{"question":"Question: what makes a dwarf planet? Would \\"Pluto in approximate true colour based on Hubble Space Telescope albedo data\\" be a reasonable answer? Available options: 1). No 2). Yes Answer:","response":"1). No A dwarf planet is defined by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) as a celestial body that meets the following criteria: 1. It orbits the Sun or another star (not another planet). 2. It has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces and achieve a hydrostatic equilibrium shape (i.e., it is nearly spherical in shape). 3. It has not cleared its orbit of other debris (unlike planets, which have cleared their orbits of other debris). 4. It is not a satellite (or moon) of another celestial body. As for the phrase \\"Pluto in approximate true color based on Hubble Space Telescope albedo data,\\" it does not explain what makes a dwarf planet. Instead, this statement refers to an image or representation of Pluto showing its approximate true colors based on the reflectivity (albedo) data obtained from the Hubble Space Telescope. Albedo refers to the proportion of sunlight that reflects off a celestial object, giving an indication of the object's composition and surface properties. However, this information does not provide a definition or explanation about the features of a dwarf planet."},{"question":"Born in Scotland on 15 June 1792, he was son of John Mitchell of Carron Works and was brought up from childhood by his uncle, Thomas Livingstone of Parkhall, Stirlingshire. On the death of his uncle, he joined the British army in Portugal as a volunteer, at the age of sixteen. On 24 June 1811, at the age of nineteen, he received his first commission as 2nd Lieutenant in the 1st Battalion 95th Rifles (later the Rifle Brigade / Royal Green Jackets). Utilising his skills as a draughtsman of outstanding ability, he was occasionally employed in the Quartermaster-General's department under Sir George Murray. Mitchell's fourth expedition was into Queensland in 1845-46. He was convinced that a significant river must flow north-west into the Gulf of Carpentaria, this being the main thrust of the endeavour. On 15 December 1845 Mitchell started from Boree (Buree in Mitchell's journal) with a large party including Edmund Kennedy as second in command (later speared to death at Escape River near Cape York). He struck the Darling River above Fort Bourke then continued to the Narran River, the Balonne, and the Culgoa. On 12 April 1846 he came to a natural bridge of rocks on the main branch of the Balonne which he called St.George Bridge, now the site of the town of St George. Kennedy was left in charge of the main body here, and was instructed to follow on slowly while Mitchell pushed ahead with a few men. Mitchell followed the Balonne to the Maranoa, and the Cogoon (now called Muckadilla Creek, near Roma). This rivulet led him to a magnificent pastoral district in the midst of which stood a solitary hill that he named Mount Abundance. He then crossed a low watershed to the Maranoa and awaited Kennedy's arrival. Kennedy rejoined Mitchell on 1 June 1846. Leaving Kennedy for a second time, he set out on an extensive excursion of more than four months. Mitchell traversed the country at the head of the Maranoa and discovered the Warrago River. Keeping north over the watershed, he traversed the Claude and Nogoa rivers, then reached the Belyando River, an upper reach of the Burdekin River. This had already been discovered by Ludwig Leichhardt on his expedition to Port Essington on 2 April 1845. Intensely mortified to find that he was on a tributary of the Burdekin River, and approaching the ground already trodden by Leichhardt, he returned to the head of the Nogoa and struck west, after dividing his party and forming a stationary camp. He continued west, making a new discovery which he was certain was the fabled north-west river. In honour of the sovereign of the time he decided to call it Victoria River. Having run out of time, he turned back towards the main party. It was here that Mitchell first noticed the well known grass that bears his name. On the homeward journey he trekked along the Maranoa River to St.George Bridge, arriving in Sydney 20 January 1847. Later that year, Kennedy proved beyond doubt that the Victoria did not continue north-west, but turned south-west and joined Cooper Creek. He renamed the watercourse the Barcoo River from a name mentioned by local Aborigines. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Which other people were there with him?","response":"In the given article, it is mentioned that Mitchell was accompanied by \\"a large party including Edmund Kennedy as second in command (later speared to death at Escape River near Cape York).\\" Apart from Kennedy, specific names of other people accompanying him are not provided in the text."},{"question":"Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: What year was the last feature film appearance of the actress who played Athena in Battlestar Galactica?","response":"To find the answer to this elaborate question, we need to determine the name of the actress who played Athena in Battlestar Galactica, and then identify her last feature film appearance.

The king was traditionally elected by the highest-ranking aristocrats, the dukes, as several attempts to establish a hereditary dynasty failed. The kingdom was subdivided into a varying number of duchies, ruled by semi-autonomous dukes, which were in turn subdivided into gastaldates at the municipal level. The capital of the kingdom and the center of its political life was Pavia in the modern northern Italian region of Lombardy. - The Lombards or Longobards (Italian \\"Longobardi\\" ) were a Germanic people who ruled large parts of the Italian Peninsula from 568 to 774. - Northern Italy is a cultural and geographical region, without any administrative purpose, used to indicate the northern part of the Italian state, also informally referred as \\"Il Nord\\", \\"Settentrione\\" or \\"Alta Italia\\". It consists of 8 regions in northern Italy: Aosta Valley, Piedmont, Liguria, Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol. According to the 2011 census, its population was 27,213,372. For statistic purposes, the Istituto Nazionale di Statistica (ISTAT) uses the term Northwest Italy and Northeast Italy for identifying two of the five statistical regions in its reporting. These same subdivisions are used to demarcate first level Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) regions (\\"NUTS 1 regions\\") within the European Union, and the Italian constituencies for the European Parliament. - In historiography, the Western Roman Empire consists of the western provinces of the Roman Empire at any one time during which they were administered by a separate independent Imperial court, coequal with (or only nominally subordinate to) that administering the eastern half. Both \\"Western Roman Empire\\" and \\"Eastern Roman Empire\\" (or \\"Byzantine Empire\\") are modern terms describing \\"de facto\\" independent entities; however, at no point did Romans consider the Empire split into two, but rather considered it a single state governed by two separate Imperial courts out of administrative expediency. The view that the Empire was impossible to govern by one emperor was established by Diocletian following the disastrous civil wars and disintegration of the Crisis of the 3rd century, and was instituted in Roman law by his introduction of the Tetrarchy in AD 285, a form of government which was legally to endure in one form or another for centuries. The Western Court was periodically abolished and recreated for the next two centuries until final abolition by the Emperor Zeno in 480, by which time there was little effective central control left in the area legally administered by the Western Court. - In the Byzantine Empire, an exarch (\\"exarchos\\") was a governor with extended authority over a province at some distance from the capital Constantinople. The prevailing situation frequently involved him in military operations. - Eutychius was the last Exarch of Ravenna ( circa 727 -- 751 ) . The Exarchate of Ravenna had risen in revolt in 727 at the imposition of iconoclasm ; the Exarch Paul lost his life attempting to quash the revolt . In response , Emperor Leo III the Isaurian ( r. 717 -- 741 ) sent the eunuch patrician Eutychius to take control of the situation . In certain historical works , Eutychius is mentioned as having served as exarch already in 710/11 -- 713 , between the tenures of John III Rizocopus and Scholasticus . This is however a modern interpolation based on an erroneous reading of the Liber pontificalis . Eutychius landed in Naples , where he called upon loyal citizens to assassinate Pope Gregory II. When the citizens responded by pledging to defend the Pope and to die in his defense , Eutychius turned his attention to the Lombards , offering King Liutprand and the Lombard dukes bribes if they would abandon Pope Gregory . Despite all of this , according to Jeffrey Richards , Pope Gregory persisted in his efforts to preserve imperial rule in Italy . Eutychius 's efforts eventually gained results : King Liutprand came to an agreement with the Exarch , and agreed to support him in return for assistance in subjecting the duchies of Benevento and Spoleto . Pope Gregory , however , met with Liutprand , and convinced him to abandon the effort , then with Liutprand 's help effected a reconciliation with Eutychius . When one Tiberius Petasius proclaimed himself emperor in Tuscia and Eutychius found himself critically short of manpower , Pope Gregory ordered the Roman army to help him put down the rebellion , and Petasius was killed . Conflict with the Lombards resulted in disaster in 737 , when the exarchate 's capital , Ravenna , was seized by Liutprand . Further warfare erupted in 739 . Pope Gregory III had supported the dukes of Benevento and Spoleto against Liutprand , causing the latter to invade central Italy . The exarchate , as well as the Duchy of Rome , was ravaged and Ravenna fell to the Lombards ; Eutychius... - Emilia-Romagna (, Romagnol: \\"Emélia-Rumâgna\\") is an administrative Region of Northeast Italy, comprising the historical regions of Emilia and Romagna. Its capital is Bologna. It has an area of , and about 4.4 million inhabitants. - Romagna (Romagnol: \\"Rumâgna\\") is an Italian historical region that approximately corresponds to the south-eastern portion of present-day Emilia-Romagna. Traditionally, it is limited by the Apennines to the south-west, the Adriatic to the east, and the rivers Reno and Sillaro to the north and west. The region's major cities include Cesena, Faenza, Forlì, Imola, Ravenna, Rimini and City of San Marino (San Marino is a landlocked state inside the Romagna historical region). The region has been recently formally expanded with the transfer of seven comuni (Casteldelci, Maiolo, Novafeltria, Pennabilli, San Leo, Sant'Agata Feltria, Talamello) from the Marche region, which are a small number of comuni where Romagnolo dialect is spoken. Etymology. The name \\"Romagna\\" comes from the Latin name \\"Romània\\", which originally was the generic name for \\"land inhabited by Romans\\", and first appeared on Latin documents in the 5th century. It later took on the more detailed meaning of \\"territory subjected to Eastern Roman rule\\", whose citizens called themselves Romans (\\"Romani\\" in Latin; \\"Romàioi\\" in Greek). Thus the term \\"Romània\\" came to be used to refer to the territory administered by the Exarchate of Ravenna in contrast to other parts of Northern Italy under Lombard rule, named \\"Langobardia\\" or \\"Lombardy\\". \\"Romània\\" later became \\"Romandìola\\" in Vulgar Latin, meaning \\"little Romània\\", which became \\"Romagna\\" in modern times. History. Prehistory. A number of archaeological sites in the region, such as Monte Poggiolo, show that Romagna has been inhabited since the Paleolithic age. - Ravenna (also locally ) is the capital city of the Province of Ravenna, in the Emilia-Romagna region of Northern Italy. It was the capital city of the Western Roman Empire from 402 until that empire collapsed in 476. It then served as the capital of the Kingdom of the Ostrogoths until it was re-conquered in 540 by the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire. Afterwards, the city formed the centre of the Byzantine Exarchate of Ravenna until the invasion of the Lombards in 751, after which it became the seat of the Kingdom of the Lombards. - The Exarchate of Ravenna or of Italy was a center of Byzantine (East Roman) power in Italy, from 584 to 751, when the last exarch was put to death by the Lombards. - The province of Ravenna is a province in the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy. Its capital is the city of Ravenna. As of 2015, it has a population of 391,997 inhabitants over an area of , giving it a population density of 210.81 inhabitants per square kilometre.

This suggests that the standard for being considered gifted has possibly been lowered, making it easier for more students to reach that designation. On the other hand, the second sentence postulates that the school system has become tougher, causing even smart kids to struggle and fall behind. This implies that the educational standards and expectations have increased. These two sentences represent contrasting ideas: one proposes that the educational system is becoming easier, while the other suggests it is becoming more demanding.

(CNN) -- Germany's greatest golfer tried time and time again to conquer the U.S. Open, and failed. But where Bernhard Langer fell short, Martin Kaymer succeeded, becoming the first German to ever get his hands on the feted trophy. Kaymer has already made it to world number one, bagged his first major at the U.S. PGA Championship and sunk the winning putt in a Ryder Cup before he is 30. Langer did win the Masters twice in his illustrious career but now his successor has two of the four major titles in his back pocket after an emphatic win at Pinehurst.","response":"As the sun set on the final day of the U.S. Open, the crowd eagerly anticipated a nail-biting finish. However, Martin Kaymer refused to let the pressure get to him. With his eyes set firmly on the prize, he stayed focused and maintained a steady pace throughout the course. With each swing, Kaymer's determination seemed to grow stronger, echoing the spirit of his predecessor, Bernhard Langer. When the final putt was sunk, the crowd erupted in cheers and applause, as tears of joy streamed down Martin Kaymer's face. He had accomplished what no other German golfer had done before, sealing his place in history as the first German to ever win the U.S. Open. As he hoisted the trophy above his head, he couldn't help but feel gratitude toward Langer, who had laid the foundation for German golfers and paved the way for his own success. In the days that followed, Kaymer received high praise from media and fans alike, celebrating his incredible achievement. His hard work, perseverance, and natural talent had paid off, and he had become not only an inspiration to aspiring golfers but also a symbol of national pride for Germany. Though Bernhard Langer never won the U.S. Open, he could take solace in knowing that his legacy lived on through the extraordinary accomplishments of Martin Kaymer. As the two champions stood side by side, their combined efforts served as a testament to the progress of German golf and the bright future that lay ahead."},{"question":"Premise: \\"uh-huh do you normally receive the calls or is it pretty much split\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"I would like to know who to expect to answer when I call.\\"?","response":"If we consider the premise \\"uh-huh do you normally receive the calls or is it pretty much split,\\" we can infer that the person is asking the interlocutor about the distribution of call-answering responsibilities, possibly between two or more individuals. They may be inquiring whether one person typically answers calls or if the responsibility is shared among multiple people. The premise does not explicitly state any information that pertains to the speaker's preferences or expectations, but it appears to seek clarification on call-answering patterns within a specific context. Now, let's analyze the hypothesis \\"I would like to know who to expect to answer when I call.\\" This statement suggests that the speaker has a desire to understand who they should anticipate speaking with when making a call. The hypothesis has a direct connection with the premise, as they both convey an interest in gathering information about call-answering patterns. However, it is important to note that the hypothesis is more specific and centers around the speaker seeking to develop a clear expectation concerning who answers calls. In contrast, the premise seems to focus primarily on understanding whether one person usually receives calls or if the responsibility is more evenly divided among other parties. To sum up, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis reveals that although both statements focus on understanding call-answering patterns, the premise mainly revolves around revealing if there's a dominant party responsible for answering calls or if the responsibility is shared. On the other hand, the hypothesis concerns the speaker's desire to know who they should expect to answer the call when they make one. While the premise does not directly entail the hypothesis, it does lay the foundation for the development of such expectations. The information obtained through the premise may lead to the speaker having clearer expectations that align with the hypothesis. In other words, by understanding whether one person generally handles calls or if the responsibility is split, the speaker may be able to develop an idea of who to expect when making a call."},{"question":"Alexander married twice: Roxana, daughter of the Bactrian nobleman Oxyartes, out of love; and Stateira II, a Persian princess and daughter of Darius III of Persia, for political reasons. He apparently had two sons, Alexander IV of Macedon of Roxana and, possibly, Heracles of Macedon from his mistress Barsine. He lost another child when Roxana miscarried at Babylon. Alexander also had a close relationship with his friend, general, and bodyguard Hephaestion, the son of a Macedonian noble. Hephaestion's death devastated Alexander. This event may have contributed to Alexander's failing health and detached mental state during his final months. Alexander's sexuality has been the subject of speculation and controversy. No ancient sources stated that Alexander had homosexual relationships, or that Alexander's relationship with Hephaestion was sexual. Aelian, however, writes of Alexander's visit to Troy where \\"Alexander garlanded the tomb of Achilles and Hephaestion that of Patroclus, the latter riddling that he was a beloved of Alexander, in just the same way as Patroclus was of Achilles\\". Noting that the word eromenos (ancient Greek for beloved) does not necessarily bear sexual meaning, Alexander may have been bisexual, which in his time was not controversial. Green argues that there is little evidence in ancient sources that Alexander had much carnal interest in women; he did not produce an heir until the very end of his life. However, he was relatively young when he died, and Ogden suggests that Alexander's matrimonial record is more impressive than his father's at the same age. Apart from wives, Alexander had many more female companions. Alexander accumulated a harem in the style of Persian kings, but he used it rather sparingly; showing great self-control in \\"pleasures of the body\\". Nevertheless, Plutarch described how Alexander was infatuated by Roxana while complimenting him on not forcing himself on her. Green suggested that, in the context of the period, Alexander formed quite strong friendships with women, including Ada of Caria, who adopted him, and even Darius's mother Sisygambis, who supposedly died from grief upon hearing of Alexander's death. Question: \\"How many kids of Alexander's did Roxana carry?\\" Answer: \\"Two - a son and one that she lost\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","response":"I'll explain it in a simpler way: Alexander was married to two ladies, Roxana and Stateira. Roxana had one child with Alexander, a baby boy named Alexander IV. She also had another baby, but sadly, the baby didn't make it.

Goal: Store extra sponges. Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal? Pick your answer from: + Keep fresh in empty baby wipe container.. + Keep fresh in empty napkin container.....I think the answer is","response":"Both of the given methods for storing extra sponges have their own advantages and can be considered reasonable depending on your specific needs and space availability. Below, I will examine each method in more detail to help you determine which option is more suitable for you. 1. Keep fresh in empty baby wipe container: An empty baby wipe container has an airtight seal, which makes it a good option for storing sponges. The container can protect the sponges from dust, moisture, and even bugs. Additionally, most baby wipe containers have an easy-to-open lid, making it simple to grab a sponge whenever needed. Pros: - Airtight seal keeps sponges fresh - Protects sponges from dust, moisture, and insects - Easy access to sponges through the lid - Can be repurposed, reducing waste Cons: - May have limited storage depending on the size of the container and sponges - Baby wipe containers can vary in design, making it less universal or consistent in how they store sponges 2. Keep fresh in empty napkin container: An empty napkin container can also be used for storing extra sponges. While these containers might not be as airtight and sealed as baby wipe containers, they can provide a convenient and organized method of storage. Napkin containers often have wider dimensions and can accommodate a larger number of sponges. Pros: - Can store a larger number of sponges - Convenient and organized storage - Repurpose an otherwise unused container, reducing waste Cons: - Less airtight compared to baby wipe containers, which can make it more prone to dust, moisture, or insects getting in - Access to sponges might be less convenient than in a baby wipe container In conclusion, if maintaining freshness and protection against external factors are your top priorities, the baby wipe container method might be the most reasonable for you. However, if you are looking to store a larger number of sponges and prefer an organized method, using an empty napkin container might be the better option. Ultimately, it depends on the specific requirements you have for storing your extra sponges."},{"question":"Read this: From 9 February for two days his coffin rested in St. Mary Magdalene Church, Sandringham, before lying in state at Westminster Hall from 11 February.

At that point, she wastes no time packing up her stuff into her pick up truck and moving herself and the kids out of there never to return. They move to her parents home in northern Minnesota.

Neither parent has a clue or any respect for her.Josey works temporarily washing hair in a local salon when she runs into an old acquaintance, Glory (Frances McDormand), who informs her that there are some good paying jobs available to women at the iron mines.

In einer Welt, die zunehmend globalisiert und vernetzt ist, ist es von großer Bedeutung, dass alle betroffenen Nationen gleichermaßen am Entscheidungsprozess beteiligt sind. Die Zusammenarbeit zwischen verschiedenen Ländern und Organisationen könnte dazu beitragen, ein umfassenderes und effektiveres Abkommen zu erreichen, das die unterschiedlichen Perspektiven und Herausforderungen berücksichtigt, die mit der globalen Sicherheit und Zusammenarbeit verbunden sind. Es ist wichtig, dass diese Abkommen nicht nur die Interessen der Großmächte, sondern auch die Bedürfnisse und Sicherheitsanliegen kleinerer und schwächerer Nationen berücksichtigen. In vielen Fällen haben multilaterale Abkommen, an denen mehrere Länder beteiligt sind, eine größere Legitimität und Stabilität als bilaterale Abkommen zwischen zwei Ländern. Dies liegt daran, dass sie auf einer breiteren Basis von Zustimmung und Kompromiss beruhen und weniger anfällig für politische Schwankungen und Veränderungen in den jeweiligen Ländern sind. Darüber hinaus ist es auch wichtig, dass internationale Organisationen wie die Vereinten Nationen, die Europäische Union und andere regionale Organisationen in den Verhandlungs- und Entscheidungsprozess einbezogen werden. Diese Organisationen verfügen oft über Expertise und Ressourcen, die dazu beitragen können, bessere und nachhaltigere Lösungen für globale Herausforderungen zu finden.

On a 4th down and 1, however, they were stopped and turned the ball over on downs. At their own 41-yard line, Buccaneers quarterback Jeff Garcia threw an apparent completion, but was intercepted by Jonathan Vilma. The turnover led to a Saints field goal. Midway through the first quarter, heavy rain began to fall. Tampa Bay took their next possession to the New Orleans 21, and tied the score at 3-3. Late in the second quarter, Clifton Smith returned a New Orleans punt 42 yards to the 39-yard line. The good field position led to a second Matt Bryant field goal. Brees took over with just over two minutes left in the half. He quickly led the Saints on a six-play touchdown drive, and took a 10-6 lead into halftime. Tampa Bay's opening drive of the third quarter was capped off by an 8-yard touchdown run by Carnell \\"Cadillac\\" Williams, his first touchdown since returning to play a week earlier. New Orleans went three-and-out on their next drive, while Tampa Bay stretched their lead moments later with a 39-yard touchdown pass to Antonio Bryant. Looking to answer, Brees was intercepted in the endzone by Cato June. Early in the fourth quarter, Brees again drove deep into Tampa Bay territory. An apparent interception in the endzone was negated by a penalty, and the drive continued. With new life, Brees connected to Pierre Thomas, and trimmed the deficit to 20-17. After Tampa Bay was held to two three-and-outs, Josh Bidwell shanked a punt, setting New Orleans up at the Tampa Bay 49-yard line.

Doku Umarov, 49, the Chechen warlord with the blackest of reputations, is assumed to be the mastermind behind a bombing campaign intended to disrupt Vladimir Putin's cherished dream of a successful Winter Olympics in Sochi. ||||| The seed for this crawl was a list of every host in the Wayback Machine This crawl was run at a level 1 (URLs including their embeds, plus the URLs of all outbound links including their embeds) The WARC files associated with this crawl are not currently available to the general public. ||||| Two suicide bombings in a Russian city are stoking fear about the Sochi Winter Olympics. The most likely mastermind is a Chechen field commander who wants to humiliate Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin. Why the new health-care bill may keep affordable care out of reach for some This undated frame grab image made available by IntelCenter and taken from a video posted on a pro-rebel website Wednesday, purports to show Chechen warlord Doku Umarov. In the video Umarov claims responsibility for the Moscow metro bombings that killed 40 people in March 2010. In July, a video went up on a Russian-language website known as a forum for commentary and propaganda by militant Islamist groups in Russia’s troubled North Caucasus. In it, a Chechen man named Doku Umarov gave an unequivocal warning about the upcoming Winter Olympics in Sochi, in whose success the Kremlin has invested tens of billions of dollars. \\"Today we must show those who live in the Kremlin … that our kindness is not weakness,\\" said Mr. Umarov, dressed in camouflage and wearing his trademark bushy beard. \\"They plan to hold the Olympics on the bones of our ancestors, on the bones of many, many dead Muslims buried on our land by the Black Sea. We as mujahadeen are required not to allow that, using any methods that Allah allows us.\\" On Sunday and Monday two suicide bombers detonated their explosives at different sites in Volgograd, a city, like Sochi, located just a few hundred miles from the Caucasus. Neither Umarov nor anyone else has claimed responsibility yet for the bombings, which killed at least 32 people and wounded dozens more. What’s certain, however, is that just weeks before the Olympic opening ceremonies, the attacks are bringing new tremors to a country that has struggled to quash a 20-year terrorist insurgency. For analysts who have studied terrorist tactics, in Russia and elsewhere, it seems likely that Umarov had a hand in the attacks. Successful suicide bombings are difficult to plan, organize, and execute. And there aren’t that many groups with that ability in the North Caucasus, says Mia Bloom, a professor who has written several books examining female suicide bombers in Russia and other places. (Early reports from Russia claimed that the attacker on Sunday was a woman.) “Doku Umarov is one of those guys who follows through. He specifically mentions getting Russians, to humiliate Putin, particularly because of Sochi,” says Ms. Bloom who teaches at the Center for Terrorism and Security Studies at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell. “It follows a pattern (for Umarov): the use of women, the use of simultaneous attacks, the use of hitting transportation infrastructure, the repetition of it, these are all the leitmotifs of his work,” she says. John Horgan, who directs the UMass terrorism center, says the absence of Umarov taking responsibility may in fact indicate there are more bombers waiting to attack. Umarov is latest iteration of the Chechen insurgent legacy. A veteran of the two wars and the stubborn violence that has ravaged Chechnya and the entire North Caucasus since the Soviet collapse, Umarov rose to prominence in the 2000s alongside notorious terrorist leaders such as Shamil Basayev, a fellow Chechen, but also radicalized jihadis from places like Jordan or Saudi Arabia with names like al-Khattab, Abu Hafs, and Abu Walid. The presence of these foreign fighters helped turn the Chechen fight from a secular, ethnic-based independence cause towards a pan-Islamist, cross-border movement that spilled into other parts of the Caucasus In 2007, after Russian forces killed a series of top commanders including Basayev and gained the upper hand in Chechnya, the insurgency began to fracture. Umarov declared himself “emir of the Caucasus Emirate,” an umbrella of rebel groups through the North Caucasus. Umarov used suicide bombers – which Basayev had helped introduce to Russia earlier that decade – in incidents like the 2002 Moscow theater siege, and the 2004 seizure of a school in Beslan. Moscow bombings Between 2009 and 2011, there were a series of spectacular attacks in Moscow, and a slew of other bombings around the North Caucasus, including the 2009 bombing of the high-speed train to St. Petersburg; the 2010 suicide bombing of two Moscow subways stations; and the 2011 suicide bombing at Moscow’s Domodedovo airport. All were claimed by Umarov. By 2011, the Caucasus Emirate was officially designated a terrorist group by the US State Department, and a 5 million reward was announced for information leading to Umarov's capture. Since the second Chechen War erupted in 2000, Kremlin’s tactics in the North Caucasus have turned to using local allies to take the lead in fighting insurgents like Basayev and Umarov. That, along with millions of dollars in investments and infrastructure building, has helped bring a semblance of calm to Chechnya. Other regions, however, continue to fester – such as Dagestan, a republic east of Chechnya that is a mosaic of ethnic groups who live uneasily side by side. Dagestan was the region that Tamerlan Tsarnaev visited in the months before planning the Boston Marathon bombing in April. It was also reportedly home of the female suicide bomber whose attack on a Volgograd bus in October killed six people. Umarov’s activities were relatively minimal in months leading up to the July video, which has led to speculation that he was consolidating his authority among Caucasus groups and laying the groundwork for new attacks connected to Sochi. The Sochi Olympics, which open Feb. 7, are the most expensive games ever, with the Kremlin estimated to have spent close to 60 billion to prepare the Black Sea city and the surrounding mountainous countryside to host thousands of athletes, tourists, and dignitaries. Sochi is about the same distance from Chechnya as New York is from Washington, though the formidable Caucasus Mountains prevent driving directly. By most accounts, President Vladimir Putin has staked his personal prestige on Olympic success, and Russian security services have spent years preparing to ensure the games are not disrupted. That may be the main reason why terrorists have targeted other cities like Volgograd, which is a major transportation hub for southern Russia, experts say. The Olympics also provide a ready venue for high-profile attacks to raise awareness of a group’s cause, similar to what happened with the 1972 Munich Olympics, says James Forest, former director of terrorism studies at the US Military Academy. Those games were tarnished by the killing of 11 Israeli athletes and coaches by members of a terror group wanting to draw attention to the plight of Palestinians. “It conveys to the public that even though you have all this security, this is a target; they know that they can’t protect you,” Bloom says, “so that it has a greater oomph, greater impact.” ||||| What is a summary?","response":"Chechen warlord Doku Umarov, dubbed Russia's Osama bin Laden, is suspected to be the mastermind behind a bombing campaign aimed at disrupting the Winter Olympics in Sochi. In a video posted on a Russian-language website, Umarov warned about the upcoming Olympics and called on mujahideen not to allow the event to take place. Two suicide bombings occurred in Volgograd, just a few hundred miles from the Caucasus, causing new concerns weeks before the Olympic opening ceremonies. Analysts suggest Umarov's history of following through on threats, his use of specific tactics, and stated goal to humiliate Putin, make it likely he was involved."},{"question":"Based on the information present in the given passage, you need to write a correct answer to the given question.

Clean the pumpkin with soap and water. Wipe the pumpkin dry. Spray the pumpkin with rubbing alcohol. Dry the pumpkin out over several weeks. Seal the surface of the pumpkin.\\" Article:","response":"Title: Preserving Your Perfect Pumpkin: A Step-by-Step Guide Introduction: It's that time of year again! The air is crisp, the leaves are turning, and everyone's getting ready for Halloween. One of the most important traditions during this festive season is choosing the perfect pumpkin to bring home and adorn your doorstep. However, selecting the ideal pumpkin goes beyond just finding the right size and shape - you also want it to last throughout the season without rotting or fading. In this article, we'll cover a step-by-step process to ensure your pumpkin stays fresh and vibrant from day one. Step 1: Selecting a Pumpkin with a Long Stem The first step in preserving your pumpkin starts with the selection process. Look for a pumpkin with a long stem, as this can be indicative of a healthier and fresher pumpkin. Additionally, a longer stem can help reduce moisture loss and maintain the pumpkin's overall longevity. Step 2: Cleaning the Pumpkin with Soap and Water Once you've selected your pumpkin, it's essential to give it a thorough cleaning to remove any dirt, bacteria, or fungi that could accelerate decay. Using a mild soap and warm water, gently wash the entire surface of the pumpkin, taking special care around the stem area. Step 3: Wiping the Pumpkin Dry After ensuring your pumpkin is clean, use a soft cloth or paper towel to pat the entire surface dry. Be sure to completely dry the stem area, as any remaining moisture could promote rot and shorten the pumpkin's lifespan. Step 4: Spraying the Pumpkin with Rubbing Alcohol To further protect your pumpkin from early decay, apply a coat of rubbing alcohol to the surface. The rubbing alcohol acts as an antimicrobial agent, killing any remaining bacteria or fungi and reducing the chances of your pumpkin rotting. Step 5: Drying the Pumpkin Out over Several Weeks Before sealing the surface, it's critical to allow your pumpkin to air out and reach an ideal level of dryness. Place your pumpkin in a cool, dry area away from direct sunlight, and allow it to sit for at least two weeks or until it feels lighter in weight. This process will help draw out excess moisture and slow down the decay process. Step 6: Sealing the Surface of the Pumpkin Finally, to ensure your pumpkin remains fresh and vibrant, apply a sealant to the surface of the pumpkin. You can use a commercial pumpkin sealant or create a homemade solution using a mixture of white glue and water. Apply a thin, even layer to the entire surface, ensuring the stem area is also covered. This will lock in the moisture that remains, preventing your pumpkin from drying out too much or becoming susceptible to decay. Conclusion: By following these simple steps, you'll be well on your way to preserving your perfect pumpkin throughout the Halloween season. Remember, selecting a pumpkin with a long stem and properly cleaning, drying, and sealing it will allow you and your family to enjoy the festive spirit without worrying about your pumpkin rotting away before the big night. Happy pumpkin picking!"},{"question":"The dermis is the inner layer of skin. The dermis has blood vessels and nerve endings. The nerve endings explain why your skin is sensitive. You can sense pain, pressure, and temperature. You cut your finger and it starts to bleed. What has happened? If your skin bleeds, it means you have cut the dermis layer and damaged blood vessels. The cut really hurts. It hurts because of the nerve endings in this skin layer. The dermis also contains hair follicles and two types of glands. Hair follicles are structures where hairs originate. Each hair grows out of a follicle. Hair passes up through the epidermis. It then extends above the skin surface. Oil glands produce an oily substance. The oil is secreted into hair follicles. Question: \\"Why do I bleed when I cut myself?\\" Response: \\"The dermis contains blood vessels that you damage when you cut yourself\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","response":"Yes, the response correctly answers the question. When there is an incision or cut to the skin, if it's deep enough to penetrate through the epidermis (the outer layer of skin), it gets to the dermis, the second layer of skin, which contains blood vessels. These blood vessels are damaged by the cut, and so blood leaks out of them, causing the observed bleeding. In addition, your skin is sensitive and can sense pain due to the nerve endings present in the dermis layer. Hence, any cut or damage to this part of the skin will also be painful. The process of bleeding and the subsequent clotting forms part of the body's protective mechanism to prevent further injury as well as the invasion of harmful bacteria. Furthermore, the dermis contains other structures such as hair follicles and sebaceous (oil) glands. Hair follicles are the structures from which hair grows. The hair passes through the epidermis and goes beyond the skin surface. On the other hand, oil glands secrete an oily substance into the hair follicles. This oil not only moisturizes the skin and hair but also provides a layer of protection against harmful substances and microorganisms. However, it's critical to take necessary precautions to avoid deep cuts and, in case they happen, to deal with them appropriately. Caring for a deep cut often involves cleaning the wound, applying an antibiotic ointment, and covering it with a clean bandage. It's also important to watch for signs of infection such as increased pain, redness, or pus. In some cases, medical attention may be necessary, for instance, when the cut is too deep (it may require stitches to help it heal), when it's caused by a rusty or dirty object (there could be a risk of tetanus), or when it doesn't stop bleeding after applying pressure for about 10 to 15 minutes. Therefore, understanding the structure of the skin, particularly the dermis, and how it reacts to injuries helps us take better care of our health."},{"question":"Translate \\"The Norwegian experiences in the field were quite similar to those of UK and Canada.\\" to French?","response":"Je vais traduire cette phrase en français pour toi.

An extensive radial railway network centred on Melbourne and spreading out across the suburbs and into the countryside was established from the late 1850s. Further major public buildings were begun in the 1860s and 1870s such as the Supreme Court, Government House, and the Queen Victoria Market. The central city filled up with shops and offices, workshops, and warehouses. Large banks and hotels faced the main streets, with fine townhouses in the east end of Collins Street, contrasting with tiny cottages down laneways within the blocks. The Aboriginal population continued to decline with an estimated 80% total decrease by 1863, due primarily to introduced diseases, particularly smallpox, frontier violence and dispossession from their lands.

Question: suppose waste gets eliminated happens, how will it affect LESS waste being removed from the body. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","response":"To answer the question, let's first analyze the process step-by-step: 1. Fluid and waste enter the kidneys. 2. A processing moment (filtration) occurs in the kidneys, allowing waste and fluid to pass through, but preventing larger molecules from passing. 3. Fluid goes back to the bloodstream. 4. Bad waste is removed. 5. The final product is turned into urine. Now, let's consider the perturbation: waste elimination happens. I assume you mean that the waste elimination is less effective. 1. If less waste is removed from the body during the waste elimination process (step 4), then there will be more waste left in the system. 2. The second effect mentioned in the process is the prevention of larger molecules from passing through the kidneys during filtration (step 2). Now, let's analyze the influence of the perturbation on the second effect: If less waste is removed from the body, it could lead to these potential consequences: A. The filtration system in the kidneys might become less effective due to an accumulation of waste, causing larger molecules to pass through more easily, which would result in more larger molecules passing through, rather than less or no effect. B. If the waste elimination process remains impaired but the actual filtration mechanism (preventing larger molecules from passing through) isn't affected directly, there could be no effect on the second effect. Given the information provided, it's difficult to determine the exact influence. However, considering these potential consequences, the perturbation could either have more effect or no effect on the second effect, depending on how the waste elimination impairment is impacting the filtration mechanism in the kidneys."},{"question":"My question is: Making an equal number of drums of paint each day, a paint mixer takes three days to make 18 drums of paint. How many days will it take for him to make 360 drums of paint? Your thoughts:","response":"To find out how many days it will take for the paint mixer to make 360 drums of paint, we first need to determine how many drums of paint he can make per day. Given that he takes 3 days to make 18 drums of paint, we can find out how many drums he makes per day by dividing the total number of drums (18) by the number of days (3). 18 drums / 3 days = 6 drums per day Now that we know he can make 6 drums per day, we can determine how many days it will take for him to make 360 drums of paint. 360 drums / 6 drums per day = 60 days So, it will take him 60 days to make 360 drums of paint."},{"question":"Luckily I was not the target or victim of this road rage, but I was a first hand witness. Back in the mid 1990s when I worked in Southern California, I was returning from lunch one day with a coworker when we noticed two pickup trucks driving erratically. This was on Valley View Blvd in Cerritos which is a large roadway divided (by a large, planted median strip) with 3 lanes on either side. One truck seemed to be chasing the other when suddenly the lead truck made a quick U-turn and was followed by the second truck. But the second truck came to stop just after making the turn. This was when the driver of that truck got out, walked to the front of his vehicle, raised his arm holding a semi-automatic handgun, paused, and then fired a single shot. At this point, I was parallel with the shooter’s truck and only about 50–60 feet from where he was standing. I remember my coworker exclaiming, “Oh sh*t! Did he just shoot at the something?!” I floored my accelerator and sped off to my workplace which was about a 1/2 mile down Valley View Blvd. I parked and my coworker and I got into the building as quickly as we could. While he started telling our other coworkers about what we had just witnessed, I ran to my desk, called 911, and reported the shooting. The dispatcher kept me on the line after my initial report and then transferred me to a detective in order to take down my information. As it turns out, my information and the fact that I called 911 immediately resulted in the arrest of the shooter. I was later asked to testify in court which resulted in the shooters conviction.

Instead of the usual elf toy makers, this Santa has apparently kidnapped kids from all across the globe and makes them sing a bit like characters from \\"It's a Small World\\"! I guess there are no child labor laws on the weird astral plane on which he lives (it's apparently NOT the North Pole and not on Earth)!! None of these kids seem very happy and I kept wanting to see commandos break in and rescue the tykes, though I guess for some of the third world kids, these working conditions were perhaps an improvement over local sweatshops. I sure hope that all they do is sing and make toys. Then, the scene abruptly changes to Hell where lots and lots of demons dance about like they are in a Busby Berkeley musical. This fun in put to a stop by Satan who orders one of them, Pitch, to go to Earth to ruin Christmas!! Personally, I thought this movie already did that! The Devil and his imps are actually kind of cute--like Hot Stuff from the Harvey Comics but with cool evil goatees! Or, if you are Puerto Rican, like a vejigante mask with a goatee! Somehow a poverty-stricken Mexican kid named Lupita, a group of jerky kids who want to mug Santa and some rich kid are key battlegrounds for the Devil and Santa!! So, if the Prince of Darkness (not Donald Trump, it's the OTHER Prince of Darkness) can somehow make her steal and be bad, he'll 'win'--what, we don't really know! In fact, as they root her on, you get the impression that the film makers intend Santa to be Jesus--as he has all these great powers AND fights the Devil over kids' souls! Later, Santa meets with his friend, Merlin. He asks him to make him a special powder that makes people dream nice dreams. Considering how much Santa laughs in the film (like a demented chipmunk), I assume he must use this drug A LOT! He immediately goes to see a blacksmith who makes him a magic key that opens ALL doors. Considering he keeps kids as his personal 'assistants', this magic key thing worries me immensely! During Santa's Christmas Eve ride, you see Lupita behave like a little angel--one problem down. Santa then takes time out now to take care of the rich kid whose parents are selfish jerks. He gives them some sort of crazy cocktail which magically solves their problems--two problems solved. This is a rare case where alcohol/drugs HELP kids and solves problems! And as for the little muggers, he gives them coal! Frustrated with his losses to Santa, Pitch then tries to steal the sleigh (which is pulled by creepy animatronic deer). When this fails, he destroys Santa's stash of 'magic powder'! As a result, Santa can't become invisible to avoid dogs and gets treed. Uh, oh...how can Santa take a detour to the Betty Ford Clinic if he's stuck up a tree?! Will St. Nick get down from the tree and get the monkey off his back or will the devils win? If you care, tune in and see. However, be warned that the film is bat-crap crazy! Technically speaking, the film is yecchy. While it is in color, it's really gaudy. The music is mostly done on an organ--which, along with bad singing from the kids, produces perhaps the worst soundtrack I've heard in recent memory. And the story is just incomprehensible and very, very, very creepy. Devils and a Santa that kidnaps kids is just plain creep-tastic.

Kayla tried to stop Emily's nose bleed even though she was afraid of blood.","response":"Kayla tried her best to stop Emily's nose bleed even though she was deeply afraid of blood, a phobia she had struggled with since childhood. The sight of blood had always caused her pulse to race and her stomach to churn, and sometimes she would even experience light-headedness or nausea, making the situation even more difficult for her to handle. Nevertheless, in this crucial moment, Kayla's overwhelming concern for her friend's well-being enabled her to push past her own fears and focus solely on providing aid to Emily. As Emily's nose continued to bleed, Kayla quickly scanned her surroundings for any helpful items, her hands trembling slightly from the anxiety she felt. As luck would have it, she spotted a first-aid kit nearby, and without a moment's hesitation, she retrieved it and opened it to find the necessary supplies. Grabbing a handful of clean gauze, she approached Emily, her heart pounding in her chest, making it difficult to breathe. She knew that she needed to stay calm in order to properly care for her friend, so Kayla took a few deep breaths, reminding herself that Emily was relying on her. With her thoughts focused on the task at hand, she felt slightly more at ease as she approached Emily and began to gently apply pressure to her friend's nostrils using the gauze. Recalling the first-aid techniques she had learned in her health class, she instructed Emily to lean forward slightly to help prevent blood from flowing into her throat. Kayla made sure to keep her voice steady, as she didn't want Emily to sense her fear. After a few minutes, she noticed the flow of blood starting to slow down, and her anxiety lessened as a result. Sensing that her friend was experiencing a sense of discomfort, Kayla spoke soothingly to Emily, distracting her from the pain and guiding her through breathing exercises that would help reduce her blood pressure. She urged Emily to gently blow her nose once to clear out any clotted blood, then had her pinch her nostrils together while breathing through her mouth for several minutes. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, the bleeding stopped, and Emily was able to remove the gauze. Kayla was filled with relief, but she knew her responsibility as a caretaker wasn't over yet. She took the time to check if Emily felt lightheaded or too weak before advising her to keep her head elevated for a while and drink some water to prevent dehydration. In the end, Kayla had conquered her fear of blood, at least this once, in order to help her friend during a moment of crisis. The experience had taught her just how strong she could be when someone she cared about needed her, and it gave her a newfound sense of confidence in handling emergency situations. Kayla realized that her phobia, while still very real and scary, could be overcome when the situation demanded it. And although her fear of blood wasn't entirely vanquished that day, she knew that she had taken an important step towards facing her fears, allowing her to grow and become a more resilient individual."},{"question":"Premise: \\"A boy cutting his friends hair while other boys look and one boy using his cellphone.\\" Hypothesis: \\"A boy is shaving his friends hair while other boys are near.\\" Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?

The question and answer pair are described below.","response":"Question: Can a clown be distracting a bull and blowing bubbles simultaneously? Answer: Yes, a clown can be distracting a bull and blowing bubbles simultaneously, but it requires careful management of the situation as well as multitasking skills. Rationale: Stream of consciousness often refers to a person's thoughts and feelings flowing continuously without interruption, so the rationale may be presented in a similar manner. Clowns are common in the context of bullfighting, particularly as \\"rodeo clowns\\" or \\"bullfighters\\" who help in distracting or diverting the bull's attention to protect fallen riders in rodeo events. While their primary role is to keep the rider safe, they are known for incorporating comedic and entertaining acts as well. Blowing bubbles is an activity that not only entertains audiences but can also distract and confuse bulls. It is a simple task that requires a bubble wand and liquid solution. A clown might need only one hand free to blow the bubbles, allowing him to use his other hand or body movements to distract the bull. In this scenario, the challenge lies in the clown's ability to multitask and be aware of the bull's movements. Professional clowns might have experienced performing several tasks simultaneously, so it may be possible for them to distract a bull while blowing bubbles. However, it's important to note that these actions might be risky as it can divide the clown's attention, potentially putting them in danger. The clown should carefully assess the situation before attempting to perform both tasks concurrently. In conclusion, a clown can distract a bull and blow bubbles simultaneously, but it requires caution and multitasking skills. The clown must effectively balance their actions to ensure the safety of both themselves and the rider while providing entertainment to the audience."},{"question":"Translate \\"Las bendiciones de tu padre han sobrepasado las bendiciones de mis antepasados hasta el límite de los collados eternos; sean ellas sobre la cabeza de José, y sobre la cabeza del consagrado de entre tus hermanos .\\" from Spanish to English.","response":"\\"The blessings of your father have surpassed the blessings of my ancestors up to the limit of the everlasting hills; may they be upon the head of Joseph, and upon the head of the consecrated one among your brothers.\\" This translation captures the essence of the original Spanish text, which speaks of the superior blessings that the father bestows upon Joseph, exceeding those received by the speaker's own forefathers.

And the answer is...","response":"To solve the equation 28*n + 88 - 148 - 108 = 0 for n, we will follow these steps: 1. Simplify the equation: Combine all the constants on the left side of the equation. 28*n + (88 - 148 - 108) = 0 2. Calculate the sum of the constants: 88 - 148 - 108 = -60 - 108 = -168 3. Rewrite the equation with the simplified constants: 28*n - 168 = 0 4. Isolate the variable n by moving the constant to the other side of the equation: 28*n = 168 5. Divide both sides of the equation by 28 to solve for n: n = 168 / 28 6.

Therefore, they cut the apple in two. Given the context: How would Aubrey feel afterwards?","response":"Although it's difficult to definitively determine how Aubrey would feel after sharing the apple with their friend since emotions can be quite complex and context-specific, it's likely that Aubrey would experience a range of emotions, which can be inferred from common human behavior and social norms. Here is a detailed analysis of the possible emotions Aubrey might be feeling: 1. Satisfaction: Aubrey might feel satisfied with their decision to share the apple, as it demonstrates kindness and thoughtfulness. Sharing materials and resources is a part of building and maintaining friendships. This act could strengthen their bond with the friend, which might result in a sense of satisfaction. 2. Empathy: Aubrey's decision to share the apple indicates that they are considering their friend's feelings or hunger. Empathy, the ability to understand and share the feelings of others, strengthens relationships and can lead to increased feelings of happiness and well-being. 3. Joy: Sharing an apple could be a fun and enjoyable experience in itself. Depending on the circumstances, such as the location and mood of both friends, this simple act of sharing an apple might bring happiness and joy to both individuals involved. 4. Altruism: Aubrey's willingness to share the apple might stem from a kind, generous nature. Altruistic behavior, or the act of putting other people's needs before one's own, can lead to personal happiness in the long run. Therefore, Aubrey might feel fulfilled and content due to their selfless act. 5. Pride: Aubrey could feel a sense of pride in their actions, as they showcased a positive character trait – generosity – in sharing the apple. Being able to present one's virtues to others is often a source of self-esteem and confidence. 6. Relief: In some situations, the act of sharing could be a relief to Aubrey. If, for instance, their friend was visibly hungry or in need, they might feel relieved knowing they were able to provide assistance and share their resources. 7. Gratitude: After reflecting on their actions, Aubrey might recognize that they are fortunate enough to be able to share something with a friend. This realization could lead to feelings of gratitude and appreciation for their own circumstances. In conclusion, while it's impossible to know with certainty how Aubrey would feel after sharing the apple, it is reasonable to suggest that they are likely to feel a range of positive emotions such as satisfaction, empathy, joy, altruism, pride, relief, and gratitude. These emotions stem from the act of sharing, considering the feelings of others, and the potential strengthening of their friendship."},{"question":"Q: The input is a tweet which can be Hate Speech, Offensive or Normal tweet.

When hydrogen atoms fuse together in nuclear reactions at the sun's core, they form helium. This process, known as nuclear fusion, generates a tremendous amount of energy. The energy produced manifests in the form of light (photons) and other particles (neutrinos), which need to be transported to the sun's surface before being released into space. There are two primary ways that energy is transported through the sun's layers: radiation and convection. In the radiative zone, which extends from the core to about 70% of the sun's radius, the energy is transported primarily by radiation. It is important to note that the flow of photons isn't a direct trip from the core to the surface. The photons travel through a \\"random walk\\" process, bouncing off particles, being absorbed, and then re-emitted. This results in a slow, zigzagging journey outwards. Beyond the radiative zone is the convective zone, where convection takes over as the primary mode of energy transport. In this zone, the sun's material is heated and becomes less dense. As the hot material rises towards the surface, it loses heat to the cooler layers above it. This cooling causes the material to become denser, and it sinks back down to be reheated. This cyclic process creates convection currents that carry energy towards the outermost layer of the sun, known as the photosphere. Once the energy reaches the photosphere, it is emitted into space in the form of sunlight and solar radiation, which includes ultraviolet light, x-rays, and gamma rays. This emission propagates through the solar system and can have significant effects on the planets and other celestial bodies, including Earth, for example, by driving Earth's climate and weather patterns, powering photosynthesis in plants, and producing auroras in the polar regions. In summary, the final step of the process that begins with the sun's gravity and nuclear fusion is the transportation of the produced energy through the sun's layers and its eventual release into the solar system as sunlight and solar radiation. This energy plays a crucial role in sustaining life and shaping the environment on Earth and other celestial bodies."},{"question":"Answer a question about this article: Mountains of the Long Range in Newfoundland reach heights of nearly 3,000 ft (900 m).

New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson offered on Friday to broker talks between Cubans and Cuban Americans to set the stage for normalization of relations between the U.S. and Cuba as he ended a five-day visit to the communist-led island. SANTA FE, New Mexico | SANTA FE, New Mexico (Reuters) - Billy the Kid, the Wild West outlaw who is reputed to have killed 21 men and whose exploits have been widely chronicled in U.S. popular culture, is under consideration for a pardon. New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson said on Thursday he was reviewing a pardon petition based on the widespread belief that New Mexico territorial Governor Lew Wallace promised the 19th century gunman a pardon in exchange for his testimony in a murder trial. \\"As someone who is fascinated with New Mexico's rich history, I've always been intrigued by the story of Billy the Kid and, in particular, the alleged promise of a pardon he was given,\\" Richardson said in a statement. \\"I will diligently review this new petition and all the facts available regarding an agreement between Billy the Kid and Governor Wallace before rendering any decision,\\" Richardson said, adding he would decide by the end of the year. The two-term Democratic governor, who leaves office at the end of the month, asked historians and others to weigh in with their opinions on a website dedicated to the issue, here Lincoln County Sheriff Pat Garrett shot Billy the Kid to death at point-blank range in 1881. Newspapers had already turned the young outlaw, whose real name was Henry McCarty, into a larger-than-life figure by the time of his death in his early 20s. A book by Garrett transformed McCarty into a legendary figure of America's western frontier. He has since become the subject of many songs, films and books. Richardson received various pardon requests over the years from McCarty's descendants, but this was the first formal petition he received in the matter. It was presented by trial attorney and western history buff Randi McGinn, who was designated to study the documents of that era to determine whether there was sufficient basis for a pardon to be seriously considered. The petition she submitted on Tuesday \\"is narrow in scope and does not argue for a blanket pardon of all of Billy the Kid's activities,\\" a statement from Richardson's office said.

How de we define creativity? Where does creativity come from? How philosophical is the notion of creativity? Is everyone’s ‘creativity’ different? Or is it an ill conceived, simplified term that is used to describe a very specific series of neuronal & bodily reactions to certain stimuli? These are all the questions I’ve been thinking (and googling, and youtubing) since beginning this Capturing Creativity studio* and I have found some answers or maybe I’ve just found more questions: Creativity is generally defined as the ability to make new things, or come up with new ideas, it’s an ability to think outside the box, to see unique solutions and employ them in inventive ways. In this sense creativity is not always utilised when being ‘creative’, as to be creative is simply defined as the ability to make or produce something. However I guess that depends on your definition of creative, how different, unique, special, once off, un-influenced does something have to be, to be classified as creative? This is where creativity get’s tricky. It’s all well and good to be like oh this is what creativity is, so it’s easy to investigate it, but what if you don’t define that as being creative, maybe that was just following a formula, a somewhat inspired formula, but maybe it is just a formula. Creativity to most people seems to be a random mix of once off genius combined with solid skill and hard work and for us humans these percentages are unique to us. Maybe creativity to you is 90% unique idea, 5% skill and 5% hard work. Maybe creativity to you is 40% unique idea, 50% skill and 10% hard work. Maybe for you creativity doesn’t have to involve any hard work at all. For me when it comes to creativity I’m most interested in that unique idea portion; where does that unique idea come from? Is it simply random? Is it a gift from the gods? Is our unique idea just a product of a lot of subconscious effort, only made aware to us in the sense of a ‘random’ idea?

What is Article 370 of the Constitution of India? Would you say that these questions are the same?","response":"To answer these questions, I will first gather information about Jawahar Lal Nehru's role in the mentioned events, as well as Article 370 of the Constitution of India. Then, I will analyze the reasons why some of Nehru's actions are remembered differently. Finally, I will evaluate whether these questions are the same or not. Step 1: Gather Information Jawahar Lal Nehru served as the first Prime Minister of independent India from 1947 to 1964. During his tenure, he faced various challenges, including the issues with China, Portugal, Hyderabad, Junagadh, and Kashmir. 1. Defeat against China: India faced a humiliating defeat in the 1962 Sino-Indian War under Nehru's leadership. This has left a lasting impression, and many Indians blame Nehru for India's unpreparedness and lack of military strategy. 2. Victory against Portugal: In 1961, India successfully annexed Goa, Daman and Diu, ending Portuguese colonial rule in the region. Nehru played a significant role in this event. 3. Police action in Hyderabad and Junagadh: Following India's independence, both Hyderabad and Junagadh acceded to India in 1948 after military intervention, often referred to as \\"police action.\\" This intervention led to the integration of these territories within the Indian Union. Nehru played a crucial role in these decisions. 4. Saving 3/4th of Kashmir: In 1947, when Pakistan-backed forces attempted to take control of Kashmir, Nehru took a timely decision to send Indian troops into the region, saving a significant portion of Kashmir from being occupied by Pakistan. Thus, a large part of Kashmir remained with India. 5. Article 370: It is a constitutional provision that granted special autonomy to Jammu and Kashmir, allowing the state to have its own constitution, flag, and control over various administrative matters. The article was designed to respect the unique conditions and history of the region. It was abrogated in 2019. Step 2: Analyze Reasons for Differences in Remembrance 1. The defeat against China had a higher impact on the psyche of the Indian population than the other events. Losing a war to a neighboring nation, especially a growing superpower like China, tends to be remembered more prominently in public memory. 2. Successes such as the victory against Portugal or the police action in Hyderabad and Junagadh are sometimes overshadowed by failures. Portugal was a relatively weaker opponent compared to China, and integrating princely states into the Indian Union was a relatively smooth process compared to the territorial disputes with a major power like China. 3. The India-China conflict remains an ongoing issue, while the issues with Portugal, Hyderabad, and Junagadh have been resolved. This means that the 1962 defeat still resonates in the current political climate. Step 3: Evaluate if Questions are the Same These questions are not the same as they address different aspects of Jawahar Lal Nehru's political career and decisions. The first question is about the public perception of Nehru's actions in various territorial conflicts, while the second question asks about the specifics of Article 370 of the Indian Constitution. However, both questions are related in that they pertain to different aspects of the history of modern India and the political decisions made during Nehru's tenure."},{"question":"Create a set of triples that describes the content in the following sentence.

The answer is:","response":"To determine which table will make the bottom of the bag stay cooler, we need to consider the factors that affect heat transfer between the table and the lunch bag. 1. Heat transfer by conduction: When the lunch bag is in contact with the table, heat can be transferred from the table to the bag by conduction. Shiny surfaces usually have a lower coefficient of thermal conductivity than matte surfaces, which means they transfer heat less efficiently. 2. Heat transfer by radiation: Shiny surfaces are often better reflectors of thermal radiation than matte surfaces, which means they may be less likely to transfer heat by radiation. Step by step analysis: Step 1: Consider heat transfer by conduction. Since shiny surfaces have a lower coefficient of thermal conductivity, they will transfer heat less efficiently to the lunch bag, keeping it cooler. Step 2: Consider heat transfer by radiation. As shiny surfaces are better reflectors, they are less likely to transfer heat to the lunch bag by radiation, keeping it cooler. Conclusion: Based on our analysis, the \\"shiny table\\" will make the bottom of the bag stay cooler."},{"question":"Answer the following question, with explanation first.

Explanation: When someone is on skates, they typically rely on momentum and gravity to move forward or maintain their speed. In Sentence B, \\"A child can roll downhill on skates,\\" it makes sense because when a child is skating downhill, gravity will naturally pull them downwards, allowing them to roll easily.

Paul discovers that Takeda is the last in a samurai line and has a score to settle with Kinjo. The ninjas attempts to murder Paul at the hospital, killing several hospital staff and police officers, including Wadakura, but Paul escapes. Takeda and his wife Mieko subsequently take Paul to their family's stronghold, located on an island several hundred miles away. Leaving the city, Takeda uses Paul as bait to draw Kinjo out, leading to a battle on the train where several passenger cars of innocent people are slaughtered by the ninjas. Takeda and Mieko defeat the attackers, but Kinjo was not among them. The ninja leading the attack was Junko, Kinjo's lover, giving Kinjo motivation to kill Paul and Takeda. On the island, Paul spends time with the drunken blacksmith Oshima, who is constructing a sword for Takeda, and the old man teaches him about smithing and swordsmanship. Mieko explains the history of the two clans' conflict and the samurai concepts of courage and honor.

Let's think first:","response":"First, let's break down the question to understand the key components: The Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) is an agreement that involves eliminating or reducing trade barriers among countries in the Americas, excluding Cuba. Now, let's define each component to fully grasp the concept: 1. Free Trade Area: A group of countries that agree to reduce or eliminate trade barriers, such as tariffs, quotas, or other restrictive measures.

I found the following answer on Google: The tar coating is applied in one or more coats as a hot liquid, heated in a tar kettle , or as sheets of tar impregnated 'paper' glued down and sealed together at joints by hot tar - once it has cooled, the gravel is spread evenly over it. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","response":"No, the answer provided does not directly address the question on the lifespan of a flat membrane roof. To answer your original question, the lifespan of a flat membrane roof varies depending on the type of membrane material used, installation quality, and maintenance. There are different types of membrane materials commonly used for flat roofs, including: 1. TPO (Thermoplastic Olefin) - These roofs typically last around 22-30 years. 2. PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride) - PVC roofs have an estimated lifespan of 20-25 years. 3. EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer) - EPDM rubber roofing systems can last around 20-25 years, with some lasting up to 30 years with proper maintenance. The longevity of a flat membrane roof depends on regular maintenance, inspections, and timely repairs. Additionally, various external factors, such as weather conditions, uv exposure, and mechanical damage, can impact the lifespan. To summarize, a flat membrane roof can last anywhere between 20-30 years, depending on the type of membrane material, installation quality, and maintenance practices. The answer you initially found discussed the installation process of a built-up roofing system (using tar and gravel), which is different from a single-ply membrane roofing system."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Facts: - birth date: 7 june 1942 - name: elizabeth counsell - birth place: windsor , berkshire , england - occupation: stage , film and television actress Based on these bullet points, write a short biography describing the life of elizabeth counsell .

In 1982, Waters suggested a new musical project with the working title Spare Bricks, originally conceived as the soundtrack album for Pink Floyd – The Wall. With the onset of the Falklands War, Waters changed direction and began writing new material. He saw Margaret Thatcher's response to the invasion of the Falklands as jingoistic and unnecessary, and dedicated the album to his late father. Immediately arguments arose between Waters and Gilmour, who felt that the album should include all new material, rather than recycle songs passed over for The Wall. Waters felt that Gilmour had contributed little to the band's lyrical repertoire. Michael Kamen, a contributor to the orchestral arrangements of The Wall, mediated between the two, also performing the role traditionally occupied by the then-absent Wright. The tension within the band grew. Waters and Gilmour worked independently; however, Gilmour began to feel the strain, sometimes barely maintaining his composure. After a final confrontation, Gilmour's name disappeared from the credit list, reflecting what Waters felt was his lack of songwriting contributions.Though Mason's musical contributions were minimal, he stayed busy recording sound effects for an experimental Holophonic system to be used on the album. With marital problems of his own, he remained a distant figure. Pink Floyd did not use Thorgerson for the cover design, Waters choosing to design the cover himself. Released in March 1983, The Final Cut went straight to number one in the UK and number six in the US. Waters wrote all the lyrics, as well as all the music on the album. Gilmour did not have any material ready for the album and asked Waters to delay the recording until he could write some songs, but Waters refused. Gilmour later commented: \\"I'm certainly guilty at times of being lazy ... but he wasn't right about wanting to put some duff tracks on The Final Cut.\\" Rolling Stone magazine gave the album five stars, with Kurt Loder calling it \\"a superlative achievement ... art rock's crowning...

Think carefully first, then make a decision:","response":"Step 1: Given that Mars is 150 tons of \\"other elements\\", which accounts for the remaining percentage in addition to the 50% iron and 20% carbon, we can calculate the total weight of Mars. It is given Mars and the Moon have the same composition: 50% Iron 20% Carbon (100% - 50% - 20%) = 30% Other Elements Step 2: Since 30% of Mars' weight corresponds to the 150 tons of other elements, we can calculate 1% of Mars' weight: 1% of Mars' weight = 150 tons / 30 = 5 tons Step 3: Now that we have 1% of Mars' weight (5 tons), we can determine the total weight of Mars: 100% of Mars' weight = 5 tons * 100 = 500 tons Step 4: It is given that Mars weighs twice as much as the Moon, so to find the Moon's weight, we just need to divide Mars' weight by 2: Moon's weight = Mars' weight / 2 = 500 tons / 2 = 250 tons So, the Moon weighs 250 tons."},{"question":"Question: Given the following passage \\"The structure of QD-LEDs used for the electrical-excitation scheme is similar to basic design of OLEDs.

She transferred her Pink Power Ranger powers to Katherine Hillard, played by Catherine Sutherland. Amy Jo Johnson later reprised her role as Kimberly in the 1995 film Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie and made a few guest appearances in later seasons and movies."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Texting long messages can be a pain in the neck. The repetitive action of working your fingers across the keyboard of your cell phone can cause some of the same chronic pain problems previously limited to those who'd spent a lifetime typing. The possible connection is particularly worrying considering how much teens and young adults -- and increasingly those in professional settings -- are texting nowadays, said Judith Gold, who carried out one of the first studies on the potential connection. Text messaging is a fairly new technology, Gold says, so this is a new area of research for those who study ergonomics . But \\"considering the similarities in body position, findings from research on overuse injuries from computers could be applicable\\" to texting. \\"The way the body is positioned for texting - fixed shoulders and back with rapidly moving fingers - is similar to the position for typing on a computer,\\" Gold explained. Previous research has found pain in the elbow connected with too much thumb texting. To look for a broader link between texting and chronic pain, Gold and her colleagues sent a questionnaire to 138 college students, asking them to report the number of text messages they sent per day (in four categories: 0, 1-10, 11-20, 21+ messages) and to point out any discomfort they felt on a body map. The research showed an association between the number of text messages sent per day and shoulder discomfort. The effect seemed to be particularly pronounced in males, though Gold says she doesn't know why that would be. \\"What we've seen so far is very similar to what we see with office workers who've spent most of their time at a computer,\\" Gold said. However, Gold's study did not take account of the amount of time the people surveyed also spent typing on computers, which could be affecting the results. The passage mainly tells us _ . A) what ergonomics is B) texting too much causes a pain in the neck C) whether texting is beneficial or not D) the connection between texting and typing A:","response":"The passage mainly tells us about the connection between texting and typing, and how the repetitive action of working fingers across the keyboard of a cell phone, much like typing, can cause chronic pain problems.

In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague. - North East England is one of the nine regions of England that are classified at the first level of NUTS for statistical purposes. It covers Northumberland, County Durham, Tyne and Wear, and the Tees Valley. The region is home to three large conurbations: Teesside, Wearside, and Tyneside, the latter of which is the largest of the three and the eighth most populous conurbation in the United Kingdom. There are only three cities in the region; Newcastle upon Tyne is the largest city in the region with a population of just under 280,000, followed by Sunderland, both of which are located in the metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear.

The answer to this question is:","response":"Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company was a British engineering company based in Wallsend, North East England, on the River Tyne. The company was founded by Sir Charles Algernon Parsons, who invented the marine steam turbine. It played a significant role in the development and production of steam turbines for ships, particularly in the early 20th century. Newcastle upon Tyne is the largest city in the North East region of England, and it is located within the metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear. Wallsend, where Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company was based, is a town in North Tyneside, Tyne and Wear. The company's location on the River Tyne enabled it to take advantage of the thriving maritime industry in the surrounding area, particularly Newcastle upon Tyne, which served as a major center for shipbuilding and maritime commerce. In summary, the relationship between Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company and Newcastle upon Tyne is one of geographical proximity and shared industrial heritage.

Chicago delivered the game's opening punch in the first quarter as quarterback Jay Cutler found tight end Matt Spaeth on a 5-yard touchdown pass. The Bears added onto their lead in the second quarter with a 51-yard field goal from kicker Robbie Gould. The Eagles would answer with kicker Alex Henery getting a 47-yard field goal, followed by linebacker Brian Rolle returned a fumble 22 yards for a touchdown, yet Chicago closed out the half with a 2-yard touchdown run from running back Marion Barber. Philadelphia took the lead in the third quarter with running back Ronnie Brown getting a 4-yard touchdown run, followed by running back LeSean McCoy getting a 33-yard touchdown run. The Bears replied with a 38-yard field goal from Gould. Afterwards, Chicago regained the lead in the fourth quarter with Cutler connecting with wide receiver Earl Bennett on a 5-yard touchdown pass. On the Eagles possession, punter Chas Henry attempted to pass to Colt Anderson on a fake punt, which fell short.Gould would then make a 22-yard field goal. The Eagles tried to rally, but the Bears defense would hold on for the victory. How many total yards did the two shortest field goals equal when combined?","response":"To determine the combined yards of the two shortest field goals, we need to identify the field goals that took place in the game. There were three field goals mentioned in the article: 1. A 51-yard field goal from kicker Robbie Gould. 2. A 47-yard field goal from kicker Alex Henery. 3. A 38-yard field goal from Robbie Gould. The two shortest field goals were the 47-yard field goal by Alex Henery and the 38-yard field goal by Robbie Gould. To find the combined yards, we add the yardage of these two field goals: 47 yards (Henery) + 38 yards (Gould) = 85 yards The two shortest field goals combined for a total of 85 yards."},{"question":"Premise: It should be noted that Schwartz used data on the prevalence of chronic bronchitis, not its incidence. Hypothesis: Schwartz made the right choice by using data on prevalence. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","response":"The premise stating that Schwartz used data based on the prevalence of chronic bronchitis rather than its incidence does not directly entail that Schwartz made the correct choice. The reason being, the premise is giving factual information about what Schwartz did, while the hypothesis is making a judgment or evaluation of his decision. To analyze further, we have to understand what each term— prevalence and incidence— mean. Both are epidemiological terms used in studies researching the disease patterns in a population. Prevalence refers to the proportion of a particular population found to be affected by a medical condition at a specific time. It gives an estimate of how common that condition is in a population at that particular time. Prevalence is generally assessed for chronic diseases that last for a long duration and do not disappear quickly, like chronic bronchitis. In contrast, incidence relates to the number of new cases of a condition, disease, or injury that develop in a specific group of people during a particular time period. Incidence is more relevant in cases where the disease is short-lived and disappears quickly. Your hypothesis implies that using prevalence data was the right choice, which might be accurate in certain contexts but wrong in some others. If Schwartz's research was intended to gauge how widespread chronic bronchitis currently is, then using prevalence might indeed be a good choice. If, however, Schwartz was interested in how many new cases are happening, then incidence data would have been more appropriate. So, to summarize, the statement \\"Schwartz made the right choice by using data on prevalence\\" is an evaluative statement and depends on the specific research question Schwartz was attempting to answer. It cannot be directly inferred or entailed from the factual statement \\"Schwartz used data on the prevalence of chronic bronchitis, not its incidence.\\" Whether or not Schwartz made the right choice can only be determined if we know more about the aims, goals, and context of his research."},{"question":"Obama’s China visit gets off to rocky start, reflecting current relations HANGZHOU, China — The problems began as soon as President Obama landed in China. There were no stairs waiting for him to emerge from his usual door at the front of Air Force One. On the tarmac, as Obama’s staffers scrambled to get lower-level stairs in place for him to disembark, White House press photographers traveling with him tried to get in their usual position to mark his arrival in a foreign country, only to find a member of the Chinese welcoming delegation screaming at them. He told the White House press corps that they needed to leave. A White House official tried to intervene, saying, essentially, this is our president and our plane and the media isn’t moving. American and Chinese officials argued over where the White House press corps could stand at Hangzhou airport as President Obama arrived for the G20 summit. The Chinese official told the White House official, \\"This is our country. This is our airport.\\" (Reuters) The man yelled in response, “This is our country!” The man then entered into a testy exchange with Obama’s national security adviser, Susan E. Rice, and her deputy, Ben Rhodes, while trying to block them from moving toward the front of the plane. [Obama heads to Asia with his biggest foreign policy push hanging in the balance] On what is probably his last visit to China, for a Group of 20 summit here, there were flare-ups and simmering tensions throughout — a fitting reflection of how the relationship between these two world powers has become frayed and fraught with frustration. Over the past seven years, strained ties with China have colored and come to define Obama’s foreign policy in Asia. On Saturday, several White House protocol officers and other staff members arriving at a diplomatic compound ahead of Obama’s meetings were stopped from entering and had heated arguments with Chinese officials before they could get in. “The president is arriving here in an hour,” one White House staffer was overheard saying in exasperation. A fistfight nearly broke out between a Chinese official trying to help the U.S. diplomats and a Chinese security official trying to keep them out. “Calm down, please. Calm down,” another White House official pleaded. President Obama praised the Paris agreement on climate change while meeting with world leaders at the G20 summit in China, but said the plan by itself \\"won't solve the climate crisis.\\" (Reuters) Twenty minutes before the arrival of Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping, the two sides were still arguing in the room where the two leaders would soon be touting their cooperation. The Chinese insisted that there was not enough space for the 12 American journalists traveling with Obama. U.S. officials insisted that there was, pointing to a spacious area sectioned off for the media and citing arrangements negotiated long in advance. For all the skirmishes, in the days leading up to the trip, White House officials gave a much rosier depiction of the U.S.-China relationship, talking up mutual efforts such as a deal to address climate change. But in so many other areas, the world’s two largest economic powers have failed to bridge increasing hostilities and in­trac­table disputes over maritime issues, cybersecurity, trade and human rights. The yelling and screaming Saturday in many ways illustrated just how differently both sides view their roles — and how little has changed since Obama’s troubled first visit in 2009. [How China’s ratifying the Paris climate deal could be bad for Donald Trump] High hopes turn to pivot Obama began with high hopes of improving U.S.-China relations. In 2009, he tried reaching out to Chinese leaders with offers of increased engagement. He decided not to meet with the Dalai Lama to avoid angering Beijing, to the disappointment of human rights advocates. Obama became the first U.S. president to visit China during his first year in office. But his administration was taken aback by how completely the Chinese controlled all aspects of that visit. “He wasn’t allowed to say much at all,” said Orville Schell, a longtime China scholar who was in China during the visit. “The Chinese kept him from meeting certain people, from taking questions or even radio broadcasts. He didn’t know quite how to respond. He didn’t want to be impolite. It took the U.S. a while to understand that this was the direction China and the relationship was headed.” Some have blamed Obama for adopting such an overly optimistic and open stance during those early years. For all his outreach, current and former top U.S. diplomats say, Obama got little in return, except the feeling of being burned by Beijing. But that could be equally attributed to the simple fact that China itself was undergoing a seismic shift during the early years of Obama’s presidency. When the global recession plunged the world into financial crisis in the late 2000s, China escaped unscathed. Its leaders looked around and realized for the first time just how much power China had achieved in ­becoming the world’s second-largest economy. Shortly there­after, they began eagerly throwing that weight around. No longer were they willing to make concessions or bide their time — on big things, such as territorial claims, and on smaller ones, such as the nitty-gritty of negotiations over who sits where and says what during diplomatic exchanges. Obama’s response to this newfound Chinese assertiveness was largely a response to reality. “In a textbook, it would be great to have a strategic vision for how you see things being eight years from now,” said Jeffrey A. Bader, Obama’s top Asia adviser during those early years. “But in this case, I think the word ‘reaction’ is right. You had a China that was changing in capacity and leadership.” If the carrot of engagement didn’t work, Obama administration officials decided, they would try the stick. And they gave this tougher policy a name: the “pivot to Asia.” The pivot boiled down to the idea of rebalancing U.S. ­foreign-policy attention from the Middle East to Asia — an area that will have clear long-term strategic importance in coming years. Those overseeing the pivot strategy, senior U.S. officials said at the time, had studied examples in history when one power was rising while others were declining: Germany’s rise in Europe after World War I; Athens and Sparta; the rise of the United States in the 20th century. Out of those studies, they developed a belief that China would respond best to a position of strength. To find that leverage, the United States planned to forge stronger ties with its traditional allies in Asia and pick up new allies among neighbors alienated by China’s new aggression — including Vietnam, Burma and India. Using that multilateral approach, the thinking went, the United States could offset China’s rising military power and assertiveness. The main problem with the Asia pivot was one of perception and substance. European and Middle Eastern leaders expressed concern at the idea of U.S. attention and priorities suddenly shifting from their regions to another. Chinese leaders saw the pivot as a U.S. conspiracy to interfere with China’s goals and to slow its rise. Meanwhile, the very Asian allies the pivot was meant to reassure had their doubts as well. Many wondered how much of the pivot was empty rhetoric and how much it would be backed by economic and military substance. In recent months, those doubts have resurfaced because the ­Trans-Pacific Partnership — a multinational trade agreement with Asian allies that Obama hopes to enact this year — may die for lack of support in Congress and from presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Meanwhile, in the years since the pivot strategy began, the U.S.-China relationship has soured. Both countries are trying to avoid open hostility but are increasingly wary and frustrated with each other. When asked about the skirmishes on this trip on Sunday, Obama said, “we don’t make apologies for pushing when it comes to press access.” But he added, some of the misunderstandings may just be due to the complicated logistics of hosting a G20 summit. The U.S.-China relationship may be the biggest problem Obama’s successor will face in Asia. Other countries in the region continue to fear China’s rise but are not fully convinced that the United States will be a sufficient counterweight. How the next president deals with China — the exact proportion of carrots and sticks chosen and the Chinese response to that — will probably define the region in the decade to come. If this visit by Obama is any indication, the situation is unlikely to improve anytime soon. On Saturday, even as the two presidents finished their talk and prepared for a nighttime stroll toward Obama’s motorcade, Chinese officials suddenly cut the number of U.S. journalists who could cover them from six to three, and finally to one. “That is our arrangement,” a Chinese official flatly told a White House staffer, looking away. “But your arrangement keeps changing,” the White House staffer responded. In the end, after lengthy and infuriating negotiations, they settled on having just two journalists witness the leaders’ walk. Neither side was happy with the compromise.

The original meaning of the Latin word templum was this sacred space, and only later referred to a building. Rome itself was an intrinsically sacred space; its ancient boundary (pomerium) had been marked by Romulus himself with oxen and plough; what lay within was the earthly home and protectorate of the gods of the state. In Rome, the central references for the establishment of an augural templum appear to have been the Via Sacra (Sacred Way) and the pomerium. Magistrates sought divine opinion of proposed official acts through an augur, who read the divine will through observations made within the templum before, during and after an act of sacrifice. Divine disapproval could arise through unfit sacrifice, errant rites (vitium) or an unacceptable plan of action. If an unfavourable sign was given, the magistrate could repeat the sacrifice until favourable signs were seen, consult with his augural colleagues, or abandon the project. Magistrates could use their right of augury (ius augurum) to adjourn and overturn the process of law, but were obliged to base their decision on the augur's observations and advice. For Cicero, himself an augur, this made the augur the most powerful authority in the Late Republic. By his time (mid 1st century BC) augury was supervised by the college of pontifices, whose powers were increasingly woven into the magistracies of the cursus honorum.

Step 1: Analyze the first sentence. Sentence 1 states that the educational system has been \\"watered down\\" to the extent that any above-average student is now considered gifted. This implies that the standards for what is considered \\"gifted\\" have lowered, making it easier for students to be labeled as such. Step 2: Analyze the second sentence. Sentence 2 asks if the school system has become more difficult, causing even smart students to struggle and fall behind. This sentence addresses a possible increase in the difficulty of the school system. Step 3: Compare and contrast the contents of both sentences. The two sentences address different aspects of the educational system. Sentence 1 implies a decrease in the standards for assessing students' abilities, allowing more students to be considered gifted. Sentence 2, however, focuses on the difficulty level of the system itself and addresses the possibility of increased difficulty in coursework and expectations.

Article: As Artificial Intelligence(AI) becomes increasingly sophisticated, there are growing concerns that robots could become a threat. This danger can be avoided, according to computer science professor Stuart Russell, if we figure out how to turn human values into a programmable code. Russell argues that as robots take on more complicated tasks, it's necessary to translate our morals into AI language. For example, if a robot does chores around the house, you wouldn't want it to put the pet cat in the oven to make dinner for the hungry children. \\"You would want that robot preloaded with a good set of values,\\" said Russell. Some robots are already programmed with basic human values. For example, mobile robots have been programmed to keep a comfortable distance from humans. Obviously there are cultural differences, but if you were talking to another person and they came up close in your personal space, you wouldn't think that's the kind of thing a properly brought-up person would do. It will be possible to create more sophisticated moral machines, if only we can find a way to set out human values as clear rules. Robots could also learn values from drawing patterns from large sets of data on human behavior. They are dangerous only if programmers are careless. The biggest concern with robots going against human values is that human beings fail to so sufficient testing and they've produced a system that will break some kind of taboo . One simple check would be to program a robot to check the correct course of action with a human when presented with an unusual situation. If the robot is unsure whether an animal is suitable for the microwave, it has the opportunity to stop, send out beeps , and ask for directions from a human. If we humans aren't quite sure about a decision, we go and ask somebody else. The most difficult step in programming values will be deciding exactly what we believe in moral, and how to create a set of ethical rules. But if we come up with an answer, robots could be good for humanity. Question: What does the author say about the threat of robots? Options: A: It may constitute a challenge to computer progranmers. B: It accompanies all machinery involving high technology. C: It can be avoided if human values are translated into their language. D: It has become an inevitable peril as technology gets more sophisticated.
