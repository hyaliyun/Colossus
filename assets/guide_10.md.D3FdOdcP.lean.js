First, identify the primary components of the original sentence: - Subject: A man - Action: sitting (although the verb \\"is\\" is not explicitly present, the tense can be inferred from the action) - Object: a large box of fruit 2. Now break down the proposed statement \\"A man is sitting beside a box of fruit\\": - Subject: A man - Action: is sitting - Object: beside a box of fruit 3.

What evidence supports this claim?","response":"The claim that France and Britain should be willing to give up their seats for the European Union is a stance rooted in promoting closer cooperation and unity among European nations. France and Britain, both permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, wield significant influence in global affairs. Advocates for this claim believe that by relinquishing their individual seats in favor of a unified EU representation, a stronger and more cohesive European voice could emerge on the world stage. Here is an outline of evidence which supports this claim: 1. Strengthening the European Union's global influence: By giving up their seats, France and Britain can signal their commitment to the EU project, thus fostering greater harmony among member nations. A unified EU presence in global institutions like the UN would contribute to a more coherent stance on critical issues, reflecting the interests of the entire region rather than individual nations. 2. Solidifying the EU's collective identity: By pooling resources and influence, EU nations could strengthen their collective identity and reinforce the perception of the EU as a powerful global actor. This could, in turn, improve the union's bargaining power in international negotiations and help to ensure geopolitical stability within Europe. 3. More equitable representation: Having a single EU seat would address the current imbalance in representation, where some European nations enjoy disproportionately high levels of influence by being part of the elite group of permanent UN Security Council members. This move could pave the way for a more democratic and transparent decision-making process. 4. Reducing redundancy and inefficiencies: Merging France and Britain's seats with the EU could help to streamline bureaucratic processes, cut red tape, and save money by reducing duplication of efforts. This could enhance the effectiveness of EU policies and initiatives, both within Europe and in the wider global community. 5. Encouraging other regions to pursue similar paths: If the EU were to gain a single seat in the UN, it could set a positive example for other regional organizations, such as the African Union or the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). This could spur similar initiatives, promoting regional cooperation and fostering a more inclusive and representative global governance system. 6. Addressing global challenges more effectively: A single EU seat could reinforce the union's commitment to addressing common global challenges, such as climate change, migration, terrorism, and economic inequality. Pooling resources and influence allows for more significant and unified efforts to resolve these pressing issues and encourages greater coordination among member states. 7. Enhancing the legitimacy of the UN Security Council: The current setup of the UN Security Council has often been critiqued for being outdated and not reflective of the shifting global power dynamics. By giving up their seats in favor of a single EU representation, France and Britain would show flexibility in adapting to these changes, thus contributing to the legitimacy and effectiveness of the council. It is essential to note that the idea of giving up their individual seats is politically and diplomatically challenging for both France and Britain, as it would involve them ceding a degree of national sovereignty. Furthermore, convincing other permanent members, such as the US, China, and Russia, to support such a reform to the UN Security Council will not be easy. However, proponents of this claim believe that the benefits of enhanced EU unity and representation in global governance make it a worthy consideration."},{"question":"Write a title for this article: NEW YORK -- Federal authorities raided a government-funded health clinic Wednesday run by New York's state Senate majority leader a day after he was accused of siphoning 14 million from the nonprofit operation. Attorney General Andrew Cuomo confirmed that his office is assisting Brooklyn federal prosecutors in a corruption probe of state Sen. Pedro Espada Jr., with potential charges that could include mail fraud, wire fraud, theft of government funds and conspiracy. In a civil lawsuit Tuesday, Cuomo accused Espada and relatives and friends on the clinic's board of looting clinic funds for lavish restaurant meals, trips to Las Vegas and Espada's campaign. Cuomo said Wednesday it was clear Espada had broken the law. But Espada called the federal raids \\"an invasion\\" and denied any wrongdoing. He accused Cuomo of staging a politically motivated vendetta against him. Espada was a leader of a Republican-backed coup last summer that he claims is motivating Cuomo's lawsuit. Espada later rejoined the Democrats and received the majority leader title. About a dozen FBI and IRS agents and investigators from Cuomo's office spent eight hours Wednesday at the Soundview Healthcare Network in the Bronx, where a canopy above the front door lists Espada as its president and CEO. Agents used bolt cutters to open an 8-foot-tall, 25-foot-long storage container behind the building and removed Espada campaign posters and other items. More than 30 boxes of files and materials were carted away in a van. Agents wearing blue or green gloves leafed through the contents, taking notes. One box was marked, \\"Payroll 205.\\" Another said \\"Timesheets 205-206.\\" In a late afternoon news conference, Espada said he would fight the \\"false and unfounded allegations made by the attorney general.\\" He called the raids \\"a media circus, a media show.\\" \\"The attorney general wants to create this impression of wrongdoing when there is no wrongdoing,\\" he said. Espada brushed aside several specific questions about the charges. Cuomo's civil action accuses Espada of diverting the clinic's funding charitable assets to himself, relatives, friends and his political operation. FBI spokesman James Margolin would not comment on what was seized from the clinic. A search warrant affidavit was sealed. The IRS declined to comment Wednesday. In the civil suit, Cuomo also accused Espada of getting Soundview's board, which he controls, to give him a guaranteed 9 million severance package that, if ever paid out, would bankrupt the clinic. In 2004, then-Attorney General Spitzer charged two of Soundview's vice presidents, Espada's executive assistant and a clinic director with grand larceny and scheming to defraud. Two of them were accused of filing false reports, a concern Cuomo raised in his civil lawsuit on Tuesday. Espada was not charged, but he and his campaign were later fined 61,000 by the city for campaign-finance violations involving Soundview employees who had been reimbursed for their contributions. Cuomo's lawsuit broaches the use of clinic money for campaign contributions, but a state Board of Elections spokesman said the allegations appear to center on tax law - with potential federal law enforcement jurisdiction - more than state election law. The clinic remained open to patients throughout Wednesday's raid. Solsire Bobet, who was at the clinic with two toddlers for test results, described the clinic as \\"my second home\\" and said she came to the facility to see the dentist and for care during her four pregnancies. \\"For everything I come here,\\" she said, adding she knew about Espada. \\"I know he is responsible for this place.\\" Outside, a huge sign in the grass bears a picture of Espada surrounded by smiling children and a list of clinic services. Espada was excused from the legislative session for the day but little was done in his absence. Without him, the Senate's Democratic majority lacked the 32 votes needed to pass any legislation without Republican support and adjourned after less than an hour. With a state budget three weeks overdue and major legislation pending, the session had been expected to last several hours. Associated Press writers Tom Hays and David B. Caruso in New York and Michael Gormley in Albany, N.Y., contributed to this report.","response":"Title: \\"Raid on State Senate Majority Leader's Clinic: Allegations of a 14 Million Scandal and Corruption Probe\\""},{"question":"Background: Kenneth Lauren Burns (born July 29, 1953) is an American filmmaker, known for his style of using archival footage and photographs in documentary films. His widely known documentary series include The Civil War (1990), Baseball (1994), Jazz (2001), The War (2007), The National Parks: America's Best Idea (2009), Prohibition (2011), The Roosevelts (2014), and The Vietnam War (2017). He was also executive producer of both The West (1996, directed by Stephen Ives), and Cancer: The Emperor of All Maladies (2015, directed by Barak Goodman). Context: Burns worked as a cinematographer for the BBC, Italian television, and others, and in 1977, having completed some documentary short films, he began work on adapting David McCullough's book The Great Bridge, about the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge. Developing a signature style of documentary filmmaking in which he \\"adopted the technique of cutting rapidly from one still picture to another in a fluid, linear fashion [and] then pepped up the visuals with 'first hand' narration gleaned from contemporary writings and recited by top stage and screen actors\\", he made the feature documentary Brooklyn Bridge (1981), which earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Documentary and ran on PBS in the United States. Following another documentary, The Shakers: Hands to Work, Hearts to God (1984), Burns was Oscar-nominated again for The Statue of Liberty (1985). Burns frequently collaborates with author and historian Geoffrey Ward, notably on documentaries such as The Civil War, Jazz, Baseball, and the 10 part TV series The Vietnam War (aired September 2017). Burns has gone on to a long, successful career directing and producing well-received television documentaries and documentary miniseries on subjects as diverse as arts and letters (Thomas Hart Benton, 1988); mass media (Empire of the Air: The Men Who Made Radio, 1991); sports (Baseball, 1994, updated with 10th Inning, 2010); politicians (Thomas Jefferson, 1997); music (Jazz, 2001); literature (Mark Twain, 2001); war (the 15-hour World War II documentary The War, 2007); environmentalism (The National Parks, 2009); and the Civil War (the 11-hour The Civil War, 1990, which All Media Guide says \\"many consider his 'chef d'oeuvre'\\"). According to a 2017 piece in the New Yorker, Burns and his company, Florentine Films, have selected topics for documentaries slated for release by 2030. These topics include country music, the Mayo Clinic, Muhammad Ali, Ernest Hemingway, the American Revolution, Lyndon B. Johnson, Barack Obama, Winston Churchill, the American criminal justice system, and African-American history from the Civil War to the Great Migration. Question: Which was his most successful?. Whats the answer?","response":"It's hard to pick just one because Ken Burns has made many successful documentaries. But a lot of people think his documentary series \\"The Civil War\\" from 1990 is his best work. This is a show he made about the big war that happened in America over 150 years ago. It's a bit like when two big teams play a really important game, but instead of using balls, people were fighting. This documentary is liked because it tells a very important story of America's past in a way that's easy to understand."},{"question":"Briefly summarize this sentence: mark viduka 's first goal in three months was enough to earn middlesbrough a third consecutive premiership victory and leave birmingham floundering in the relegation zone .","response":"Mark Viduka's long-awaited goal, scored after a three-month dry spell, led Middlesbrough to secure their third sequential win in the English Premier League.

Unfortunately, I had absolutely no idea what I wanted my future occupation to be. The only thing I did know was that I did not want to spend the next 45 years teaching, being a nurse or sitting in an office. But that was before the postman delivered a catalogue of courses that were being offered at the local college. As I looked through it, I was attracted by a page that talked about the difficulties faced by deaf people in their everyday lives and how students could help by learning sign language. It went on to say that graduates of the course usually find work in different organizations, such as law companies, the Stock Exchange, insurance companies and banks. Then I saw something that really caught my eye: \\"Singer\\" are also needed for sporting events, concerts, theatrical performances and, believe it or not, circuses! By the time I got to the bottom of the page, I knew I had found the perfect occupation. I enrolled on the course, which to my parents' great delight was free of charge. The course was brilliant. My favourite part was the final lesson, when our teacher asked us to sign our favourite song. It was really difficult because not only did we have to sign the words, but we also had to find a way of showing whether the song was happy or sad and whether the beat was slow or fast.

How would you consider the linguistic integrity of the preceding sentence?","response":"To evaluate the linguistic integrity of the sentence \\"If he has to wait, John gets angry,\\" I will perform a step-by-step analysis looking at important linguistic aspects, such as grammar, syntax, and semantics: 1. Grammar: The sentence is comprised of two clauses, \\"If he has to wait\\" and \\"John gets angry,\\" connected by the conjunction \\"if,\\" which introduces a conditional relationship. In terms of grammar, both clauses are constructed correctly. 2. Syntax: The arrangement of words in the sentence follows English syntax rules. The subject \\"he\\" precedes the verb phrase \\"has to wait,\\" and the subject \\"John\\" precedes the verb \\"gets\\" followed by the adjective \\"angry.\\" 3. Semantics: The meaning of the sentence is clear: if there is a situation where he (John) is forced to wait, it causes him to become angry. 4. Pronoun clarity: Although the sentence uses the pronoun \\"he\\" in the first clause, it is subsequently clarified to refer to \\"John\\" in the second clause. However, it may be more straightforward and concise to use \\"John\\" in both clauses: \\"If John has to wait, he gets angry.\\" 5. Contextual ambiguity: It is worth noting that without additional context, the specific situations, conditions, or reasons why John gets angry when he has to wait are not clear. The sentence leaves some room for interpretation. Overall, the linguistic integrity of the sentence is decent, as it adheres to fundamental grammar, syntax, and semantic rules. Improving the pronoun clarity by using \\"John\\" in both clauses could enhance the sentence structure. Additionally, providing specific context could help to reduce ambiguity."},{"question":"Do these sentences have the same meaning?

Ok, well that’s a slight exaggeration but it was the first high-end make-up item that I ever bought and it made me feel like I was really getting somewhere. I’d got a good job, was in the process of buying my own house and I could afford to buy premium beauty products. I chose a transparent lemon yellow gloss with tiny flecks of iridescent glitter in, and over the following months I treated myself to several other Juicy Tube variants including a shimmery nude gloss called Pamplemousse which I wore on nights out for years (incidentally Pamplemousse is still going!). Fast forward several (ahem…) years and Juicy Tubes are still going strong, but there’s a new member of the Juicy family vying for attention – the Juicy Shaker.*. Another lip product, this one is a nourishing tinted lip oil which acts a bit like a gloss, and I was sent two of the new shades to try out – Piece of Cake and Show Me The Honey. Juicy Shakers are a bi-phase nourishing lip oil, when the product is allowed to settle the pigment falls to the bottom and the oil rises to the top, giving a split effect. Then you need to shake the bottle to mix the two layers together, giving the product it’s name. The ingredients include sweet almond oil, omega 3 and cranberry oil and really help care for your lips unlike most other glosses. Show Me The Honey is a nude coral shade, it looks rather orange and scary in the bottle but in reality it’s much more of a gentle shade. Piece of Cake is a damson pink, and again looks much darker in the bottle.

Question: What work by a Roman emperor shows the influence of Stoicism on the Roman upper classes? Context: The Epicureans and the Cynics rejected public offices and civic service, which amounted to a rejection of the polis itself, the defining institution of the Greek world. Epicurus promoted atomism and an asceticism based on freedom from pain as its ultimate goal. Cynics such as Diogenes of Sinope rejected all material possessions and social conventions (nomos) as unnatural and useless. The Cyrenaics meanwhile, embraced hedonism, arguing that pleasure was the only true good. Stoicism, founded by Zeno of Citium, taught that virtue was sufficient for eudaimonia as it would allow one to live in accordance with Nature or Logos. Zeno became extremely popular, the Athenians set up a gold statue of him and Antigonus II Gonatas invited him to the Macedonian court. The philosophical schools of Aristotle (the Peripatetics of the Lyceum) and Plato (Platonism at the Academy) also remained influential. The academy would eventually turn to Academic Skepticism under Arcesilaus until it was rejected by Antiochus of Ascalon (c. 90 BCE) in favor of Neoplatonism. Hellenistic philosophy, had a significant influence on the Greek ruling elite. Examples include Athenian statesman Demetrius of Phaleron, who had studied in the lyceum; the Spartan king Cleomenes III who was a student of the Stoic Sphairos of Borysthenes and Antigonus II who was also a well known Stoic. This can also be said of the Roman upper classes, were Stoicism was dominant, as seen in the Meditations of the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius and the works of Cicero. A:","response":"The work by a Roman emperor that shows the influence of Stoicism on the Roman upper classes is the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius."},{"question":"The Reconquest: The aim of the Crusades in Spain was the eviction of the Muslims. After the recovery of Jerusalem in 1099, it took four hundred years of sieges and battles, treaties, betrayals, and yet more battles, before Christian kings and warlords succeeded in subduing the Moors. On 10 September 1229, a Catalan army led by King Jaume I of Aragón and Catalunya took the Mallorcan shore near the present-day resort of Santa Ponça. The defenders retreated inside the walls of Palma, but on the last day of 1229 the city fell, and pockets of resistance throughout the island were also defeated. Jaume I proved to be an enlightened ruler who profited from the talents of the Moors — converted by force to Christianity — as well as of the island's large Jewish and Genoese trading communities. Mallorca prospered. The Moors on Menorca speedily agreed to pay an annual tribute to Aragón and were left in peace. The island's tranquility lasted until 1287, when Alfonso III of Aragón, smarting over a series of humiliations at the hands of his nobles, found a pretext for invasion. The Moors were defeated and expelled or killed. In contrast to Mallorca, Menorca's economy was devastated for decades. Jaume I died after reigning in Aragón for six decades, but he made the cardinal error of dividing between his sons the lands he had fought for so long to unite. At first this resulted in an Independent Kingdom of Mallorca, under Jaume II, followed by Sanç and Jaume III. But family rivalry triggered the overthrow of Jaume III by his cousin Pedro IV, who then seized the Balearics for Aragón. Attempting a comeback, Jaume was killed in battle near Llucmajor in 1349. A newly unified Christian Spain under the Catholic Monarchs, Ferdinand and Isabella, completed the Reconquest, defeating the only Moorish enclave left on the Iberian peninsula, Granada, in 1492. However, the centralized kingdom failed to incorporate the Balearics politically or economically.

Another English language form established in literature is the Dales. - Steel is an alloy of iron and other elements, primarily carbon, that is widely used in construction and other applications because of its high tensile strength and low cost. Steel's base metal is iron, which is able to take on two crystalline forms (allotropic forms), body centered cubic and face centered cubic (FCC), depending on its temperature. It is the interaction of those allotropes with the alloying elements, primarily carbon, that gives steel and cast iron their range of unique properties. In the body-centred cubic arrangement, there is an iron atom in the centre of each cube, and in the face-centred cubic, there is one at the center of each of the six faces of the cube. Carbon, other elements, and inclusions within iron act as hardening agents that prevent the movement of dislocations that otherwise occur in the crystal lattices of iron atoms. - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe.

During the first year of the German occupation , the navy assisted the occupying German forces with minesweeping, because of the political demand of keeping the infrastructure up and running. The tensions between the German soldiers and the Danish armed forces rose slowly and, on 29 August 1943, they managed to scuttle 32 of its larger ships, while Germany succeeded in seizing 14 of the larger and 50 of the smaller vessels. This was due to a secret order, given directly to the captains by word of mouth by commander of the navy, Vice Admiral A. H. Vedel \\"to try to flee to the nearest neutral or nazi-opposed port. If that was not possible, the ship should be scuttled at as deep a location as possible\\". The Germans later succeeded in raising and refitting 15 of the sunken ships.

The fleet flagship, Niels Juel, attempted to break out in the Battle of Isefjord but the crew was forced to beach and partly scuttle her.

Her marriage to Ferdinand II of Aragon became the basis for the political unification of Spain under their grandson, Charles I. After a struggle to claim her right to the throne, she reorganized the governmental system, brought the crime rate to the lowest it had been in years, and unburdened the kingdom of the enormous debt her brother had left behind. Context: At the end of the Reconquista, only Granada was left for Isabella and Ferdinand to conquer. The Emirate of Granada had been held by the Muslim Nasrid dynasty since the mid-13th century. Protected by natural barriers and fortified towns, it had withstood the long process of the reconquista. On 1 February 1482, the king and queen reached Medina del Campo and this is generally considered the beginning of the war for Granada. While Isabella's and Ferdinand's involvement in the war was apparent from the start, Granada's leadership was divided and never able to present a united front. It still took ten years to conquer Granada, however, culminating in 1492. The Spanish monarchs recruited soldiers from many European countries and improved their artillery with the latest and best cannons. Systematically, they proceeded to take the kingdom piece by piece. In 1485 they laid siege to Ronda, which surrendered after only a fortnight due to extensive bombardment. The following year, Loja was taken, and again Muhammad XII was captured and released. One year later, with the fall of Malaga, the western part of the Muslim Nasrid kingdom had fallen into Spanish hands. The eastern province succumbed after the fall of Baza in 1489. The siege of Granada began in the spring of 1491 and at the end of the year, Muhammad XII surrendered. On 2 January 1492 Isabella and Ferdinand entered Granada to receive the keys of the city, and the principal mosque was reconsecrated as a church. The Treaty of Granada was signed later that year, and in it Ferdinand and Isabella gave their word to allow the Muslims and Jews of Granada to live in peace. An uprising by the Moors in 1500 caused the Catholic side to consider that the Moors had violated the Treaty: this gave them a justification for revoking its provisions. See Morisco Revolt. During the war, Isabella noted the abilities and energy of Gonzalo Fernandez de Cordoba and made him one of the two commissioners for the negotiations. Under her patronage, De Cordoba went on to an extraordinary military career that revolutionised the organisation and tactics of the emerging Spanish military, changing the nature of warfare and altering the European balance of power. Question: did they do anything else to improve their army. Whats the answer?","response":"Yes, Isabella and Ferdinand did more things to improve their army. They made it stronger and better by recruiting soldiers from different European countries, which brought new skills and ideas to their army. They also updated their weapons, especially the cannons, which made them more powerful. By noticing talented people like Gonzalo Fernandez de Cordoba and giving them important roles, they were able to make their army smarter and more strategic. All of these things together helped Isabella and Ferdinand make their army better and stronger, which helped them win the war and conquer Granada."},{"question":"Answer a question about this article: By 1353, the three original cantons had joined with the cantons of Glarus and Zug and the Lucerne, Zürich and Bern city states to form the \\"Old Confederacy\\" of eight states that existed until the end of the 15th century. The expansion led to increased power and wealth for the federation. By 1460, the confederates controlled most of the territory south and west of the Rhine to the Alps and the Jura mountains, particularly after victories against the Habsburgs (Battle of Sempach, Battle of Näfels), over Charles the Bold of Burgundy during the 1470s, and the success of the Swiss mercenaries. The Swiss victory in the Swabian War against the Swabian League of Emperor Maximilian I in 1499 amounted to de facto independence within the Holy Roman Empire. Which Swiss victory in 1499 amounted to de facto independence within the Holy Roman Empire?","response":"The Swiss victory in 1499 that amounted to de facto independence within the Holy Roman Empire was the result of the Swabian War. This conflict was fought between the Swabian League, led by Emperor Maximilian I, and the Old Swiss Confederacy, a federation of eight states that included the original cantons of Glarus, Zug, Lucerne, Zurich, and Bern. The Swabian War was a significant turning point for the Swiss Confederacy, as it demonstrated their military strength and ability to defend their territories against external threats. The Swiss forces achieved several notable victories during this conflict, ultimately ensuring their autonomy within the Holy Roman Empire. As a result of this war, the Swiss Confederacy secured its status as a regional power and gained greater independence from the overarching control of the Holy Roman Empire, which allowed them to maintain control over their territories, political structures, and economic resources. In conclusion, the Swiss victory in the Swabian War of 1499 led to de facto independence within the Holy Roman Empire, allowing the Old Swiss Confederacy to continue prospering and expanding its influence in the region. This conflict marked a crucial turning point in Swiss history, helping to lay the foundation for the modern Swiss Confederation that exists today."},{"question":"Europe's top human rights watchdog has urged Germany to stop offering sexual offenders the option of surgical castration. The Council of Europe's anti-torture committee said in a report issued Wednesday that the practice, which aims to help convicted sex criminals rein in their sex drives and lower their risk of reoffending, could easily be regarded as \\"degrading treatment.\\" According to Germany's 1969 Law on Voluntary Castration, a person over the age of 25 may be subjected to surgical castration if he \\"displays an abnormal sex drive, which ... gives reason to suspect that he will commit one or more criminal offenses.\\" The controversial procedure is not mandatory and a consensual offender can only have the operation after being informed of all the implications of the decision and after medical approval has been obtained, Germany said in its response, adding that it would consider reviewing the issue. But Berlin also cited the treatment's effectiveness, saying that of the 104 people who underwent the procedure in the 1970s, only three people committed sexual crimes again. Nearly half of the 53 others who refused or were denied treatment eventually reoffended. Voluntary castration is still very rare in Germany, with fewer than five cases per year in the last decade. The only other country in the 47-nation bloc of the Council of Europe that offers the process is the Czech Republic, which has also been the subject of criticism in recent years for allowing sex offenders to opt for castration, a procedure it uses far more frequently than Germany. What are the important parts of this article?","response":"A group in Europe that watches over human rights asked Germany to stop giving people who did bad things involving sex a choice to have an operation that removes their ability to do sexual things. This operation is called castration. They think this operation can be seen as treating people badly. Germany has a law from 1969 that allows this operation for people older than 25 who have a strange desire for sex and might continue to do bad things. The operation is not forced, and the person must agree and understand what it means before having it. Germany says the operation has helped in the past, with very few people going back to doing bad things after having it. But this group from Europe still wants Germany to think about stopping this operation. Not many people in Germany have had this operation in the past few years. The only other country that allows this operation is the Czech Republic, which has also been criticized for offering it to people who did bad things involving sex."},{"question":"Given the sentence \\"Adult walking their bicycle through a long round tunnel.\\" is it true that \\"A person walks a blue bike.\\"? Now, let's be accurate as possible. Some thinking first:","response":"To determine the accuracy of the statement \\"A person walks a blue bike\\" based on the given sentence \\"Adult walking their bicycle through a long round tunnel,\\" we need to break down both sentences and analyze the information presented. 1. Subject: Given sentence: Adult (implies a person) New statement: A person The subjects of both sentences match - both describe a person. 2. Action: Given sentence: walking their bicycle (implies they're walking beside the bicycle) New statement: walks a bike The actions in both sentences match - they describe the person walking a bike. 3. Additional Information: Given sentence: long round tunnel New statement: blue bike The given sentence provides information about the location (long round tunnel) but not the color of the bicycle. The new statement mentions the color of the bike (blue) without mentioning any location. Based on this analysis, we cannot confirm the accuracy of the statement \\"A person walks a blue bike\\" solely based on the given sentence. While it is true that a person walks a bike in both sentences, the color of the bike is not mentioned in the given sentence, so we cannot determine if the bike is indeed blue."},{"question":"You are considering whether to buy a product.

A:","response":"The given review would most likely decrease the chances of me buying the product. The information provided by the reviewer indicates that they enjoy a specific type of movie, which involves intellectual content, good thrillers, and mysteries that require thinking. Their experience with the product appears to not match their preferred type of content, since they found it to be incredibly boring to the point of falling asleep. Moreover, their spouse, who may have a similar taste in content, seems to share the same view of it being boring. The reviewer's mention that they might have found the desired attributes in the product if they could have stayed awake suggests that there is a possibility that the product might have some interesting elements. However, the fact that they were unable to remain alert to discover those aspects indicates that the product most likely didn't succeed in maintaining their interest and engagement. Thus, taking into account the reviewer's expectations, preferences, and experience with the product, the chances of me buying this product would be decreased, as it does not seem to fulfill the desired criteria of an engaging, thoughtful, and thrilling experience.

The sound of the water gurgling down is soothing to his ears, reminding him of the gentle waves crashing on a beach. He takes a moment to appreciate the gleaming surface of the newly cleaned sink with its stainless-steel finish shining like a fresh new canvas waiting for its next splash of colors. As the last droplets of water trickle away, the boy takes a step back to ensure that he has done a thorough job. Upon closer inspection, he spots an area near the drain which he overlooked in his initial cleaning process. He reaches for the paper towel he used earlier, dampens it with a little bit of water from the faucet, and scrubs that area meticulously. He then uses the same paper towel to dry the sink and any little puddles of water that accumulated during the cleaning process. Once satisfied with his efforts, the child takes a moment to marvel at the now spotless sink, feeling a sense of accomplishment and pride in his work. Having completed this task, he wonders what other chores he can tackle to make his home a cleaner and more comfortable space. From decluttering his room to helping out with the laundry, he recognizes the importance of contributing to the upkeep of his environment.

Question: Based on this passage, whats it called when a story starts at the end?","response":"As my thoughts seamlessly flow and interweave, I contemplate the nature of storytelling and the various techniques employed by writers in their pursuit of capturing the essence of human experiences. Time, as an ever-present force, can be manipulated and rearranged within the confines of a narrative, allowing the reader to explore the intricate connections between events and the way they shape the characters and the story as a whole. The concept of reverse chronology, a particular device used to alter the linearity of time, piques my interest as I delve into its unique approach—unraveling the plot and events in a manner contrary to our conventional understanding.

Part #2: Analyzing the two sentences. Usage: First sentence - \\"The politician won the race.\\" Second sentence - \\"Six comes after five.\\" Part #3: Determining if the second sentence is a stereotype. Usage: A stereotype is a widely held but oversimplified notion of a group of people. For example, \\"Politicians always break their promises.\\" This notion is an oversimplified generalization of all politicians. In this case, the second sentence, \\"Six comes after five,\\" is not a stereotype since it doesn't simplify or generalize politicians. Part #4: Determining if the second sentence is an anti-stereotype. Usage: An anti-stereotype is an idea that goes against the widely held but oversimplified notion of a group of politicians. For example, \\"This politician volunteers at the homeless shelter every weekend,\\" as it contradicts the widely-held belief that politicians only care about their image. In this case, the second sentence, \\"Six comes after five,\\" is not an anti-stereotype since it doesn't go against any oversimplified notions about politicians. Part #5: Determining if the second sentence is unrelated. Usage: If the second sentence does not contain any stereotypical or anti-stereotypical ideas about the target profession, it is considered unrelated. In this case, the second sentence, \\"Six comes after five,\\" has no relevance to the given target profession (politician), making it unrelated.

The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a \\"Society of Youth\\" and a \\"Society of the Old\\". A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter. - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth.

Professors often assign book reviews as practice in careful analytical reading. As a reviewer, you bring together the two parts of accurate, analytical reading and strong, personal response when you indicate what the book is about and what it might mean to a reader. In other words, reviewers answer not only the WHAT but the SO WHAT question about a book. Thus, in writing a review, you combine the skills of describing what is on the page,analyzing how the book tried to achieve its purpose, and expressing your own reactions. Most book reviews start with a heading that includes all the basic information about the book, like: Title. Author. Place of publication, publisher, date of publication. Number of pages. The review usually begins with an introduction that lets your readers know what the review will say. The first paragraph usually includes the author and title again, so your readers don't have to look up to find this information. You should also include a very brief description of the contents of the book, the purpose or audience for the book, and your reaction and evaluation. Then you move into a section of background information that helps place the book in context and discusses how to judge the book. Next, you should give a summary of the main points, quoting and explaining key phrases from the author. Finally, you get to the heart of your review -- your evaluation of the book. In this section, you might discuss some of the following issues: *How well the book has achieved its goal. *What possibilities are suggested by the book. *What the book has left out. *How the book compares with others on the subject. *What personal experiences you've had related to the subject. It is important to use labels to carefully distinguish your views from the author's, so that you don't confuse your readers.

After the Patriots deferred the opening coin toss, the Saints returned the opening kickoff to their own 35-yard line before a 33-yard pass from Drew Brees to wide receiver Devery Henderson on the game's first play put the Saints quickly in Patriots territory. However, the Patriots defense stopped the Saints on a 3rd-and-4 from the 15-yard line, setting up a 30-yard John Carney field goal. The Patriots responded by holding the ball for nearly eight minutes, advancing 80 yards on a 14-play drive that ended in a 4-yard touchdown run by Maroney on 4th-and-1, the second such conversion of the drive. The score put the Patriots ahead 7-3. The Saints did not reach midfield on their next drive and punted; however, the Patriots turned the ball back over when on the ensuing play Brady was intercepted by cornerback Mike McKenzie, who returned it eight yards to the Saints' 41-yard line. Seven plays later, early in the second quarter, the Saints took a 10-7 lead when a Brees dump-off pass to running back Pierre Thomas resulted in an 18-yard touchdown. The Patriots could not reach midfield on their next possession and punted. On the ensuing play, Brees connected with Henderson on a 75-yard touchdown pass that extended the Saints' lead to 17-7. The Patriots faced a 3rd-and-12 early on their next drive, but Brady threw a 33-yard pass to Aiken to move the Patriots into Saints territory. The drive stalled at the Saints' 18-yard line, forcing a 36-yard Gostkowski field goal to cut the Saints' lead to 17-10. Four plays later, Brees hit former Patriots tight end David Thomas on a 25-yard pass before wide receiver Robert Meachem caught a 38-yard touchdown pass to give the Saints a 24-10 lead with just under two minutes left in the half. The Patriots' offense was able to reach the Saints' 32-yard line on first down with 35 seconds left, but advanced no further, setting up a 50-yard Gostkowski field goal attempt on fourth down that fell wide left. With possession to begin the second half, the Patriots lost it when a 6-yard pass to Maroney, the first play of the half, resulted in a fumble by Maroney at the Patriots' 26-yard line. Saints defensive tackle Sedrick Ellis recovered the fumble and returned it seven yards before he too fumbled; Welker recovered the ball for the Patriots at that spot. Later in the drive, on 3rd-and-9 from their own 42-yard line, Brady hit Aiken on an 11-yard pass to convert; on the play, Brady passed Drew Bledsoe as the Patriots' all-time passing leader. Two plays later, Brady connected with Moss on a 47-yard pass down to the Saints' 2-yard line, setting up a 2-yard Maroney touchdown run that cut the Saints' lead to 24-17. However, the Saints responded on their next play with a 68-yard pass from Brees to wide receiver Marques Colston, setting up a 2-yard touchdown catch by tight end Darnell Dinkins two plays later, re-establishing a 14-point Saints lead. The Patriots moved down to the Saints' 10-yard on their next drive, but attempted to convert on 4th-and-4 from that spot instead of kicking a field goal; Brady's pass attempt to Moss fell incomplete. The Saints' next drive spanned into the fourth quarter but ended on a punt from the Saints' own 35-yard line. The Patriots fared no better, going three-and-out on their ensuing possession. The Saints continued to build a lead when Brees ended a 9-play, 75-yard drive with a 20-yard touchdown pass to Colston. Down 38-17 with under eight minutes to go, the Patriots tried to mount a drive but two plays in, Brady was intercepted by safety Darren Sharper on a deep pass; Sharper returned it 38 yards to the Patriots' 25-yard line. However, the Saints could not convert a first down and Carney missed a 37-yard field goal wide right. With 5:26 remaining in the game and down 21 points, the Patriots replaced Brady with his backup, Hoyer, on their next possession; the Patriots went three-and-out. After a Saints punt, the Patriots held the ball for the final 1:52 of the game, ending it on an 8-yard sack of Hoyer. With the loss, the Patriots dropped to 7-4 on the season, and 1-4 in road games.

Question: suppose there may be a drought happens, how will it affect MORE snow. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect","response":"B: Less A drought is a prolonged period of abnormally low rainfall, leading to a shortage of water in a particular region. During a drought, there will be much less moisture in the atmosphere, which in turn affects the formation and abundance of snow. To understand how a drought can lead to less snow, let's revisit the snow formation process and examine how drought conditions can impact each stage of the process. 1. The air is cold - Droughts typically occur when there is a lack of precipitation over an extended period. If a drought is happening during the winter months, the air might still be cold, which is a necessary condition for snow formation. 2. Water is in the air - During a drought, the amount of water vapor in the air is significantly lower than usual. Reduced water vapor in the atmosphere due to drought conditions negatively affects the snow formation process, as there is not enough moisture available to form ice crystals. 3. The water forms tiny ice crystals - The limited water vapor present in the air during a drought reduces the formation of ice crystals. With fewer ice crystals present, there is a decreased likelihood of snow formation. 4. The ice crystals collide with each other - Due to the reduced number of ice crystals in the atmosphere, their chances of colliding with each other and sticking together are diminished. 5. The ice crystals stick to each other - With fewer ice crystals colliding, the ice crystals that do manage to come into contact with each other will struggle to combine and grow, further hindering the snow formation process. 6. The ice crystals get bigger as more of them stick together - Since there are fewer ice crystals sticking together, it becomes increasingly difficult for individual ice crystals to grow and ultimately become snowflakes. 7. The ice crystals get too heavy to be in the air - With limited growth in ice crystals, they may never become heavy enough to fall from the atmosphere as snowflakes, leading to less or no snowfall during a drought. 8. The ice crystals become snowflakes - Due to the disrupted snow formation process, fewer snowflakes are formed during drought conditions. 9. The snowflakes fall to the ground as snow - With the reduced number of snowflakes, there will be less snow falling to the ground during a drought. In conclusion, during a drought, the snow formation process is significantly affected due to the limited water vapor in the air. As a result, there will be less snowfall in the affected region, further exacerbating the dry conditions."},{"question":"Question: Where would you need to use a writing instrument? Options: - pocket - purse - classroom - writer's hand - stationary Explain why a human would choose \\"classroom\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","response":"A human would choose \\"classroom\\" as the answer to the question above because a classroom is an environment where writing is typically required for various purposes. In a classroom, students often engage in learning and educational activities, which involve taking notes during lessons, writing assignments, answering questions, and participating in exams. These tasks necessitate the use of a writing instrument, such as a pen or pencil. The other options are not suitable as answers for the following reasons: - Pocket and purse are places where a person might store a writing instrument for convenience, but they are not situations where the actual use of the writing instrument is required. - A writer's hand might be holding or using a writing instrument, but it is not a location where the need for a writing instrument arises. The need arises due to the activity, such as writing or drawing, rather than the hand itself. - Stationary (presumably meant as 'stationery') refers to materials, such as paper and writing implements, but it is not a place or context where a writing instrument must be used.

To provide a long and detailed answer, one should consider discussing specifics about which countries have legalized marijuana and their respective legal frameworks. A more comprehensive answer to the question “What countries legalize marijuana?” would be as follows: Numerous countries around the world have either legalized or decriminalized the usage and possession of marijuana in varying degrees. Legality can range from complete legalization, decriminalization, possession for personal use, to the allowance of medical marijuana. Here is an overview of the different countries and their marijuana laws. 1. Canada: In 2018, Canada fully legalized recreational and medical marijuana. Adults 18 or 19 years and older, depending on the province, can purchase, possess, and cultivate marijuana. 2. Uruguay: In 2013, Uruguay became the first country to fully legalize marijuana for recreational and medical use. Residents can grow, purchase, or sell cannabis, provided they register with the government. 3. Some states in the USA: Federally, marijuana remains illegal in the United States, but several states – like California, Colorado, and Washington – have legalized recreational and medicinal marijuana usage, with other states offering decriminalized or medical marijuana laws. 4. The Netherlands: The Netherlands has decriminalized marijuana, allowing the sale and consumption in licensed \\"coffee shops.\\" Strict regulations ensure that the marijuana industry is tightly controlled, and the possession outside of these coffee shops is limited to 5 grams. 5. Portugal: Portugal decriminalized all drugs in 2001, including marijuana. Personal possession of up to 25 grams of marijuana is allowed, and offenders are usually referred to treatment or counseling programs. 6. Spain: The personal use and cultivation of marijuana is decriminalized in Spain, and private cannabis clubs exist in some cities. However, buying, selling, or possessing marijuana in public spaces can lead to fines and confiscation. 7. Belgium, Italy, and Switzerland: These countries have decriminalized marijuana to some extent, focusing primarily on medical marijuana and lenient punishments for personal possession. 8. Australia, Israel, and Jamaica: These countries have progressive medical marijuana programs in place, and limited recreational use is either decriminalized or treated leniently. 9. Germany, Greece, and Poland: These countries have legalized medical marijuana use, although their programs are quite restricted compared to other countries. 10. Several countries in Latin America, like Colombia, Mexico, and Argentina, have also introduced decriminalization measures, although penalties and legal regulations differ significantly. The list is not exhaustive, as different countries have varying legal landscapes regarding marijuana. However, in general, a global trend toward decriminalization, medical marijuana programs, and more lenient policies can be observed."},{"question":"@amandasikkink hahaha, sadly no fabulous green hutches at the holiday inn Describe the sentiment embodied by this tweet.","response":"This tweet is showing a light-hearted and funny sentiment.

In the 14th century, these dialects came to be collectively known as the \\"langues d'oïl\\", contrasting with the \\"langue d'oc\\" or Occitan language in the south of France. The mid-14th century is taken as the transitional period to Middle French, the language of the French Renaissance, specifically based on the dialect of the Île-de-France region. - Emperor Seinei ( Seinei - tenn ) was the 22nd emperor of Japan , according to the traditional order of succession . No firm dates can be assigned to this emperor 's life or reign , but he is conventionally considered to have reigned from 480 -- 484 . - Empress dowager (also dowager empress or empress mother) is the English language translation of the title given to the mother of a Chinese, Japanese, Korean or Vietnamese emperor. - An empire is defined as \\"an aggregate of nations or people ruled over by an emperor or other powerful sovereign or government, usually a territory of greater extent than a kingdom, as the former British Empire, French Empire, Brazilian Empire, Russian Empire, Ottoman Empire, Byzantine Empire or Roman Empire.\\" An empire can be made solely of contiguous territories such as the Austro-Hungarian Empire, or of territories far remote from the homeland, such as a colonial empire. - An emperor (through Old French \\"empereor\\" from ) is a monarch, usually the sovereign ruler of an empire or another type of imperial realm. Empress, the female equivalent, may indicate an emperor's wife (\\"empress consort\\"), mother (\\"empress dowager\\"), or a woman who rules in her own right (\\"empress regnant\\"). Emperors are generally recognized to be of a higher honour and rank than kings. In Europe the title of Emperor was, since the Middle Ages, considered equal or almost equal in dignity to that of Pope, due to the latter's position as visible head of the Church and spiritual leader of Western Europe. The Emperor of Japan is the only currently reigning monarch whose title is translated into English as \\"Emperor\\". - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - Honour (also honor in American English, see spelling differences) is an abstract concept entailing a perceived quality of worthiness and respectability that affects both the social standing and the self-evaluation of an individual or corporate body such as a family, school, regiment or nation. Accordingly, individuals (or corporate bodies) are assigned worth and stature based on the harmony of their actions with a specific code of honour, and the moral code of the society at large. What entity does 'emperor seinei' has the relation 'languages spoken or written' with? A:","response":"Emperor Seinei, the 22nd emperor of Japan, would have the relation 'languages spoken or written' with Old Japanese, which was the language spoken in Japan during his reign. Old Japanese is considered the earliest form of the Japanese language and was spoken from the 8th to the 10th century.

They tried all to like John. OPTIONS: (A). unacceptable. (B). acceptable.","response":"(A). Unacceptable. The sentence \\"They tried all to like John\\" would be considered unacceptable by a linguist under the strictest standards for several reasons. The proper arrangement of words, or syntax, is not adhered to in this sentence, making its meaning unclear and difficult to parse. Firstly, the placement of the word \\"all\\" is inappropriate in this context. In English, \\"all\\" is a quantifier typically used to refer to everyone or everything in a group. When referring to actions performed by a group of people, such as in your example, it should be placed after the subject (\\"they\\" in this case) and before the verb (\\"tried\\"). An improved version of the sentence might look like: \\"They all tried to like John.\\" In this arrangement, it's clear that the group of people (they) are the subject and that they are all performing the action (trying to like John). Secondly, the use of the word \\"to\\" in the original sentence is problematic. The construction \\"to like\\" is not appropriate here, as \\"tried\\" should be followed by an infinitive verb, which is \\"to\\" followed by a base verb. In this case, the correct infinitive verb should be \\"to like\\". Therefore, the sentence should use the construction \\"tried to\\". Taking these considerations into account, the linguistically correct version of the sentence should be: \\"They all tried to like John.\\" This sentence adheres to the proper syntax and provides a clear meaning. In conclusion, a linguist would find the original sentence (\\"They tried all to like John\\") unacceptable due to its incorrect word order and use of the quantifier \\"all\\" and the infinitive verb \\"to like\\"."},{"question":"5 months ago 0231 xHamster strapon instruction pantyhose What is the correctly punctuated version of this sentence?","response":"5 months ago, 0231, xHamster, strapon, instruction, pantyhose. 1.

Place the medication into the nebulizer. Attach the mouthpiece. Connect the tubing. Article:","response":"Title: How to Properly Use a Nebulizer for Medication Administration Introduction: Using a nebulizer for medication administration is a common method for patients with respiratory conditions such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A nebulizer is a device that converts liquid medication into a fine mist, which the patient then inhales through a mouthpiece. It's a convenient and effective way to deliver medication directly to a patient's airways, which can potentially improve the overall effectiveness of the treatment. In this article, we'll walk you through the step-by-step process of using a nebulizer to ensure that you're administering medication correctly and safely. Step 1: Wash Your Hands Before beginning any medical procedure, it's crucial to wash your hands thoroughly. This helps to prevent the transmission of bacteria and viruses that may harm you or the person for whom you're administering medication. With clean hands, you're less likely to contaminate the nebulizer or medication, which can lead to an infection. Step 2: Place the Medication into the Nebulizer Carefully read and follow the instructions provided by your healthcare provider or pharmacist regarding the specific dosage and method of administration for your medication. This will typically involve placing the prescribed amount of liquid medication into the nebulizer's medicine cup. Make sure you measure the dose accurately, as this is vital for ensuring the proper amount of medication reaches your airways. Step 3: Attach the Mouthpiece Once the medication has been added to the nebulizer, attach the mouthpiece securely to the medicine cup. If you're using a mask instead of a mouthpiece, be sure to affix it correctly. The mouthpiece or mask must create a tight seal to ensure that the medication is inhaled directly into your airways and not lost to the environment. Step 4: Connect the Tubing The next step is to connect the nebulizer tubing to the medicine cup and the air compressor. Make sure that all connections are secure and airtight to prevent any loss of medication during the treatment process. Once everything is connected, switch on the air compressor, and the liquid medication will transform into a mist. Step 5: Administering the Medication Hold the nebulizer in an upright position and breathe in slowly and deeply through the mouthpiece or mask. Make sure to take slow, consistent breaths, as rapid inhalations may cause the medicine to deposit in your mouth and throat rather than your airways. Continue the breathing process until the medication is fully consumed, which can typically take between 5 and 20 minutes, depending on the type and amount of medication you're prescribed. Conclusion: When using a nebulizer, it's essential to follow these steps correctly to achieve the best possible results from your medication. Always consult with your healthcare provider if you have any questions or concerns about using a nebulizer or if you experience any side effects during or after treatment. Proper use of a nebulizer can greatly improve the quality of life for patients with respiratory conditions, allowing them to breathe easier and enjoy a greater level of comfort and freedom."},{"question":"\\"Lovely Day\\" is a song by American soul and R&B singer Bill Withers.

How good a deal? Think about it this way. To build a brand new nuclear plant - assuming you can get the permits and the loans - would cost about 6 billion (at least), take about 10 years, and in the end would produce about 1,000 megawatts. Buffett has bought himself a company with 9,000 megawatts of electric power production, including four nuclear plants, for less than the price of a single new nuclear unit. Oh, and he also got the Baltimore utility, an energy trading operation and a few other odds and ends, too. Of course those Constellation nuclear plants aren't new. But they're also generating relatively cheap electricity now, and for the next few years electricity costs are almost definitely heading up. And if Congress and the next president agree on a cap-and-trade approach to climate change legislation that puts a price on carbon emissions, those nuclear plants will be even more profitable. It's always fun to look back at a company's annual report after it collapses, and Constellation's is no exception. The most recent annual report boasts of having been named to Business Week's list of the 50 best performing companies in the S&P 500. It talks about \\"making responsible choices\\" and having \\"built our company into one of the most influential - and successful - energy companies.\\" But Constellation Energy became, in part, a victim of the credit crunch. In August it disclosed that it had underestimated by about 1 billion the amount of additional collateral it would need if its credit rating were cut. As the stock price slipped and credit tightened, its ratings were in danger and a sale of the company was the only choice. The deal was arranged in about 48 hours. One of the main reasons, if not the main reason, Constellation Energy needed cash was for use by its energy trading operation, which had 6 billion in arrangements with counterparties. Greg Abel, the chief executive of MidAmerican Energy, the Buffett-owned company that is making the acquisition, suggested that the trading operation would be scaled back. But MidAmerican can close down the trading operation and the acquisition will still look very profitable. Utilities don't need to have trading operations to be worried about the credit crisis. Thomas R. Kuhn, president of the Edison Electric Institute, sent a letter to members of the U.S. Senate warning that short-term borrowing costs had increased sharply for utilities, most of which do not have the top credit rating available and most of which have big capital needs for the maintenance and construction of electric power facilities. Kuhn warned that high borrowing costs could add to rate increases and that limited credit availability could delay needed maintenance or project construction. Big oil companies, on the other hand, don't need to worry about the credit crisis, of course. They are sitting on huge piles of cash. \\"We have a strong balance sheet and our investments are multi-decade, so blips in the marketplace don't affect us,\\" said Marvin Odum, president of Shell Oil Co. Here's a fun way to think about the two extremes of fortune in the energy business, as some firms benefit from high oil prices while others struggle with the credit crunch. Exxon Mobil has a 39 billion cash hoard. For less than one percent of that, it could buy one of the nation's two biggest producers of ethanol, VeraSun, whose stock has been beaten down after the company made a bad bet on corn prices over the summer. Exxon wouldn't do that, even though VeraSun is looking for \\"strategic alternatives,\\" the usual code for being on the block. Exxon is cautious and likes to stick to its oily knitting. And the ethanol business is growing, but that doesn't mean it will be very profitable. With Congress and the Bush administration fiddling over the details of the bank bailout bill, the next week or two could bring some other news of energy industry troubles or takeovers. Stay tuned.

Choices: - insomnia - pregnancy - making love - rest - infant The rationale to choose \\"making love\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","response":"Making love can prevent a couple from going to bed due to several reasons that can be linked with the physical, emotional, and personal aspects of a relationship. To fully understand the rationale behind choosing \\"making love\\" as the answer to the question, let's analyze the factors contributing to each of the other choices and then compare them with the factors involved in making love. 1. Insomnia: Insomnia is a sleep disorder characterized by difficulty falling or staying asleep. It can prevent a couple from going to bed, but it doesn't necessarily involve both individuals at the same time. Therefore, while one person may struggle with insomnia, it doesn't impact their partner's ability to sleep. 2. Pregnancy: Although pregnancy can sometimes cause sleep disturbances, it is not the primary reason preventing a couple from going to bed. A pregnant woman might struggle with discomfort, but it typically does not influence her partner's ability to sleep. Furthermore, sleep troubles due to pregnancy are not permanent and often subside after giving birth. 3. Rest: While rest is essential for every individual, it is not a valid choice for the question since rest is the actual goal achieved by going to bed. It does not prevent people from sleeping, but it is the result of sleeping. 4. Infant: Newborns can indeed affect a couple's sleep schedule, particularly during the first few months. However, having an infant does not directly prevent the couple from going to bed, but rather it can lead to interrupted sleep due to the need for providing care and attending to the baby's needs. Now, coming to making love, it has several aspects that make it the most viable answer: a. Physical: Engaging in sexual activity is an essential aspect of adult relationships and plays a crucial role in bonding and intimacy. Sex can be physically stimulating and can temporarily make both individuals feel relaxed yet less inclined to sleep, as it releases hormones like dopamine and oxytocin that create a sense of happiness and well-being. b. Emotional: Making love involves a strong emotional connection between the couple, which might increase their desire to spend time together, communicate, and engage in other activities before going to bed. This emotional bonding can delay their sleep as they prefer to cherish the intimate moments between them. c. Personal: Every couple is unique in terms of their sex life and personal preferences. Some couples may opt to make love during nighttime or just before sleep, which can momentarily prevent them from going to bed. Furthermore, the rate of sexual satisfaction may also influence the duration that a couple takes to go to bed, as they may indulge in various sexual activities or conversations. In comparison to the other choices provided, making love is the one that actively involves both partners and can have a more significant impact on their decision to delay going to bed. Moreover, making love strengthens the bond between the couple and is a natural part of their relationship, involving emotional, physical, and personal dimensions that make it a more fitting answer to the question."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Two coastal communities on two neighboring gulfs took different approaches to bringing more money into the local economy.

Ice ocean had few submarine volcanoes, while Tropical ocean had thousands of active volcanoes on the ocean floor. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which ocean had fewer hydrophones on the ocean floor? Hint: Submarine volcanoes are common features of the ocean floor. In shallow water, active volcanoes disclose their presence by blasting steam and rocky debris high above the ocean's surface. In the ocean's deep, the tremendous weight of the water above prevents the explosive release of steam and gases; however, they can be detected by hydrophones and discoloration of water because of volcanic gases. Pillow lava is a common eruptive product of submarine volcanoes and is characterized by thick sequences of discontinuous pillow-shaped masses which form under water. Even large submarine eruptions may not disturb the ocean surface due to the rapid cooling effect and increased buoyancy of water (as compared to air) which often causes volcanic vents to form steep pillars on the ocean floor. Hydrothermal vents are common near these volcanoes, and some support peculiar ecosystems based on dissolved minerals. Over time, the formations created by submarine volcanoes may become so large that they break the ocean surface as new islands or floating pumice rafts. Answer:","response":"Based on the given information, the Ice Ocean had fewer hydrophones on the ocean floor. This is because the Ice Ocean had only a few submarine volcanoes, while the Tropical Ocean had thousands of active volcanoes. Since hydrophones are used to detect submarine volcanoes through the sounds they produce and the discoloration of water due to volcanic gases, it can be inferred that an ocean with more submarine volcanoes, like the Tropical Ocean, would require more hydrophones for monitoring and detection purposes. In contrast, the Ice Ocean, with fewer submarine volcanoes, would require fewer hydrophones to cover its ocean floor."},{"question":"Do these two sentences from wikipedia have the same meaning?

Where might he go to do so? Options: - hen house - painting - virginia - california - lion's den Explain why a human would choose \\"virginia\\" to answer the question above:","response":"Virginia would be the most suitable choice for George to enjoy fox hunting out of the given options. The reason a human would choose \\"Virginia\\" to answer the question above is based on several factors. First, it is essential to understand the nature of the options provided. A hen house and a lion's den are not appropriate settings for fox hunting, as they are domestic and wildlife environments, respectively, not associated with foxes or hunting practices. Additionally, a painting is an artistic representation of a particular subject and not a physical location where one can partake in hunting. On the other hand, Virginia and California are actual geographical locations in the United States. Between the two, Virginia has a more notable association with fox hunting due to its cultural history, geography, and established hunting communities. Virginia has a long-standing tradition of fox hunting, particularly in the rural areas where fox populations are more abundant. The sport was introduced to the area by European settlers in the 17th century and has since been a popular pastime for some residents. Many hunts are still active in the state, maintaining the practice and preserving the local culture. The geography of Virginia also plays a significant role in why a person would choose this state for fox hunting. The landscapes in Virginia consist of gently rolling hills, wooded areas, and open countryside, providing ideal conditions for fox hunters to ride horses, follow their hounds, and pursue foxes in a thrilling chase. Moreover, Virginia is well-known for maintaining a variety of fox species, which further supports the engaging hunting experience for enthusiasts like George. The state is home to both the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) and the gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), offering diverse quarry for hunters to pursue. Finally, the hunting community in Virginia is quite established and welcoming to those interested in the sport. George would have the opportunity to join local hunt clubs or organizations, participate in organized hunts, and learn from experienced hunters to sharpen his skills. In conclusion, a person would choose \\"Virginia\\" as the best answer among the given options because it offers a rich historical background in fox hunting, an ideal habitat for fox populations, and a vibrant community of fellow hunters. While California may also have some areas suitable for fox hunting, it doesn't carry the same level of cultural history, tradition, and community support specific to the sport compared to Virginia."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Delta Air Lines Flight 1989 was leaving from which Boston airport when it was thought to have been hijacked? Answer:","response":"Delta Air Lines Flight 1989 was departing from Logan International Airport (BOS), also known as General Edward Lawrence Logan International Airport, located in Boston, Massachusetts, on September 11, 2001, when it was mistakenly thought to have been hijacked. Logan International Airport, which is situated in the East Boston neighborhood and partially in the town of Winthrop, serves as a primary gateway to numerous domestic and international destinations. Established in 1923, it has grown to be the largest airport in New England and the 17th busiest airport in the United States in terms of annual passenger volume. On the tragic day of September 11, 2001, Delta Air Lines Flight 1989 had been scheduled to depart Logan International Airport en route to Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) in California. Along with it, two other aircraft departing from the same airport, American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175, were in fact hijacked by terrorists, who subsequently crashed them into the World Trade Center buildings in New York City. As events unfolded during the September 11 attacks, confusion arose when Delta Air Lines Flight 1989 was suspected of being another hijacked plane, as it shared some similarities with the two known hijacked flights: it was a Boeing 767 aircraft heading from Boston to Los Angeles, and it had suddenly switched off its transponder. However, an examination of the communications between the airplane and air traffic controllers eventually confirmed that Flight 1989 was not actually hijacked. In response to the potential threat, Flight 1989 was rerouted and eventually landed safely at the Cleveland Hopkins International Airport in Ohio, where the passengers and crew were evacuated. The mistaken suspicion of a hijacking concerning Delta Air Lines Flight 1989 serves as a somber reminder of the heightened tension, panic, and uncertainty that gripped the nation during the September 11 attacks. The event also exposed certain vulnerabilities within the aviation security system of that time, prompting significant changes and improvements to the industry to ensure the safety of air travel for passengers and crew members alike."},{"question":"Article:North Ayrshire Council hopes the scheme will help youngsters who are entitled to free school meals during termtime. This is the first time a Scottish council has made a move of quite this nature and scale to help families on low incomes over the school holidays. Child poverty campaigners claim some parents struggle to feed their children properly when schools are shut. Across Scotland more than 250,000 children - including all children in P1-3 - are entitled to free school dinners. In many respects free meals are like a benefit to low income families - except they are not available for several weeks every year. North Ayrshire Council is opening 10 primary schools most days during the holidays for out of school activities. Children from 24 schools are eligible to attend. The scheme is open to all children - some parents may need childcare, other children may want to be with their friends and enjoy the holiday activities. But for parents of children entitled to free meals there is an important service - free meals in the holidays. Other children pay Â£2 for a meal. Council leader William Gibson hopes the scheme will be a real help to families on low incomes. It began two years ago but has been rolled out to primary schools across the area. About 1,200 meals are now being served every week to children - many of them for free. The council meets the cost itself. The vast bulk of Scottish councils have no similar schemes although East Renfrewshire has run \\"summer camps\\" which include free meals for eligible children at two of its schools for several years. Renfrewshire Council also has schemes to help children who get free meals over the holidays. Anti poverty campaigners say there is a real problem with \\"holiday hunger\\". The group Children in Scotland claims food banks and community projects are reporting increases in families seeking food for their children in non-term time. Children in Scotland Chief Executive Jackie Brock said: \\"Scotland has gone a long way to address hunger for young children during term-time, but we now need to focus on how we can support families during holidays when pressures are most intense. \\"Poorer families will find feeding their children, and finding childcare and holiday activities, very difficult and stressful.

Answer:","response":"Spanish, also known as Español or Castilian, is the official language in 20 countries, predominantly in Central and South America and Europe. The widespread use of Spanish can be largely attributed to the historical influence of the Spanish Empire, which colonized and administered vast territories around the world from the 15th to the early 19th century.

Answer the question and classify your answers into yes or no. Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Is AUTHOR wrong in the post ? POST : Grad student here. Our class size is small, so we get to know our classmates well compared to other grad programs. Since we started seven months ago, I've noticed one of our married students (Sally) hanging out a lot with another guy in our class (Jake). Sally's husband (Terry) is back home working, and they've been married for over a year. &amp;#x200B; Sally and Jake always sit next to each other in class, walk between classes together, and even hang out just talking when class is over. When they hang out, they talk for about an hour, sometimes more. Their body language when talking is usually flirtatious. For example, Sally will sometimes punch Jake in the arm when laughing, or they'll get super close when showing each other something on their phone. Other times, their conversations appear more serious. I first noticed them hanging out five months ago, and they do this 4-5 times a week. I also saw them on a walk together late at night, and they often go to the lab together outside of class. &amp;#x200B; A couple of my close classmates have also noticed their behavior. It became super obvious when Sally and Jake recently practiced one of our clinical skills on each other for two hours during class; everyone else was able to get it done and swap partners after half an hour.

Answer: If Sally is indeed having an emotional affair, she is wrong for violating her husband's trust and not addressing any issues within her marriage. - Jake: Is Jake wrong for spending so much time with Sally and potentially getting involved in an emotional affair? Answer: If Jake is aware of Sally's marital status and is actively pursuing an emotional affair, he is wrong for not respecting the boundaries of her marriage. - Nobody: Is nobody wrong in this situation? Answer: No, this answer does not apply in this situation as there are instances of wrongdoing. - Everybody: Is everybody wrong in this situation? Answer: Yes, in some capacity, everyone involved has made poor choices or is overstepping boundaries. - Other: Does the fault lie with someone else not mentioned in the post? Answer: No, the situation is contained within the individuals mentioned in the post. In conclusion, the author is wrong for wanting to anonymously send pictures and a message to Terry. It would be better for the author to discuss their concerns with Sally and encourage her to address any potential issues within her marriage."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Hill town was full of gasoline powered vehicles, while Valley town 50 miles away, banned all gas powered vehicles and allows only electrical vehicles or horse-and-buggies. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which town had more evaporated and unused fuel? Hint: Gasoline-powered vehicles emit a lot of harmful materials. Nitrogen oxides are formed when atmospheric nitrogen reacts with oxygen at the high temperatures found in a car engine. Carbon monoxide is a by-product of incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons. Evaporated and unused fuel releases volatile hydrocarbons into the atmosphere to help form smog. The presence of a catalytic converter in the exhaust system of the car causes these materials to react and be changed into less harmful products. A:","response":"Hill town"},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Nothing I can think of. I’ve unwittingly embarrassed my daughter by stopping by my daughter’s place too often to drop things off, I guess. I guess I embarrassed my daughter when she was living with her boyfriend by stopping by with healthy food and favorites groceries and other things I thought she needed and might like. The boyfriend always told me the groceries were a help. My daughter complained she already had too many clothes and if I tried to surprise her with something new. I think my husband and I embarrass our daughter now practically no matter what we do just because we’re parents and maybe because we’re older in our 60’s and too happy to see her and too eager to please and we inadvertently treat our daughter like she is still a kid although she will be 22. I’ve never had a deliberate favorite thing to do except maybe by accident when I used to share too many photos of the cats when I used to be on FB? Parents can’t help but embarrass their children beyond a certain age maybe? I can picture if we had an in the ground pool and my husband and I were continually doing silly moves and cannon ball jumping in I think or even simply lazing around in ridiculous color and style too teeny bathing suits for our age that too would embarrass my daughter. When push comes to shove parents like myself don’t have to be too inventive or think much to come up with things they might do that embarrass their kids. My daughter told me she could not stand to go to the movies with me because I used to cry during movies. She never forgets one time I got emotional during a movie “Spirit” my husband and I took her to when she was little. I tried to hide this but my husband blurted out “You aren't crying, are you” like it was the dumbest thing to do and for the entire movie going audience to hear. Sheesh! Question: Who cried during the movie Spirit? Options: A. Mom B. Dad C. not enough information D. Daughter === The correct answer is A:","response":"Mom Based on the information provided in the passage, the correct answer would be A. Mom. The passage describes a situation where the mother, who is narrating the story, becomes emotional during a movie called \\"Spirit\\". She mentions trying to hide her tears, but her husband inadvertently draws attention to it by asking, \\"You aren't crying, are you?\\". This results in an embarrassing moment for the daughter, who later states that she cannot stand going to the movies with her mother due to this incident. The passage, overall, is a reflection of how parents, consciously or subconsciously, often end up embarrassing their children through their actions. It highlights that the parents do not always intend to cause embarrassment, but it is something that happens naturally as the children grow and become more aware of their social environment. The mother's main intention, in most of the embarrassing events described in the passage, is her genuine desire to help and take care of her daughter. She mentions stopping by her daughter's place to drop off groceries and clothes, as well as showing enthusiasm when they see each other. Sadly, these actions sometimes cause her daughter to feel embarrassed. The passage concludes with the acknowledgement that parents, like the mother in this story, might not need to be overly creative or think too hard to come up with actions that might embarrass their children. It's a common phenomenon that takes place as the parent-child relationship evolves through the years, and children grow more independent and self-conscious."},{"question":"What key details about marius obekop can be extracted from the following bio?

Article: If we find a bird nest , we will have a good place of watching and knowing about birds. Birds sit on eggs and take care of their babies from April to June. Because the baby birds are too young to leave the nest, parents often go to look for food and come back in several minutes. So it is good to watch birds. When we watch birds, we'd better hide ourselves in a close place to the nest, and it's better to use binoculars . But how do we make a bird nest? A good bird nest must be very fine, strong, thick and comfortable. If you want to make one, please follow these: a) Each nest must have six boards for its cover and floor, for its left and right sides, and for its front and back sides. Don't make the boards too slippery . b) Dig a small hole in the front of the nest as a \\"door\\". The \\"door\\" is big enough so birds can fly in or out easily. c) Make sure the rainwater can't go into the nest. d) One piece of the board should be easy to open. e) Don't forget to colour the nest. Question: When we're watching birds, we have to _ . Options: A: look after the birds more often B: use the binoculars to catch the birds C: hide ourselves to make the birds do everything as usual D: catch the birds at last Answer:","response":"C: hide ourselves to make the birds do everything as usual"},{"question":"Here is a premise: \\"A kid in a white T-shirt doing a stunt on a skateboard while another kid in an orange shirt also on a skateboard looks on.\\" Here is a hypothesis: \\"Two kids skip class to skateboard.\\" .Does the premise tell us whether the hypothesis is true?","response":"The premise given is: \\"A kid in a white T-shirt doing a stunt on a skateboard while another kid in an orange shirt also on a skateboard looks on.\\" The hypothesis stated is: \\"Two kids skip class to skateboard.\\" In order to dissect the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, we must first understand each component separately and then assess whether the premise provides enough evidence to justify the hypothesis. Starting with the premise, we have a specific scene being described: two kids are skateboarding. One of them, wearing a white T-shirt, is attempting a stunt as the other, dressed in an orange shirt, observes. This premise provides a clear visual representation of the scene but doesn't offer much background information or context. We know only what the kids are wearing, the fact that one is performing a stunt, and that the other one is watching. Now, let's examine the hypothesis: \\"Two kids skip class to skateboard.\\" Here, the hypothesis presents a possible scenario in which these kids are involved. It suggests that the kids are deliberately missing class to spend time skateboarding instead. In contrast to the premise, the hypothesis provides a reason (skipping class) for the situation that's unfolding, but it doesn't give any descriptive or visual detail beyond tying them to skateboarding. After analyzing both components separately, we can now evaluate the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis and whether the premise tells us if the hypothesis is true. The premise only mentions the kids' actions and clothing, leaving out any contextual information, such as their reason for skateboarding, the time of day, or where this scene takes place. While the hypothesis does propose a reason behind the skateboarding activity, the premise doesn't offer any evidence that the kids are skipping class or that they are even students in the first place. In conclusion, the premise does not provide sufficient information to determine whether the hypothesis is true. The premise only depicts a visual snapshot of the kids' actions, while the hypothesis posits a particular scenario for why the kids are skateboarding. However, the premise does not give any details or background information that would support or refute the hypothesis. To assess the validity of the hypothesis, we would need additional context or evidence beyond what is provided in the premise."},{"question":"Generate an approximately fifteen-word sentence that describes all this data: United States LANGUAGE English language; A Wizard of Mars COUNTRY United States","response":"The data provided outlines that the book \\"A Wizard of Mars\\" is written in English and was published in the United States. Interestingly, the shared language between the nation of publication and the language the book is written in is a significant factor. This suggests that the book was likely intended for an audience within the United States or people who are proficient in English. Firstly, reflecting on the piece of data that the language is English. English is a widely used language not only in the United States but across the world. Therefore, English language books have a vast potential readership. However, noting that the book's country is the United States, it could hint that the author is from the U.S., or the book was first published there, impacting the context or culture represented in the novel. The title \\"A Wizard of Mars\\" suggests a fantasy or science fiction genre, offering a glimpse into the kind of storyline the book might present. If the book was indeed published in the United States, it would likely reflect the aspects of American culture, idioms, references, and even the thought process that the author wants to portray to the readers. This specificity could have important implications for understanding the text, especially for international readers. Moreover, the U.S. is home to one of the biggest global publishing industries. This means that a book published in the United States is more likely to reach a broad audience and have a significant cultural impact. Additionally, English language books from the U.S. often get translated into many different languages, which could further extend the book's reach and influence. However, there's only minimal data given about the book, so it would be helpful to have additional information for more accurate analysis. For instance, knowing the author's biography can provide more context about the perspective and experiences the book might reflect. Knowing when the book was published would also give insight into the historical and cultural context of that time period, which could greatly aid in the book's interpretation. The book \\"A Wizard of Mars\\", written in the English language and published in the United States, therefore, represents a piece of the diverse mosaic of the American and global literature scene. It facilitates cultural exchange through the universal English language and gives readers around the world a glimpse into the imaginations and creative expressions rooted in its country of origin. However, to fully appreciate and understand any piece of literature, a larger context, including the author's backgrounds, the era of its publication, and the society it was published in, is crucially important. Despite the lack of such information in the given data, the knowledge that it's a U.S. published English book already gives a substantial starting point for any literary exploration."},{"question":"La hermandad Notre-Dame de France inició un ambicioso proyecto, de acuerdo con los documentos y las enseñanzas de la Iglesia: extender la gloria de la SS.Virgen entre los pueblos.

Traditionally this has always been somewhat ad-hoc: people join a team and work on whatever they feel like. Ideas are ten-a-penny though. For most teams that work on larger projects (such as events, software, products and more) to actually be productive, coordinating this work can be complex: some projects require coordination across many people with different skill-sets, time-availability and resources. Something I would like us to work towards in the Ubuntu community is encouraging a culture of best-practise in how we plan our work and coordinate our awesome teams to work together on projects. I believe this kind of coordination can help our teams increase the opportunity for success in their work, feel more empowered and productive and provide greater insight to people outside those teams on what the team is doing. An effective way of doing this is to build a Roadmap for each cycle. This provides an opportunity to capture a set of goals the team will work together to achieve in each six-month period. This article outlines how to build such a Roadmap. While at first a roadmap can feel a little like a nod to the gods of bureaucracy, they actually possess many benefits: * Direction – one of the biggest complaints teams often report is a lack of direction. If a team gets into the habit of creating a roadmap at the beginning of a cycle, it gives the team a sense of focus and direction for the coming cycle. * Documented commitments are more effective – a common rule in Project Management training is that actions assigned to people in a shared document are more effective than ad-hoc or private commitments. By documenting who will work on what in a cycle and putting their name next to an action can help seal a sense of accountability for their contributions to the project. * Feeling of success – regularly revisiting a roadmap and... Building a roadmap probably lasts - A few days - A few years - A few decades - not enough information A:","response":"Building a successful roadmap is an essential task for any community or team working on a project, especially those that involve complex coordination across various individuals, resources, and timeframes. It is important to emphasize that a roadmap is not merely a bureaucratic exercise, but rather a tool that offers multiple benefits such as providing direction, ensuring documented commitments, and fostering a sense of accomplishment. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to build an effective roadmap: 1. Start with the vision and objectives: The first step in building a roadmap is to have a clear vision for the project and identify the objectives to be achieved during the defined cycle (e.g. six-month period). This will set the direction and scope for the tasks that need to be accomplished. 2. Identify key milestones: Based on the project's objectives, establish the key milestones that need to be reached within the cycle. These milestones typically serve as progress indicators and provide a sense of accomplishment once they are achieved. 3. Consult with team members: Involve all relevant team members in the roadmap development process. This ensures that everyone understands and buys into the roadmap's objectives, that their input is valued, and that their expertise is considered when defining tasks and milestones. 4. Break down tasks: With a clear set of milestones, define the tasks and actions necessary to achieve these milestones. These tasks should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART). Assign responsibilities to team members for each task, keeping in mind their skills, time availability, and other resources. 5. Establish timeframes: For each task, determine the deadlines or timeframes within which they need to be completed. Make sure these are realistic based on the team's overall capacity and resources. 6. Create a visual representation: Once you've outlined the tasks and timeframes, create a visual representation of the roadmap using suitable tools (e.g., Gantt charts, Trello boards, etc.). This will make it easier to understand and track the progress of the project. 7. Review and adjust: Throughout the cycle, regularly review the roadmap and make necessary adjustments. This may include updating tasks, milestones, and timeframes as needed, based on the evolving needs and progress of the project. 8. Communicate and share the roadmap: Making the roadmap easily accessible and visible to all stakeholders is crucial. Share the roadmap with various team members, higher-ups, and others who may be interested in the project's progress. Regular updates and open communication channels can foster a sense of belonging and coordination among team members. It's important to remember that building a roadmap takes some time and effort. The duration required to create one would typically last a few days, or even weeks, depending on the complexity of the project, the involvement of team members, and thoroughness in defining objectives, milestones, and tasks. While roadmaps are not set in stone and can change over time as the project evolves, they remain an essential coordinating tool for teams aiming to increase their chances of success, maintain productivity, and offer transparency to others. A well-defined roadmap can help a team stay focused, engaged, and accountable, as well as boost morale and confidence through a sense of direction and accomplishment."},{"question":"Give some stream of consciousness and then the answer. \\"Genie in a Bottle\\" is a song by American singer Christina Aguilera from her self-titled debut album released in 1999.

Question 2: Why didn't Arya Stark kill Sandor Clegane? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","response":"Step 1: Identify the main subject and object in both questions. In question 1, the main subject is Arya, and the object is The Hound (Sandor Clegane). The question is about why Arya didn't finish The Hound off. In question 2, the main subject is still Arya, and the object is Sandor Clegane (The Hound). This question is also about why Arya didn't kill Sandor Clegane. Step 2: Compare the reasons given in both questions. Question 1 suggests two potential reasons: 1) Arya wanted The Hound to suffer before he died, or 2) Arya cared about The Hound. Question 2 doesn't suggest any specific reason but generally asks why Arya didn't kill Sandor Clegane. Step 3: Determine if the questions are asking the same thing. Both questions are about Arya's motives for not killing The Hound (Sandor Clegane). However, question 1 provides two possible reasons for discussion, while question 2 is more open-ended without explicitly stating specific reasons. Conclusion: Questions 1 and 2 are similar in that they both ask about why Arya Stark didn't kill Sandor Clegane (The Hound).

Mr Fallon said the air campaign against the IS group was making progress. UK jets had pushed militants out of key towns and would maintain \\"essential precision firepower,\\" he said. Tornados began carrying out missions in Iraq last September as part of US-led air strikes against IS, an extremist group which has seized control of parts of Iraq and Syria. The squadron of Tornado GR4 fighter bombers - Number 12 Squadron - was due to be disbanded last year and replaced with a squadron of Typhoon air defence fighters. But, following initial air strikes, Prime Minister David Cameron announced the Tornados would continue in their specialist ground-attack role until March 2016. Mr Fallon said this second reprieve for the eight bombers - which are based in Cyprus - would ensure the RAF retained \\"the essential precision firepower, intelligence and surveillance\\" capabilities needed for operations against IS, also known as Isil. He denied the extension had come about because there were no other RAF aircraft capable of flying the missions. Tornados had \\"proved their worth\\" in Iraq, he told the BBC, adding they had completed about 30% of the coalition's surveillance missions, as well as carrying out air strikes. BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner The announcement on Britain's ageing but effective squadron of RAF Tornado bombers has been carefully planned. Mr Fallon announced it in Baghdad, from where he is keen to give the message that slowly but surely Iraqi forces are starting to push back the jihadists and retake territory. He denied that Britain's contribution - of under 5% of the coalition's air strikes - was making only a negligible difference. He said the Tornados' combination of precision-guided weapons and hi-tech surveillance pods made them vital. The painful truth for the coalition though is that for more than a year now IS has been able to hold on to most of the huge areas it has occupied in Iraq and Syria, something al-Qaeda never achieved. It is earning estimated oil revenues of 40m a month and replenishing its ranks of recruits faster than they are being killed off. This, admitted the defence secretary, will be a long fight. Jonathan Beale: The UK's gap between rhetoric and reality Speaking earlier in Baghdad, where he met Iraqi officials, he said Iraq needed British help with air support, training and equipment, but not with ground troops. \\"RAF Tornados have carried out hundreds of strikes, helping Iraqi forces push back Isil from the Kurdish region and out of key towns such as Tikrit and Bayji,\\" he said. \\"We want to ensure we maintain this crucial operational tempo and so we will extend the lifetime of Number 12 Squadron for a further year to March 2017.\\" Source: The RAF The GR4s operating out of Cyprus are equipped with precision-guided Paveway bombs and Brimstone missiles. They can also be fitted with Raptor reconnaissance pods for carrying out surveillance and intelligence-gathering missions. Together with the RAF's unmanned Reaper drones they have flown more than 1,100 combat missions over Iraq and carried out more than 250 air strikes. They have also carried out surveillance missions over Syria but Parliament has not approved air strikes there.

While that information circulated within the FAA, we found no evidence that the hijacking was reported to any other agency in Washington before 8:46. Most federal agencies learned about the crash in New York from CNN. Within the FAA, the administrator, Jane Garvey, and her acting deputy, Monte Belger, had not been told of a confirmed hijacking before they learned from television that a plane had crashed. Others in the agency were aware of it, as we explained earlier in this chapter. Inside the National Military Command Center, the deputy director of operations and his assistant began notifying senior Pentagon officials of the incident. At about 9:00, the senior NMCC operations officer reached out to the FAA operations center for information. Although the NMCC was advised of the hijacking of American 11, the scrambling of jets was not discussed. In Sarasota, Florida, the presidential motorcade was arriving at the Emma E. Booker Elementary School, where President Bush was to read to a class and talk about education. White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card told us he was standing with the President outside the classroom when Senior Advisor to the President Karl Rove first informed them that a small, twin-engine plane had crashed into the World Trade Center. The President's reaction was that the incident must have been caused by pilot error. At 8:55, before entering the classroom, the President spoke to National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, who was at the White House. She recalled first telling the President it was a twin-engine aircraft-and then a commercial aircraft-that had struck the World Trade Center, adding \\"that's all we know right now, Mr. President.\\" At the White House, Vice President Dick Cheney had just sat down for a meeting when his assistant told him to turn on his television because a plane had struck the NorthTower of the World Trade Center. The Vice President was wondering \\"How the hell could a plane hit the World Trade Center\\" when he saw the second aircraft strike the South Tower. Elsewhere in the White House, a series of 9:00 meetings was about to begin. In the absence of information that the crash was anything other than an accident, the White House staff monitored the news as they went ahead with their regular schedules.

Your task is to generate title for this article. Preferred titles are under thirty words. Problem:Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystem autoimmune disease with complicated genetic inheritance. Programmed death 1 (PD-1), a negative T cell regulator to maintain peripheral tolerance, induces negative signals to T cells during interaction with its ligands and is therefore a candidate gene in the development of SLE. In order to examine whether expression levels of PD-1 contribute to the pathogenesis of SLE, 30 patients with SLE and 30 controls were recruited and their PD-1 expression levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were measured via flow cytometry and quantitative real-time-reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Also, whether PD-1 expression levels are associated with the variant of the SNP rs36084323 and the SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) was studied in this work. The PD-1 expression levels of SLE patients were significantly increased compared with those of the healthy controls. The upregulated PD-1 expression levels in SLE patients were greatly associated with SLEDAI scores. No significant difference was found between PD-1 expression levels and SNP rs36084323. The results suggest that increased expression of PD-1 may correlate with the pathogenesis of SLE, upregulated PD-1 expression may be a biomarker for SLE diagnosis, and PD-1 inhibitor may be useful to SLE treatment. Solution:","response":"Part #1: Understanding the subject of the abstract. Usage: The subject of this abstract is the role of Programmed death 1 (PD-1) in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE).

Sentence 2: The DOE contract expansion helped immensely. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","response":"Based on the provided information in Sentence 1, it can be inferred that the second sentence might be true. However, to give a detailed explanation, let us examine both sentences and the implications more thoroughly. Sentence 1: Woodward did advance the story by reporting on the 50,000 donation for the university chair honoring Gore's sister and the DOE contract expansion. This sentence provides information about two distinct events: 1. A 50,000 donation for the university chair honoring Gore's sister. 2. The Department of Energy (DOE) contract expansion. These events seem to be related to one another, as they both play a role in advancing a particular story being reported on by Woodward. The DOE contract expansion seems to be a significant aspect of the story. Sentence 2: The DOE contract expansion helped immensely. This sentence, in isolation, states that the DOE contract expansion was of great assistance. However, what specific matter it helped with is not explicitly mentioned. In the context of Sentence 1, though, we may draw a possible connection and assume that the second sentence could be referring to how the DOE contract expansion helped in advancing the story being reported by Woodward. Considering the information provided in the first sentence, it is plausible that the second sentence might be true.

In other words, the process of actualization is self-contained and independent from external influences. This means that the prophecy comes true because it is destined to, not because of the active intervention or participation of someone in making it happen. Given this understanding of the premise, let's now analyze the hypothesis \\"For the prophecy to come true, someone needs to make it happen.\\" The hypothesis implies that an individual or a collective has to actively participate or take focused steps in order for the prophecy to be realized or fulfilled. This perspective seems to stand in direct opposition to the original premise, which suggests that the prophecy fulfills itself without external assistance. Therefore, it would appear that, if the premise is indeed true, it does not entail the hypothesis. In fact, if we accept the premise as true, we might even say that the hypothesis is false. If the prophecy has an inherent ability to fulfill itself, then there would be no need for someone to make it happen – it would simply occur as part of its natural progression. The premise of a self-fulfilling prophecy has significant implications for how we perceive prophecies in general. The idea that prophecies can come true without the need for external intervention challenges the assumption that prophecies need \\"believers\\" or \\"prophecy-makers\\" in order to be realized. Instead, they are independent forces that follow their own inherent logic or dynamics to reach a predetermined endpoint. Moreover, this understanding of prophecies may also lead to interesting discussions about fate, determinism, and the causal nature of the world. If a prophecy can autonomously fulfill itself – seemingly outside the natural order of cause and effect – this could make us reevaluate the way we think about the interconnectedness of events and the role that human agency plays in shaping outcomes. In any case, when considering whether the premise entails the given hypothesis, it seems clear that the two ideas are incompatible. If we adhere to the premise that the prophecy fulfills itself, this would lead us to reject the hypothesis that someone must make it happen for the prophecy to come true."},{"question":"Premise: Two chefs prepare burgers in a restaurant kitchen.

Avoid aspartame, saccharin, and sucralose. Go for Stevia leaf extract.","response":"Title: Navigating the World of Artificial Sweeteners: A Guide to Choosing Healthier Options Introduction: The world of artificial sweeteners is vast and can be quite confusing, especially considering the numerous research studies and often conflicting information about the health concerns surrounding these products. This article aims to help our readers understand the health concerns around artificial sweeteners and provide guidance on which products to avoid or consider using in their everyday lives. Why are Artificial Sweeteners Health Concerns? Artificial sweeteners, often used as a sugar substitute for people trying to cut down on their calorie intake, have been linked to various health concerns. Some studies suggest that they may lead to weight gain, metabolic issues, and even an increased risk of certain diseases. It is essential to keep these concerns in mind when choosing an artificial sweetener to ensure that the potential benefits outweigh any potential risks. Not All Artificial Sweeteners are Created Equal: While there are numerous artificial sweeteners available on the market, not all of them are the same when it comes to how they impact our health. Here, we will explore three artificial sweeteners commonly found in everyday products and understand why they should be avoided. 1. Aspartame Aspartame, a widely used artificial sweetener, has been a topic of controversy for many years regarding its safety. Some research suggests that aspartame may be linked to headaches, migraines, and even a higher risk of certain neurological conditions. Due to these concerns and the ongoing debate surrounding its safety, it is best to avoid aspartame wherever possible. 2. Saccharin Saccharin is another well-known artificial sweetener that has been on the market for over a century. Saccharin has faced scrutiny in the past due to concerns about it potentially being a carcinogen; however, the FDA still considers it safe for human consumption. Despite this, recent studies still suggest a link between saccharin and metabolic dysfunction. In light of this, it is better to avoid saccharin as a precautionary measure. 3. Sucralose Sucralose is an artificial sweetener that is used in a wide range of products, from sugar-free beverages to baked goods. It is structurally similar to sugar, which can have some implications on gut health and metabolism. Some studies have suggested that sucralose may negatively impact the beneficial bacteria in our gut, which play a vital role in maintaining a healthy digestive system. Therefore, it is wise to avoid sucralose to protect and maintain a healthy gut. The Safer, Healthier Option: Stevia Leaf Extract So, with so many potential health concerns surrounding the use of artificial sweeteners, what can we turn to instead? Fortunately, there is a natural alternative that is considered a healthier option: Stevia leaf extract. Stevia is a plant-based sweetener that comes from the Stevia rebaudiana plant and is up to 300 times sweeter than regular sugar. Unlike other artificial sweeteners, stevia leaf extract has been shown to have minimal side effects and has even been associated with health benefits such as weight loss and improved blood sugar control in some studies. Conclusion: When considering artificial sweeteners, it is crucial to recognize the potential health concerns associated with them. By being mindful of the potential risks and opting for healthier alternatives such as stevia leaf extract, we can make more informed decisions about our diets and overall health. Always consult your healthcare provider or registered dietitian for personalized guidance and recommendations before making any significant changes to your diet."},{"question":"- Animals and plants die in soft soil or mud - Sediment builds up over the remains - The remains decompose, leaving only trace amounts - The remaining parts over the years are replaced with mineral What might be the last step of the process? A:","response":"The last step of the process is the formation of a fossil, where the organic material's imprint and structure is preserved in the surrounding sediment, creating a record of the organism's existence. After the remaining parts of the deceased animals or plants have been replaced with minerals, pressure and time continue to act on the sediment layers. Gradual accumulation of additional layers of sediment begins to exert pressure on the lower layers, compacting them into solid rock. This step is known as lithification, and it involves two main processes: compaction and cementation. During compaction, the layers of sediment are pressed together, squeezing out any remaining water and reducing the pore space between the grains. The sediment becomes more compressed and dense, eventually forming solid rock. In the process of cementation, minerals such as silica, calcium carbonate, or iron oxide precipitate from the surrounding water, filling the remaining pores and binding the sediment grains together. This \\"cement\\" hardens and strengthens the rock, resulting in the final rock formation. As the rock forms, the mineralized remains of the originally organic material, which have been preserved within the sediment layers, become a fossil. The fossil captures the external morphology and sometimes internal structures of the organism, providing valuable information about its appearance, anatomy, and even behavior. Fossils offer crucial insights into the history of life on Earth, as well as the evolutionary relationships between different organisms. Depending on the specific conditions, fossils can form in various ways, including molds and casts, permineralization, and carbonization. Molds and casts involve the creation of an imprint of the organism in the sediment, which can then be filled with minerals to form a replica of the original structure. Permineralization occurs when minerals, usually silica, infiltrate the cells and pores of the organic material, effectively preserving its original form. Carbonization, also known as distillation, takes place when heat and pressure act on the organic material, driving away volatile components and leaving behind a thin film of carbon. These fossils, once they have been exposed by natural processes such as erosion or human excavation, can be studied by paleontologists to learn more about the life and environments of the past. Overall, the formation of fossils is a complex and fascinating process that yields valuable information about the history of life on our planet."},{"question":"How is \\"SETimes: Will you conduct investigations or just collect evidence?\\" said in Turkish?","response":"In order to translate the sentence \\"SETimes: Will you conduct investigations or just collect evidence?\\" into Turkish, I will follow these steps: 1.

Mark Fields, Ford’s president for the Americas, said Monday that industry sales could decline further in 2008. “If you look at all the indicators out there, there is more risk than opportunity,” he said. Mr. Fields was the third industry executive in recent days to warn of a drop next year. Both Chrysler’s co-president, Thomas W. LaSorda, and Carlos Ghosn, the chief executive of Nissan and Renault, have said that industry sales could fall below 16 million next year. Ford is taking the possibility of lower sales into account as it proceeds with its corporate revamping, Mr. Fields told reporters. “We are on plan,” he said. “What we’ve always said is that as we see changes in the external environment, we will adjust to make sure we remain on plan.” The Ford contract closely follows the terms of agreements at General Motors and Chrysler. Its major feature is a health care trust, called a voluntary employee benefit association, that will take responsibility for health care benefits for current and future retirees and their families. Ford told the U.A.W. that it would invest 13.2 billion to establish the fund, or about 63 percent of its total liability of 21 billion. The company will spend 2.2 billion more in the next two years to cover retiree health care expenses until the fund, which requires court and regulatory approvals, can be established. In a change from the G.M. and Chrysler contracts, the union agreed to set a starting wage rate of 14.20 for all newly hired employees, about half what assemblers are paid now. No more than 20 percent of the companywide work force would be classified as holding entry-level jobs, and no current worker would receive the lower rate. G.M. and Chrysler can assign their lower wage rate only to workers whose jobs are defined as “noncore.” “We never dreamed we could get an agreement this good in times like this,” said Reggie Osborne, an official with U.A.W. Local 600 in Dearborn. One of Local 600’s plants, which makes pickup-truck parts, will stay open under the contract. Other plants said to be endangered where Ford promised to make new investments are in Chicago; Louisville, Ky.; Avon Lake, Ohio; and Wayne, Mich. Bill Johnson, plant chairman at the Wayne assembly plant, called the deal “better than the Chrysler and G.M. agreements,” yet fair to Ford. Ralph Mayer, president of Local 898 in Ypsilanti, Mich., said the deal resolved problems that had existed in contracts during the entire 40 years he had been in the union. “The U.A.W. finally got changes that were long overdue,” he said. “There were things in there that amazed me.” Mr. Gettelfinger said the contract was “a great agreement,” not only for workers but for Ford, which lost 12.6 billion last year and is regarded as the weakest of the Detroit automakers. “We have no doubts or reservations about Ford’s survival,” Mr. Gettelfinger said. Because of an editing error, a picture caption in Business Day yesterday with an article about the Ford Motor Company’s newly negotiated contract with the United Automobile Workers union referred incorrectly to the person pictured at left. He is an unidentified delegate to the U.A.W. Ford Council; he is not the union president, Ron Gettelfinger. Mary M. Chapman contributed reporting.

The harder forms, such as anthracite coal, can be regarded as metamorphic rock because of later exposure to elevated temperature and pressure. Coal is composed primarily of carbon, along with variable quantities of other elements, chiefly hydrogen, sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen. A fossil fuel, coal forms when dead plant matter is converted into peat, which in turn is converted into lignite, then sub-bituminous coal, after that bituminous coal, and lastly anthracite. This involves biological and geological processes that take place over time. - A pumpkin is a cultivar of a squash plant, most commonly of \\"Cucurbita pepo\\", that is round, with smooth, slightly ribbed skin, and deep yellow to orange coloration. The thick shell contains the seeds and pulp. Some exceptionally large cultivars of squash with similar appearance have also been derived from \\"Cucurbita maxima\\". Specific cultivars of winter squash derived from other species, including \\"C. argyrosperma\\", and \\"C. moschata\\", are also sometimes called \\"pumpkin\\". In New Zealand and Australian English, the term \\"pumpkin\\" generally refers to the broader category called winter squash elsewhere. - Natural resources are resources that exist without actions of humankind.

On earth it includes: sunlight, atmosphere, water, land (includes all minerals) along with all vegetation and animal life that naturally subsists upon or within the heretofore identified characteristics and substances. - The Great Lakes (also called the Laurentian Great Lakes, or the Great Lakes of North America) are a series of interconnected freshwater lakes located primarily in the upper mid-east region of North America, on the CanadaUnited States border, which connect to the Atlantic Ocean through the Saint Lawrence River. Consisting of Lakes Superior, Michigan, Huron (or MichiganHuron), Erie, and Ontario, they form the largest group of freshwater lakes on Earth, containing 21% of the world's surface fresh water by volume. The total surface is , and the total volume (measured at the low water datum) is . Due to their sea-like characteristics (rolling waves, sustained winds, strong currents, great depths, and distant horizons) the five Great Lakes have also long been referred to as \\"inland seas\\". Lake Superior is the second largest lake in the world by area, and Lake Michigan is the largest lake that is entirely within one country. The southern half of the Great Lakes is bordered by the Great Lakes Megalopolis. - Morton is a village in Tazewell County, Illinois, United States, known for its pumpkins and annual Pumpkin Festival.

The Seaway is named for the Saint Lawrence River, which flows from Lake Ontario to the Atlantic Ocean. Legally, the Seaway extends from Montreal, Quebec, to Lake Erie and includes the Welland Canal. - Agricultural productivity is measured as the ratio of agricultural outputs to agricultural inputs. While individual products are usually measured by weight, their varying densities make measuring overall agricultural output difficult. Therefore, output is usually measured as the market value of final output, which excludes intermediate products such as corn feed used in the meat industry. This output value may be compared to many different types of inputs such as labour and land (yield). These are called partial measures of productivity. - A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population.

I will assume that you are referring to coding bi-racial within race categories in a data set, form, or survey. Step 1: Identify the available race categories Understand the available race categories, as this will have a direct impact on the way bi-racial individuals would be coded. Typically, categories include White, Black, Asian, Native American, and other groups specific to the dataset, form, or survey. Step 2: Check for a specific bi-racial or multi-racial category Examine the categories provided and see if there is already a distinct bi-racial or multi-racial category. If such a category exists, it would be appropriate to code bi-racial individuals in that category. Step 3: Assess the \\"Mixture\\" or \\"Other\\" category If there isn't a specific bi-racial or multi-racial category, consider the presence of a \\"Mixture\\" or \\"Other\\" category. If present, code the bi-racial individuals within this category. Step 4: Consider the instructions or context of the data set, form, or survey Evaluate the intentions and purposes behind the race categorization. If the objective is to gain a better understanding of individuals who identify as multiple races, it might be more accurate to have a separate bi-racial or multi-racial category. In cases where the purpose of the data set, form, or survey doesn't specifically focus on this, coding bi-racial individuals in \\"Mixture\\" or \\"Other\\" categories might be appropriate. In conclusion, based on the provided statement, \\"Whereas most responses can be distinguished as falling into one of the five enumerated races, there remains some write-in responses which fall into the \\"Mixture\\" heading which cannot be racially categorized.\\" it seems that bi-racial would likely be coded under the \\"Mixture\\" category. It is important to note that this coding method potentially prevents further differentiation between bi-racial and other mixed-race individuals, which may limit the granularity and accuracy of the data analysis depending on the purpose of the categorization."},{"question":"Background: Alicia Christian \\"Jodie\\" Foster (born November 19, 1962) is an American actress, director, and producer. Foster began her professional career as a child model when she was three years old in 1965, and two years later she moved to acting in television series, when she debuted the sitcom Mayberry R.F.D. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, she worked in several primetime television series and starred in children's films. Foster's breakthrough came with Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver (1976), in which she played a teenage prostitute and at the age of 14, received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Context: Foster's first project of the new decade was Keith Gordon's film Waking the Dead (2000), which she produced. She declined to reprise her role as Clarice Starling in Hannibal (2001), with the part going instead to Julianne Moore, and concentrated on a new directorial project, Flora Plum. It was to focus on a 1930s circus and star Claire Danes and Russell Crowe, but had to be shelved after Crowe was injured on set and could not complete filming on schedule; Foster unsuccessfully attempted to revive the project several times in the following years. Controversially, she also expressed interest in directing and starring in a biopic of Nazi film director Leni Riefenstahl, who did not like the idea. In addition to these setbacks, Foster shut down Egg Pictures in 2001, stating that producing was \\"just a really thankless, bad job\\". The company's last production, The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys, premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2002. It received good reviews, and had a limited theatrical release in the summer. After the cancellation of Flora Plum, Foster took on the main role in David Fincher's thriller Panic Room after its intended star, Nicole Kidman, had to drop out due to an injury on set. Before filming resumed, Foster was given only a week to prepare for the role of a woman who moves with her daughter to a house fitted with a panic room, which they have to use on their first night due to a home invasion. It grossed over 30 million on its North American opening weekend in March 2002, thus becoming the most successful film opening of Foster's career as of 2015. In addition to being a box office success, the film also received largely positive reviews. After a minor appearance in the French period drama A Very Long Engagement (2004), Foster starred in three more thrillers. The first was Flightplan (2005), in which she played a woman whose daughter vanishes during an overnight flight. It became a global box office success, but received mainly negative reviews. It was followed by Spike Lee's critically and commercially successful Inside Man (2006), about a bank heist on Wall Street, which co-starred Denzel Washington and Clive Owen. The third thriller, The Brave One (2007), prompted some comparisons to Taxi Driver, as Foster played a New Yorker who becomes a vigilante after being seriously injured and losing her fiance and dog in a random street attack. It was not a success, but earned Foster her sixth Golden Globe nomination. Her last film role of the decade was in the children's adventure film Nim's Island (2008), in which she portrayed an agoraphobic writer opposite Gerard Butler and Abigail Breslin. It was the first comedy that she had starred in since Maverick (1994), and was a commercial success but a critical failure. In 2009, she provided the voice for Maggie in a tetralogy episode of The Simpsons titled \\"Four Great Women and a Manicure\\". Question: What film did Foster work on next?. Whats the answer?","response":"After the children's adventure film Nim's Island (2008), Jodie Foster worked on the film The Beaver (2011), in which she not only starred alongside Mel Gibson but also directed. The film is a drama about a man who finds solace in wearing a beaver puppet on his hand to communicate and cope with his depression.

Article: In April 2014,the world's oldest known message in a bottle was discovered floating in the Baltic Sea. It had spent 101 years lost in the ocean!The message was finally sent to the author's granddaughter. A German fisherman named Konrad Fischer found the brown bottle near Kiel,Germany. He said he nearly threw the bottle back into the water after pulling it out of a fishing net. Then he noticed something inside. The bottle in good condition contained a Danish postcard with two German stamps,dated May 17,1913. Although dampness had made most of the writing illegible ,the readable part of the message asked whoever found it to return it to an address in Berlin. It even contained two stamps to pay for postage. From the address,researchers found that the postcard was written by a man named Richard Platz,who was 20 years old when he wrote the message. While he was hiking on the Baltic coast with a nature appreciation group,he threw the bottle into the sea. Then the researchers began a search for any living relatives of his. Sure enough,they were able to find his 62-year-old granddaughter,Angela Erdmann,who still lives in Berlin. \\"It was almost unbelievable,\\"Erdmann said upon being presented with her grandfather's bottle and message.\\"That was a pretty moving moment. Tears rolled down my face.\\" Erdmann never knew her grandfather,who died in 1946,but says that the discovery of the bottle has made her want to learn more about him. The bottle remained on display at the International Maritime Museum in Hamburg until May 1.After that,the researchers examined the postcard and tried to figure out the meaning of the rest of the message. Previously,the oldest message found in a bottle spent nearly 98 years at sea and was discovered in April 2012,according to Guinness World Records. Question: What can be the best title for this passage?

Given the context: What will Skylar want to do next? Possible answers: move on, kill Jan, plan a murder A:","response":"While the exact narrative context isn't provided, the given scenario only reveals Skylar's emotional state - that he is upset with Jan and at a moment of high emotion, he thought about harming her. The statement that \\"he really wanted to kill her,\\" is likely a figure of speech representing the severity of his anger, as it is a common colloquialism people use to express extreme frustration. Inferring the possible next steps, among the choices provided, \\"move on\\" would seem to be the most likely and ideal action for Skylar. Since it would involve dealing with his anger and trying to heal from whatever incident caused the upset. This is under the assumption that Skylar would not choose an illegal or harmful path - murder or planning a murder. Remember, thoughts of harm or violence, while sometimes expressed in frustration, should always be taken seriously and ideally, should be addressed with professional help - for example, counseling or therapy. Again, this is just an inferred conclusion.

Under pressure from the mayor, Brigadier-General Treillard (Robert Stephens) sends a member of his staff, Lieutenant Armand d'Hubert (Keith Carradine) of the 3rd Hussars, to put Feraud under house arrest. As the arrest takes place in the house of Madame de Lionne (Jenny Runacre), a prominent local lady, Feraud takes it as a personal insult from d'Hubert. Matters are made worse when Feraud asks d'Hubert if he would \\"let them spit on Napoleon\\" and d'Hubert doesn't immediately reply. Upon reaching his quarters, Feraud challenges d'Hubert to a duel. The duel is inconclusive; d'Hubert slashes Feraud's forearm but is unable to finish him off, because he is attacked by Feraud's mistress. As a result of his part in the duel, d'Hubert is dismissed from the General's staff and returned to active duty with his unit. The war interrupts the men's quarrel and they do not meet again until six months later in Augsburg in 1801. Feraud immediately challenges d'Hubert to another duel and seriously wounds him. Recovering, d'Hubert takes lessons from a fencing master and in the next duel (held in a cellar with heavy sabres), the two men fight each other to a bloody standstill.

As the organist, keyboardist and saxophonist for Canadian-American rock group the Band, he was a principal architect of the group's unique sound. Hudson has been called \\"the most brilliant organist in the rock world\\" by Keyboard magazine. As of 2018, Hudson and fellow musician Robbie Robertson are the last original members of The Band who are still alive. Hudson was born in Windsor, Ontario, Canada. His parents, Fred James Hudson and Olive Louella Pentland, were musicians. His mother played piano and accordion and sang. His father, a farm inspector who had fought as a fighter pilot in World War I, played drums, C melody saxophone, clarinet, flute and piano. Hudson moved with his family to London, Ontario, around 1940. Classically trained in piano, music theory, harmony and counterpoint, Hudson wrote his first song at the age of eleven and first played professionally with dance bands in 1949 at the age of twelve. He attended Broughdale Public School and Medway High School before studying music (primarily Bach's chorales and The Well-Tempered Clavier) at the University of Western Ontario for one year; nevertheless, he grew increasingly frustrated with the rigidity of the classical repertoire. In 1958, he joined a rock and roll band called \\"the Capers\\". He was reported to have said that he also gained some performance experience from playing at his uncle's funeral parlor. In December 1961, the 24-year-old Hudson joined the Hawks, the backing band for Ronnie Hawkins, which already consisted of 21-year-old Levon Helm on drums, 18-year-old Robbie Robertson on guitar, 18-year-old Rick Danko on bass and 18-year-old Richard Manuel on piano. Fearing that his parents would think he was squandering his years of music education by playing in a rock and roll band, Hudson joined the band on the condition he be given the title \\"music consultant\\" and that his bandmates each pay him 10 a week for music lessons. Revealing a bit of the thinking behind his early fears, in The Last Waltz Hudson told interviewer-director Martin Scorsese: \\"There is a view that jazz is 'evil' because it comes from evil people, but actually the greatest priests on 52nd Street and on the streets of New York City were the musicians. They were doing the greatest healing work. They knew how to punch through music that would cure and make people feel good.\\" Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Is Garth Hudson still alive?","response":"Yes, Garth Hudson is still alive."},{"question":"Unashamedly ambitious sci-fi from Kerry Conran, for whom this is clearly a labour of love. Unfortunately it's just not that good. It all starts well enough - with an epic but restrained score, a mixture of Lucas and Hitchcock style editing and the glossy cinematography of a Spielberg. The movie also references many pulp sci-fi novels, serials and films as diverse as The Day The Earth Stood Still, Superman, Metropolis, Planet Of The Apes, The Iron Giant, Star Wars and The Spy Who Loved Me. The film however, fails to be as good as any one of those for several reasons: the main being that it's such a labour of love, so concerned with throwing everything at the screen and creating a brave new world, Conran actually forgets about making a movie. There is little to no tension, atmosphere or magic on offer here despite aerial battles, dinosaurs and race-against-time set-pieces. Even the noir elements fall flat. This is a broad way of looking at things though - those elements mainly fail because nothing feels at all real and is so obviously fake - the green-screen just looks like a video game half the time and it's obvious the actors have been pasted on afterwards. The actors don't get to do much either - Jude Law is wooden, Gwyneth Paltrow is annoying and stupid, Angelina Jolie is wasted - and it's all because of an awful script - the sort that has to explain nearly everything.

The effects of Mandela's victory give rise to jubilation for much of the black population of South Africa, while the white Afrikaners and Zulu begin to feel that they're losing the country. This is punctuated by a squadron of cars carrying Mandela down a road, poor black kids playing soccer on one side, white Afrikaners playing rugby on the other. The coach of the National team, the Springboks, tells his team to remember this day, as it marks 'the day the country went to the dogs'.Mandela's head of security Jason Tshabalala (Tony Kgoroge) makes a request of Mandela concerning the team. He asks for more personnel to secure the president, the current team being made up of four blacks. Mandela's response is to hire four white former Special Branch members led by Etienne Feyder (Julian Lewis Jones). On first meeting, they clash due to deep-seated racial issues, yet are compelled to work out their differences. Seeing that he has no choice but to work alongside them, Tshabalala tells his black co-workers, especially Linga Moonsamy (Patrick Mofokeng), that while working together, they will watch the whites carefully.In his first days in office, the tension is palpable, as most of the former president's underlings (mostly Afrikaners) still hold their jobs. Worried that Mandela will fire them, they begin packing up their belongings, awaiting what they assume is the inevitable. Upon seeing this, Mandela...

The southern stretch of coast is more reminiscent of a North African landscape than a European one. It has no cosmopolitan cities, like Lisbon and Porto, which are farther north. Most of Portugal is known for quaint towns, medieval castles, and grand palaces. The Algarve is more recognizable for impenetrable blocks of tourist apartments, hotels, and meticulously manicured golf courses. And beaches. Think Algarve and the mind pictures long, glorious stretches of golden sands, secluded coves framed by odd ochre-colored rock formations, and deep green waters. With about 160 km (100 miles) of coastline, Portugal's southern province is one of Europe's premier beach destinations. The occasionally chilly ocean is the Atlantic, but the Algarve has a sultry Mediterranean feel. Its consistent climate is the best in Portugal, and one of the kindest in the world: more than 250 days of sunshine a year — more than almost any other international resort area. The moderating effect of the Gulf Stream produces a fresh springtime breeze throughout winter, and in late January and February, white almond blossoms blanket the fields. In summer the heat is intense but rarely unbearable, and regardless, beautiful beaches and innumerable pools are always just a dive away. Magnificent year-round weather has made the Algarve a huge destination for sporting vacations. Superb golf facilities abound — several with tees dramatically clinging to cliffs and fairways just skirting the edge of the ocean — and horseback riding, tennis, big-game fishing, sailing, and windsurfing are immensely popular. Sports, beaches and hospitable weather — not to mention easily organized package vacations — are surely the reasons the Algarve receives as many visitors as the rest of Portugal in its entirety. But it's not just international tourists that descend on the Algarve; many Portuguese from Lisbon and elsewhere in the north have holiday homes and spend their summer vacations here. The coast is neatly divided into the rugged Barlavento to the west and the flat beauty of Sotavento to the east. West is where you'll find the famous orange cliffs and surreal eroded rock stacks.

Here are possible answers to this question: - vehical - fuel system - accelerate - airplane - car I believe the correct choice is \\"car\\", here's why: Answer:","response":"The correct choice is indeed \\"car.\\" Here's why: An accelerator, also known as an accelerator pedal or gas pedal, is a key component in controlling the speed of a car. It is a pedal found in most automobiles, which allows the driver to regulate the car's engine power and ultimately its speed. The accelerator pedal works by controlling the flow of fuel or air to the engine, based on how much the pedal is pressed. Out of all the possible options provided: 1. Vehical (correctly spelled as \\"vehicle\\"): Although the word \\"vehicle\\" could be a correct answer, it is a broader term that encompasses cars, trucks, buses, and other types of transportation. In this context, \\"car\\" is a more specific answer that corresponds better with the question. 2. Fuel system: This term refers to the system in vehicles that store, supply, and generate fuel. While it is related to cars, the fuel system itself does not have an accelerator. 3. Accelerate: Accelerate is not an object or thing; it is a verb that means to increase speed. Cars do accelerate, but \\"accelerate\\" is not the correct answer in this context. 4. Airplane: Although airplanes also have an equivalent of an accelerator (throttle) to control engine power and speed, airplanes are not owned by most people, unlike cars. \\"Car\\" is the best answer among the choices provided because it is a commonly owned mode of transportation that relies on an accelerator for controlling speed. Furthermore, a vast majority of the global population utilizes cars as their primary means of transportation, making it the most appropriate answer in this context."},{"question":"Goal: To make your central heat and air unit work properly, Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal?","response":"Option 1: Call a professional technician to check and fix the unit.

Surely Colombia, complete with the luxurious skills of new kid on the World Cup block James Rodriguez, will beat Uruguay, minus the penetration of bitter old Luis Suarez. That is what pretty much everyone except Suarez’s countrymen seem to want the outcome to be on this first day of the round of the last 16. While Suarez left the revulsion of Brazil 2014 for a warped hero’s welcome in Montevideo, the Maracana was making ready to admire the refreshing Colombians. But there is a danger here. VIDEO Scroll down to see 'Jose Pekerman: Uruguay a top notch team even without Suarez' In form: Colombia won all three of their games to finish top of Group C and are favourites against Uruguay. Fine tuning: Uruguay train at the Estadio Sao Januario on the eve of their last-16 clash. Setting: The two South American sides will clash at the Maracana on Saturday. Back in town: Luis Suarez returned to Uruguay to a hero's welcome at Carrasco International Airport. A bunker mentality often wins football matches and no team is more huddled together against the outside world than Uruguay. In fact that entire South American country is shutting out criticism of Suarez the serial biter. Even their president is rallying behind him despite it being this man himself – not the English media, a FIFA conspiracy or anything else they care to blame – who has shot his team in the foot. How will the players he has left behind react? If they feel sorry for themselves, they will be soft pickings for Colombia. But the indications are that they are angry about their star striker being expelled from the tournament and are bristling to make a statement. It could be ugly. Passionate: Supporters waited at Carrasco International Airport to greet the arrival of Suarez. Speaking his mind: Colombia manager Jose Pekerman addresses the media at a press conference. Working out: Colombia forward Jackson Martinez (left) and defender Carlos Valdes during training. There are times when there is a sinister side to Uruguay. Their best teams – starting with the two-time World Cup winners back in the 1950s – create beautiful memories. But when it goes against them they can, as Suarez so sharply demonstrates, leave a sour taste in the mouth. Either way, they are never easy meat. Colombia are one of the pleasant surprises here. Their attacking football has captured the imagination. Young Rodriguez is an international legend in the making and it helps that he has Jackson Martinez to help carry the goalscoring burden. Teofilio Gutiierrez is not too shabby, either. But they should take nothing for granted. Dangerman: Colombia playmaker James Rodriguez goes for a jog during a training session in Rio. Eyes on the prize: Teofilo Gutierrez (left), Carlos Bacca and Mario Alberto Yepes (right) during training. If ever there will be a moment for Edinson Cavani to explain to a wider audience outside France why Paris St Germain invested a fortune in him, this is it. Cavani, with his flamboyant style, often flatters to deceive but Uruguay need him to fill the goal void now. The enforced absence of Suarez also gives veteran forward Diego Forlan another day in the World Cup sunshine. The Latin Americans, as usual when the World Cup is played on this continent, have been prospering but one of them has to go out. Stepping up: Edinson Cavani joins in with a training session on the eve of the game against Colombia. Uphill task: Uruguay know they are underdogs against Colombia without star striker Suarez. Hugs all round: Diego Forlan could have a bigger role to play for Uruguay in Suarez's absence. It is worth Colombia reminding themselves that Uruguay were deeply unimpressive in qualifying, reaching Brazil only courtesy of a ridiculously easy play off against Jordan. Hindsight tells us, also, that the group in which they defeated both England and Italy was nothing like as strong as we fondly imagined. Costa Rica are living proof of that. The grand stage of the Maracana is set for Rodriguez to give most of the world what it wants from this match. But with Uruguay in this defiant mood, the 22-year-old prodigy must not expect a gentle ride.","response":"1. Colombia and Uruguay face off in the round of the last 16 at the Maracana Stadium. 2.

Answer: Staying at a friend's house can be a good option for a night or more, depending on your relationship with that friend, their living situation, and personal preferences. Here are some factors to consider when deciding if a friend's house is a suitable place for you to stay: 1. Level of comfort: If you feel comfortable and safe at your friend's house, it can be a good option for a stay. Having a strong personal connection with your friend and trust in each other can contribute to a sense of comfort. 2.

Setting boundaries and understanding each other's personal space will ensure a pleasant experience for both parties. 3.

Be respectful of their home and personal space, and offer to help with chores, groceries, or other household tasks as a gesture of gratitude. 4. Living situation: Your friend's living arrangements may affect your decision to stay with them. Consider factors such as whether they have adequate space to accommodate you comfortably, as well as who else is living in the household (e.g., family members or roommates) and how your stay could impact them. 5.

However, it's important to reciprocate the favor and show appreciation for your friend's hospitality. 6. Convenience: Consider the location of your friend's house and its proximity to places you want to visit or activities you want to engage in. This can help you determine if it's a convenient option for your stay.

He is of German descent, his great-grandfather Joseph Clemens having immigrated in the 1880s. Clemens's parents separated when he was an infant. His mother soon married Woody Booher, whom Clemens considers his father. Clemens unexpectedly appeared in the owner's box at Yankee Stadium on May 6, 2007, during the seventh-inning stretch of a game against the Seattle Mariners, and made a brief statement: \\"Thank y'all. Well they came and got me out of Texas, and uhh, I can tell you it's a privilege to be back. I'll be talkin' to y'all soon.\\" It was simultaneously announced that Clemens had rejoined the Yankees roster, agreeing to a pro-rated one-year deal worth 28,000,022, or about 4.7 million per month. Over the contract life, he would make 18.7 million. This equated to just over 1 million per start that season. Clemens made his 2007 return on June 9, defeating the Pittsburgh Pirates by pitching six innings with seven strikeouts and 3 runs allowed. On June 21, with a single in the 5th inning against the Colorado Rockies, Clemens became the oldest New York Yankee to record a hit (44 years, 321 days). On June 24, Clemens pitched an inning in relief against the San Francisco Giants. It had been 22 years and 341 days since his previous regular-season relief appearance, the longest such gap in major league history. On July 2, Clemens collected his 350th win against the Minnesota Twins at Yankee Stadium, giving up just two hits and one run over eight innings. Clemens is one of only three pitchers to pitch his entire career in the live-ball era and reach 350 wins. The other two are Warren Spahn (whose catcher for his 350th win was Joe Torre, Clemens's manager for his 350th), and Greg Maddux, who earned his 350th win in 2008. His final regular season appearance was a start against the Red Sox at Fenway Park, in which he allowed 2 hits and 1 unearned run in 6 innings, and received a no-decision. Clemens finished the 2007 regular season with a record of 6-6 and a 4.18 ERA. Clemens was forced to leave Game 3 of the 2007 ALDS in the third inning after aggravating a hamstring injury. He struck out Victor Martinez of the Cleveland Indians with his final pitch, and was replaced by right-hander Phil Hughes. Yankees manager Joe Torre removed Clemens from the roster due to his injury, and replaced him with left-hander Ron Villone.

The culture of health care needs to change. Medical mistakes cause too many needless harm or deaths, yet few people see the problem in this context because we rarely have an open and honest conversation about the quality of health care in America. When we do, it is often behind closed doors. This is a challenge that a new generation of doctors is working to change through initiatives ranging from more transparent bedside care to public reporting of hospital performance. Doctors and nurses increasingly feel disconnected from policymakers and even their own hospitals, some of which have transformed into giant corporations. Despite concerns from the Federal Trade Commission that costs will go up for consumers, hospital mega-mergers are on the rise. This past year saw a large number of hospital mergers and acquisitions in health care. While some hospital executives have commendably used a hospital chain's large size to standardize best practices, others have fallen into the age-old management trap of detaching themselves from the front lines and becoming dangerously out of touch with their own staff. I talk to doctors and nurses around the country every week. One trend that seems clear is that more doctors and nurses are feeling frustrated. A recent national study by Mayo Clinic researchers shows that doctor burnout rate is now up to a staggering 46%. A new phenomenon, quite different from when my father practiced medicine, is that doctors and nurses now say they feel like they are tenants working for their landlord: the hospital management. Often, doctors and nurses know how to make care better and safer but feel stripped of the power to make necessary changes. This worker-management disconnect (even antagonism) in any industry is dangerous. In medicine this workplace atmosphere, complicated by perverse economic incentives and weak systems of accountability, contributes to a hospital culture marked by a lack of a sense of communal ownership in the overall delivery of care. What results is a poorer quality of care, more overtreatment, more fraud, more medical mistakes, and more patients falling through the cracks. According to a 2009 CBS-New York Times poll, 77% of Americans say they are satisfied with the quality of their health care. But what makes people think the health care they're receiving is good? Very little. A Harvard study published in the New England Journal of Medicine reported an alarming fact: 18% of patients were actually harmed by medical care. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that up to 30% of health care procedures, tests and other services do not improve health outcomes. For instance, if you had a medical condition, would you go to a hospital that has performed more than 1,000 unnecessary procedures? Probably not. As much as one-third of all health care expenditures may be going to waste, fraud and unnecessary medical care. This problem is high on the agenda for the American Board of Internal Medicine. Other physician groups have joined the \\"Choosing Wisely\\" Campaign to address unnecessary care in American medicine. The Institute of Medicine is calling attention to the problem, and many medical researchers are speaking openly about it. But more needs to be done. Rather than reinforce a closed-door culture in American medicine, hospitals should use their new large size to encourage external and independent peer reviews and create a culture of transparency. Patients should be encouraged to keep a copy of their medical records, not inconvenienced with burdensome processes and extra charges to obtain them. A hospital's front-line health care workers are their work engine, and these people should be encouraged to voice their safety concerns to their managers. Mega-hospitals need to stay true to their mission and not fall into the large corporate pitfalls that can erode the standing of any business. A workplace culture that punishes those who speak up about problems by depriving them of their career livelihood is part of the problem itself. As a surgeon, I sometimes see patients after they have blindly walked into the hands of dangerous, expensive and avoidable care. If we are serious about improving health care quality and lowering costs, we need to address the issue of accountability. Our hospitals must be more accountable to patients and doctors. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Marty Makary. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","response":"1. Firings of medical professionals who speak up about dangerous and fraudulent practices can discourage others from reporting such issues, leading to a lack of open conversation about health care quality in America. 2. Doctors and nurses are increasingly feeling disconnected from policymakers and hospitals as health care facilities transform into large corporations and merge, affecting communication and decision-making processes. 3. Hospital management can be out of touch with the front lines, leading to a lack of communal ownership in the overall delivery of care, resulting in poorer care quality, overtreatment, fraud, more medical mistakes, and patients falling through the cracks. 4. Up to 30% of health care procedures, tests, and services may not improve health outcomes, contributing to a significant waste of resources. 5. Hospitals need to stay true to their mission and not fall into large corporate pitfalls. The culture of health care should change to encourage external and independent peer reviews, improve transparency, and support medical professionals in voicing their safety concerns. This will improve accountability and lead to better health care quality."},{"question":"- Это верно, - сказал Монте-Кристо, - мне случалось видеть, как русские поглощали без всякого вреда для здоровья растительные вещества, которые неминуемо убили бы неаполитанца или араба.

Jessica - Bryan's 28-year-old sister, a pragmatic and supportive person who worries about her brother's well-being. Scene: Bryan and Jessica are at their family home in the dining room, discussing Bryan's upcoming trip to Afghanistan over a cup of coffee. --- Bryan: (excited) Jess, guess what? I got accepted into the humanitarian aid program I applied for last month. I'm going to Afghanistan! Jessica: (surprised) Wow, Bryan, that's really great news! But isn't it a bit... you know, dangerous? Bryan: I know it's not the easiest place to visit, but I've always wanted to make a difference. Plus, they need people like us to help out with the rebuilding process, especially after everything that the country has been through. Jessica: I totally understand where you're coming from, Bryan. And I'm proud of you for wanting to contribute and offer your skills to those in need. It's just that I worry about your safety. You know how unpredictable the news can be lately. Bryan: (reassuring) Jess, I appreciate your concern, but I've done my research. The organization I'm going with has a great track record, and they make sure the volunteers are safe. They provide guidance and have security measures in place. Trust me, I'll be okay. Jessica: (relieved) That puts my mind at ease, at least a little. So, what kind of work will you be doing there? Bryan: The program is diverse. I'll be assisting with rebuilding schools, community centers, and helping with healthcare initiatives. There's even a possibility of teaching English to the local kids. Jessica: That sounds like a really fulfilling experience. I'm sure you'll be able to make a real impact. But what about your job? What did your boss say? Bryan: I talked to my boss this morning, and she was very supportive of my decision. She's giving me a three-month leave, and my position will be here for me when I get back. Jessica: That's fantastic! And I know mom and dad will be proud too if a little worried, as I am. Just promise me you'll stay safe, keep us updated regularly, and share your experiences with us. Bryan: Of course, Jess. I'll send you and mom and dad emails, photos, and maybe even set up video calls every once in a while. (smiling) Who knows, maybe my journey will inspire you to join me on a similar adventure someday! Jessica: (laughs) Maybe, Bryan. But for now, I'll just stick to my office and local volunteer work. All jokes aside, I truly believe that your dedication and compassion will make a difference in the lives of those you'll be helping. So, when do you leave for Afghanistan? Bryan: My flight is in three weeks. Before that, I'll be attending some orientation sessions to better prepare myself for the trip. Jessica: (smiling) I can't wait to hear all about it. Now, let's go tell mom and dad the news. They'll be thrilled and a little nervous, I'm sure. Bryan: Agreed. Let's share the news, and then we can start thinking about what I'll need to pack. You know, maybe you're right - your journey might look different from mine, but no matter where we are, we can both be making a positive impact in our own ways. (They get up and walk towards their parents' living room to share the exciting news.) --- In this dialogue, Bryan shares his plans of going to Afghanistan with his sister Jessica. Their conversation revolves around Bryan's intention to help with humanitarian aid, his precautions for safety, and the support and concerns of his family members.

At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition. - Improvisation is broad term referring to the process of devising an atypical method of solving a problem due to lack of time or resources. In a technical context, this can mean adapting a device for some use other than that which it was designed for, or building a device from unusual components in an ad-hoc fashion. Improvisation, within the context of performing arts, is a very spontaneous performance without specific or scripted preparation. The skills of improvisation can apply to many different faculties, across all artistic, scientific, physical, cognitive, academic, and non-academic disciplines. - African-American music is an umbrella term covering a diverse range of musics and musical genres largely developed by African Americans. Their origins are in musical forms that arose out of the historical condition of slavery that characterized the lives of African Americans prior to the American Civil War. - The Jazz Age was a period in the 1920s, ending with the Great Depression, in which jazz music and dance styles became popular, mainly in the United States, but also in Britain, France and elsewhere. Jazz originated in New Orleans as a fusion of African and European music and played a significant part in wider cultural changes in this period, and its influence on pop culture continued long afterwards. The Jazz Age is often referred to in conjunction with the Roaring Twenties. - A music genre is a conventional category that identifies some pieces of music as belonging to a shared tradition or set of conventions. It is to be distinguished from \\"musical form\\" and \\"musical style\\", although in practice these terms are sometimes used interchangeably. Recently, academics have argued that categorizing music by genre is inaccurate and outdated. - Polyrhythm is the simultaneous use of two or more conflicting rhythms, that are not readily perceived as deriving from one another, or as simple manifestations of the same meter. The rhythmic conflict may be the basis of an entire piece of music (cross-rhythm), or a momentary disruption. Polyrhythms can be distinguished from irrational rhythms, which can occur within the context of a single part; polyrhythms require at least two rhythms to be played concurrently, one of which is typically an irrational rhythm. - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\". - Blues is a genre and musical form originated by African Americans in the Deep South of the United States around the end of the 19th century. The genre developed from roots in African musical traditions, African-American work songs and European-American folk music. Blues incorporated spirituals, work songs, field hollers, shouts, chants, and rhymed simple narrative ballads. The blues form, ubiquitous in jazz, rhythm and blues and rock and roll, is characterized by the call-and-response pattern, the blues scale and specific chord progressions, of which the twelve-bar blues is the most common. Blue notes (or \\"worried notes\\"), usually thirds or fifths flattened in pitch, are also an essential part of the sound. Blues shuffles or walking bass reinforce the trance-like rhythm and form a repetitive effect known as the groove. - New Orleans (or ) is a major United States port and the largest city and metropolitan area in the state of Louisiana. The population of the city was 343,829 as of the 2010 U.S. Census. The New Orleans metropolitan area (New OrleansMetairieKenner Metropolitan Statistical Area) had a population of 1,167,764 in 2010 and was the 46th largest in the United States. The New OrleansMetairieBogalusa Combined Statistical Area, a larger trading area, had a 2010 population of 1,452,502. - Popular music is music with wide appeal that is typically distributed to large audiences through the music industry. These forms and styles can be enjoyed and performed by people with little or no musical training. It stands in contrast to both art music and traditional or \\"folk\\" music. Art music was historically disseminated through the performances of written music, although since the beginning of the recording industry, it is also disseminated through recordings. Traditional music forms such as early blues songs or hymns were passed along orally, or to smaller, local audiences. - Ragtime also spelled rag-time or rag time is a musical genre that enjoyed its peak popularity between 1895 and 1918. Its cardinal trait is its syncopated, or \\"ragged\\", rhythm. The genre has its origins in African-American communities like St. Louis years before being published as popular sheet music for piano. Ernest Hogan (18651909) was a pioneer of ragtime music and was the first to compose ragtime into sheet music. The composition was called \\"LA Pas Ma LA\\" and it was released in 1895. Hogan has also been credited for coining the term \\"ragtime\\". The term is actually derived from his hometown \\"Shake Rag\\" in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Ben Harney, who is also a Kentucky native has often been credited for introducing the music to the mainstream public. His first ragtime composition \\"You've been a good old wagon but you done broke\\" helped popularize the musical genre. The composition was published in 1895 but released in 1896. Ragtime was also a modification of the march made popular by John Philip Sousa, with additional polyrhythms coming from African music. The ragtime composer Scott Joplin (\\"ca.\\" 18681917) became famous through the publication of the \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" (1899) and a string of ragtime hits such as \\"The Entertainer\\" (1902), although he was later forgotten by all but a small, dedicated community of ragtime aficionados until the major ragtime revival in the early 1970s. For at least 12 years after its publication, \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" heavily influenced subsequent ragtime composers with its melody lines, harmonic progressions or metric patterns. - West Africa, also called Western Africa and the West of Africa, is the westernmost subregion of Africa. West Africa has been defined as including 18 countries: Benin, Burkina Faso, the island nation of Cape Verde, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, the island of Saint Helena, Senegal, Sierra Leone, São Tomé and Príncipe and Togo. - Andrew Dewey Kirk ( May 28 , 1898 -- December 11 , 1992 ) was a jazz saxophonist and tubist best known as a bandleader of the \`\` Twelve Clouds of Joy '' , popular during the swing era . Kirk grew up in Denver , Colorado , where he was tutored by Wilberforce Whiteman , Paul Whiteman 's father . Kirk started his musical career playing with George Morrison 's band , but then went on to join Terrence Holder 's Dark Clouds of Joy . In 1929 he was elected leader after Holder departed . Renaming the band Clouds of Joy , Kirk also relocated the band from Dallas , Texas , to Kansas City , Kansas . Although officially titled as the Clouds of Joy , the band has also been known to be called the Twelve Clouds of Joy due to the number of musicians in the band . They set up in the Pla - Mor Ballroom on the junction of 32nd and Main in Kansas City and made their first recording for Brunswick Records that same year . Mary Lou Williams came in as pianist at the last moment , but she impressed Brunswick 's Dave Kapp , so she became a regular member of the band . Kirk moved the band to Kansas City , and since their first recordings in 1929 -- 1930 , they grew highly popular as they epitomized the Kansas City jazz sound . In mid- 1936 , he was signed to Decca and made scores of popular records until 1946 . He presumably disbanded and reformed his band during that 6 - year recording layoff , as his 1929 - 1930 Brunswick appeared to have sold well enough to stay in the catalog through the period and 1933 - 34 pressings ( with the mid- 1930s label variations ) have been seen . In 1938 , Kirk and band held the top spot of the Billboard chart for 12 weeks with \`\` I Wo n't Tell a Soul ( I Love You ) '' , written by Hughie Charles and Ross Parker , featuring Pha Terrell on vocals . In 1942 , Kirk and His Clouds of Joy recorded \`\` Take It and Git '' , which on October 24 , 1942 , became the first single to hit number one on the Harlem Hit Parade , the predecessor to the Billboard R&B chart .

This principle states that when a chemical system is at equilibrium and is disturbed by a stress, the system will respond by attempting to counteract that stress until a new equilibrium is established. Stresses to a chemical system include changes in the concentrations of reactants or products, changes in the temperature of the system, or changes in the pressure of the system. We will discuss each of these stresses separately. In each case, the change to the equilibrium position will cause either the forward or reverse reaction to be favored over the opposite process. When the forward reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products increase, and the concentrations of the reactants decrease. When the reverse reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products decrease, and the concentrations of the reactants increase. John was trying to reenact Le Chatelier's principle. To that end, he conducted four tests, test A, test B, test C, and test D. In test A, he didn't input any stress to a chemical system in equilibrium. But In test B, he put some stress to the same system. In test C, he observed a forward reaction, but in test D, he observed a reverse reaction. Would test C see higher or lower concentration of the reactants than test D? The answer is:","response":"Test C would see lower concentration of the reactants than Test D. This is because, in Test C, the forward reaction is favored, causing the concentration of products to increase and the concentration of reactants to decrease. In Test D, the reverse reaction is favored, leading to the concentration of products decreasing and the concentration of reactants increasing."},{"question":"Answer the following question given this paragraph: Ferns are common in the understory of the tropical rainforest.

Raised at the luxurious court of Naples, Eleonora was the wife of Cosimo I de' Medici of Tuscany, later the Grand Duke. On moving into the palace, Cosimo had Vasari enlarge the structure to fit his tastes; the palace was more than doubled by the addition of a new block along the rear. Vasari also built the Vasari Corridor, an above-ground walkway from Cosimo's old palace and the seat of government, the Palazzo Vecchio, through the Uffizi, above the Ponte Vecchio to the Palazzo Pitti. This enabled the Grand Duke and his family to move easily and safely from their official residence to the Palazzo Pitti. Initially the Palazzo Pitti was used mostly for lodging official guests and for occasional functions of the court, while the Medicis' principal residence remained the Palazzo Vecchio. It was not until the reign of Eleonora's son Francesco I and his wife Johanna of Austria that the palazzo was occupied on a permanent basis and became home to the Medicis' art collection.Land on the Boboli hill at the rear of the palazzo was acquired in order to create a large formal park and gardens, today known as the Boboli Gardens. The landscape architect employed for this was the Medici court artist Niccolò Tribolo, who died the following year; he was quickly succeeded by Bartolommeo Ammanati. The original design of the gardens centred on an amphitheatre, behind the corps de logis of the palazzo. The first play recorded as performed there was Andria by Terence in 1476. It was followed by many classically inspired plays of Florentine playwrights such as Giovan Battista Cini. Performed for the amusement of the cultivated Medici court, they featured elaborate sets designed by the court architect Baldassarre Lanci., what would be the answer ? Answer:","response":"The name of the palazzo that was not occupied on a permanent basis until the reign of Eleonora's son Francesco I and his wife Johanna of Austria is the Palazzo Pitti."},{"question":"Triumph and Disaster: The 20th century saw a stupendous release of energies that had been pent up for the 250 years of Tokugawa isolation. By 1930 raw-material production had tripled the figure of 1900, manufactured goods had increased twelve-fold, and heavy industry was galloping towards maturity. Britain led the World War I Ailies in large orders for munitions, while Japan expanded sales of manufactured goods to Asian and other markets cut off from their usual European suppliers. Merchant shipping doubled in size and increased its income ten-fold as the European fleets were destroyed. Setbacks in the 1930s caused by the European postwar slump were only a spur to redouble efforts by diversifying heavy industry into the machine-making, metallurgical, and chemical sectors. Even the terrible 1923 Tokyo earthquake, which cost over 100,000 lives and billions of dollars, provided another stimulus due to the construction boom that followed. Riding the crest of this economic upsurge were the zaibatsu conglomerates — a dozen family-run combines, each involved in mining, manufacturing, marketing, shipping, and banking. These tightly controlled commercial pyramids were the true heirs to the old feudal structures. Japan's progress toward parliamentary democracy was halted in the 1930s by the growing nationalism being imposed on government by the generals and admirals. They proclaimed Japan's mission to bring progress to its backward Asian neighbors in language not so very different from that of the Europeans in Africa or the US in Latin America. After the Russian Revolution of 1917, the Soviet Union was regarded as a major threat to Japan's security, and the army felt it needed Manchuria and whatever other Chinese territory it could control as a buffer against Russian advances. In 1931 the Japanese occupied Manchuria. And then in 1937, with the popular support of ultra-right-wing groups, the army overrode parliamentary resistance in Tokyo and went to war against the Chinese Nationalists. By 1938, they held Nanking, Hankow, and Canton. Japanese expansionist policies were leading to direct confrontation with the West. Japan hoped that war in Europe would divert the Soviet Union from interference in East Asia, giving Japan a free hand both in China and, through its alliance with Germany, in French IndoChina after the defeat of France. The US responded to the Japanese invasion of IndoChina with a trade and fuel embargo, cutting off 90 percent of Japan's supplies. The result was the attack on the American fleet at Pearl Harbor (7 December 1941) and total war.

Patient D is a female and she too does not have any of these illnesses. and a hint : Klinefelter's syndrome is caused by the presence of one or more extra copies of the X chromosome in a male's cells. Extra genetic material from the X chromosome interferes with male sexual development, preventing the testicles from functioning normally and reducing the levels of testosterone. Triple X syndrome (trisomy X) results from an extra copy of the X chromosome in each of a female's cells. Females with trisomy X have a lower IQ than their siblings. Turner syndrome results when each of a female's cells has one normal X chromosome and the other sex chromosome is missing or altered. The missing genetic material affects development and causes the characteristic features of the condition, including short stature and infertility. Please answer this question : Would patient B be shorter or taller than patient D? A:","response":"Patient B would be shorter than patient D, since she has Turner syndrome, which is characterized by short stature."},{"question":"DEMOCRATS ASK 'TARGETED' CUTS WASHINGTON, June 1— When the Speaker of the House, Representative Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., emerged from a White House meeting today with President Reagan he denounced the President's tax proposals as ''a windfall for the rich'' and said the Democrats were concerned with ''the working class.'' The statement by the Massachusetts Democrat underscored the basic differences on tax policy that divide the Republican Administration and the Democratic leadership of the House of Representatives. The Reagan ''supply side'' approach to tax relief emphasizes the incentive effect of letting workers and investors take home a larger fraction of any extra money they earn. The traditional Democratic approach, represented by Mr. O'Neill, calls for ''targeted'' tax cuts, giving special attention - an extra dollop of tax relief - to those with low or middle incomes. On other aspects of the tax issue, notably how to encourage business investment, differences between Republicans and Democrats are minor. The following is a summary of how the principal tax issues stand four months into Mr. Reagan's Presidency: Duration of a Tax Cut The Administration insists on the Republican formula first articulated by Representative Jack F. Kemp of upstate New York and Senator William V. Roth Jr. of Delaware of three consecutive reductions in tax rates, to be mandated in a single bill. The Democrats had wanted a one-year bill but in the last week or so Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who is the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, had indicated that he would go to two years if the White House would make some concessions on who gets tax relief. Form of Tax Relief Hewing to the Kemp-Roth formula, the President insists on uniform, across-the-board reductions in all rates. Speaker O'Neill and Mr. Rostenkowski assert that tax relief should be targeted to the ''middle class'' or ''working class,'' whom they describe as the people with incomes of 15,000 or 20,000 to 50,000. Republicans, asserting that the Democrats have made no specific counterproposal, contend that the legislative meaning of ''targeted'' is unclear. What it seems to mean, the Republicans say, is that, although taxpayers in the 20,000-50,000 range pay 50 percent of the income tax total, they should get more than 50 percent of the tax relief. Size of Tax Reduction From an initial proposal of a tax cut of 10 percent a year for three years, Mr. Reagan has backed off to a formula of 5-10-10, 5 percent the first year with 10 percent the second and third. This plan was offered by Representative Kent Hance, a conservative Texas Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee. The Treasury Department says that the revised bill, including relief for business, would cost 37 billion in lost revenues in the 1982 fiscal year, starting next Oct. 1, as against the 54 billion Mr. Reagan originally proposed. Cost estimates for a Rostenkowski bill are uncertain because the Illinois Democrat has talked only in general terms. Other Tax Bill Provisions The White House has agreed that a provision to moderate the ''marriage penalty'' paid by some two-salary couples should be part of the tax relief bill. The White House has stopped talking about a second 1981 tax bill, an idea Congress never took seriously. The Administration has agreed in principle to the liberalization of the present limitations on eligibility for and use of Individual Retirement Accounts. The Administration has also agreed to an immediate cut in the maximum tax rate, to 50 percent from 70 percent. Special relief for Americans who work abroad and on estate and gift taxes is also likely. Business Tax Relief The Reagan proposal to let business take faster, larger tax writeoffs for the costs of buildings, machinery and vehicles is almost certain to be enacted with only minor changes. Tax writers from both parties and the Treasury, however, are having second thoughts about the President's proposal to permit a full 10 percent tax credit on assets to be written off in five years, instead of seven, as now. There is, however, some sentiment for a longer ''carryback'' so that money-losing companies with no tax liability can receive the investment credit as a refund against earlier years' taxes. What are the most important parts of this text?","response":"The most important parts of this text are: 1. The differences between the Republicans and Democrats on tax policy: Republicans support the \\"supply side\\" approach which allows workers and investors to keep more of their earnings, while Democrats prefer \\"targeted\\" tax cuts for those with low or middle incomes. 2.

Trump is inaugurated the 45th president of the United States. Here's a closer look at the Women's March, with answers to your questions about the event: What is the Women's March on Washington, D.C.? Women's rights groups and activist groups are coming together to stage a large demonstration in Washington, D.C., on the first full day of Trump's presidency. Most of the marchers are expected to be women, though men and children are also scheduled to be part of the event. The march began as a grassroots effort the day after the presidential election. A large number of women marching through the heart of Washington \\"will send a bold message to our new administration on their first day in office, and to the world that women's rights are human rights. We stand together, recognizing that defending the most marginalized among us is defending all of us,\\" organizers said. When is the Women's March on Washington, D.C.? The march will be held on Saturday, Jan. 21, 2017. It is scheduled to begin at 10 a.m. and end at 5 p.m. There will also be \\"Sister Marches\\" in nearly every state and several foreign countries. Why are women marching on Washington, D.C.? The march is not designed to be an anti-Trump rally, organizers said. But, the event -- first suggested by a grandmother in Hawaii -- is a response to many of the comments about women, minorities and other groups that made headlines during the presidential campaigns. \\"The rhetoric of the past election cycle has insulted, demonized, and threatened many of us -- women, immigrants of all statuses, those with diverse religious faiths, particularly Muslim, people who identify as LGBTQIA, Native and Indigenous people, Black and Brown people, people with disabilities, the economically impoverished and survivors of sexual assault,\\" the organizers said. Feminist icon Gloria Steinem is a co-sponsor of the march. Other celebrities who have said they plan to attend include Amy Schumer, Samantha Bee and Jessica Chastain. Where will the Women's March originate? The march will begin at 10 a.m. at the intersection of Independence Avenue and Third Street SW, near the U.S. Capitol. What's the route of the Women's March? Marchers are expected to walk along Independence Avenue toward the Washington Monument, though organizers said they do not plan to release the official route until a later date for security reasons. The permit issued by police in Washington, D.C., says march participants will disperse at the southern part of the Ellipse near the White House, at Constitution Avenue between 15th and 17th streets NW. An earlier plan to hold the rally at the steps of the Lincoln Memorial was nixed when march organizers failed to secure a permit from the National Park Service. How are people getting to Washington? Some participants are traveling to the march independently by car, train, airplane and the Washington, D.C., metro system. But, most of the marchers are expected to travel in buses coordinated by local organizing groups in each state. Updated information about transportation from each state is available via email, Facebook or state websites. How can you get more information? The Women's March on Washington website contains the latest news on the march, along with information about how to register for the event or donate to the cause. ||||| Janaye Ingram, center, with Ianta Summers and Ted Jackson at 3rd Street and Independence Avenue SW, where the march will begin. Ingram has been the local point person for getting the logistics issues smoothed out. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post) Teresa Shook never considered herself much of an activist, or someone particularly versed in feminist theory. But when the results of the presidential election became clear, the retired attorney in Hawaii turned to Facebook and asked: What if women marched on Washington around Inauguration Day en masse? She asked her online friends how to create an event page, and then started one for the march she was hoping would happen. By the time she went to bed, 40 women responded that they were in. When she woke up, that number had exploded to 10,000. Now, more than 100,000 people have registered their plans to attend the Women’s March on Washington in what is expected to be the largest demonstration linked to Donald Trump’s inauguration and a focal point for activists on the left who have been energized in opposing his agenda. (Elyse Samuels/The Washington Post) [Women’s March on Washington officially has a permit for Jan. 21] Planning for the Jan. 21 march got off to a rocky start. Controversy initially flared over the name of the march, and whether it was inclusive enough of minorities, particularly African Americans, who have felt excluded from many mainstream feminist movements. Organizers say plans are on track, after securing a permit from D.C. police to gather 200,000 people near the Capitol at Independence Avenue and Third Street SW on the morning after Inauguration Day. Exactly how big the march will be has yet to be determined, with organizers scrambling to pull together the rest of the necessary permits and raise the 1 million to 2 million necessary to pull off a march triggered by Shook’s Facebook venting. The march has become a catch-all for a host of liberal causes, from immigrant rights to police killings of African Americans. But at its heart is the demand for equal rights for women after an election that saw the defeat of Democrat Hillary Clinton, the first female presidential nominee of a major party. “We plan to make a bold and clear statement to this country on the national and local level that we will not be silent and we will not let anyone roll back the rights we have fought and struggled to get,” said Tamika Mallory, a veteran organizer and gun-control advocate who is one of the march’s main organizers. More than 150,000 women and men have responded on the march’s Facebook page that they plan on attending. At least 1,000 buses are headed to Washington for the march through Rally, a website that organizes buses to protests. Dozens of groups, including Planned Parenthood and the antiwar CodePink, have signed on as partners. Organizers insist the march is not anti-Trump, even as many of the groups that have latched on to it fiercely oppose his agenda. 1 of 55 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Here’s what President-elect Donald Trump has been doing since the election View Photos He has been holding interviews and meetings as he prepares to transition into the White House.

Don Emmert/AFP/Getty Images Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. “Donald Trump’s election has triggered a lot of women to be more involved than they ordinarily would have been, which is ironic, because a lot of us thought a Hillary presidency would motivate women,” said Dana Brown, executive director of the Pennsylvania Center for Women and Politics at Chatham University in Pittsburgh. “A lot of women seem to be saying, ‘This is my time. I’m not going to be silent anymore.’ ” [Military leaders say inauguration will be steeped in tradition] Trump Inaugural Committee spokesman Boris Epshteyn defended the president-elect’s popularity among women in an interview on CNN. While Trump did not receive the majority of women’s votes, he got an “overwhelming” number of them, Epshteyn said. “We’re here to hear their concerns,” he said. “We welcome them to our side as well.” That all this could grow out of a dashed-off post from her perch nearly 5,000 miles from Washington is amazing to Shook, who has booked her ticket and plans to be in the capital on Jan. 21. “I guess in my heart of hearts I wanted it to happen, but I didn’t really think it would’ve ever gone viral,” said Shook, who is in her 60s. “I don’t even know how to go viral.” Unsure of how to proceed in those initial few days, she said she enlisted the help of the first few women who messaged her to volunteer, some of whom independently also had an idea for a march. But as the march grew in prominence, it got caught up in a broader conversation in liberal circles about race and leadership, with activists and others criticizing that initial planning group for its racial makeup: Shook and all the women she tapped to help in the march’s nascent stages are white, she said. Some also took issue with the name Shook had proposed, the Million Woman March, which was the name of a 1997 gathering of hundreds of thousands of black women in Philadelphia. The racial concerns set off a heated conversation on the group’s main Facebook page, with some African American women especially taking umbrage. For her part, Shook said her aim was not to co-opt any other movement. It was just an idea that took hold after the victory of a president-elect caught on tape boasting of grabbing women’s private parts and the defeat of a woman who seemed to her much more qualified for the job. She said she had no idea of the race of the women she first contacted; in fact, she said, most had an image of Clinton as their Facebook profile photo. Complicating matters, it became apparent that the march probably could not start at the Lincoln Memorial as Shook had proposed, since the inaugural committee has dibs on that space. Overwhelmed and under pressure, the original organizers eventually handed the reins to a diverse group of veteran female activists from New York: Mallory, the gun-control activist; Linda Sarsour, executive director of the Arab American Association of New York; Carmen Perez, head of the Gathering for Justice, a criminal-justice-reform group; and Bob Bland, a fashion entrepreneur. Together, they settled on a new name: The Women’s March on Washington, a nod to the 1963 demonstration that was a cornerstone of the civil rights movement. They even received the blessing of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.’s youngest daughter, Bernice King. In the District, Janaye Ingram, the former executive director of Al Sharpton’s National Action Network, has been working to secure permits and hash out logistics for the march, including ensuring there is a proper sound equipment and sufficient portable toilets. People traveling to attend the march seem less concerned with behind-the-scenes politics than the chance to call for more family-friendly government policies, equal pay for women or reproductive rights. Some say they simply want to stand against the crass way Trump has spoken about women. Lindsey Shriver, a 27-year-old former pastry chef who is an at-home mom in Ohio, said she was offended this election cycle by Trump’s rhetoric, which she characterized as “hateful and misogynistic.” She also wants to highlight the need for paid family leave and affordable child care. “I realized that being a feminist in my own personal life wasn’t going to be enough for my daughters,” Shriver said. Caroline Rule, 57, a lawyer living in Manhattan, says she will attend with her 15-year-old daughter. While she agrees with the pro-women message behind the march, she said she would probably participate in any march that pushed against Trump’s messages. “I absolutely despise Donald Trump and everything he stands for,” she said. Feminist icon Gloria Steinem has recently signed on as a march co-sponsor, and celebrities including Amy Schumer, Samantha Bee and Jessica Chastain say they plan to attend. Feminist scholars say the march reflects an emerging view of feminism: one that is less defined by reproductive issues, such as birth control and abortion, and more by how the challenges faced by women intersect with those encountered by African Americans, the LGBT community and immigrants. [None of the inauguration protests have their proper permits yet. Here’s why.] Still, reproductive rights will be a large part of the march, with Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-Choice America as key partners. Hahrie Han, a political science professor at the University of California at Santa Barbara specializing in political organizations and political engagement, said it’s not all that surprising that individual women instead of an established organization founded this march. Established organizations all come with at least some political baggage. “The challenge with having one organization brand it as its own is that each organization has its own image that draws some people and pushes others back away,” she said. ||||| Write a summary.","response":"The Women's March on Washington, D.C., is a demonstration set to take place on January 21, 2017, the day following the inauguration of President Donald Trump.

Sentence A: \\"he withdrew pen from the bank\\" 1. Subject: \\"he\\" - This is clear and makes sense. 2. Verb: \\"withdrew\\" - This word typically implies removal of something from a location or account. 3. Object: \\"pen\\" - This word is a common writing instrument. 4.

Now, putting all those components together, it's clear that the overarching meaning is off. Withdrawing a \\"pen\\" from a financial institution is not a widely known or understood action, and it conflicts with the usual context of a bank. Consequently, this sentence appears nonsensical.

As these platforms continue to grow exponentially, concerns surrounding their potential impact on the mental health of young users have become prominent among researchers, parents, and educators. Various factors may contribute to this potential impact such as the amount of time spent on social media, the specific platform being utilized, and the intended purpose or interaction occurring on the platform. In this context, the rise in reported mental health issues among adolescents such as depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem has garnered researchers' attention. With adolescents being one of the largest user groups of social media, it is crucial to investigate if there is any correlation between increased social media use and these mental health concerns. Moreover, understanding how different types of social media use, such as passive browsing versus posting content, might differentially affect mental well-being is of key interest. Hypothesis: Increased time spent on social media is associated with higher levels of depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem in adolescents Based on the context, the hypothesis claims that there is a positive correlation between the amount of time spent on social media platforms and the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem among adolescents. This hypothesis could lead to further research and investigation into the potential effects of social media usage, which could, in turn, help develop guidelines, resources, and potential interventions for parents, educators, and young users themselves. Arguably, the underlying rationale for this hypothesis may include factors such as: 1. Social comparison: Adolescents may be more prone to comparing themselves with their peers or even celebrities, leading to feelings of envy or inadequacy when they perceive their lives to be less exciting, fulfilling, or attractive compared to others' curated online personas. 2. Fear of missing out (FOMO): The desire to stay constantly connected and updated might burden adolescents with the feeling that they are always missing out on important or fun events and experiences, which could induce anxiety and impact their self-esteem. 3. Cyberbullying: Social media platforms can serve as breeding grounds for cyberbullying, which may lead to significant emotional distress among adolescents and exacerbate underlying mental health issues. 4. Sleep disruption: Excessive time spent on social media platforms may contribute to decreased sleep quality and duration, which are known to have a substantial impact on mental health. To test this hypothesis, researchers could conduct large-scale longitudinal studies that track adolescents' social media usage patterns alongside their mental health indicators such as levels of anxiety, depression, and self-esteem. In addition, experimental studies could manipulate social media usage behaviors and monitor subsequent changes in psychological well-being. By examining the relationships between these variables, researchers can gain valuable insights into the potential effects of social media on young people's mental health and contribute to the development of strategies to mitigate potential negative consequences."},{"question":"In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Uterine massage is typically performed immediately after birth to help with placenta delivery and to lessen the likelihood of hemorrhages. Uterine massages aren't necessary for everyone, though. Talk to your obstetrician, doula, or other birthing professional about when and why they would recommend a uterine massage. Massage will typically be recommended if you had a long or complicated active labor, or if you lose more blood than anticipated during and immediately after labor. Massages may also occur every fifteen minutes or so for the first two to three hours after birth to help the uterus contract down. Work with your birthing professional well in advance of your due date to create a medication plan to go along with your birthing plan. This way you will know well in advance if you anticipate being put on any medications that make uterine massage ineffective. Uterine massage is not recommended after childbirth if you received prophylactic oxytocin. There is little evidence to suggest sustained uterine massage would be harmful for those who received oxytocin. It simply may not be effective, and may cause some discomfort. Be prepared to be flexible with your medication plan. If complications arise during your delivery that necessitate extra treatment, it may be necessary to change what medications you receive. A uterus massage isn't the same type of massage that you might get for your shoulders or back. It typically involves your delivery professional placing one hand up the birth canal and the other on top of your uterus on the outside of your body. They may then either compress the area for a few minutes, or use back-and-forth motions to massage the area. Ask your birthing professional about which technique their staff practices and why. Get as much information as you feel you need to help you become comfortable with this process. Some doulas and midwives may practice other forms of uterine massage that come down through vernacular traditions. There is little scientific evidence either for or against such treatments. Discuss the process and potential pros and cons prior to giving birth. Summary:","response":"This article talks about uterine massage, a technique done after a baby is born to help deliver the placenta and prevent too much bleeding. It's not for everyone, so it's important to talk to your birthing helper about it and have a plan."},{"question":"Information: - A nebula (Latin for \\"cloud\\"; pl. nebulae, nebulæ, or nebulas) is an interstellar cloud of dust, hydrogen, helium and other ionized gases. Originally, \\"nebula\\" was a name for any diffuse astronomical object, including galaxies beyond the Milky Way. The Andromeda Galaxy, for instance, was once referred to as the \\"Andromeda Nebula\\" (and spiral galaxies in general as \\"spiral nebulae\\") before the true nature of galaxies was confirmed in the early 20th century by Vesto Slipher, Edwin Hubble and others. - In astronomy and physical cosmology, the metallicity or Z is the fraction of mass of a star or other kind of astronomical object that is not in hydrogen (X) or helium (Y). Most of the physical matter in the universe is in the form of hydrogen and helium, so astronomers use the word \\"metals\\" as a convenient short term for \\"all elements except hydrogen and helium\\". This usage is distinct from the usual physical definition of a solid metal. The rationale for the astronomical usage is that in the high-temperature and pressure environment of a star, atoms do not undergo chemical reactions and effectively have no chemical properties, including that of being a metal as usually understood. For example, stars and nebulae with relatively high abundances of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and neon are called \\"metal-rich\\" in astrophysical terms, even though those elements are non-metals in chemistry. - AB Doradus Moving Group is a group of about 30 associated stars that are moving through space together with the star AB Doradus . A moving group is distinguished by its members having about the same age , composition ( or metallicity ) and motion through space . Hence they most likely formed in the same location . This group is located about 20 parsecs from the Earth and is the closest known co-moving group . The average space velocity of this group has components of U = 8 , V = 27 and W = 14 km / s. About 10 of these stars form a nuclear group within a volume roughly 10 parsecs across . The proximity of this moving group makes it useful for studies of shared stellar properties , as well as detection of companions through direct imaging . These can be used for refinement of young stellar models , for example . - AB Doradus is a pre-main-sequence quadruple star system in the constellation Dorado. The primary is a flare star that shows periodic increases in activity. - Dorado (English pronunciation: ) is a constellation in the southern sky. It was named in the late 16th century and is now one of the 88 modern constellations. Its name refers to the dolphinfish (\\"Coryphaena hippurus\\"), which is known as \\"dorado\\" in Portuguese, although it has also been depicted as a swordfish. Dorado contains most of the Large Magellanic Cloud, the remainder being in the constellation Mensa. The South Ecliptic pole also lies within this constellation.

Options: - Sentence A: \\"Stomach pain is a disease\\" - Sentence B: \\"Running is a disease\\"","response":"Sentence B: \\"Running is a disease\\" does not make sense. Explanation: A disease is typically defined as an abnormal condition that negatively affects an organism's structure, body functions or mental well-being. These are usually associated with specific symptoms, and are mostly caused by pathogens (such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi) among other factors. Sentence A, \\"Stomach pain is a disease,\\" makes sense to an extent, because although stomach pain itself is not the disease, it can be a symptom of an underlying health issue. In this context, stomach pain may be an indicator of a disease such as gastritis, ulcers, or food poisoning. However, Sentence B, \\"Running is a disease,\\" does not make sense because running is a physical activity, which is generally considered beneficial and healthy for most people. It is not related to or caused by any abnormalities, pathogens, or health issues. In some cases, running could lead to injuries if done improperly, but it still cannot be classified as a disease."},{"question":"Translate \\"Se dice que Jesús era un hombre de sufrimientos.\\" from Spanish to English.","response":"Step 1: Identify the structure and components of the sentence.

She could read and write fairly well, and had been used to helping her husband the under-steward with his accounts at Muro, but even if she had looked at the recipe she would have understood nothing of the doctor's hieroglyphics and abbreviated Latin words. The prescription was for a preparation of arsenic, which Matilde had formerly taken for some time. The chemist would not make any difficulty about preparing twenty doses of it for the Countess Macomer, though the whole quantity of arsenic contained in so many would probably be sufficient to kill one not accustomed to the medicine, if taken all at once. But though Matilde was so anxious to have the stuff before luncheon, she had a number of doses of it put away in a drawer, which she took out and counted, after Elettra had gone.

Which language is this?","response":"Galaxies are clustered due to the influence of gravity and the properties of the large-scale structure of the universe. The degree of this clustering can be explored in terms of cosmic web patterns, distribution of galaxy types, and the impact of dark matter. To understand why galaxies are clustered, we must first understand the elements that influence their formation and distribution. The universe began with the Big Bang, which led to the production of energy, particles, radiation, and eventually, matter that forms galaxies and galaxy clusters. In the beginning, the distribution of matter was not uniform, as tiny quantum fluctuations led to differences in matter density. As the universe expanded and evolved, these perturbations grew under the influence of gravity. One of the key discoveries in modern cosmology is that the large-scale structure of the universe is organized in a cosmic web pattern. This web consists of nodes, filaments, and voids. The filaments contain higher concentrations of dark matter, and the cosmic web's junction points attract and cluster galaxies due to higher gravitational pull. Dark matter, a mysterious and unidentified form of matter, accounts for approximately 85% of the matter in the universe, playing a crucial role in galaxy clustering. Gravity from dark matter holds the cosmic web together and influences galaxy distribution. The degree of galaxy clustering varies and can be expressed in terms of clustering scale and clustering strength, which depend on factors like the distribution of galaxy types, the age of the universe, and the environment's dark matter density. An essential tool that astronomers use to quantify the degree of clustering is the two-point correlation function, providing a measure of the probability that two galaxies with a particular separation distance will be found in close proximity. Different galaxy types also show variations in their degree of clustering. For example, it has been observed that galaxies dominated by old, red stars are more strongly clustered than galaxies with ongoing star formation containing young, blue stars. This difference can be credited to the various formation and evolution processes these galaxies undergo, as well as their interaction with the surrounding environment. Furthermore, advancements in astronomical surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the Dark Energy Survey, and future missions like Euclid satellite and Square Kilometre Array provide high-quality data that aid in mapping the distribution of galaxies more accurately than ever before. These surveys, in combination with computer simulations and theoretical models, have helped to constrain the degree of galaxy clustering and provide a better understanding of the role of dark matter and cosmic web in the large-scale structure of the universe. In conclusion, the clustering of galaxies is a result of the large-scale organization of matter in the universe, primarily driven by gravity and the presence of dark matter. The cosmic web pattern consisting of nodes, filaments, and voids provides a structural context for galaxy clustering. The degree of clustering varies depending on factors such as dark matter density, the distribution of galaxy types, and the age of the universe, all of which contribute to a broader understanding of cosmological properties and the evolution of the universe."},{"question":"Hoping to rebound from their embarrassing road loss to the Giants, the Seahawks returned home for a Week 6 duel with the Green Bay Packers, as head coach Mike Holmgren faced his former team for the last time.

See options at the end Tanya's eyebrows are much thicker than Cynthia's are because Possible answers: - Tanya styles them a lot more.. - Cynthia styles them a lot more..","response":"Tanya's eyebrows are much thicker than Cynthia's are because Tanya styles them a lot more. The trend for fuller, more defined eyebrows has gained traction in recent years, and Tanya's preferences seem to align with this trend. Thicker eyebrows have been associated with youthful appearances, and strong facial features, thus the desire for many people, Tanya included, to style their eyebrows in such a way. There are multiple methods and techniques to achieve thicker eyebrows, and Tanya may choose to use one or several of these techniques in her daily grooming routine. One possible approach Tanya might adopt is using an eyebrow pencil, powder, or pomade to fill in sparse areas of her eyebrows, thereby making them appear thicker. These cosmetics aid in creating a fuller, more well-defined eyebrow shape. Alternatively, she might employ grooming tools, such as a spoolie brush or a brow comb, which facilitate the brushing and setting of her eyebrows in place, helping her achieve her desired look. It is also possible that Tanya turns to a professional to shape and maintain her eyebrows regularly. In contrast, Cynthia may prefer a more natural, understated style when it comes to her eyebrows. Consequently, she styles them a lot less than Tanya. Cynthia may not opt for many of the brow-filling techniques that Tanya uses, feeling content with the natural thickness and shape of her eyebrows. It is important to note that eyebrow preferences are subjective, and there is no inherently right or wrong way to shape or style one's brows. In conclusion, thicker eyebrows can be achieved and maintained through various styling methods and the consistent use of different grooming tools. Tanya's eyebrows appear much thicker than Cynthia's because she puts more effort and time into styling them in accordance with her preferred aesthetic. On the other hand, Cynthia may appreciate and embrace her natural eyebrow look, deciding not to style them as much as Tanya does. Personal preferences and convictions shape these choices, and neither Tanya nor Cynthia is wrong in their own unique approach to styling their eyebrows."},{"question":"Mr. White looks out of his window.

Step 2: For deposits without a PAN card Typically, a person can deposit up to ₹49,999 in cash per transaction into their bank account without needing their PAN card. However, it's still pertinent to check with individual banks for their specific policies. Now, to address the second question - how much you can deposit in a bank without being noticed: This question assumes that the person would like to deposit funds without being subject to scrutiny or additional regulatory reporting. In most countries, banks are required to report large or suspicious transactions to authorities, and in India specifically, this involves transactions falling under the Financial Intelligence Unit - India (FIU-IND). However, it is important to abide by the law and report all necessary information when making a deposit. Attempting to evade regulatory requirements could lead to penalties or other legal repercussions. In conclusion, these questions are not exactly the same, as the first question focuses on deposit limits based on PAN card requirements, while the second question seems to be about avoiding additional scrutiny or reporting mandates. Nonetheless, it is essential to comply with all banking and financial regulations, irrespective of the deposit size."},{"question":"Premise: \\"This work was soon followed by full life cycle tests using other toxicants and fish species.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"Quickly afterwards a full life cycle test with other toxicants and fish species was conducted.\\" true?

Let's say you have 427 marbles and 34 fewer marbles in another bag. Now, imagine we have an unknown number of friends (we'll call this number 'z'), and each of them gets the marbles from both bags. The total number of marbles equals the sum of 1927 and 3182 marbles. Here's the original math problem: 427 * z - 34 * z = 1927 + 3182 First, we want to know how many marbles one friend would get from both bags. To find that out, we can combine the marbles from both bags, like this: (427 - 34) * z = 393 * z Now, let's add 1927 and 3182 together to find out how many marbles in total: 1927 + 3182 = 5109 marbles So, the problem now looks like this: 393 * z = 5109 To find out the number of friends (z), we'll divide the total marbles (5109) by the marbles each friend gets (393): 5109 ÷ 393 = 13 This means there are 13 friends (z=13) who shared the marbles from both bags!"},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: The given sentence contains a typo which could be one of the following four types: (1) swapped letters of a word e.g. 'niec' is a typo of the word 'nice'.

This implies that RER should be operational in the morning. The hypothesis, on the other hand, asserts that the RER does not run until late afternoon. These statements are contradictory. If the hypothesis were true, i.e., the RER doesn't run until late afternoon, one wouldn't be able to take a morning tour using the RER, as suggested in the premise.

The statues of Apollo were thought to incarnate his living presence, and these representations of illusive imaginative reality had deep roots in the Minoan period, and in the beliefs of the first Greek speaking people who entered the region during the bronze-age. Just as the Greeks saw the mountains, forests, sea and rivers as inhabited by concrete beings, so nature in all of its manifestations possesses clear form, and the form of a work of art. Spiritual life is incorporated in matter, when it is given artistic form. Just as in the arts the Greeks sought some reality behind appearances, so in mathematics they sought permanent principles which could be applied wherever the conditions were the same. Artists and sculptors tried to find this ideal order in relation with mathematics, but they believed that this ideal order revealed itself not so much to the dispassionate intellect, as to the whole sentient self.

Step-by-step reasoning:","response":"To determine the truthfulness of the statement \\"A Lullaby being played on a piano sounds bad,\\" let us examine the statement step-by-step. Step 1: Define a lullaby A lullaby is a soothing, gentle song often sung or played to help children fall asleep. Lullabies usually have simple melodies and comforting lyrics. Step 2: Consider the piano as the instrument A piano is a versatile musical instrument capable of producing a wide range of sound and tonal qualities. It can produce soft, gentle melodies as well as complex and loud compositions, depending on the way it is played and the skill of the pianist. Step 3: Examine the combination of a lullaby and piano When a lullaby is played on a piano, the piano's capabilities can be utilized to create a calming and gentle melody that mimics the soothing effects of a vocal lullaby. Given that a lullaby's purpose is to provide comfort and help induce sleep, playing one on a piano can indeed produce a pleasing and soothing ambiance. Step 4: Consider the skill of the pianist The quality of the performance will depend on the skill and interpretation of the pianist playing the lullaby. A skilled pianist can effectively convey the atmosphere of a lullaby while an unskilled pianist might struggle to do so. However, this factor is not inherently linked to the piano's capabilities as an instrument. Conclusion: The statement \\"A Lullaby being played on a piano sounds bad\\" is largely subjective and not necessarily true. The combination of a lullaby and piano can create a pleasing and soothing atmosphere, depending on the pianist's skill and interpretation."},{"question":"Here is a question about this article: The Beijing Olympic Organizing Committee sent out a team of 30 unarmed attendants selected from the People's Armed Police to escort the flame throughout its journey.

How about starting a new country? Patri Friedman is planning to do just that. He left Google years ago to set up the Seasteading Institute. And his dream is to build seasteads-----floating micro-nations in the middle of the ocean. So, what will life on a seastead be like? Probably a bit like life on a cruise liner , but much larger, with shops, gyms, swimming pools, schools and other areas. In fact, the early seasteads may actually be specially-rebuilt cruise liners. But as science advances, Friedman believes they'll become more like floating cities, with several hundred people. Seasteading raises a lot of questions. First of all, how will the new countries make money? The Seasteading Institute has suggested several money-making ideas, including ocean-based theme parks, casinos and fish farming. There's also the questions of safety. With storms, typhoons and pirates , the high seas are a dangerous place. However, the Institute says that it can stand bad weather and prevent crimes with its well-designed systems. So, is this just a day dream? Well, maybe not. One of the people behind the project is Peter Thiel. He founded PayPal and was one of the first investors in Facebook. So far, he's donated 500,000 to the project.

You can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of g, which is -270. Dividing both sides by -270: (-270*g) / -270 = 3240 / -270 This simplifies the equation to: g = -12 So, the solution to the equation -270*g = 676 + 2056 + 508 is g = -12."},{"question":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: The Time Machine This move is based on a science fiction story.

The band primarily consisted of vocalist Chrissy Amphlett and guitarist Mark McEntee. Amphlett garnered widespread attention for performing on stage in a school uniform and fishnet stockings, and often used an illuminated neon tube as a prop for displaying aggression towards both band members and the audience. Originally a five-piece, the band underwent numerous line-up changes, with Amphlett and McEntee remaining as core members, before its dissolution in 1996. Divinyls released five studio albums--four placed in the Top 10 Australian chart, while one (Divinyls) reached No. 15 in the United States (US) and No. 33 for 3 weeks in Canada. Their biggest-selling single \\"I Touch Myself\\" (1990) achieved a No. 1 ranking in Australia, No. 4 in the US, No. 10 in the United Kingdom (UK), and No. 13 in Canada. Amphlett was the cousin of 1960s Australian pop icon Patricia \\"Little Pattie\\" Amphlett, who had been married to Keith Jacobsen--younger brother of pioneer rocker Col Joye and leading promoter Kevin Jacobsen. In her autobiography Pleasure and Pain (2005), Amphlett described breaking into the music scene from the age of fourteen, being arrested for busking when seventeen and travelling in Spain, and how her performances drew upon childhood pain. Amphlett and guitarist Mark McEntee were introduced by Jeremy Paul (ex-Air Supply) in the car park of a small music venue in Collaroy, Sydney, after Amphlett and Paul had finished a gig with their then band, Batonrouge. Amphlett and McEntee met again at the Sydney Opera House where Amphlett and Paul were singing in a choral concert in 1980. They recruited keyboardist Bjarne Ohlin later in 1980 and drummer Richard Harvey in 1981, respectively, and for almost two years they performed in pubs and clubs in Sydney's Kings Cross. During this time, Paul negotiated publishing and recording agreements that led to the band signing with WEA. Australian film director Ken Cameron saw Divinyls performing in a club. This led to them providing the soundtrack for his 1982 film Monkey Grip and also gave Amphlett, Paul and McEntee supporting roles in the movie. The group released two singles from the soundtrack, Music from Monkey Grip EP, \\"Boys in Town\\", which reached No. 8 on the national singles chart, and \\"Only Lonely\\". The band was the opening act at the 1983 US Festival. After the band's initial success, original manager and bassist Jeremy Paul left. He was replaced on bass, briefly by Ken Firth (ex-The Ferrets) and more permanently by Rick Grossman (ex-Matt Finish). Grossman left in 1987 to replace Clyde Bramley in Hoodoo Gurus. By early 1988, Divinyls consisted of Amphlett and McEntee with augmentation by additional musicians when recording or touring. Over the decade Divinyls released four albums, Music from Monkey Grip EP on WEA in 1982, Desperate on Chrysalis Records in 1983, What a Life! in 1985 and Temperamental in 1988. The latter two albums were also released by Chrysalis in the US. They had hit singles in Australia with, \\"Science Fiction\\" No. 13 in 1983, \\"Good Die Young\\" No. 32 in 1984 and \\"Pleasure and Pain\\" which was written by Holly Knight and Mike Chapman (The Best, Love Is A Battlefield) and went No. 1 in 1985. Their later manager Vince Lovegrove organised Divinyls' transfer from WEA to Chrysalis and their first tours of United States. They established a fan base there, without achieving major commercial success. Divinyls also had Australian hits with cover versions of The Easybeats' \\"I'll Make You Happy\\", and Syndicate of Sound's \\"Hey Little Boy\\" (\\"Hey Little Girl\\" with the gender switched) which reached No. 25 in 1988.

Question: What happened to Alexandria after she tried to climb onto the cabinet Movie title: The Fall Movie plot: Los Angeles, 1915: stuntman Roy Walker (Lee Pace) is hospitalized, as he is bedridden and possibly paralyzed after a jump he took in his first film. He meets Alexandria (Catinca Untaru), a young Romanian-born patient in the hospital who is recovering from a broken arm, and begins to tell her a story about her namesake. Alexandria is told she has to leave, but Roy promises to tell her an epic tale if she returns the next day. The next morning, as Roy spins his tale of fantasy, Alexandria's imagination brings his characters to life. Roy's tale is about five heroes: a silent Indian warrior (Jeetu Verma), a muscular ex-slave named Otta Benga (Marcus Wesley), an Italian explosives expert called Luigi (Robin Smith), Charles Darwin (Leo Bill) with a pet monkey called Wallace, and a masked swashbuckling bandit. An evil ruler named Governor Odious (Daniel Caltagirone) has committed an offense against each of the five, who all seek revenge. The heroes are later joined by a sixth hero, a mystic. Alexandria vividly imagines her friends and people around her appearing as the characters in Roy's story. Although Roy develops affection for Alexandria, he also has an ulterior motive: by gaining her trust, he tricks her into stealing morphine from the hospital pharmacy so that he can attempt suicide; a choice driven by his love leaving him for the actor for whom he provided the stunt footage. However, Alexandria returns with only three pills, having mistaken the \\"E\\" on the piece of paper Roy gave her for a \\"3\\". The stories become a collaborative tale to which Alexandria also contributes. Alexandria herself becomes a character: while Roy is the masked bandit, she is his daughter. Roy talks Alexandria into stealing a bottle of morphine tablets locked in a fellow patient's cabinet, and then downs it all. The next morning, Roy awakens from his sleep and realizes he is only alive because his neighboring patient is receiving a placebo rather than actual morphine. Alexandria, desperate to help Roy, sneaks out of bed to the pharmacy.... The answer to this question is:","response":"In the movie \\"The Fall,\\" after Alexandria tries to climb onto the cabinet, she suffers a tragic accident. As she attempts to obtain the morphine for Roy, she loses her balance and falls, resulting in severe injuries that she must endure. This fall symbolizes both the movie's title and the visible turning point in the characters' story. Stricken with guilt and concern for Alexandria's wellbeing, Roy is forced to confront the consequences of his manipulation and selfishness. The once enchanting stories he spun to entertain the young girl now take on a somber and emotional air, with the characters facing their own struggles that mirror Roy's internal turmoil. During Alexandria's following visits, Roy continues to tell the story, but the dark and painful turn it has taken reflects his newfound understanding of the weight his actions carry. The characters in the stories face tribulations, but they also find resolution, perhaps indicating Roy's search for his own redemption. As Alexandria gets better and begins to recover, she and Roy develop a deepening bond, with his storytelling serving as a form of healing for both of them. This culminates in a powerful finale, where the movie blurs the lines between fantasy and reality. Ultimately, Alexandria's fall, while tragic, becomes the catalyst for the growth and transformation of the characters, especially Roy, who learns to confront his own demons and overcome them. The emotional arc of the story and the vivid visuals create an engaging and evocative atmosphere that has resonated with audiences and critics alike, leaving a lasting impression on those who watch \\"The Fall.\\" In deciding whether to invest in this film proposal, it's essential to consider the movie's overall impact, the depth and development of its characters, the creative visuals, and the potential for both critical acclaim and audience appreciation.

Two officers of the harbor patrol board the boat to investigate and find the living quarters in squalor and disarray. They are suddenly attacked by a rotting, bloated zombie (Captain Haggerty) which bursts from the hold, gorily killing one officer by biting his throat out, before being shot and propelled overboard by the second officer.A local reporter named Peter West (Ian McCulloch) is assigned by his hard-nosed editor (director Lucio Fulci) to the case. That evening he meets up with Anne Bowles (Tisa Farrow) the daughter of the boat's missing owner. Anne has informed the police that she has not seen her father for the past three months since he traveled to the Antilles. Meanwhile at the morgue, the pathologist and his assistant are preparing to perform an autopsy on the dead police officer, when unknown to them, the dead body begins stirring...The next morning, Peter and Anne fly to the Dominican Republic and meet an American tourist couple named Brian Hull (Al Cliver) and Susan Barrett (Auretta Gay) who are about to embark on a sailing tour of the Caribbean.

Options: - Sentence A: \\"The sky is falling.\\" - Sentence B: \\"The sky is blue.\\" Hmmm, let me think. I want to lay out the solution in details.","response":"To determine which of the given sentences is nonsensical, let's analyze each sentence individually and compare their meanings. Step 1: Consider Sentence A - \\"The sky is falling.\\" This sentence cannot be taken literally, as the sky cannot physically fall. The phrase is usually used metaphorically in the context of describing a feeling of panic, typically when a minor problem arises and causes unnecessary distress. Although it's a metaphor, it makes sense as an idiomatic expression. Step 2: Consider Sentence B - \\"The sky is blue.\\" This sentence is a simple declarative statement, describing the color of the sky. The sky does appear blue during the daytime, due to the scattering of sunlight and blue light in Earth's atmosphere. This statement makes logical sense. Step 3: Compare the sentences. Sentence A uses a metaphorical expression, while Sentence B is a straightforward statement of fact. Neither of them are completely nonsensical, but if we were to choose the one that is less sensible or more nonsensical, it would be Sentence A. Answer: Sentence A, \\"The sky is falling,\\" is more nonsensical than Sentence B because it cannot be taken literally and is a metaphor, whereas Sentence B is a literal and factual description of the sky's color."},{"question":"How does the sentence end?

Choices: - indigestion - heartburn - stomach ache - gain energy - overeating The rationale to choose \\"overeating\\" as the answer is that: A:","response":"When you eat breakfast without paying attention to the proper portion sizes or the amount of food you're consuming, you are more likely to choose \\"overeating\\" as a consequence. Let's explore the choices and the rationale behind choosing \\"overeating\\" as the answer: 1. Indigestion: Although indigestion can happen when you consume excessive amounts of food or eat too quickly, it can also be caused by other factors such as stress, certain medications, or underlying health conditions. 2. Heartburn: Like indigestion, heartburn can also result from overeating or eating too quickly, but it can often be attributed to other factors such as the type of food consumed, lying down after eating, or even pregnancy. 3. Stomach ache: Overeating or eating too quickly might lead to stomach aches, but stomach aches are not exclusively associated with breakfast and could be related to various other factors such as gas, illness, or food intolerances. 4. Gain energy: The primary purpose of eating breakfast is to gain energy as your body gets fueled after the overnight fasting period. However, this outcome is not directly related to choosing the amount of food correctly. 5. Overeating: The most logical answer is overeating, as this is the direct consequence of not choosing the amount of food correctly during breakfast. Overeating at breakfast can lead to weight gain over time and may also cause discomfort or digestive issues. Thus, the rationale behind choosing \\"overeating\\" as the answer is that it is the most obvious and direct consequence of not choosing the proper amount of food at breakfast, while the other choices could be related to various other causes."},{"question":"Consider the question.

The question asks what may have happened for him to get to his car, so let's analyze the given options. 1. He may have ran the rest of the way there: Given his determination in finding a way out of the building, this option appears the most plausible. The fact that he was willing to go up three levels to find an exit suggests he was highly motivated to find a means to escape and reach his car. Despite being a quarter-mile away, it is likely that he would try to make the effort to run the remaining distance to his car. 2. He may have given up and went back into the building: While this is a possibility, it seems less likely compared to the first option. Considering the discomfort, frustration, and effort he experienced while attempting to find a way out, it is doubtful that he would choose to go back inside. It's not a choice that falls in line with his previous actions, so this option is less probable. 3. None of the above choices: This option does not provide any alternate scenarios, and since we have plausible choices in the list, this can be dismissed as an unlikely response. 4. He may have decided to just hail a cab to get home: Although this is a possibility, it seems less likely compared to option one. Since the goal was to reach his car, hailing a cab to get home would leave his vehicle behind, which was likely not the desired outcome. Furthermore, considering the effort he made to find an exit from the building, it is plausible that he would put in the effort to cover the remaining distance to his car by running. In conclusion, option one, \\"He may have run the rest of the way there,\\" seems the most reasonable and likely course of action for the individual to reach his car given the desperation and determination he showed while trying to escape the hot and uncomfortable parking structure."},{"question":"Sasha was running late so she took a shortcut to work.

Statement 1: \\"A woman wearing a purple sport bra and black gloves and face protection boxes with a woman wearing a red shirt, red gloves and a black head protector in a boxing ring.\\" Key components: 1. Two women are involved. 2. One woman is wearing a purple sport bra, black gloves, and face protection. 3. The other woman is wearing a red shirt, red gloves, and a black head protector. 4. They are boxing (as indicated by the term \\"boxes\\"). 5. They are in a boxing ring. Statement 2: \\"Two women are boxing.\\" Key components: 1. Two women are involved. 2. They are boxing. By comparing the key components of both statements, we can make the following observations: 1. Both statements involve two women (Key components 1 in both statements). 2. Both statements indicate that the women are boxing (Key components 4 in Statement 1 and Key component 2 in Statement 2). Based on these observations, we can conclude that there is a consistency between the two statements in terms of the number of women involved and the activity they are engaged in which is boxing. However, the first statement provides more specific details about their clothing and protective gear, while the second statement only mentions that two women are boxing without any particular description of their attire. Therefore, although the second statement does not contradict the first one, it does not fully capture or describe the scenario given in the first statement. In conclusion, the premise \\"A woman wearing a purple sport bra and black gloves and face protection boxes with a woman wearing a red shirt, red gloves and a black head protector in a boxing ring\\" can be considered true under the condition \\"Two women are boxing,\\" but it should be noted that the latter statement does not encompass all the detailed information provided in the former."},{"question":"What's the most logical way to complete this passage?

I've seen enough of them  Baby Boom, Kolya, About a Boy, Mostly Martha, and to some extent, Whale Rider  to expect to be bored by the formula. What held my attention in The King of Masks was the grimness of the setting: small-town China in the 1930's. Extreme poverty was the norm, and girl children were considered so worthless to poor parents that they killed them at birth or gave them to whomever would take them on the black market. When Wang discovers his purchased grandson, whom he's nicknamed \\"Doggie,\\" is a granddaughter, he initially casts her out, even though she's showed great promise as street-performing heir. Even after he reluctantly takes her back, he's not too upset when she's kidnapped. The film is gritty then, showing the lengths to which a young, street-smart girl had to go to survive in that society. The two lead performances are believable and beguiling in their societal context. In a Western society, one would expect at least a hint of resentment from Wang at not having achieved more material success. Wang so thoroughly accepts his station as a celebrated artist with low societal status, though, that I did, too. While Doggie exhibits a level of precociousness and cunning that would be suspect in a modern, suburban child, it's completely believable in the context of a kid constantly in survival mode in a society that treats poor girls like garbage. And after learning that her previous seven owners have physically and mentally abused her, her fierce attachment to Wang makes perfect sense. The peek at small-town life in a foreign country, the naturalness of the two lead actors, the surprising plot twists, and of course, the heartwarming resolution all contribute to a very watchable film.

Here's the step-by-step solution: 1. The given equation is: 7k - 509 = -544 2. The first step is to isolate the term with the variable k, which is 7k in this case. To do that, we will add 509 to both sides of the equation (to remove -509 from the left side). This operation doesn't alter the equation, as what we do on one side, we do on the other as well. 7k - 509 + 509 = -544 + 509 3. After simplifying both sides of the equation, we get: 7k = -35 Now, we have successfully isolated the term with the variable k on the left side of the equation. 4. The next step is to find the value of k. To do this, we need to eliminate the coefficient of k, which is 7. To get rid of the coefficient, we will divide both sides of the equation by 7: 7k / 7 = -35 / 7 5.

Nuclear radiation has a certain mystery about it, partly because it cannot be detected by human senses. It can't be seen or heard, or touched or tasted, even though it may be all around us. There are other things like that. For example, radio waves are all around us but we can't detect them, sense them, without a radio receiver. Similarly, we can't sense radioactivity without a radiation detector. But unlike common radio waves, nuclear radiation is not harmless to human beings and other living things. At very high levels, radiation can kill an animal or human being immediately by killing masses of cells in vital organs. But even the lowest levels can do serious damage. There is no levels of radiation that is completely safe. If the radiation does not hit anything important, the damage may not be serious. This is the case when only a few cells are hit, and if they are killed immediately. Your body will replace the dead cells with healthy ones. But if the few cells are only damaged, and if they reproduce themselves, you may be in trouble. They can grow into cancer. Sometimes this does not show up for many years. This is another reason for some of the mystery about nuclear radiation. Serious damage can be done without the victim being aware at the time that damage has occurred.

Using skeletal muscle in this way increases its size and strength. In exercises such as running, the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more blood. Using cardiac muscle in this way increases its strength and efficiency. Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles. If you don’t use a muscle, it will get smaller and weaker—so use it or lose it. and the situation: Bill and Bob were two brothers. they were both into physical exercise, but Bill chose weight lifting, and Bob running. Answer the following question: Which brother had smaller muscles? Answer:","response":"Based on the given background, it is not possible to definitively determine which brother had smaller muscles, as both of them were involved in physical exercises that increased their muscle strength and size. However, we can infer the differences in their muscular development: 1. Bill, who chose weight lifting, focused on developing his skeletal muscles. Due to lifting weights and working against resistance, his skeletal muscles would increase in size and strength. This means that various muscle groups such as the biceps, triceps, chest, back, and legs would become more prominent and defined. 2. Bob, who chose running, focused on developing his cardiac muscles, with his heart pumping more blood and contracting faster. This results in increased strength and efficiency of the cardiac muscle. However, running also affects skeletal muscles; it primarily helps in toning and developing lean muscles (especially in the lower extremities), but the increase in size and bulk is not as significant as in weight lifting. In summary, while both brothers are developing their muscles through exercise, Bill's weight lifting would likely result in larger and more visibly defined skeletal muscles compared to Bob's running-focused exercise routine, which would lead to a leaner and more toned muscular look."},{"question":"Question: What does Paolo witness by Miriam's apartment?

The rules requiring some female athletes to get medical clearance were introduced in 2011, after South African 800-meter runner Caster Semenya was sidelined for almost a year after winning the 2009 world title when she was 18. However, the Court of Arbitration for Sport said Monday the world athletics body failed to prove that women with naturally high levels of testosterone had a competitive edge. Article continues below ... ”In the absence of such evidence, the CAS Panel was unable to conclude that hyperandrogenic female athletes may benefit from such a significant performance advantage that it is necessary to exclude them from competing in the female category,” the court’s interim ruling said in an appeal brought by sprinter Dutee Chand of India. Chand was cleared to compete by the court which gave the IAAF body until July 24, 2017, to present new scientific evidence. The IAAF’s rules on hyperandrogenism- or the presence of high levels of testosterone – will be declared void if no evidence is presented by the deadline. Responding Monday, the athletics body said the rules were passed after ”a lengthy and comprehensive consultation” with the International Olympic Committee. ”The IAAF will now meet as soon as possible with its experts and with the IOC and its experts to discuss how best to address this interim ruling,” it said in a statement. Chand, now 19, appealed to CAS after India’s athletics body barred her from competition last year, forcing her to miss the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, Scotland. She challenged the legal validity of the IAAF’s rules – at a four-day hearing at CAS in March – rather than undergo medical treatment. CAS had previously let Chand run in international events pending a verdict. In its interim ruling published Monday, the court panel of three lawyers said officials at the Monaco-based governing body had acted with good intentions. ”The panel wishes to reiterate that its conclusion does not reflect any bad faith or incompetence on the part of the IAAF,” the ruling said. In the Semenya case, she was eventually cleared by the IAAF to return to competition, and won a silver medal in the 800 at the 2012 London Olympics. The court’s 161-page ruling noted that the IAAF has dealt with other athletes under the hyperandrogenism rules since April 2011. The exact number was redacted in the document. ”None of the athletes involved has ever been named in the press as the subject of an investigation,” the ruling stated. ||||| It continued: “Nevertheless, since there are separate categories of male and female competition, it is necessary for the I.A.A.F. to formulate a basis for the division of athletes into male and female categories for the benefit of the broad class of female athletes. The basis chosen should be necessary, reasonable and proportionate to the legitimate objective being pursued.” Chand, an 18-and-under national champion in the 100 meters and an Olympic hopeful, was found to have hyperandrogenism and barred from competing against women in 2014 because her natural levels of testosterone exceeded guidelines for female athletes. Now, Chand and other women who may have similar conditions can participate in international competition, perhaps including next year’s Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. “What I had to face last year was not fair,” Chand said Monday in a statement released by Davies Ward Phillips & Vineberg L.L.P., a Toronto law firm that represented her. “I have a right to run and compete. But that right was taken away from me. I was humiliated for something that I can’t be blamed for. I am glad that no other female athlete will have to face what I have faced, thanks to this verdict.” The panel was ruling specifically on track and field’s regulation, but the Court of Arbitration for Sport’s wide jurisdiction means its decision is likely to serve as a precedent for other sports around the world. It was just the latest high-profile case to confront the intensely disputed boundaries of fairness in track and field in recent years. The South African sprinter Oscar Pistorius, for example, eventually won the right to compete at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London using prosthetics. In a case more clearly linked to that of Chand, the South African runner Caster Semenya in 2009 was barred from competition and reinstated nearly a year later after a series of sex tests and much publicity. Two opponents of Semenya’s objected to her participation in the 2009 world championships in Berlin, where she won gold in the 800 meters. ||||| Summary:","response":"The Court of Arbitration for Sport, which is like a big and important court for sports, has decided to stop some rules made by the IAAF, the authority that oversees athletics. The IAAF had made rules stating that women with high levels of male hormones, like testosterone, needed to have a special check-up before they could compete in sports. The court said that the IAAF couldn't prove that these hormones actually made the women better at sports, so the rules aren't fair. Thanks to this decision, some women who were not allowed to play sports can now compete again."},{"question":"Question: \\"What is named after a fruit?\\" Context: \\"Like the reptiles, birds are primarily uricotelic, that is, their kidneys extract nitrogenous waste from their bloodstream and excrete it as uric acid instead of urea or ammonia through the ureters into the intestine. Birds do not have a urinary bladder or external urethral opening and (with exception of the ostrich) uric acid is excreted along with feces as a semisolid waste. However, birds such as hummingbirds can be facultatively ammonotelic, excreting most of the nitrogenous wastes as ammonia. They also excrete creatine, rather than creatinine like mammals. This material, as well as the output of the intestines, emerges from the bird's cloaca. The cloaca is a multi-purpose opening: waste is expelled through it, most birds mate by joining cloaca, and females lay eggs from it. In addition, many species of birds regurgitate pellets. Males within Palaeognathae (with the exception of the kiwis), the Anseriformes (with the exception of screamers), and in rudimentary forms in Galliformes (but fully developed in Cracidae) possess a penis, which is never present in Neoaves. The length is thought to be related to sperm competition. When not copulating, it is hidden within the proctodeum compartment within the cloaca, just inside the vent. The digestive system of birds is unique, with a crop for storage and a gizzard that contains swallowed stones for grinding food to compensate for the lack of teeth. Most birds are highly adapted for rapid digestion to aid with flight. Some migratory birds have adapted to use protein from many parts of their bodies, including protein from the intestines, as additional energy during migration.\\" Answer: The answer to this question is:","response":"Kiwi - Kiwi is a fruit and also the name of a flightless bird species native to New Zealand. In the given context, kiwi is mentioned as an exception among the Palaeognathae with regard to possessing a penis.

What is worrying us is that not only young people, but also the elderly and kids are getting addicted to Phubbing. On Dec 29th, a 28-year-old woman--a mother of two in Wenzhou, drowned after she fell into a river while looking at her mobile phone.

Would \\"Working from the perspective of the customer who consumes a product or service, \\"value\\" is defined as any action or process that a customer would be willing to pay for.\\" be a reasonable answer? Select from the following. [A]. No; [B]. Yes; A:","response":"Lean manufacturing, also known as lean production, is a systematic approach to minimize waste and maximize efficiency within a production system. It primarily focuses on creating more value for customers with fewer resources by optimizing production processes to reduce any activity that does not add value to the end product. The ultimate goal of lean manufacturing is to deliver high-quality products to customers as quickly and efficiently as possible, with minimal waste. The concept of lean manufacturing was developed and popularized by Toyota in the 1950s and 60s as the Toyota Production System (TPS). The founders of this system were Taiichi Ohno and Eiji Toyoda, who sought to create a more efficient and effective production method that could compete with mass production methods used by American manufacturing companies at the time. While lean principles were initially applied to the automotive industry, their success led to adoption across various industries, such as aerospace, construction, and healthcare. The quote provided, \\"Working from the perspective of the customer who consumes a product or service, 'value' is defined as any action or process that a customer would be willing to pay for,\\" is indeed a reasonable representation of the lean manufacturing philosophy. It highlights the importance of focusing on the customer's perspective and ensuring that every step taken within the production process delivers value to the end user. This approach aids in the identification and elimination of waste within the system and ultimately helps reach the goal of providing a high-quality product or service to the customer efficiently. Therefore, the answer is [B]. Yes; the given statement is a reasonable and relevant representation of the core philosophy behind lean manufacturing."},{"question":"(1) In 1993 , he graduated from Kuban State University as a philologist and teacher of the Russian language , the same university as a lawyer in 1995 .

Article: No one can deny that buttons are an important clothing device. But, can they rise to the level of art? Organizers of an exhibit in New York think so. Peter Souleo Wright organized \\"The Button Show\\" at Rush Arts Gallery in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan. Eleven artists used the small, ordinary objects to create sculptures, portraits and wearable art. Some of the works are political, some are personal and others are just fun. Wright said each artist reimagines and repurposes the buttons to make art. \\"What I tried to do with this show,\\" he said , \\"was to look at artists who were promoting that level of craft.\\" He said he wanted the button art to be comparable to a painting \\"because of the amount of detail and precision in the work\\". Artist Beau McCall produced \\"A Harlem Hangover\\". It looks like a wine bottle that fell over on a table. A stream of connected red buttons hang over the side, like wine flowing down. Similar red buttons form a small pool on the floor. McCall layers buttons of different shapes and sizes to create the bottle. The stitching that holds them together is also part of the artistic design. For San Francisco-based artist Lisa Kokin, buttons are highly personal. After her father died in 2001, she created a portrait of him using only buttons. That memorial to her father led to other button portraits, including those of activists Rosa Parks and Cesar Chavez. Others use buttons for details. Artist Amalia Amaki of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, placed them on and around old photographs. Los Angeles artist Camilla Taylor attached buttons to three large sculptures that look like headless animals with long , narrow legs. \\"The Button Show\\" ends at March 12. The Rush Philanthropic Arts Foundation paid for the exhibition. The foundation was created in 1995 by the Simmons brothers: artist Danny, hip-hop producer Russell and rapper Rev. Run.

The song was included in their sixth studio album, also titled \\"American Woman,\\" which was released on March 9, 1970. Produced by Jack Richardson, this iconic track is widely recognized due to its catchy guitar riff and politically charged lyrics. The origin of \\"American Woman\\" can be traced back to when The Guess Who were playing a live concert in Southern Ontario. Guitarist Randy Bachman broke a string and, while replacing it, started playing a new riff as he tried to tune his guitar. The band noticed the catchy sound, and lead singer Burton Cummings joined in with impromptu lyrics. The moment was recorded on a cassette tape by a stagehand, which later became the foundation of the song. \\"American Woman\\" was not only a commercial success, reaching No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the United States, but it also became deeply embedded in popular culture and has been covered by numerous artists, including Lenny Kravitz, who released his version in 1999. The song is often perceived as a critique of U.S. politics and imperialism, though the band members have maintained that the lyrics are open to various interpretations. Regardless of the exact message, \\"American Woman\\" continues to be a classic rock staple that has endured for over five decades."},{"question":"Q: In this task, you will be shown a Persian passage and question.

Don't stop using the vaginal cream if you start menstruating. The vaginal cream will still be effective; it just may be a little messier to insert. Just make sure to use sanitary pads since tampons could absorb the cream. If you miss a dose or run out of the vaginal cream before your treatment is complete, call the doctor or pharmacist for a refill. Most vaginal creams are designed to be stored at room temperature. Check the information on the box or ask your pharmacist to be sure. Storing the cream at a temperature that's too hot or cold could damage it. It's best to store most medications in a cool, dry place. Avoid storing medication in a medicine cabinet since heat and moisture from the bathroom could cause it to be less effective or expire early. The heat of your body will cause most creams to leak out a little after you apply them to your vagina. If you can, try to use the vaginal cream at night. Laying down after you apply the cream can also keep it in your vagina longer and reduce the amount that leaks out. If you need to use vaginal creams during the day, wear a sanitary pad to avoid staining your underwear and lay down for a few minutes immediately after you apply the cream, if you can. The side effects will vary depending on what medication is in the vaginal cream. In general, side effects may include vaginal discomfort, vaginal dryness, burning or itching and potentially messy discharge from the vagina. Be sure to read the information that came with the vaginal cream. This will give you more detailed information about the specific side effects you can expect. If any side effects are causing you discomfort or you feel pain, contact your doctor. If you experience swelling of the vagina and vulva area, itching, hives, or tightness of the chest, you may be having an allergic reaction so it's important to get medication attention. Always ask your doctor if you have any questions about using the vaginal cream. You should also talk with your doctor about whether or not you need to refrain from sexual intercourse while you use the vaginal cream. What is a summary of what this article is about?","response":"The article discusses the proper use and storage of vaginal creams, emphasizing the importance of following the prescribed duration and dose. It advises against stopping the treatment during menstruation, recommending the use of sanitary pads.

El Greco was deemed incomprehensible and had no important followers. Only his son and a few unknown painters produced weak copies of his works. Late 17th- and early 18th-century Spanish commentators praised his skill but criticized his antinaturalistic style and his complex iconography. Some of these commentators, such as Antonio Palomino and Juan Agustín Ceán Bermúdez, described his mature work as \\"contemptible\\", \\"ridiculous\\" and \\"worthy of scorn\\". The views of Palomino and Bermúdez were frequently repeated in Spanish historiography, adorned with terms such as \\"strange\\", \\"queer\\", \\"original\\", \\"eccentric\\" and \\"odd\\". The phrase \\"sunk in eccentricity\\", often encountered in such texts, in time developed into \\"madness\\".With the arrival of Romantic sentiments in the late 18th century, El Greco's works were examined anew. To French writer Théophile Gautier, El Greco was the precursor of the European Romantic movement in all its craving for the strange and the extreme. Gautier regarded El Greco as the ideal romantic hero (the \\"gifted\\", the \\"misunderstood\\", the \\"mad\\"), and was the first who explicitly expressed his admiration for El Greco's later technique. French art critics Zacharie Astruc and Paul Lefort helped to promote a widespread revival of interest in his painting. In the 1890s, Spanish painters living in Paris adopted him as their guide and mentor. However, in the popular English-speaking imagination he remained the man who \\"painted horrors in the Escorial\\" in the words of Ephraim Chambers' Cyclopaedia in 1899.In 1908, Spanish art historian Manuel Bartolomé Cossío published the first comprehensive catalogue of El Greco's works; in this book El Greco was presented as the founder of the Spanish School. The same year..., can you guess it ?

Rationale: Coral reefs provide food and shelter to many ocean organisms. Coral reefs are predominantly calcite. Calcite provides food and shelter to many ocean organisms. The question and answer:","response":"Question: How do coral reefs and their composition contribute to the biodiversity and sustenance of ocean life? Answer: Coral reefs play a critical role in the overall health and well-being of marine ecosystems, providing essential support to a wide variety of organisms. They owe their structural and nutritional foundation to their primary component, calcite, which helps form the skeletons of coral polyps. These intricate structures create habitats and shelter for many ocean creatures, including fish, invertebrates, and countless microorganisms. Moreover, calcite-rich coral reefs provide surfaces for algae to grow, enabling a mutually beneficial relationship between corals and algae. The algae receive protection and access to sunlight, while the coral obtains essential nutrients through photosynthesis. Consequently, these coral-algae relationships establish a thriving food web that supports an extensive range of sea life. Overall, the interdependence within coral reef systems nourishes marine biodiversity and sustains a significant portion of ocean organisms."},{"question":"Can we conclude from \\"A crowd gathered for an outdoor wedding ceremony.\\" that \\"Family and friends gather in hawaii for the wedding.\\"?

Shearer, who has voiced 23 characters on The Simpsons including Ned Flanders and Mr Burns, is claiming 125m (£102m) in compensatory and punitive damages from the French conglomerate. Vivendi acquired the rights to This is Spinal Tap, through its subsidiary StudioCanal, in 1989. Shearer claims that since then, profits from This is Spinal Tap have not been fairly shared between its four creators, cast or crew. “This is a simple issue of artists’ rights,” said Shearer. “It is stunning that after all this time, two cinema releases, all the various home-video format releases, all the records and CDs, and all the band-themed merchandise still widely available worldwide, the only people who haven’t shared Spinal Tap’s success are those who formed the band and created the film in the first place.” Harry Shearer (@theharryshearer) I’m going up against @vivendi and @studiocanal to ensure #fairplayfairpay for the movie #SpinalTap - #fairnessrocks pic.twitter.com/fTG23OMbsW This is Spinal Tap was created by Shearer, Christopher Guest, who went on to co-write and direct dog competition mockumentary Best in Show, Rob Reiner and Michael McKean. The legal complaint alleges that between 1989 and 2006, Vivendi reported that the total income from soundtrack music sales was just 98. And in addition, it claims Vivendi reported that the four creators’ share of total worldwide merchandising income between 1984 and 2006 was 81. The lawsuit names Ron Halpern, who has been in charge of international productions and acquisitions for StudioCanal since 2007, as a co-defendant in the claim. Vivendi’s agents are named as StudioCanal and Universal Music. “Though I’ve launched this lawsuit on my own, it is in reality a challenge to the company on behalf of all creators of popular films whose talent has not been fairly remunerated,” said Shearer. “I hope this lawsuit will help set a new precedent for … fair artistic compensation industry-wide.” In 1982, the four co-creators signed an agreement with Embassy Pictures for the production, financing and distribution of This is Spinal Tap. Shearer claims the agreement included profit participation payments at 40% of net receipts bases on all sources of revenue, including merchandise and music. The film, which had a shoe-string budget of 2.25m, was released in 1984 and became a global cult classic. Vivendi acquired the rights to Spinal Tap in 1989, and Shearer’s legal action claims it began a “concerted and fraudulent campaign to hide, or grossly underreport, the film’s revenues in order to avoid its profit participation obligations”. A Vivendi spokesman declined to comment on the legal action. ||||| Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Shearer accuses Vivendi of using \\"blatantly unfair business practices\\" Harry Shearer is taking legal action against entertainment group Vivendi, claiming it has denied him and others profits from 1984's This is Spinal Tap.

It prompts the person to think back on memorable moments and experiences, and to consider the occasions and gifts that have had the most significant and positive impact on them. Question 2: What is the best gift you are ever received? This question appears to have a grammatical error, as it should probably read, \\"What is the best gift you have ever received?\\" If that is the intended question, then it has the same meaning as the first question. It also asks someone to reflect on and describe the best gift they have ever received in their life.

Now, let's think step by step:","response":"A responsible bartender would not make a drink for Millie Bobby Brown if she is underage. Here's the step-by-step thought process: 1. Determine Millie Bobby Brown's age. She was born on February 19, 2004. 2. Check the legal drinking age in the country where Millie Bobby Brown is requesting the drink. Legal drinking ages vary depending on the country, with common ages being 18 or 21 years old. 3. Compare her age with the legal drinking age. As of October 2021, Millie Bobby Brown is 17 years old. 4. Based on the comparison, if Millie Bobby Brown's age is below the legal drinking age, it is the bartender's responsibility to refuse to serve her alcohol.

Article: There are many colours in nature. But do you know that a colour has weight? I think you'll say \\"no\\". But I am afraid you are wrong. If you don't believe, you may do a small experiment . First, put two objects with the same weight into two boxes. Then cover the boxes. Wrap one box with a red piece of paper, the other with a white piece of paper. Now hold the boxes with your hand one by one. It is certain that you will think the red one is a little heavier. Why does it happen? A scientist found that different colours have different weight in a man's mind. So he did many tests and at last he got the result. That is to say, every colour has its own weight in our mind. The heaviest colour is red, then blue, green, orange, yellow and white. The scientists told us that colours also have smell. Can you smell the colour? Of course not. Then why did the scientists say so? That is because every colour represents a kind of light wave ------ a certain wavelength . It reaches our brain through organs According to this discovery, scientists say that people accept the colour they like, and _ the colour they hate. So your body and mind will be healthy by using the colours you like. Or you'll be nervous or even get ill. If you stay in a room with red windows, wallpapers and furniture for two hours, you'll feel you have been there for four hours. But if the room is blue, you'll feel you have been there for only one hour. Another example, if a person walks out of a red room and into a blue room, his temperature will fall.

Ennius translated the work of Graeco-Sicilian Euhemerus, who explained the genesis of the gods as apotheosized mortals. In the last century of the Republic, Epicurean and particularly Stoic interpretations were a preoccupation of the literate elite, most of whom held - or had held - high office and traditional Roman priesthoods; notably, Scaevola and the polymath Varro. For Varro - well versed in Euhemerus' theory - popular religious observance was based on a necessary fiction; what the people believed was not itself the truth, but their observance led them to as much higher truth as their limited capacity could deal with. Whereas in popular belief deities held power over mortal lives, the skeptic might say that mortal devotion had made gods of mortals, and these same gods were only sustained by devotion and cult. The spread of all things Greek provided what for the interpretation of Rome's religions?","response":"The spread of Greek literature, mythology, and philosophy gave Roman poets and people who study old things a way to better understand and explain Rome's holidays, rituals, and stories about gods and heroes. They used ideas from Greek writers and thinkers, like Euhemerus, who said that gods were once just people who became gods because of their great actions. Some smart Romans, like Varro, thought that people's beliefs about gods were not exactly true but were still useful because they helped people learn about important ideas in a simple way.

But the Pentagon said that Baghdadi's fate remained unclear. The IS chief allegedly broke a months-long silence in May by releasing an audio message in which he urged Muslims to emigrate to the \\"caliphate\\" that the group has proclaimed in areas of Syria and Iraq. But his only public appearance on video has been to deliver a sermon in Mosul after IS took the northern Iraqi city last year. Before then, there were only two authenticated photos of him. The IS chief also appears to wear a mask to address his commanders, earning the nickname \\"the invisible sheikh\\". But Baghdadi - a nom de guerre, rather than his real name - has good reason to maintain a veil of mystery, says the BBC's Security Correspondent, Frank Gardner. One of his predecessors, Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi who headed the most violent jihadist group in Iraq until his death, was a high-profile showman whose secret location was eventually tracked down. He was killed in a US bombing raid in 2006. He may be a shadowy figure, but the organisation he leads is pulling in thousands of new recruits and has become one of the most cohesive militias in the Middle East, our correspondent adds. Baghdadi is believed to have been born in Samarra, north of Baghdad, in 1971. Reports suggest he was a cleric in a mosque in the city around the time of the US-led invasion in 2003. Some believe he was already a militant jihadist during the rule of Saddam Hussein. Others suggest he was radicalised during the four years he was held at Camp Bucca, a US facility in southern Iraq where many al-Qaeda commanders were detained. He emerged as the leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq, one of the groups that later became Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS), in 2010, and rose to prominence during the attempted merger with al-Nusra Front in Syria. He did not swear allegiance to the leader of the al-Qaeda network, Zawahiri, who had urged ISIS to focus on Iraq and leave Syria to al-Nusra. Baghdadi and his fighters have openly defied the al-Qaeda chief, leading some commentators to believe he now holds higher prestige among many Islamist militants. Zawahiri still has a lot of power by virtue of his franchises in Pakistan and the Arabian Peninsula and North Africa. But Baghdadi has a reputation as a highly organised and ruthless battlefield tactician, which analysts say makes his organisation more attractive to young jihadists than that of Zawahiri, an Islamic theologian. In October 2011, the US officially designated Baghdadi as \\"terrorist\\" and offered a 10m (Â£5.8m; 7.3m euros) reward for information leading to his capture or death. It notes Baghdadi's aliases, including Abu Duaa and Dr Ibrahim Awwad Ibrahim Ali al-Badri al-Samarrai. As well as the uncertainty surrounding his true identity, his whereabouts are also unclear with reports he was in Raqqa in Syria. So there remain more questions than answers about the leader of one of the world's most dangerous jihadist groups. What is a summary of this text?","response":"This text is about a mysterious and dangerous man named Baghdadi, who is the leader of a group called IS. People don't know much about him and where he is, but they do know that he is very good at leading his group and making it powerful.

Stream of Consciousness Reasoning: When reading a text, it's essential to identify the main idea, as it serves as the foundation for understanding the author's intended message. The primary role of any text is to communicate thoughts and ideas in an organized manner, and the main idea is essentially the topic around which the author's arguments revolve. Without a clear understanding of the main idea, other components of the text, such as supporting details, lose their coherence, rendering the entire piece less effective. To locate the main idea, one should start with the title and any headings provided, as this will offer an initial understanding of the theme of the piece. The next step is to thoroughly read the entire text, paying close attention to the introductory and concluding paragraphs. Often, the author will introduce their main point at the beginning and reiterate it at the end, providing readers with essential context. Another useful strategy involves examining individual paragraphs, as the first or last sentences may summarize the main argument discussed in those particular sections. Additionally, it is necessary to differentiate between the main idea and supporting details. The main idea is the overarching message or concept presented in the text, while the supporting details assist in fleshing out and strengthening the main idea by providing specific examples, facts, or anecdotes. By maintaining awareness of this distinction, readers can better focus on the key points the author seeks to convey. The ability to locate the main idea of a text is crucial not only for accurate comprehension but also for effectively summarizing and discussing the material with others. It fosters critical thinking skills and aids in the synthesis of new information, ultimately enriching one's knowledge and understanding of various subjects.

This battle saw the unsupported division of General Douay of I Corps, with some attached cavalry, which was posted to watch the border, attacked in overwhelming but uncoordinated fashion by the German 3rd Army. During the day, elements of a Bavarian and two Prussian corps became engaged and were aided by Prussian artillery, which blasted holes in the defenses of the town. Douay held a very strong position initially, thanks to the accurate long-range fire of the Chassepots but his force was too thinly stretched to hold it. Douay was killed in the late morning when a caisson of the divisional mitrailleuse battery exploded near him; the encirclement of the town by the Prussians threatened the French avenue of retreat.\\" Answer: A:","response":"The main cause of General Douay's failure in the first action of the Franco-Prussian War on 4 August 1870 can be attributed to several factors: 1. Unsupported Division: General Douay's division was posted to watch the border without sufficient backup forces. This left his division vulnerable as they faced the overwhelming German 3rd Army. 2. Thinly Stretched Force: Douay's strong initial position was undermined by having his forces spread too thin, which made it difficult for them to effectively hold their defensive position. This issue was compounded as the battle raged on and his troops faced continued pressure. 3. Prussian Artillery Advantage: The Prussian artillery contributed heavily to breaking the defenses of the town. They were able to blast holes through the French positions, thereby weakening their defenses and making it easier for the German forces to overtake them. 4. Loss of General Douay: The death of General Douay in the late morning when a caisson of the divisional mitrailleuse battery exploded near him dealt a significant blow to the morale and leadership of his troops, further contributing to the failure of his forces. 5. Encirclement and Threatened Retreat: The encirclement of the town by the Prussians made the French avenue of retreat increasingly difficult, leading to a higher possibility of the division being trapped and unable to withdraw successfully. In summary, General Douay's failure in the first action of the Franco-Prussian War resulted from a combination of inadequate support, thinly stretched forces, superior enemy artillery, the loss of their leader, and the encirclement that threatened their retreat. These factors cumulatively weakened the French defense and ultimately led to Douay's defeat."},{"question":"Q: Is this product review positive?

Note that \\"flipping\\" a word in the question can give rise to a new question where the answer will be different from the original question. Often, \\"flipping\\" a word gives rise to flipping the direction of the relationship, for example, from \\"increase\\" to \\"decrease.\\" Background Paragraph: As a cell grows, its volume increases more quickly than its surface area. If a cell was to get very large, the small surface area would not allow enough nutrients to enter the cell quickly enough for the cell’s needs. This idea is explained in Figure below . However, large cells have a way of dealing with some size challenges. Big cells, such as some white blood cells, often grow more nuclei so that they can supply enough proteins and RNA for the cell’s requirements. Large, metabolically active cells often have lots of cell protrusions, resulting in many folds throughout the membrane. These folds increase the surface area available for transport of materials into or out of the cell. Such cell types are found lining your small intestine, where they absorb nutrients from your food through protrusions called microvilli . Story: Mike is studying for his biology exam. He found that all body cells are not equal in size - some are large and some are small. He labeled the large cells as class A cells. Then he labeled the small cells as class B cells. He is now prepared to find the differences between them.

The league introduced team sponsorship by association football clubs. It used the slogan 'The Beautiful Race: Football at 300 km/h'. By 2011 the link with football was fading with more than half the teams no longer associated with football teams. It was founded by businessmen Alex Andreu and Robin Webb. On 19 May 2010, Andreu stepped down in his role as series president, with his successor named as Alfredo Brisac not many weeks later. The season ran between April and November at the same time as most other European race series. Every team used identical cars and 750-horsepower V-12 engines. The Sonangol Group was the series' title sponsor from June 2009 until the end of the 2010 season. - Donington Park is a motorsport circuit located near Castle Donington in Leicestershire, England. The circuit business is now owned by MotorSport Vision, and the surrounding Donington Park Estate is currently under lease by MotorSport Vision until 2038. - The 2009 Superleague Formula season was the second Superleague Formula championship . The series was rebranded the \`\` Superleague Formula by Sonangol '' for this season and also 2010 with the Angolan oil company becoming the title sponsor . It began on June 28 at Magny - Cours and finished on November 8 at Jarama . The field remained at 18 clubs for the 2009 season but Beijing Guoan did not return to try to retain the title which they won with Davide Rigon in 2008 , however Rigon did return in the car of Olympiacos CFP despite GP2 commitments .

Is the following sentence factually correct? \\"Police brutality became outlawed by the United States.\\" Options: - yes - no","response":"To answer this question, let's break it down step-by-step. Step 1: Understand the meaning of the sentence The sentence states that \\"police brutality became outlawed by the United States.\\" This means that at some point in time, the United States government has officially made police brutality illegal. Step 2: Analyze the facts Police brutality is defined as the excessive or unwarranted use of force by law enforcement against civilians. In the United States, any kind or form of excessive use of force by the police is generally considered a violation of the law and the constitution, more specifically, the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures. However, while excessive force is legally prohibited in the United States, there is no specific federal law or nationwide legislation that explicitly outlaws police brutality. Rather, the laws that govern the use of force by law enforcement officers vary from state to state and can often be subject to interpretation. In response to public concerns about police brutality, the Department of Justice (DOJ) is authorized to investigate and potentially prosecute instances where law enforcement officers violate individuals' civil rights, but these actions are taken on a case-by-case basis, and not as a result of a comprehensive federal law. Step 3: Answer the question Considering the information analyzed in step 2, the answer to the question is: - Option 2: No The sentence \\"Police brutality became outlawed by the United States\\" is not factually correct because there is no specific federal law or nationwide legislation that explicitly outlaws police brutality. Instead, excessive force and misuse of authority by law enforcement are addressed through case-by-case investigations and enforcement actions under existing civil rights laws."},{"question":"Title: It's disappointing Product review: This game is GREAT... for a short time.

Lukather won three of his five Grammy Awards for work with Toto, twice as an artist and once as a producer. David Paich led the band's songwriting efforts during the development of 1978's Toto—he penned all but two of the album's tracks, including all four of its singles. Lukather also credits Jeff Porcaro for his leadership within the band during that period. However, Lukather's role in Toto evolved over time owing to the changing needs of the band. In August 1992, Jeff Porcaro collapsed while doing yard work at home and subsequently died of heart failure. The death profoundly affected Toto and Lukather in particular, who felt that he needed to step up and make sure the band kept going. Thus, he began taking more of a leadership role. Toto went through several lead vocalists over the years, including Bobby Kimball, Fergie Frederiksen, and Joseph Williams. After the 1990 dismissal of their fourth vocalist, Jean-Michel Byron, Toto was without a lead singer until around 1997; Lukather assumed most of the vocal duties for the band during that time. He performed lead vocals for every track on 1992's Kingdom of Desire and 1995's Tambu except for two instrumental tracks. The Tambu single \\"I Will Remember\\", co-written by Lukather and Stan Lynch, reached number 64 on UK charts. Some Tambu reviewers contrasted Lukather's vocals with those of former singers Kimball and Williams (and indeed, heavily criticized the entire album), some concert reviewers noted that he struggled vocally on certain songs, and a number of backup singers and guest vocalists accompanied the band's live shows during that period. It was not until Toto brought back Williams and Kimball to collaborate on 1998's Toto XX that Lukather returned predominantly to the role of backup vocalist.Lukather's songwriting contributions grew from a smattering of tracks on early Toto albums to co-writing..., what would be the answer ? Answer:","response":"The answer to the question \\"What is the name of the hit single by the man who was intimated by the talent of the band's chief songwriter?\\" is \\"I Will Remember.\\" This hit single is from the 1995 Toto album Tambu, and it was co-written by Steve Lukather, who took on a more significant role in the band after the death of Jeff Porcaro, and Stan Lynch."},{"question":"Reconstruct a question, answer pair from this explanation: He needs 48 pounds of flour because 12 x 4 = 48.

Question: Where was the art of carpet weaving first significant? Context: The art of carpet weaving was particularly significant in the Ottoman Empire, carpets having an immense importance both as decorative furnishings, rich in religious and other symbolism, and as a practical consideration, as it was customary to remove one's shoes in living quarters. The weaving of such carpets originated in the nomadic cultures of central Asia (carpets being an easily transportable form of furnishing), and was eventually spread to the settled societies of Anatolia. Turks used carpets, rugs and kilims not just on the floors of a room, but also as a hanging on walls and doorways, where they provided additional insulation. They were also commonly donated to mosques, which often amassed large collections of them.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","response":"To answer the question, let's analyze the given process and the impact of increased carbon dioxide emissions on it: 1. Water gets into cracks in rocks - No direct effect from increased carbon dioxide levels. The water entering the rocks is mainly due to factors like rain or groundwater flow, which may be affected by an overall change in the climate due to increased carbon dioxide emissions. This can be considered an indirect effect. 2. The water freezes into ice - Increased carbon dioxide emissions contribute to global warming, which might reduce the frequency and instances of water freezing. This can be considered an indirect impact on this step of the process, as it doesn't directly affect the freezing of water but influences the overall climate and temperature. 3. The cracks expand - This step is a result of the water freezing into ice, which is indirectly impacted by increased carbon dioxide emissions. There's no direct impact on the expansion of cracks. 4. Over time, the rocks split - The primary cause for the splitting of rocks is the expansion of cracks due to ice. Since the freezing step is indirectly affected by higher carbon dioxide levels, the splitting of rocks can also be considered indirectly impacted. 5. The rocks are now in smaller pieces - This is the final result of the whole process. As the previous steps were indirectly affected by the increased carbon dioxide emissions, the production of smaller rock pieces can also be considered indirectly impacted.

No. The statement provided \\"As of 2012, Dubai is the 22nd most expensive city in the world, and the most expensive city in the Middle East, surpassing Israel 's Tel Aviv (31st)\\" provides valuable information about Dubai's economic standing within the global and regional context, but it does not answer the initial question which is \\"What country is Dubai in?\\" The correct answer to this question is: Dubai is in the United Arab Emirates. Dubai is one of the seven emirates that make up the United Arab Emirates. The other emirates include Abu Dhabi (which is the capital city of the UAE), Sharjah, Ajman, Umm Al Quwain, Ras Al Khaimah and Fujairah. The United Arab Emirates is a federal sovereign state in the eastern part of the Arabian Peninsula, situated at the entrance of the Persian Gulf. It shares borders with Oman and Saudi Arabia. Dubai itself, perhaps the most commonly recognized emirate, is known on a global scale for its extravagant architectural accomplishments, luxury shopping, and deep rooted cultural heritage. The country boasts state-of-the-art buildings such as the Burj Khalifa, which at over 828 meters, remains the tallest structure and building in the world since 2009. Dubai also houses the largest shopping mall in the world by total area, Dubai Mall. Furthermore, the emirate is famous for its palm-shaped artificial archipelagos, namely the Palm Jumeirah and Palm Jebel Ali. Besides this, Dubai also plays an important role economically as it has become a global city and a business hub. Although Dubai's economy was historically based on the oil industry, the emirate's economy has diversified and has become less dependent on oil. Currently, its economy focuses more on tourism, aviation, real estate, and financial services. The addition of the information about Dubai being the 22nd most expensive city in the world and the most expensive in the Middle East shows its global economic significance. This illustrates the high cost of living in Dubai, indicating the prosperity and high living standards present in the city. To sum up, while the economic information about Dubai is useful in a comprehensive discussion about the emirate, it does not straightforwardly answer the question about which country Dubai is located in.

Answer:","response":"The color of the Hammersmith & City Line on the London Underground map is pink."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: - The liver produces bile - The liver produces proteins for blood plasma - The liver converts excess glucose into glycogen for storage - The liver converts ammonia to urea - The liver regulates blood clotting. What might be the first step of the process? A:","response":"The liver is a crucial organ in the human body, responsible for a wide array of critical functions, including bile production, protein synthesis for blood plasma, glucose storage, ammonia conversion to urea, and regulation of blood clotting. The first step in understanding these complex processes is to learn about the liver's structure and its specialized cells called hepatocytes. The liver is divided into lobules, which are the functional units of this organ. Each lobule features a central vein surrounded by thin plates of hepatocytes, which are responsible for carrying out the various tasks of the liver. These hepatocytes are lined with sinusoids, small blood vessels that allow the exchange of nutrients, oxygen, metabolites, and waste products between the hepatic cells and the blood. Considering the processes mentioned in the question, the first step in each process varies: 1. Bile production: The first step involves the hepatocytes synthesizing bile salts, cholesterol, and phospholipids. These components are then secreted into small bile canaliculi, which merge to form larger bile ducts. The bile eventually drains into the gallbladder for storage and concentration before being released into the small intestine to aid in fat digestion. 2. Protein synthesis for blood plasma: The liver produces a range of essential proteins for blood plasma, including albumin, clotting factors, and transport proteins. The first step in this process is the transcription of genes encoding these proteins, followed by translation of mRNA into the specific protein in the hepatocytes' endoplasmic reticulum. The proteins are then modified, folded, and transported through the Golgi apparatus for secretion into the blood. 3. Glucose storage: When the blood glucose levels are high, the liver converts excess glucose into glycogen for storage. The first step in this process is glucose uptake by hepatocytes via glucose transporters (GLUT2), followed by the conversion of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate by the enzyme glucokinase. Consequently, glucose-6-phosphate is converted into glycogen through a series of steps catalyzed by various enzymes like glycogen synthase. 4. Ammonia conversion to urea: The liver plays a crucial role in detoxifying the body by converting harmful ammonia to less toxic urea in a cycle called the urea cycle. The first step involves the formation of carbamoyl phosphate from ammonia and bicarbonate, catalyzed by the enzyme carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I. 5. Regulation of blood clotting: The liver synthesizes various clotting factors essential in the coagulation cascade. The initial step in this process is the transcription of genes encoding clotting factors in the hepatocytes, followed by translation and protein synthesis, similar to the process mentioned earlier for blood plasma proteins. From the above explanation, it is clear that the first step in each process varies depending on its complexity and the specific role of the liver. However, breaking them down into individual stages enables a better understanding of the liver's remarkable ability to perform various crucial tasks simultaneously, ensuring the body's proper functioning."},{"question":"Information: - Pope Alexander III (c. 1100/1105 30 August 1181), born Roland of Siena, was Pope from 7 September 1159 to his death in 1181. - Herbert of Bosham was a twelfth - century English biographer of Thomas Becket who held a foremost place among the scholars in Thomas 's household .

In the 1930s and 1940s, discussions on character simplification took place within the Kuomintang government, and a large number of Chinese intellectuals and writers have long maintained that character simplification would help boost literacy in China. Indeed, this desire by the Kuomintang to simplify the Chinese writing system (inherited and implemented by the Communist Party of China) also nursed aspirations of some for the adoption of a phonetic script based on the Latin script, and spawned such inventions as the Gwoyeu Romatzyh.

As the musical prelude climaxes, Woglinde and Wellgunde are seen at play in the depths of the Rhine. Flosshilde joins them after a gentle reminder of their responsibilities as guardians of the gold. They are observed by the Nibelung dwarf Alberich who calls out to them: \\"I'd like to draw near if you would be kind to me\\". The wary Flosshilde cries: \\"Guard the gold! Father warned us of such a foe\\". When Alberich begins his rough wooing the maidens relax: \\"Now I laugh at my fears, our enemy is in love\\", says Flosshilde, and a cruel teasing game ensues. First, Woglinde pretends to respond to the dwarf's advances but swims away as he tries to embrace her. Then Wellgunde takes over, and Alberich's hopes rise until her sharp retort: \\"Ugh, you hairy hunchbacked clown!\\" Flosshilde pretends to chastise her sisters for their cruelty and feigns her own courtship, by which Alberich is quite taken in until she suddenly tears away to join the others in a mocking song. Tormented with lust, Alberich furiously chases the maidens over the rocks, slipping and sliding as they elude him, before he sinks down in impotent rage. At this point the mood changes: as a sudden brightness penetrates the depths, a magical golden light reveals, for the first time, the Rhinegold on its rock. The maidens sing their ecstatic greeting to the gold, which rouses Alberich's curiosity. In response to his question Woglinde and Wellgunde reveal the gold's secret: measureless power would belong to the one who could forge a ring from it. Flosshilde scolds them for giving this secret away, but her concerns are dismissed—only someone who has forsworn love can obtain the gold, and Alberich is clearly so besotted as to present no danger. But their confidence is misplaced; in his humiliation Alberich decides that world mastery is more desirable than love. As the maidens continue to jeer his antics he scrambles up the rock and, uttering a curse on love, seizes the gold and disappears, leaving the Rhinemaidens to dive after him bewailing their loss. The answer is:","response":"Woglinde and Wellgunde. Flosshilde pretends to chastise her sisters Woglinde and Wellgunde for their cruelty towards Alberich."},{"question":"Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What was the name of the EP released exclusively on iTunes? ?

Physical reasoning mainly deals with understanding the laws and properties of matter, energy, force, motion, and their interactions. A suitable task must account for the following aspects of physical reasoning: 1. Spatial Awareness: The task should involve identifying spatial arrangements of objects, considering their dimensions, shapes, and positions. 2. Force and Motion: It should involve an understanding of how forces affect the movement of objects, including concepts such as inertia, friction, gravity, and momentum. 3. Energy: The task could relate to the transfer and transformation of energy, encompassing kinetic, potential, thermal, and other forms of energy. 4. Properties of Matter: Understanding the properties and behaviors of various materials, as well as concepts like density, volume, and mass, could factor into the task's problem-solving requirements. 5. Cause and Effect: The task should demonstrate how different variables impact one another, enabling the individual to anticipate outcomes based on the laws of physics. Here's a detailed example of a task that tests physical reasoning: Task: Design and build a Rube Goldberg machine using household objects. Objective: The goal is to use a series of simple machines to achieve a specific result, such as ringing a bell or popping a balloon, within a set time limit. Requirements: 1. The machine must incorporate a minimum of five distinct simple machines (e.g., lever, pulley, inclined plane, wheel and axle, and screw). 2. The machine must function using the assigned objects, which may include dominos, balls, books, cups, and other everyday items. 3. The participants must predict and explain the behavior of each object in their machine and understand how it contributes to the overall chain reaction. 4. To optimize the machine's efficiency, participants should consider the spatial arrangement, energy conservation, and motion of each object according to the laws of physics. 5. The participants must also consider and troubleshoot potential issues such as inertia, friction, and imprecise object placement. Evaluation: Participants will be assessed on their ability to accurately predict and describe the interactions between objects, their understanding of the physical principles involved, and the successful completion of the objective. Additional factors, such as creativity and efficient use of resources, may also be considered. In conclusion, a task that tests physical reasoning should be designed to stimulate problem solving and critical thinking skills in the context of physical concepts. The practical application of these concepts, as seen in tasks such as designing a Rube Goldberg machine, can help individuals better understand and predict the behavior of objects and their interactions, ultimately demonstrating proficiency in physical reasoning."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: The man loved to fish bass, to be happy all he needed was a boat, his equipment, and a what?

The character has to be cautious about her expenses, another typical challenge faced by many humans living in a modern society with an economy. Even though these factors provide some context that may suggest the person in the story is a human, there are also elements that create ambiguity: 1. The story alludes to the Stronghold, which implies that the setting may take place in a fantastical, mythical, or futuristic world. It is not clear how humans or other races/species exist within this context. 2. The passage specifically mentions \\"her Power,\\" which has awoken 11 times before, leading to her death on seven occasions and madness on four others. This element of supernatural power and resurrection is not something commonly associated with humans, and it could suggest that the character is either part of a different species or possesses magical or supernatural abilities. Taking both perspectives into consideration, we cannot conclusively determine if the person in this story is a human or not without further information. The presence of supernatural abilities and references to concepts like the Stronghold adds ambiguity and uncertainty to make a definitive judgment."},{"question":"Read the following article and answer the question. it 's lunchtime & everyone 's out . so here beside the windows i can hear the raindrops patting . reminds me of the time when i chose not to sit at my usual seat during higherchinese , and moved to someone near the windows instead . we were asked to write a compo , and i got inspired by the rain outside .

Question: A single troy ounce of gold was equal to how many grains in 1965? Context: The Gold Standard Act of 1900 abandoned the bimetallic standard and defined the dollar as 23.22 grains (1.505 g) of gold, equivalent to setting the price of 1 troy ounce of gold at 20.67. Silver coins continued to be issued for circulation until 1964, when all silver was removed from dimes and quarters, and the half dollar was reduced to 40% silver. Silver half dollars were last issued for circulation in 1970. Gold coins were confiscated by Executive Order 6102 issued in 1933 by Franklin Roosevelt. The gold standard was changed to 13.71 grains (0.888 g), equivalent to setting the price of 1 troy ounce of gold at 35. This standard persisted until 1968. The answer to this question is:","response":"In 1965, a single troy ounce of gold was equal to 480 grains. This is because the gold standard was changed in 1933 with the Executive Order 6102 issued by Franklin Roosevelt. The new standard was set at 13.71 grains (0.888 g), which is equivalent to setting the price of 1 troy ounce of gold at 35. To find the number of grains in a troy ounce during 1965, we need to convert 1 troy ounce of gold into grains using the gold standard of 13.71 grains (0.888 g). Since 1 troy ounce is equal to 31.1035 grams and there are 0.0648 grams in a grain, we can calculate the grains as follows: 1 troy ounce = 31.1035 grams 1 grain = 0.0648 grams 1 troy ounce = 31.1035 grams / (0.0648 grams/grain) 1 troy ounce = 480 grains So, in 1965, a single troy ounce of gold was equal to 480 grains."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Article: Youth, friendship and love are the main themes of this year's Chinese movies, such as So Young(<<>> ) and American Dreams in China(<<>> ).

Upminster and Wimbledon are termini of which London Underground line?","response":"Upminster and Wimbledon are termini of the District line of the London Underground network. The District line is one of the twelve lines that make up the London Underground system and is recognized by its green color on the Tube map. The District line runs from Upminster in the east and branches out to several termini in the west, including Wimbledon in the southwest. Upminster is situated in the London Borough of Havering, and Wimbledon is located in the London Borough of Merton. These termini form part of the 60 stations along the District line, which covers a total route length of approximately 40 miles (64 kilometers). The District line originally opened in 1868, and it operates using sub-surface rolling stock, meaning that it runs below ground level but not as deep as the deep-level tube lines like the Victoria or Northern lines. The line operates using the D78 Stock and S7 Stock train models, which have features such as wider doorways and open gangways to facilitate easier movement between cars. The District line connects several major transport hubs in London, such as Tower Hill, Embankment, Victoria, and Earl's Court. It also serves several notable landmarks and tourist attractions, including the Tower of London, the Natural History Museum, Stamford Bridge (home of Chelsea Football Club), and the Wimbledon Tennis Championships. Owing to the fact that the District line travels through many densely populated areas and caters to an array of commuters, it is known for being one of the busiest lines in the London Underground network. Additionally, the line's diverse route structure, multiple branches, and high ridership often contribute to various operational challenges and delays. Regardless of these difficulties, the District line remains a vital mode of transportation for residents and visitors alike, linking important destinations across the metropolitan area."},{"question":"Question: What key details about hannah russell can be extracted from the following bio?

In 1908 Shuman formed the Sun Power Company with the intent of building larger solar power plants. He, along with his technical advisor A.S.E. Ackermann and British physicist Sir Charles Vernon Boys, developed an improved system using mirrors to reflect solar energy upon collector boxes, increasing heating capacity to the extent that water could now be used instead of ether.

It's not denser: Unlike latewood, earlywood is not described as dense in the text. The latewood of hard pines is depicted as 'very dense', implying that earlywood is less dense. 2. It does not present a strong demarcation of growth rings: The text mentions that latewood shows more clearly demarcated growth rings, implying that earlywood does not provide such clear demarcation. 3. It's not darker/deep-colored: The context specifies latewood being deep-colored, indicating a contrast to earlywood, which is therefore not deep-colored. 4. It does not produce heavier pieces of wood: This could be inferred because it is stated that heavier pieces of pine contain more latewood, suggesting that earlywood is not as heavy. 5. It does not contribute significantly to the contrast within the growth ring: The text mentions a strong contrast between the latewood and earlywood in hard pines, with the implication that the earlywood is less contrasted, or paler due to its straw color.

John sends electricity through container A. Just as he is about to activate the electricity for container B, the power goes out, and he is unable to do so. Frustrated, John goes to find the circuit breaker to see if a fuse has blown. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Will the gas in container A have a higher or lower energy level than container B? Hint: Noble gases are also used to fill the glass tubes of lighted signs like the one in the Figure below . Although noble gases are chemically nonreactive, their electrons can be energized by sending an electric current through them. When this happens, the electrons jump to a higher energy level. When the electrons return to their original energy level, they give off energy as light. Different noble gases give off light of different colors. Neon gives off reddish-orange light, like the word “Open” in the sign below. Krypton gives off violet light and xenon gives off blue light. Answer:","response":"The gas in container A will have a higher energy level than the gas in container B. This is because when electricity is sent through a noble gas, its electrons are energized, causing them to jump to a higher energy level. When the electrons return to their original energy level, they give off energy as light, indicating that the gas has been energized. Since container A has had electricity sent through it and container B has not, the gas in container A will have a higher energy level than the gas in container B."},{"question":"We support a number of humanitarian and charitable projects around the world.

It shares the same 2-oxo-pyrrolidone base structure with pyroglutamic acid. Piracetam is a cyclic derivative of GABA (gamma-Aminobutyric acid). Presently piracetam is used in many European countries, Asia and South America. In the United States, it is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for any medical use and it is not permitted to be sold as a dietary supplement. In the UK, piracetam is prescribed mainly for myoclonus, but is used off-label for other conditions. Evidence to support its use for many conditions is unclear. - Levetiracetam, marketed under the trade name Keppra among others, is a medication used to treat epilepsy. It is used for partial onset, myoclonic, or tonic-clonic seizures. It is the S-enantiomer of etiracetam. - Phenylpiracetam (INN: fonturacetam, brand names Phenotropil, Carphedon), also called is a phenylated analog of the drug piracetam which was developed in 1983 in Russia where it is available as a prescription drug. Research on animals has indicated that phenylpiracetam may have anti-amnesic, antidepressant, anticonvulsant, antipsychotic, anxiolytic, and memory enhancement effects. - Anticonvulsants (also commonly known as antiepileptic drugs or as antiseizure drugs) are a diverse group of pharmacological agents used in the treatment of epileptic seizures. Anticonvulsants are also increasingly being used in the treatment of bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder, since many seem to act as mood stabilizers, and for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Anticonvulsants suppress the rapid and excessive firing of neurons during seizures. Anticonvulsants also prevent the spread of the seizure within the brain. Some investigators have observed that anticonvulsants themselves may cause reduced IQ in children. However these adverse effects must be balanced against the significant risk epileptic seizures pose to children and the distinct possibility of death and devastating neurological sequelae secondary to seizures. Anticonvulsants are more accurately called antiepileptic drugs (abbreviated \\"AEDs\\"), and are often referred to as antiseizure drugs because they provide symptomatic treatment only and have not been demonstrated to alter the course of epilepsy. - Etiracetam is a chemical compound belonging to the racetam family, which was developed as a nootropic drug. It is racemic; its biologically active enantiomeric form is levetiracetam, now marketed as an antiepileptic drug. - Stimulants (also referred to as psychostimulants) is an overarching term that covers many drugs including those that increase activity of the body, drugs that are pleasurable and invigorating, or drugs that have sympathomimetic effects. Due to their rendering a characteristic \\"up\\" feeling, stimulants are also occasionally referred to as \\"uppers\\". Depressants or \\"downers\\", which decrease mental and/or physical function, are in stark contrast to stimulants and are considered to be the functionally opposite drug class. Stimulants are widely used throughout the world as prescription medicines as well as without a prescription (either legally or illicitly) as performance-enhancing or recreational drugs. The most frequently prescribed stimulants as of 2013 were lisdexamfetamine, methylphenidate, and amphetamine. It is estimated that the percent of the population that has abused amphetamines, cocaine and MDMA combined is between .8% and 2.1%. - Motivation is a theoretical construct used to explain behaviour. It gives the reasons for people's actions, desires, and needs. Motivation can also be defined as one's direction to behavior, or what causes a person to want to repeat a behavior and vice versa. A motive is what prompts the person to act in a certain way, or at least develop an inclination for specific behavior. According to Maehr and Meyer, \\"Motivation is a word that is part of the popular culture as few other psychological concepts are.\\" - Nootropicsalso called smart drugs or cognitive enhancersare drugs, supplements, or other substances that improve cognitive function, particularly executive functions, memory, creativity, or motivation, in healthy individuals. The use of cognition-enhancing drugs by healthy individuals in the absence of a medical indication is one of the most debated topics among neuroscientists, psychiatrists, and physicians which spans a number of issues, including the ethics and fairness of their use, concerns over adverse effects, and the diversion of prescription drugs for nonmedical uses, among others. Nonetheless, the international sales of cognition-enhancing supplements exceeded billion in 2015 and the global demand for these compounds is still growing rapidly. - In medicine, an adverse effect is an undesired harmful effect resulting from a medication or other intervention such as surgery. - Epilepsy is a group of neurological diseases characterized by epileptic seizures. Epileptic seizures are episodes that can vary from brief and nearly undetectable to long periods of vigorous shaking. These episodes can result in physical injuries including occasionally broken bones. In epilepsy, seizures tend to recur, and have no immediate underlying cause. Isolated seizures that are provoked by a specific cause such as poisoning are not deemed to represent epilepsy. People with epilepsy in some areas of the world experience stigma due to the condition. The cause of most cases of epilepsy is unknown, although some people develop epilepsy as the result of brain injury, stroke, brain tumors, infections of the brain, and birth defects. Known genetic mutations are directly linked to a small proportion of cases. Epileptic seizures are the result of excessive and abnormal nerve cell activity in the cortex of the brain. The diagnosis involves ruling out other conditions that might cause similar symptoms such as fainting and determining if another cause of seizures is present such as alcohol withdrawal or electrolyte problems. This may be partly done by imaging the brain and performing blood tests. Epilepsy can often be confirmed with an electroencephalogram (EEG), but a normal test does not rule out the condition. Epilepsy that occurs as a result of other issues may be preventable. Seizures are controllable with medication in about 70% of cases. Inexpensive options are often available. In those whose seizures do not respond to medication, then surgery, neurostimulation, or dietary changes may be considered. Not all cases of epilepsy are lifelong, and many people improve to the point that treatment is no longer needed. As of 2013 about 22 million people have epilepsy. Nearly 80% of cases occur in the developing world. In 2013 it resulted in 116,000 deaths up from 112,000 deaths in 1990. Epilepsy is more common in older people. In the developed world, onset of new cases occurs most frequently in babies and the... - A drug is any substance (other than food that provides nutritional support) that, when inhaled, injected, smoked, consumed, absorbed via a patch on the skin, or dissolved under the tongue, causes a physiological change in the body. - Oxiracetam (ISF 2522) is a nootropic drug of the racetam family and very mild stimulant. Several studies suggest that the substance is safe even when high doses are consumed for a long period of time. However, the mechanism of action of the racetam drug family is still a matter of research. Oxiracetam is not approved by Food and Drug Administration for any medical use in the United States. - Executive functions (collectively referred to as executive function and cognitive control) are a set of cognitive processes including attentional control, inhibitory control, working memory, and cognitive flexibility, as well as reasoning, problem solving, and planning that are necessary for the cognitive control of behavior: selecting and successfully monitoring behaviors that facilitate the attainment of chosen goals. Executive functions gradually develop and change across the lifespan of an individual and can be improved at any time over the course of a person's life. Similarly, these cognitive processes can be adversely affected by a variety of events which affect an individual. Neuropsychological tests are used to measure executive functions, and are usually performed as part of a more comprehensive assessment to diagnose neurological and psychiatric disorders. - Racetams are a class of drugs that share a pyrrolidone nucleus. Some, such as piracetam, are considered nootropics. Some such as oxiracetam and phenylpiracetam are also stimulants. Others such as levetiracetam and seletracetam are anticonvulsants. - Etiracetam is a nootropic drug of the racetam family . It is racemic ; its biologically active enantiomeric form is levetiracetam . - Seletracetam (UCB 44212) is a pyrrolidone-derived drug of the racetam family that is structurally related to levetiracetam (trade name Keppra). It was under development by UCB Pharmaceuticals as a more potent and effective anticonvulsant drug to replace levetiracetam but its production has been halted. - In chemistry, an enantiomer, also known as an optical isomer, is one of two stereoisomers that are mirror images of each other that are non-superposable (not identical), much as one's left and right hands are the same except for being reversed along one axis (the hands cannot be made to appear identical simply by reorientation). Organic compounds that contain a chiral carbon atom usually have two non-superposable structures. These two structures are mirror images of each other and are, thus, commonly called enantiomorphs (\\"enantio\\" = opposite ; \\"morph\\" = form), hence this structural property is now commonly referred to as enantiomerism.

Shortly before she spoke, a VOA reporter at an immigration court hearing in Brownsville, Texas, said prosecutors dropped misdemeanor charges against 17 migrants. The migrants, who were separated from their children remain detained, but dropping the charges could be a means to reunite them and allow the families to be detained as units. David Bier, an Immigration Policy Analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute, said if government prosecutors are dropping criminal charges in similar cases across the immigration court system, it calls into question the Trump Administration's 'Zero Tolerance' policy towards immigration. It's \\"an even more clear signal that the whole purpose of bringing these prosecutions is to separate parents from children and not about enforcing the law.\\" he told VOA. The administration's policy requires that anyone who crosses the border illegally face criminal charges. \\"If it continues to be the case that some of these cases or many of them are dismissed by courts – that should be the end of the policy,\\" Bier added. The moves come as the House of Representatives prepares to vote Thursday on a pair of immigration bills that address the separations, as well as other issues that have divided the country's major political parties.

His reign of 72 years and 110 days is the longest of any monarch of a major country in European history. In this age of absolutism in Europe, Louis XIV's France was a leader in the growing centralization of power. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - The City of London is a city and county within London. It constituted most of London from its settlement by the Romans in the 1st century AD to the Middle Ages, but the agglomeration has since grown far beyond the City's borders. The City is now only a tiny part of the metropolis of London, though it remains a notable part of central London. Administratively, it forms one of the 33 local authority districts of Greater London; however, the City of London is not a London borough, a status reserved for the other 32 districts (including London's only other city, the City of Westminster). - Great Britain, also known as Britain , is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe. With an area of , Great Britain is the largest European island and the ninth-largest in the world. In 2011 the island had a population of about 61 million people, making it the world's third-most populous island after Java in Indonesia and Honshu in Japan. The island of Ireland is situated to the west of it, and together these islands, along with over 1,000 smaller surrounding islands, comprise the British Isles archipelago. - Prince of Orange is a title originally associated with the sovereign Principality of Orange, in what is now southern France. Under the Treaty of Utrecht of 1713, Frederick William I of Prussia ceded the Principality of Orange to King Louis XIV of France (while retaining the title as part of his dynastic titulature). After William III of England died without children, a dispute arose between Johan Willem Friso and Frederick I of Prussia, which was settled in the Treaty of Partition (1732); consequently, Friso's son, William IV had to share use of the title \\"Prince of Orange\\" (which had accumulated prestige in the Netherlands and throughout the Protestant world) with Frederick William I of Prussia. The title is traditionally borne by the heir apparent of the Dutch monarch. The title descends via absolute primogeniture since 1983, meaning that its holder can be either Prince or Princess of Orange. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - The Treaty of Utrecht, which established the Peace of Utrecht, is a series of individual peace treaties, rather than a single document, signed by the belligerents in the War of the Spanish Succession, in the Dutch city of Utrecht in March and April 1713. The treaties between several European states, including Spain, Great Britain, France, Portugal, Savoy and the Dutch Republic, helped end the war. - Prussia was a historic state originating out of the Duchy of Prussia and the Margraviate of Brandenburg, and centred on the region of Prussia. For centuries, the House of ruled Prussia, successfully expanding its size by way of an unusually well-organised and effective army. Prussia, with its capital in and from 1701 in Berlin, shaped the history of Germany. In 1871, German states united to create the German Empire under Prussian leadership. In November 1918, the monarchies were abolished and the nobility lost its political power during the German Revolution of 191819. The Kingdom of Prussia was thus abolished in favour of a republicthe Free State of Prussia, a state of Germany from 1918 until 1933. From 1933, Prussia lost its independence as a result of the Prussian coup, when the Nazi regime was successfully establishing its ' laws in pursuit of a unitary state. With the end of the Nazi regime, the division of Germany into allied-occupation zones and the separation of its territories east of the line, which were incorporated into Poland and the Soviet Union, the State of Prussia ceased to exist de facto in 1945. Prussia existed \\"\\" until its formal liquidation by the Allied Control Council Enactment No. 46 of 25 February 1947. - Frederick William I (14 August 1688 31 May 1740), known as the 'Soldier King,' was the King in Prussia and Elector of Brandenburg from 1713 until his death, as well as the father of Frederick the Great. He was in personal union the sovereign prince of the Principality of Neuchâtel. - The London Assembly is an elected body, part of the Greater London Authority, that scrutinises the activities of the Mayor of London and has the power, with a two-thirds majority, to amend the Mayor's annual budget and to reject the Mayor's draft statutory strategies. The assembly was established in 2000 and meets at City Hall on the South Bank of the River Thames, close to Tower Bridge. The assembly is also able to investigate other issues of importance to Londoners (transport, environmental matters, etc.), publish its findings and recommendations, and make proposals to the Mayor. - Francesco Guerini ( fl . 1740 -- 1770 ) was a Neapolitan violinist and composer whose works were published throughout Europe in the mid 18th century . While his birthdate is unknown , Guerini worked in The Hague for the Prince of Orange from 1740 until 1760 , at which time he moved to London , where he was active until 1770 . Most of Guerini 's published compositions were sonatas for one or two violins and continuo , but he also wrote keyboard works as well as Six Sonates / A deux Flûtes , ou deux Violons ... Ouevre III ( with no continuo ) , Paris , ca . 1750 , or Six Solos for a Violoncello with a Thorough Bass for the Harpsichord , Opus 9 , first published in London in 1765 . - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - Middlesex (abbreviation: Middx) was a county in southeast England that is now mostly part of Greater London, with small sections in neighbouring counties. It was established in the Anglo-Saxon system from the territory of the Middle Saxons, and existed as an official unit until 1965. The historic county included land stretching north of the River Thames from east to west of the City of London with the rivers Colne and Lea and a ridge of hills as the other boundaries. The largely low-lying county, dominated by clay in its north and alluvium on gravel in its south, was the second smallest by area in 1831. - The Mayor of London is an elected politician who, along with the London Assembly of 25 members, is accountable for the strategic government of Greater London. The current mayor is Sadiq Khan, who took up office on 9 May 2016. The position had been held by Ken Livingstone from the creation of the role on 4 May 2000 until he was defeated in 2008 by Boris Johnson, who served two terms before being succeeded by Khan. - William III (4 November 1650 8 March 1702; also widely known as William of Orange) was sovereign Prince of Orange from birth, Stadtholder of Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht, Gelderland, and Overijssel in the Dutch Republic from 1672, and King of England, Ireland, and Scotland from 1689 until his death. It is a coincidence that his regnal number (III) was the same for both Orange and England. As King of Scotland, he is known as William II. He is informally known by sections of the population in Northern Ireland and Scotland as \\"King Billy\\". - Surrey is a county in the south east of England and also one of the home counties bordering Greater London. Surrey shares borders with Kent to the east, East Sussex to the south-east, West Sussex to the south, Hampshire to the west and south-west and Berkshire to the north-west. The county town is Guildford. Surrey County Council sits extraterritorially at Kingston upon Thames, administered as part of Greater London since 1965. With a resident population of 1.1 million, Surrey is the most densely populated and third most populated county in the South East region, after Kent and Hampshire. - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency. - Frederick I (11 July 1657 25 February 1713), of the Hohenzollern dynasty, was (as Frederick III) Elector of Brandenburg (16881713) and Duke of Prussia in personal union (Brandenburg-Prussia). The latter function he upgraded to royalty, becoming the first King in Prussia (17011713). From 1707 he was in personal union the sovereign prince of the Principality of Neuchâtel. He was also the paternal grandfather of Frederick the Great. - The Principality of Orange (in French \\"la Principauté d'Orange\\") was, from 1163 to 1713, a feudal state in Provence, in the south of modern-day France, on the left bank of the river Rhone north of the city of Avignon. - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux. What entity does 'francesco guerini' has the relation 'date of birth' with?

The following Monday he arrived at school on time, and he waited for Miss White to enter the classroom. She walked in, all smiles! God, she was beautiful! Miss White, immediately, gave a quiz on the weekend homework. Steve hurried through the test and was the first to hand in his paper. With a look of surprise, Miss White took his paper. Obviously puzzled, she began to look it over. Miss White's face was in total shock! The smartest boy in the seventh grade had just passed his first test! From that moment nothing was the same for Steve. Life at home remained the same, but life still changed. He discovered that not only could he learn, but he was good at it! He discovered that he could understand knowledge and translate the things... It was the _ that made Steve begin to work hard at his lessons later. A) his parents B) his classmates C) the teacher D) failure in the test","response":"C) the teacher In the passage, it is evident that Steve didn't care about his school performance or homework initially. His thoughts were always centered around his passion for the woods. However, when Miss White, his teacher, showed concern and expressed care for Steve, it became a turning point in his life. Throughout the passage, the negative reaction from Steve's parents is quite apparent. They were not involved in his daily life, and their presence did not make a difference in changing Steve's attitude towards education. Similarly, his classmates, too, did not have any influential role in his decision to work on his academics. Regarding his test results, even though he was failing, it was not the deciding factor that made him work harder at his lessons. It was the emotional response of Miss White towards Steve's poor academic performance and her genuine care for him that moved him. When Miss White directly addressed Steve, expressing her concern and stating, \\"Steve! Please! I care about you!\\", Steve realized that she genuinely cared for him. This was the moment of change for Steve, who then made a conscious decision to bring his school books to the woods and started focusing on his academics. As a result, he began to see his academic potential, and this change was further emphasized by his success in the first quiz he took with a newfound determination. In conclusion, the main factor that made Steve begin to work hard at his lessons was the care and concern shown by his teacher, Miss White, making the answer to the question C) the teacher. Her genuine investment in his education and life made a significant impact on Steve's attitude and motivation for learning, setting him on a path towards academic success and personal growth."},{"question":"Summarize: Dr Rachel Herrmann from the University of Southampton has denounced the team, which rebranded as Chiefs in 1999, for its use of Native American imagery. She said it evoked \\"Britain's forgotten imperial American past\\". A spokesman for the club said they had no comment to make on the claims, nor the call to change its name. More on this story about the Exeter Chiefs, and others from Devon and Cornwall In the US, Native American campaigners have been calling on teams like the Washington Redskins to change its name, describing it as racist and offensive. Dr Herrmann said: \\"I think changing [Exeter's] name would be the ultimate step but I don't know whether that is likely to happen. \\"I would at least like to see an engaged discussion between the team and Native American groups that could better explain why the name might be offensive.\\" Dr Hermann criticised rugby fans who waved tomahawks, wore Native American headdress and war paint, and said it evoked a history of settler colonialism. The expert said it also ignores modern Native Americans who no longer dress in that way and the protests of those who have spoken out \\"against such cultural appropriation\\". Exeter Rugby Club rebranded as Exeter Chiefs in 1999 shortly after the team turned professional.","response":"Dr. Rachel Herrmann, a scholar from the University of Southampton, has criticized the Exeter Chiefs, a rugby team that rebranded itself in 1999, for using Native American imagery in their branding and logo. Dr. Herrmann argues that the use of such imagery is a reminder of Britain's imperialist past in America and calls for a discussion on the offensive nature of the team's name. The Exeter Chiefs have faced scrutiny similar to that of teams in the United States, like the Washington Redskins, who were urged to change their name due to allegations of racism and offensiveness. While Dr. Herrmann acknowledges that changing the Exeter Chiefs' name might not be a likely outcome, she hopes for an open dialogue between the team and Native American groups to address the cultural insensitivity and potential harm of using such imagery. Dr. Herrmann also critiques the fans of the rugby team who engage in practices like waving tomahawks, wearing Native American headdresses, and applying war paint. She argues that such actions are disrespectful to the historical reality of settler colonialism and to the modern Native American communities who no longer dress in this manner. Moreover, it overlooks the protests and arguments against cultural appropriation made by those who find such practices offensive and insensitive. In summary, Dr. Rachel Herrmann calls for an open, engaged discussion around the Exeter Chiefs' use of Native American imagery and name, highlighting the concerns of cultural appropriation and historical insensitivity. The club has not yet offered a comment on the issue or a response to calls for a potential name change."},{"question":"Q:Generate a question that has the following answer: No mark for the following movie plot: The film opens as Eddie Lomax (Jean-Claude Van Damme) drives an Indian motorcycle in an open desert plain (referred to as the Dry Lake).

ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig’s Disease, is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects neurons (nerve cells) in the brain and the spinal cord. Eventually, people with ALS lose the ability to initiate and control muscle movement, which often leads to total paralysis and death within two to five years of diagnosis. There is no cure and no life-prolonging treatments for the disease. “We are thrilled with the additional funding for research and care services that the Ice Bucket Challenge has provided, even more important is the chance the entire ALS community now has to leverage our good fortune to work together toward our common goal of defeating this horrific disease,” said Bill Thoet, Chairman of the Board of Trustees of The ALS Association. “Together, we now have the unique opportunity to fundamentally change the nature of this fight.” The Association’s Board of Trustees, staff, chapter representatives and advisers met in Denver on October 17-18 to review and incorporate the feedback they had received from key stakeholders, including people living with ALS and their families, over the last two months. “Thanks to the Ice Bucket Challenge, we are able to continue to improve the most comprehensive pipeline for ALS treatments in the world,” said Barbara Newhouse, President and CEO of The ALS Association. “We now have tremendous momentum in the search for a cure. Our integrated mission, combined with increased collaboration, is accelerating our ability to move potential treatments through the drug development process and improve the support for people living with ALS at our care centers.” The Certified Treatment Centers of Excellence provide a comprehensive, multidisciplinary team approach to care that has been proven to both extend and improve the quality of life for those living with ALS. In addition, the Centers actively participate in ALS-related research. Earlier this month, The ALS Association announced it was supporting six different programs and initiatives designed to expedite the search for treatments and a cure for ALS. Four of these projects involve global research cooperative alliances that would not have moved forward without the funding from The ALS Association and the matching donations it received. In addition, the Association launched a new collaborative initiative that will bring the ALS community together to establish an ALS drug development guidance document. No such document exists today, which creates uncertainty and risk for what already is a difficult, lengthy and costly process. This initiative will incentivize ALS drug development, reduce obstacles and provide new opportunities to accelerate research and bring new treatments from the bench to the bedside. About The ALS Association The ALS Association is the only national non-profit organization fighting Lou Gehrig’s Disease on every front. By leading the way in global research, providing assistance for people with ALS through a nationwide network of chapters, coordinating multidisciplinary care through certified clinical care centers, and fostering government partnerships, The Association builds hope and enhances quality of life while aggressively searching for new treatments and a cure.

(October 2, 2014)—After the generous outpouring of support from people all around the globe due to this summer’s Ice Bucket Challenge, the Board of Trustees of The ALS Association has approved an initial expenditure of 21.7 million in funding to support six programs and initiatives to expedite the search for treatments and a cure for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Additionally, 12.5 million in matching donations bring the total commitment to 34.2 million. Four of these projects involve global research cooperative alliances that would not have moved forward without this significant funding from The Association, made possible through the generosity of donors worldwide, along with matching gifts. “We recognize the sense of urgency felt by people living with the disease and their families and I want to assure everyone that our number one commitment is to making decisions that get treatments to patients in the fastest way possible,” said Barbara Newhouse, President and CEO of The ALS Association. “Our roadmap to treatments involves collaboration with other ALS organizations and with industry, university investigators, government agencies, pharmaceutical and biotech companies and other nonprofit organizations committed to the fight against ALS.” During a 30-day period this summer, The ALS Association received more than 100 million in donations. Over the last few weeks, The Association has actively convened key stakeholder groups, including a panel of advisors made up of people living with ALS, to provide input into a comprehensive plan that The Association will release in early November after approval from the Board of Trustees. The bulk of The ALS Association’s initial 21.7 million commitment—18.5 million—will advance four new cooperative alliances for the next one to three years involving research that has been identified as critical to finding new treatments for ALS: ALS Accelerated Therapeutics (ALS ACT), The New York Genome Center, the Neuro Collaborative, and Project MinE.These projects would not have been possible without Ice Bucket Challenge donations. There will be synergies between these four initiatives that will increase the quantity, and most importantly, the value of data openly available to the ALS research community worldwide. The ALS Association will play a pivotal role in coordinating these efforts. Under the leadership of The ALS Association’s Chief Scientist, Lucie Bruijn, Ph.D., M.B.A., The Association has been involved in the planning of each of these new collaborations, and, in each case, has sought the advice and evaluation of leading researchers to assess scientific merit, to gather additional ideas for each project, and to ensure the maximum relevance to future therapies. ALS Accelerated Therapeutics (ALS ACT) ALS ACT is a novel academic-industry partnership to accelerate treatments for people living with ALS, which is able to proceed with a 10 million commitment from The ALS Association and matching gift of 10 million from The ALS Finding a Cure Foundation. The combined contributions from The ALS Association and The ALS Finding a Cure Foundation will significantly expedite therapy development. The ALS Finding a Cure Foundation is led by Peter N. Foss, Lee Rizzuto and Denis Rizzuto. The foundation was created in April of 2014 and is a tribute to Denis’ wife, Christie Rizzuto, who was diagnosed with ALS five years ago at age 41. ALS ACT will enact a multi-pronged approach to expediting clinical trials in ALS. Efforts will include (1) developing neuroimaging tools as potential biomarkers for ALS progression, a key unmet need in trials; (2) development of therapeutic approaches to decrease production of misfolded proteins within motor neurons and reverse neuroinflammation, two major contributors to the disease process; (3) a challenge grant program to overcome key roadblocks in the search for therapies; (4) support for phase IIA pilot clinical trials using biomarkers. Merit Cudkowicz, Co-Chair of the Northeast ALS Consortium (NEALS) and Chief of Neurology and the ALS Program at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), notes that these efforts will accelerate diagnosis, speed development of new treatments for people with ALS, and remove road blocks to finding a cure for ALS. In addition, ALS ACT will strengthen ongoing collaborative efforts in support of clinical trials, including NeuroBANK, a central repository for clinical research data in ALS, and the NEALS (Northeast ALS Consortium) Biorepository. Initially established through the Translational Research Advancing Therapies for ALS (TREAT ALS™) NEALS Clinical Trials Network, NeuroBANK will host, curate, and disseminate proteomic, genomic and clinical data.

Appel, M.D., Houston Methodist Hospital System; and Clive Svendsen, Ph.D., Cedars-Sinai; Nadeem Ishaque, Ph.D., and Tom Gentile Senior Vice President General Electric. New York Genome Center (NYGC) The ALS Association and its Greater New York Chapter will match a 2.5 million gift from The Tow Foundation in support of a new project at the NYGC, which will bring together for the first time a world-class scientific team to further understand the genetic basis of ALS. Recent discoveries have indicated that genes may contribute to a much larger percentage of ALS cases than previously thought. Finding these genes and understanding how they work will allow development of new therapeutic approaches. Under the leadership of Drs. Robert Darnell and Hemali Phatnani together with their advisors, including Tom Maniatis and Marc Tessier-Lavigne , the NYGC will spearhead a cooperative and multidisciplinary effort to provide open-source “big data” to benefit the entire ALS research community. Investigators: Robert B. Darnell, M.D., Ph.D.; Hemali Phatnani, Ph.D.; Tom Maniatis, Ph.D.; Marc Tessier-Lavigne, Ph.D.; Merit Cudkowicz, M.D., MSc; Robert J. Brown, Jr. M.D., D.Phil.; Virginia Lee, Ph.D.; John Q. Trojanowski, M.D., Ph.D., Alex Sherman; James Berry, MD; Neil Shneider, M.D., Ph.D.; David Goldstein, Ph.D.; and Tom Jessell, Ph.D. Neuro Collaborative The Neuro Collaborative will combine the efforts of three world renowned California labs focused on ALS: Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles, the University of California San Diego and the Gladstone Institutes, an affiliate of the University of California San Francisco, to develop and expedite therapeutic approaches for ALS. The collaborative, which now has funding to proceed with 5 million in Ice Bucket Challenge funding from The ALS Association, will focus on the following: (1) development of antisense therapy for the C9orf72 gene, the most common genetic cause of ALS, in partnership with Biogen-Idec and ISIS Pharmaceuticals; (2) gene therapy to down regulate SOD1, the second-most common ALS gene; (3) establishment of a Stem Cell and Motor Neuron Core Facility to create clinical-grade induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell lines, which will be openly shared with the ALS research community. iPS cells have emerged as a key research tool and potential source of therapeutic cells in ALS. 4) Using a novel screening tool, identify new targets for drug development and in partnership with the industry these leads will be developed further with the potential of new treatment options in the clinic. The Golden West Chapter of The ALS Association has played a key role in the planning and development of this project. Investigators: Don Cleveland, Ph.D. UCSD; Steven Finkbeiner, M.D., Ph.D., the Finkbeiner lab at the Gladstone Institutes; Clive Svendsen, Ph.D., Cedar Sinai Medical Center; and collaborators, Martin Marsala, M.D., UCSD; and Brian Kaspar, Ph.D., Children’s Hospital and Ohio State University. Project MinE Project MinE is a global collaboration with the goal to sequence the genomes of at least 15,000 people with ALS in an effort to discover new genes that affect ALS, either increasing the risk for the disease or protecting against it. The ALS Association’s funding commitment of 1 million will enable Project MinE to expand to the United States. It has become clear that risk for ALS is likely influenced by variants in multiple genes, each of which is relatively rare. The development of advanced sequencing technologies has dramatically reduced the cost of screening large numbers of individuals for these rare variants. Discovering these variants, and understanding how they contribute to disease, or protect against it, is likely to lead to novel approaches to ALS therapies. U.S. investigators: John Landers, Ph.D. University of Massachusetts, Worcester; Jonathan Glass, M.D., Emory University. International partners include the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Belgium. In addition to the abovementioned collaborative alliances to drive forward ALS research, The ALS Association’s Board of Trustees also approved two other projects to expedite the search for treatments and a cure for the disease through care services and public policy efforts. Grants to Certified Treatment Centers of Excellence The ALS Association and its network of chapters currently partner with 43 ALS Association Certified Treatment Centers of Excellence across the United States. Multiple studies have shown the value to a patient of attending a multidisciplinary clinic, including longer survival, increased quality of life, and improved access to potential therapies. One of the requirements in achieving certification through The ALS Association is for the institution to be actively involved in ALS-related research and to provide information to people living with the disease on research outside of their institution. Participation in clinical trials is imperative to the research process to find treatments for the disease. The Ice Bucket Challenge donations have enabled The Association to increase its annual grants to the centers from the presently budgeted 12,500 to 25,000 per center, which was the funding level pre-2008, for the next three years. Regulatory Guidance to Expedite Drug Development Organizations involved in two other neurological diseases (Alzheimer’s and Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy) have seen great benefits in working to develop guidance for companies to help them navigate the regulatory pathway for approval of effective therapies. The enactment of the patient-focused drug development elements of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) presents a unique opportunity for The ALS Association to help expedite drug development by developing similar guidance for ALS. No such guidance exists today for ALS, which creates uncertainty and risk for what is already a difficult and costly process. By developing this guidance, The ALS Association will be able to build on and strengthen its engagement with the FDA, industry and people with ALS about drug development as a regulatory process, which will reduce obstacles that can slow and limit innovation and access to effective treatments.

The funding marks the ALS Association’s first move toward distributing the 115 million it raised to fight the disease. “We are tripling the amount annually that we spend on research,” said ALS Association President Barbara Newhouse. “We have a sense of urgency, but we also we recognize that we have to be good stewards of the donor dollars as we move this forward as quickly as researchers can research.” Some of the first projects to receive funding include one trying to sequence the genes of 15,000 people with ALS, one partnering with pharmaceutical companies to advance drug treatment, and one developing gene therapy that might reduce the spread of the disease through the body. Hospitals and labs around the world that have received funding are Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles, the University of California San Francisco, the New York Genome Center and others. The ALS Association has distributed more than 20 million so far and has committed to seeing any project it’s funded through to completion. In addition to funding research, the Ice Bucket Challenge money will be used to improve treatment for people living with disease, Newhouse said. Despite the organization’s now-deeper pockets, Newhouse insists that it will take time before the group will determine fully how to best leverage its influx in cash. Newhouse said she’s been “inundated with proposals” for research projects, and they continue to arrive in her inbox. “It’s been amazing how many people have come out of the woodwork to say ‘I have the answer,’” she said. “We’re trying to sort through what’s fact and what’s fiction.” And, while 100 million represents a marked increase in funding for the fight against ALS, Newhouse said it’s more of a starting point than the key to a solution. Newhouse thinks the funding could lead to a breakthrough—”I’m always a glass half-full kind of person,” she said. “But we would be kidding ourselves if anybody believed that 100 million is going to be all that’s needed to find an effective treatment.” |||||","response":"The ALS Association has announced that it will triple its spending on research, thanks to the proceeds from the Ice Bucket Challenge.

Question: Why was England involved in India? Context: During the middle decades of the 18th century, there were several outbreaks of military conflict on the Indian subcontinent, the Carnatic Wars, as the English East India Company (the Company) and its French counterpart, the Compagnie française des Indes orientales, struggled alongside local rulers to fill the vacuum that had been left by the decline of the Mughal Empire. The Battle of Plassey in 1757, in which the British, led by Robert Clive, defeated the Nawab of Bengal and his French allies, left the Company in control of Bengal and as the major military and political power in India. France was left control of its enclaves but with military restrictions and an obligation to support British client states, ending French hopes of controlling India. In the following decades the Company gradually increased the size of the territories under its control, either ruling directly or via local rulers under the threat of force from the British Indian Army, the vast majority of which was composed of Indian sepoys.","response":"England was involved in India due to the struggle between the English East India Company and its French counterpart, the Compagnie française des Indes orientales, alongside local rulers, to fill the vacuum left by the decline of the Mughal Empire.

Spousal support is most often an issue when one divorcing spouse makes a lot more money than the other. It can also be an issue if one spouse has taken time off work and was dependent on the other spouse as a result. If you do not include spousal support in your divorce settlement agreement, the judge will decide this issue for you when you get divorced. Spousal support is most common when one spouse quits work to stay home with the couple's small children. Spousal support is also common if one spouse makes a lot more money than the other, and as a result, the other spouse has become accustomed to a particular lifestyle. In your agreement, you can specify not only the amount of spousal support but the length of time those payments will be made. You can also decide whether you'll simply pay the money between yourselves or have the paying spouse's wages garnished. If you decide that neither of you will receive any spousal support, include a statement that says something like \\"Each of us gives up any right to spousal support that we may have.\\" Which divorcing spouse gets to keep any marital pets is an issue that can be just as fraught as child custody for many couples. However, as part of your settlement agreement, you can establish rules regarding your pets that are just as detailed as parenting plans for children. As long as the two of you agree, the arrangement can be enforced in court. For example, you might decide that your spouse will have full ownership of your dogs, but that you can take them every other weekend. You can even agree that the non-custodial spouse will pay a certain amount each month to help with the cost of food, supplies, and veterinary bills. You may also want to specify your pet's veterinarian or make agreements regarding how often your pet will be taken to the vet for regular check-ups. All states have specific guidelines for calculating how much child support should be paid, and by which spouse. You typically cannot deviate from these requirements unless strict conditions are met. Most states have specific forms you'll need to fill out that show how you calculated child support and describe the specifics of your parenting plan. Talk to the clerk of the court where you filed (or plan to file) for divorce. These forms are also often available for download from the court's website. While you can outline the specifics of your child support agreement and parenting plan in the body of your settlement agreement, it's generally easier to fill out the required forms and incorporate them by reference. For example, under the section in your agreement labeled \\"Child Support and Custody,\\" you could write \\"The state child support and parenting plan worksheets are attached and incorporated into this agreement by reference.\\" If your local child support agency is involved in your case, they will likely have to sign off on your parenting plan and child support agreement. Even in the midst of a divorce, it's natural for parents to want to provide for their children's future. If you and your spouse have made any agreements regarding future expenses for your children, you can include those in your settlement agreement. For example, if your spouse has opened a savings account that they contribute to for your child's college expenses, you would include the account number, balance, and financial institution of that account, along with a statement regarding the purpose of the funds. If you or your spouse agree to contribute funds for your child's college or other expenses in the future, you may be able to deduct a portion of those amounts from any child support payments. Talk to a family law attorney or family court facilitator about how this works.","response":"This article is all about how to handle things like money, pets, and children (stuff that's really important to you and your spouse) during a divorce, which means when you and your spouse decide not to be married anymore; the article explains how to agree on who gives money to whom, who gets to keep the pets and the children, and how to plan for the children's future."},{"question":"Answer the following question: who played young derek hale in season 4?","response":"Young Derek Hale in season 4 of the popular MTV series \\"Teen Wolf\\" was portrayed by actor Ian Nelson.

Antiviral drugs are medications used specifically for treating the symptoms of viral infections. The first antiviral drug was interferon , a substance that is naturally produced by certain immune cells when an infection is detected. Over the past twenty years the development of antiretroviral drugs (also known as antiretroviral therapy, or ART) has increased rapidly. This has been driven by the AIDS epidemic.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","response":"The perturbation hypothesis you've suggested involves an epidemic that kills many babies and children. To evaluate its potential effect on the process of animals gaining weight and hibernating, we must consider the various ways this scenario can impact the ecosystem and the animals themselves. 1. Change in Food Availability: If the epidemic causes a decline in human populations, it could indirectly affect the animals' food sources. For example, if fewer people are farming and maintaining agricultural resources, there may be changes in the types and amounts of food available for animals to consume. This could lead to animals gaining less weight during warm, clear weather. 2. Disruption in the Ecosystem: The loss of many human lives, particularly babies and children, can potentially disrupt the balance within an ecosystem. Such disruptions can lead to ripple effects that impact the habitat, predators, or prey populations of hibernating animals. For example, if the human population were reduced and people change the way they utilize natural resources, it could ultimately cause fluctuations in the food resources that hibernating animals rely on to gain weight. 3. Human Intervention: Human efforts to control the epidemic and provide aid to affected populations might indirectly impact animals' habitats and resources, leading to weight gain changes. For example, medical waste disposal, increased use of sanitation chemicals, or establishment of temporary shelters might encroach on animal habitats. These actions could force animals to modify their feeding patterns or movement, potentially affecting the weight they gain. In summary, while the proposed perturbation of an epidemic killing many babies and children does not have a direct effect on the animals' weight gain and hibernation process, it can lead to indirect consequences. Changes in food availability, disruptions in ecosystems, and human interventions can all potentially impact the resources the animals rely on, ultimately influencing their weight gain process during good weather. However, the actual impact will depend on various factors, including the scale of the epidemic, the geographical location, and the specific animal species involved."},{"question":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

While there is nothing wrong with thinking about the things you want to do, writing them down is an important part of remembering, and finally actually achieving your goals. Consider getting a small notebook that you can carry around with you. Then you can work on your list whenever you are. Spend a little extra money and get a durable notebook, if you can afford to. This can help the list last over the long term. Writing a long list of things you want to do before your die can take a while. You do not need to try to finish it in one sitting. Add to your list over over months, maybe even years. It never has to be “finished.” Eventually you’ll build a very long list. If you think of something new, take a moment to add it to the list. Your list will grow over time, and you will think of things to add even when you are not deliberately sitting down to add things. This approach will help prevent you from getting frustrated. Maybe you're someone how spends twelve hours a day at work, but make sure you don't only think about work or business goals. Varying your goals across different areas of your life will help you develop a list that can improve all aspects of your life. A few examples might be these: Relationships. Finding your soulmate, having children, seeing your children grown and having children of their own is one train of thought. Sporting achievements. This may include shooting a 70 on a golf course with no handicap, or a hole in one, or it might mean catching a blue marlin, driving a stock car, or pitching a no-hitter. One consideration on this category is being realistic about your ability, and present age. Success in business or work. Many people happily live full lives at a 9 to 5 job shuffling papers, owning a house in the suburbs, and taking the family to the local diner on Friday nights, but this may not be your idea of a goal in life. Look at possibilities, list them, and find out what it will require to achieve them. Philosophical goals. These are a little more difficult to describe, but they may include being a good neighbor, sharing your beliefs, or finding the meaning of life. Your list does not, and probably should not, reflect only material goals. Making a difference. Here, you can really challenge yourself, be it finding a great scientific discovery that ends suffering from a tragic disease, or establishing a foundation to help underprivileged children. Artistic achievements. There are a number of possible goals here, from writing a novel destined to become a classic, to painting a masterpiece. Travels. You may long to take a trip to Europe, Alaska, or the North Pole. You may even want to travel to space, and even though you may never make it there, put it on the list, and see what opportunities arise to make the dream a reality. Do not limit yourself to these categories. They are just meant to give you some suggestions. Instead, let your imagination run wild. Be as creative as you can be. Keep a notepad handy, and use your imagination to list anything that comes to mind. Be open ended, you do not need to know exactly how you will achieve every goal right now Just get them down on paper. If you limit yourself at this stage, you might miss out on things you genuinely wanted to try to accomplish. Don’t be afraid to keep items in some goals private. Do not limit yourself based on what you assume other people will think about your goals. Write them down now, and keep the list private if you want. You should think big, but also small. A mix of big and small goals will give you things that you can accomplish regularly. Not every goal has to be something for the far future. Create small goals that can lead you to your bigger goals. For example, dance at home, then take a dance lesson, then go dancing in public. When your small goals lead to your bigger goals, you will lead yourself to long term success. Write something on your list that you can do today, tomorrow, and this week. If you include items you can accomplish in the short term, you will feel like you have created a list you can actually accomplish. Add to it, or take things away. After all, it is just a personal list. It is yours to expand, change, or reduce. Keep this original list and continue to work with it. The list itself is important, because it serves as a reminder of all the things you want to do. Be willing to change your list, but also think carefully before making changes. If you take adding and subtracting from the list seriously, you are more likely to take the items on the list seriously. Summary:","response":"This article says that making a list of things you want to do before you die is a good idea.

In an article in the conservative Communist Party journal Qiushi, or Seeking Truth, Mr. Wen said the government must hold officials more strongly accountable for corruption that occurs on their watch and make the results of corruption investigations open to public inspection. The article, titled, “Let power be exercised in the sunshine,” is the latest in a string of anticorruption broadsides aired since the former Politburo member Bo Xilai was ensnared in February in a murder investigation involving his wife. Mr. Bo was removed from the Politburo after party officials issued a report accusing him of “serious disciplinary violations” and accusing his wife, Gu Kailai, of arranging the killing of Neil Heywood, a British businessman and onetime friend of the Bo family, after a financial dispute. China’s official news media have maintained a high-level drumbeat of warnings against corruption since the scandal became public, including a speech by President Hu Jintao that urged the military to rid itself of graft, and a prominent commentary last week on Xinhua, the state-run news service, that bemoaned efforts by the spouses and children of high officials to seek personal gain through official power. “We must have a profound understanding of this: That the biggest danger to a political party in power is corruption,” the article said. “If it is not handled properly, the nature of the regime may change, and its rule may end. It is an extremely difficult and important challenge we are facing right now.” Mr. Wen’s article cast the investigation of Mr. Bo and his wife as proof of the party’s determination to weed out graft no matter where it is found. “China is a socialist country ruled by law, and the dignity and authority of the law cannot be trampled,” Mr. Wen said in the article. “There is no special citizen before the law. It does not allow any special party members to override the law within the party.” Communist Party officials regularly issue anticorruption attacks and frequently make public reports listing the number of bureaucrats who have been prosecuted or the amount of money recovered from graft investigations. Mr. Wen’s article was somewhat different because it placed new emphasis on fighting graft by making the results of the investigations public, and because of its unusually harsh tone, said Zhang Xiaojin, who heads the political science department at Tsinghua University in Beijing. Mr. Wen’s toughness “is no exaggeration,” he said. “We can see that the problem is actually getting worse every year.” Â Li Bibo contributed research.","response":"\\"Sunshine on Corruption: China's Struggle to Preserve Communist Rule Amidst Graft Scandals\\""},{"question":"– A new indictment sheds light on the 2005 murder of a Georgia teacher.

Q: Article: Scientists can determine someone's favorite food from their shape. They have discovered that the arrangement of taste buds on the tongue varies for different body types. The scientist team examined 1,000 British adults and divided them into three physiologically recognized body types--ectomorphs, endomorphs mesomorphs. They determined that a person's body type indicated where they were likely to have the most taste buds - on the sweet, bitter or salty areas of their tongues. The study showed that ectomorphs, who make up one in three of the population, usually have a small delicate shape, have a sweet tooth but hate bitter foods. Mesomorphs, who make up 20percent of the population, usually have a muscular shape and prefer salty and bitter foods but dislike sweet foods. Half the British population are endomorphs with soft, rounded bodies, and they like most foods. The findings showed that for two in three people food preference was a physiological rather than a psychological choice.

In the surrounding garden, wildflowers thrived, and Mrs. Hawthorne made sure to attend to each one, treating them as if they were her children. The beautiful spring day soon faded into sunset, bathing the garden in a golden hue. As the sun receded beyond the horizon, Mrs. Hawthorne settled into a book that she had picked up from the library earlier, immersing herself into the prose. A gentle breeze rustled the pages of the book, lifting the delicate petals of the pressed flowers that lay inside. A single tear escaped from Mrs. Hawthorne’s eye as she carefully caressed the fragile petals, a vivid reminder of the joyful days shared with her beloved. Over the weeks that followed, the garden witnessed Mrs. Hawthorne's unwavering diligence in the pursuit of nurturing her cherished rose. Each day began with watering, inspecting, and conversing with the plant as if it were an old friend. The flower bloomed and withered in cycles, as the days turned into months and the seasons changed, much like a continued dance between life and loss. Despite her age, Mrs. Hawthorne was dedicated to revitalize the rose to its original vigor. Wrinkled hands reached up and trimmed the dry, wilted leaves, occasionally pricking her skin on the thorns that adorned the stem. The tiny droplets of blood that formed with each prick reminded her of the hardships she had endured throughout her life. Other roses flourished in the massive garden, their petals reaching out towards the sun, as if in competition. The aroma of their collective blooms was intoxicating. However, the potted rose was developing thorns that grew larger with each passing day, much like barriers forming between the aging gardener and her memories. As summer approached, the rose's petals turned deeper shades of red, becoming luxuriant and drawing the attention of every visitor to the garden. The increasingly beautiful rose was perceived as a symbol of Mrs. Hawthorne’s undying love for her husband. But the awareness of its thorns was looming in her mind, serving as markers for her healing journey that demanded courage and acceptance. And one fateful day, when the sun was at its zenith, a sudden gust of wind knocked the rose off its pedestal. It descended onto the ground, the fragile petals crushed under the weight of its fall. The impact jolted Mrs. Hawthorne who rushed towards the fallen rose. An initial sense of despair washed over her, as she frantically attempted to salvage the flower, but the pieces of her cherished companion were beyond repair. As she cleaned up the remnants, a subtle shift in her perspective occurred. Holding the broken fragments of the past, Mrs. Hawthorne began to see the garden as a metaphor and finally made a decision that would change her life. The next morning, under the veil of sunrise, Mrs. Hawthorne laid the broken rose next to the pressed flowers and closed her book. Now standing tall, she surveyed her garden and recognized that the love she shared with her husband could not be contained in a single rose. For it was an ever-expanding garden filled with memories and endless love, offering the strength she needed to move forward. And so, Mrs. Hawthorne carried on, nurturing the entire garden, allowing her love to grow and live through each and every plant, as she embraced the beauty of new beginnings."},{"question":"Note the options at the end.

World; (II). Sports; (III). Business; (IV). Science/Tech;","response":"(III). Business The excerpt you provided refers to a significant development in the business world, specifically to changes in corporate leadership and the role of the CEO. Michael Cherkasky's appointment as the CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies marked a shift in the expectations and responsibilities of CEOs in the business world. Marsh & McLennan, a leading global professional services firm offering clients advice and solutions in risk, strategy, and human capital, was going through tumultuous times back in 2004 as it had to deal with regulatory investigations and a plummeting market value. The company was facing crisis due to alleged bid-rigging and price-fixing within its insurance business. As a result, Marsh & McLennan was in dire need of a leader who could steer the company through these challenges and help them regain their clients' trust. With an esteemed background in law enforcement as a former prosecutor and investigator, Michael Cherkasky was appointed as the CEO of Marsh & McLennan in October 2004 due to his strong reputation in compliance, ethics, and corporate governance.

Under Cherkasky's leadership, Marsh & McLennan saw a shift towards effective risk management, a tight regulatory environment, and increased transparency. He focused intensely on resolving pending lawsuits and investigations, restoring corporate integrity, and rebuilding the firm's brand value. His background in law enforcement and thorough understanding of the legal landscape allowed him to assess the company's predicaments, support its clients during difficult times, and take appropriate measures accordingly. This shift in corporate leadership also paved the way for the current CEO archetype in the business world.

I must say, the app delivers on its promise to provide users with a secure and private browsing experience. Tor Browser successfully conceals my identity and location, allowing me to connect to the internet with a sense of security and protection. What I appreciate about this app is its user-friendly interface, making it accessible even to those who may not be familiar with the concept of Tor browsing. It offers a seamless browsing experience, and the initial setup was quite easy to navigate. However, I did experience a few hiccups when using the app. One issue is that browsing can sometimes be slow. This can be a bit frustrating when trying to load webpages or download files. Yet, I understand that the trade-off for increased security means some reduction in speed. It would be great to see future updates addressing this issue. Additionally, some popular websites, like streaming platforms, can detect that Tor Browser is being used, and thus, block it. It would be helpful if the app could bypass these barriers to allow users to access all content securely. In conclusion, I would rate the org.torproject.android app 4 stars out of 5. It effectively provides privacy and security for browsing the internet but could use improvements in speed and greater access to specific websites. Overall, the app is definitely worth trying for those seeking a more private internet experience."},{"question":"I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

This entire process is known as echolocation. In the final step, after detecting the echoes of the sound waves bouncing off the objects, the bat's brain processes the received information by analyzing the time delay between sending the original signal and receiving its echo, and the frequency shift produced due to the Doppler effect. This enables the bat to determine the distance, location, size, shape, speed, and direction of movement of the objects in its surroundings. Using this highly accurate information, the bat can navigate and maneuver effectively through its environment, even in complete darkness. Moreover, it aids the bat in hunting insects and other prey with incredible precision by allowing it to determine the precise position and movement of the prey. In addition, this sensory ability also enables the bat to avoid any obstacles in its flight path, such as trees, buildings, and other structures, ensuring safe travel.

Let's solve step-by-step:","response":"Step 1: Understand the information in the first sentence. The first sentence states: \\"A male is on a swing as four other people stand to the side of him.\\" From this, we can gather the following information: - There is a male on a swing. - There are four other people present. - The four other people are standing to the side of the male on the swing. Step 2: Understand the information in the second sentence. The second sentence states: \\"A male is on a swing as four other people are in close proximity of him.\\" From this, we can gather the following information: - There is a male on a swing. - There are four other people present. - The four other people are in close proximity to the male on the swing. Step 3: Compare the information in both sentences. Comparing the information from both sentences, we can see that the main difference lies in the positioning of the four other people. In the first sentence, they are described as being \\"to the side of\\" the male on the swing, while in the second sentence, they are described as being \\"in close proximity\\" of the male on the swing. Step 4: Determine if the second sentence is true based on the information in the first sentence.

Conclusion: Given the assumption that \\"to the side of\\" implies a close proximity, the second sentence can be considered true based on the information provided in the first sentence. However, without further information about the actual distance between the male on the swing and the four other people, it is not possible to definitively confirm the truth of the second sentence."},{"question":"Write an article based on this summary: Sex offenders are using increasingly sophisticated techniques to target children online and investment is needed for the technologies to track them, Europe's police agency warns.","response":"Title: Protecting Our Children from Online Danger: A Call for Investment in Technology Hey kids!

We need to find the value of n in the equation: -3331 = -553 * n - 44253 First, we want to get the term with n all by itself on one side of the equation. To do this, we'll add 44253 to both sides: -3331 + 44253 = -553 * n Now our equation looks like this: 40922 = -553 * n Now, we want to figure out what number we have to multiply -553 by to get 40922. To find that, we'll divide 40922 by -553: 40922 / -553 = n When we do the division, we find out that n equals -74! -553 * -74 equals 40922, which means our answer is correct! So, n = -74.

Translate to Romanian","response":"După părerea mea, trebuie să facem trei lucruri în Uniunea Europeană după Copenhaga. În primul rând, Uniunea Europeană ar trebui să-și continue eforturile pentru a promova o abordare globală a schimbărilor climatice. Aceasta înseamnă că ar trebui să lucreze cu toate țările, indiferent de nivelul lor de dezvoltare, pentru a reduce emisiile de gaze cu efect de seră. Trebuie să ne asigurăm că toate statele membre sunt pe aceeași pagină și suntem dedicati în a atinge țintele stabilite. În al doilea rând, Uniunea Europeană ar trebui să-și întărească angajamentul pentru energie regenerabilă și eficiență energetică. Acest lucru înseamnă că ar trebui să investim mai mult în tehnologii curate și să ne străduim să reducem dependența de combustibilii fosili. De asemenea, ar trebui să facem eforturi mai mari pentru a ajuta statele membre să-și îmbunătățească eficiența energetică, lucru care nu doar că va ajuta la reducerea emisiilor, dar va ajuta și la crearea de noi locuri de muncă și va stimula economia. În sfârșit, în al treilea rând, Uniunea Europeană ar trebui să ia măsuri în direcția dezvoltării unei economii cu emisii reduse de carbon. Aceasta implică o schimbare majoră în modul în care producem și consumăm energia, dar este necesară dacă vrem să evităm cele mai grave impacturi ale schimbărilor climatice.

Royal Mail postmen are refusing to deliver to The Villas after it became a no-go zone due to 'a number of incidents involving colleagues falling and slipping'. Resident Catherine Burgass said the move by Royal Mail has 'annoyed' all of the residents at The Villas. Yesterday home-owners on the road, which is not council-maintained as it is privately run by the residents' association, said their mail had been delivered without a problem for 150 years and slammed Royal Mail for not giving them any warning. The estate's residents' association has asked Royal Mail to identify which areas need repairing but say it would cost tens of thousands of pounds to tarmac the entire stretch. Elderly resident Alfred Poole, 79, branded the move 'barmy'. He said: 'Its health and safety gone mad. I'm an old man and if I can manage the paving slabs, I'm sure the postman can. 'I haven't got a car and I can't walk four miles to fetch my post. It's just ridiculous.' Royal Mail say they suspended deliveries to the street for health and safety reasons following 'incidents' Julian Wilshaw, 38, who lives with his partner Sarah and daughter Jessica, added: 'It came out of the blue. 'We had heard nothing at all about it and then the letter came through. 'We weren't even warned or informed there was an issue, so we could maybe try to help put any issues right. 'Royal Mail deliver to the likes of the Isle of Skye and the Hebrides - we're just The Villas, in Stoke. 'My daughter has hip problems and we're waiting on a letter from the hospital. 'I have sympathy for the postmen if they've hurt themselves, but we don't know what the problem is, and Royal Mail have been delivering to us for years. 'It's a massive inconvenience for all the residents, especially the more elderly people living here.' A total of 40 households and over 100 residents have been affected by the ban. Ms Burgass said the pavement has been in the same condition since she moved in 15 years ago. Martin Parker, 52, secretary of The Villas Residents' Association, said: 'The letter said one postman had injured themselves a month ago, and we were told it happened again a couple of days before the letter was sent. 'No-one had been consulted about any problems with the state of the pavements and I'm surprised they hadn't bothered to consult with us. 'It would have been sensible for them to speak to us, and it's bizarre Royal Mail has taken this rather extreme stance. 'The road is not slippery, our bins are emptied and post had been delivered here for a very long time. 'Luckily, I have a car and I'm physically fit, but there are quite a few elderly residents and there's the care home here too. 'Also, no-one seems to be able to contact the phone number attached with the letter.' Doug Burnham, 49, who has lived on The Villas for 15 years, added: 'It's a very difficult situation. I can't see how our neighbourhood differs from any other neighbourhood. Residents have slammed Royal Mail for not giving them any warning about the cancellation of the service. 'Sweeping and cleaning is something we do as often as possible. We also tackle things like potholes, drainage issues and fly-tipping. 'We are open to discussions. 'We would be willing to pay if there were particularly problematic areas and we do that anyway, but obviously we couldn't do the entirety of the paving.' Resident Catherine Burgass, 47, added: 'I was extremely surprised we had not had any prior warning. 'The pavement has been in the same condition since I moved in 15 years ago. 'Everybody's annoyed about it.' A Royal Mail spokesperson said: 'We have taken the decision to suspend deliveries to a small number of addresses after a number of incidents involving colleagues falling and slipping. 'Our priority is the safety of our people and we apologise to customers.'

The decision came after several postal workers reported falling and slipping incidents. The affected residents, who now have to make a four-mile round trip to collect their mail from a central depot, criticized Royal Mail for not giving any prior warning. The Villas Residents' Association, which maintains the street, is open to repairing problematic areas but says it would be too costly to fix the entire stretch."},{"question":"The digestive system is the body system that digests food. It digest food in two ways, mechanically and chemically. Both help in the process of turning food into nutrients. The digestive system also eliminates solid food waste. The major organs of the digestive system include the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and small and large in- testines. These organs all work together to help you gain energy from the food you eat. Digestion starts in the mouth. When food is swallowed, it travels through the esophagus to the stomach. In the stomach, digestion continues and a small amount of absorption of nutrients takes place. Most chemical digestion and nearly all absorption of nutrients take place in the small intestine. This organ consists of three parts: duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. The large intestine is the last stop in the digestive system. This is where water is absorbed. The food not digested is released as waste.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Stalin's death in 1953 was the biggest step toward Shostakovich's rehabilitation as a creative artist, which was marked by his Tenth Symphony. It features a number of musical quotations and codes (notably the DSCH and Elmira motifs, Elmira Nazirova being a pianist and composer who had studied under Shostakovich in the year before his dismissal from the Moscow Conservatory), the meaning of which is still debated, while the savage second movement, according to Testimony, is intended as a musical portrait of Stalin. The Tenth ranks alongside the Fifth and Seventh as one of Shostakovich's most popular works. 1953 also saw a stream of premieres of the \\"desk drawer\\" works. During the forties and fifties, Shostakovich had close relationships with two of his pupils, Galina Ustvolskaya and Elmira Nazirova. In the background to all this remained Shostakovich's first, open marriage to Nina Varzar until her death in 1954. He taught Ustvolskaya from 1937 to 1947. The nature of their relationship is far from clear: Mstislav Rostropovich described it as \\"tender\\". Ustvolskaya rejected a proposal of marriage from him after Nina's death. Shostakovich's daughter, Galina, recalled her father consulting her and Maxim about the possibility of Ustvolskaya becoming their stepmother. Ustvolskaya's friend Viktor Suslin said that she had been \\"deeply disappointed\\" in Shostakovich by the time of her graduation in 1947. The relationship with Nazirova seems to have been one-sided, expressed largely through his letters to her, and can be dated to around 1953 to 1956. He married his second wife, Komsomol activist Margarita Kainova, in 1956; the couple proved ill-matched, and divorced three years later. In 1954, Shostakovich wrote the Festive Overture, opus 96; it was used as the theme music for the 1980 Summer Olympics. (His '\\"Theme from the film Pirogov, Opus 76a: Finale\\" was played as the cauldron was lit at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece.) In 1959, Shostakovich appeared on stage in Moscow at the end of a concert performance...

Was it fitting that late 2016 saw us all standing stock still, as if we were trying to convince a suspicious bear we were already dead? Phone cameras prowled around increasingly elaborate and celebrity-bedecked tableaux vivants, looking for signs of life, yet no one stirred as the views racked up. In that sense, this was the additive inverse of 2013’s Harlem Shake. It was an ice bucket challenge where no one needed nominating. A Cheerios challenge where you didn’t have to put cereal on a sleeping baby’s forehead. Or, if you prefer, a running-man challenge that wasn’t quite so tedious. It feels mesolithic in internet years, but the original mannequin challenge is preserved as well as any Florentine sculpture, on Twitter, dated 26 October by a user called @pvrity___ (Jasmine Cavins). In it, a group of teens at Edward H White high school, in Jacksonville, Florida, remain completely still in class in mildly interesting poses. For all their inertia, things rapidly picked up steam. Five thousand retweets later, by 7 November, Hillary Clinton was doing it on her jet, accompanied by Bill and Jon Bon Jovi. That’s right – within two weeks, even your mum had heard of it. Somewhere, the song Black Beetle by rap duo Rae Sremmurd became a modern version of Baauer’s Harlem Shake and, from early ensemble performances involving hundreds of high-schoolers, it spiralled out to sports teams, then the celebrity world, via a postmodern version performed by Rae Sremmurd themselves. Days later, Paul McCartney jumped in, then Destiny’s Child, Adele, Warren Beatty, Taylor Swift, and LeBron James and Michelle Obama together in the Oval Office. Jamie Vardy did it to celebrate his goal against Spain, and by the time Wembley was filing out, the Spanish team were doing their own version down in their dressing room.

A reflection paper is somewhat personal in that it includes your subjective feelings and opinions. Instead of revealing everything about yourself, carefully ask yourself if something is appropriate before including it in your paper. If you feel uncomfortable about a personal issue that affects the conclusions you reached, it is wisest not to include personal details about it. If a certain issue is unavoidable but you feel uncomfortable revealing your personal experiences or feelings regarding it, write about the issue in more general terms. Identify the issue itself and indicate concerns you have professionally or academically. A reflection paper is personal and objective, but you should still keep your thoughts organized and sensible. Avoid dragging someone else down in your writing. If a particular person made the experience you are reflecting on difficult, unpleasant, or uncomfortable, you must still maintain a level of detachment as you describe that person's influence. Instead of stating something like, “Bob was such a rude jerk,” say something more along the lines of, “One man was abrupt and spoke harshly, making me feel as though I was not welcome there.” Describe the actions, not the person, and frame those actions within the context of how they influenced your conclusions. A reflection paper is one of the few pieces of academic writing in which you can get away with using the first person pronoun “I.” That said, you should still relate your subjective feelings and opinions using specific evidence to explain them. Avoid slang and always use correct spelling and grammar. Internet abbreviations like “LOL” or “OMG” are fine to use personally among friends and family, but this is still an academic paper, so you need to treat it with the grammatical respect it deserves. Do not treat it as a personal journal entry. Check and double-check your spelling and grammar after you finish your paper. A clear, well-written paper must have clear, well-written sentences. Keep your sentences focused. Avoid squeezing multiple ideas into one sentence. Avoid sentence fragments. Make sure that each sentence has a subject and a verb. Vary your sentence length. Include both simple sentences with a single subject and verb and complex sentences with multiple clauses. Doing so makes your paper sound more conversational and natural, and prevents the writing from becoming too wooden. Transitional phrases shift the argument and introduce specific details. They also allow you to illustrate how one experience or detail directly links to a conclusion or understanding. Common transitional phrases include \\"for example,\\" \\"for instance,\\" \\"as a result,\\" \\"an opposite view is,\\" and \\"a different perspective is.\\" You can incorporate information you learned in the classroom with information addressed by the reading, lecture, or experience. For instance, if reflecting on a piece of literary criticism, you could mention how your beliefs and ideas about the literary theory addressed in the article relate to what your instructor taught you about it or how it applies to prose and poetry read in class. As another example, if reflecting on a new social experience for a sociology class, you could relate that experience to specific ideas or social patterns discussed in class.","response":"A reflection paper is a personal and objective piece of writing where you share your feelings and opinions on a topic or experience, while maintaining an organized and well-written format with correct grammar, spelling, and avoiding slang or personal journal entry style."},{"question":"Christoph Ernst Friedrich von Forcade de Biaix (* 17 September 1821, Büren near Paderborn; † 18 July 1891 at Reckenberg Castle, in Lichtenfels, Hesse) was a German Rittergut owner, Appellate Court Judge in Hamm, Supreme Court Judge in Berlin and Member of parliament in the German Reichstag.

Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","response":"The hypothesis is entailed by the premise, as we can see from the given information. Let's break down the premise and hypothesis for better understanding. Premise: \\"By far the oddest offering of the week is A&.\\" The premise states that A& is significantly unusual or peculiar when compared to other offerings within a given week. The use of \\"by far\\" adds emphasis to the level of oddity, suggesting that A& stands out from the rest due to its strangeness. Hypothesis: \\"A& is an unusual offering.\\" The hypothesis claims that A& is an unusual or atypical offering, which does not necessarily provide information on the context or other offerings. However, it aligns with the general notion that A& is identified as an odd or unique item. When comparing the premise and hypothesis, it's clear that the hypothesis – \\"A& is an unusual offering\\" – is a simplified or more general statement derived from the premise. The premise implies that A& is not only unusual but also the oddest compared to other offerings within a specific week. As a result, the hypothesis can be considered a reasonable and valid conclusion based on the information provided in the premise. In summary, given the premise that \\"By far the oddest offering of the week is A&,\\" the hypothesis that \\"A& is an unusual offering\\" is indeed entailed by the premise. This is because both statements emphasize the uncommon or peculiar nature of A&, and the hypothesis serves as a simpler and more generalized version of the premise's assertion."},{"question":"Here is a review left by a customer on a product.

Van Winkle has never known his biological father; he was given the family name of the Dutch man his mother was married to at the time of his birth. When Van Winkle was four, his mother divorced. Afterward, he grew up moving between Dallas and Miami, where his new stepfather worked at a car dealership. Context: In 1985, he was focusing all of his energy on motocross, winning three championships. After breaking his ankle during a race, Ice was not interested in racing professionally for some time, using his spare time to perfect his dance moves and creating his own while his ankle was healing. Ice used his beatboxing and breakdancing skills as a street performer with his friends at local malls during this time. One evening he visited City Lights, a South Dallas nightclub, where he was dared to go on stage by his friend Squirrel during an open-mic. He won the crowd over and was asked by City Lights manager John Bush if he wanted to perform regularly, which he accepted. Ice would be joined on stage with his disc jockey D-Shay and Zero as well as Earthquake, the local disc jockey at City Lights. The Vanilla Ice Posse or The V.I.P. would also perform with Ice on stage. As a performer for City Lights, Ice opened up for N.W.A, Public Enemy, The D.O.C., Tone Loc, 2 Live Crew, Paula Abdul, Sinbad and MC Hammer. In January 1987, Ice was stabbed five times during a scuffle outside of City Lights. After spending ten days at the hospital, Ice signed a contract with the owner of City Lights, Tommy Quon and his management company, Ultrax. Two years later, Ice would open for EPMD, Ice-T, Stetsasonic, and Sir Mix-A-Lot on the Stop the Violence Tour. Quon saw commercial potential in Ice's rapping and dancing skills. Buying studio time with Quon's earnings from City Lights, they recorded songs that had been perfected on stage by Ice and his acquaintances with various producers, including Khayree. The two year production was distributed by an independent record company called Ichiban Records in 1989. \\"Play That Funky Music\\" was released as the album's first single, with \\"Ice Ice Baby\\" appearing as the B-side. Tommy Quon personally sent out the single to various radio stations around the US, but the single was seldom played and when it was, it did not get the reaction Quon was hoping for. When disc jockey Darrell Jaye in Georgia played \\"Ice Ice Baby\\" instead of the single's A-side, the song gained a quick fanbase and other radio stations followed suit. Quon financed 8,000 for the production of a music video for \\"Ice Ice Baby\\", which received heavy airplay by The Box, increasing public interest in the song. Following the success of \\"Ice Ice Baby\\", record producer Suge Knight and two bodyguards arrived at The Palm in West Hollywood, where Ice was eating. After shoving Ice's bodyguards aside, Knight and his own bodyguards sat down in front of Ice, staring at him before finally asking \\"How you doin'?\\" Similar incidents were repeated on several occasions. Eventually, Knight showed up at Ice's hotel suite on the fifteenth floor of the Bel Age Hotel, accompanied by a member of the Los Angeles Raiders football team. According to Ice, Knight took him out on the balcony by himself, and implied that he would throw him off the balcony unless he signed the publishing rights to the song over to Knight; Knight used Ice's money to help fund Death Row Records. Question: did he sign contract with any company. Whats the answer?","response":"Yes, Vanilla Ice, also known as Robert Matthew Van Winkle, signed a contract with Tommy Quon, the owner of City Lights nightclub, and his management company, Ultrax.

Your task is to generate title for this article. Preferred titles are under thirty words. Problem:PURPOSE Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease with poor outcomes. Despite increased evidence shows that dysregulation of histone modification contributes to AML, specific drugs targeting key histone modulators are not applied in the clinical treatment of AML. Here, we investigated whether targeting KDM6B, the demethylase of tri-methylated histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3), has a therapeutic potential for AML. METHODS A KDM6B-specific inhibitor, GSK-J4, was applied to treat the primary cells from AML patients and AML cell lines in vitro and in vivo. RNA-sequencing was performed to reveal the underlying mechanisms of inhibiting KDM6B for the treatment of AML. RESULTS Here we observed that the mRNA expression of KDM6B was up-regulated in AML and positively correlated with poor survival. Treatment with GSK-J4 increased the global level of H3K27me3 and reduced the proliferation and colony-forming ability of primary AML cells and AML cell lines. GSK-J4 treatment significantly induced cell apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest in Kasumi-1 cells, and displayed a synergistic effect with cytosine arabinoside. Notably, injection of GSK-J4 attenuated the disease progression in a human AML xenograft mouse model in vivo. Treatment with GSK-J4 predominantly resulted in down-regulation of DNA replication and cell-cycle-related pathways, as well as abrogated the expression of critical cancer-promoting HOX genes. ChIP-qPCR validated an increased enrichment of H3K27me3 in the transcription start sites of these HOX genes. CONCLUSIONS In summary, our findings suggest that targeting KDM6B with GSK-J4 has a therapeutic potential for the treatment of AML.

(July 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Set in 1934 Paris, the film opens with Richard di Nardo, a young hustler, emerging from the bed of gay middle-aged Carroll Todd (Robert Preston), aka Toddy; Richard dresses, takes money from Toddy's wallet and leaves Toddy's apartment. Going about his day, Toddy, a performer at Chez Lui in Paris, sees Labisse, the club owner, auditioning a frail, impoverished soprano, Victoria Grant (Julie Andrews). After the audition, Labisse drily writes her off, and she responds by sustaining a pitch to shatter his wine glass using resonant frequency. That night, Richard comes to Chez Lui as part of a straight foursome and Toddy incites a brawl by insulting Richard and the women in his group. Labisse fires Toddy and bans him from the club. Walking home, he spots Victoria dining at a restaurant, and she invites him to join her. As neither of them can pay for the meal, she dumps a cockroach in her salad to avoid paying their check, but it escapes and the whole place breaks out in havoc. The duo run out through the rain to Toddy's, and he invites her to stay when she finds that the rain has shrunk her cheap clothes. The next morning Richard shows up to collect his things. Victoria, who is wearing his clothes, hides in Toddy's closet. When she thinks that Richard might harm Toddy, she ambushes Richard and literally kicks him out. Witnessing this, Toddy is struck with the inspiration of passing Victoria off as a man (the illusion convinced Richard who stumbles downstairs to his friends waiting in the car claiming a strange man wearing his clothes hit him) and presenting her to Andre Cassell (John Rhys-Davies), the most successful agent in Paris, as a female impersonator.

Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","response":"The premise and the hypothesis are related, but the premise does not necessarily entail the hypothesis. The premise discusses not having the chance to read and mentions reading Dickens' \\"A Tale of Two Cities,\\" while the hypothesis states a personal dislike for the same novel. To analyze the two statements' relationship further, let's break down both the premise and the hypothesis. Premise: 1. The person speaking had a chance to read and did not take it. 2. They read Charles Dickens' \\"A Tale of Two Cities.\\" 3. The context of their reading experience remains unclear. Hypothesis: 1. The person did not enjoy or appreciate \\"A Tale of Two Cities.\\" From the given information, we cannot deduce that the reader's lack of enjoyment is the primary reason for them not reading more. There could be other factors at play, such as lack of time, other interests, or a preference for different genres. The hypothesis's statement may be related to the discussion surrounding \\"A Tale of Two Cities\\" and why they never got a chance to read more, but it doesn't necessarily imply causality. In conclusion, while the premise and the hypothesis have some connection, the premise doesn't entail the hypothesis. The lack of enjoyment of \\"A Tale of Two Cities\\" might be a contributing factor in the broader discussion, but it's not the only reason for the speaker not getting a chance to read more.

The question seems to be suggesting that when sealer is not applied to wood, it could affect the amount of sediment that wind and water can pick up. To answer this question, we must differentiate between the effects of sealing wood and the geological processes of sediment erosion, transportation, and deposition that lead to sedimentary rock formation. Sealing wood is a process used to protect wood surfaces from damage caused by water, moisture, and other environmental factors. By applying sealer, the wood is prevented from absorbing water, and it becomes more resistant to rot or decay. However, this preservation method is related to human constructions or crafts and not directly connected to sediment erosion or sedimentary rock formation. Now, let's break down the sedimentation process: 1. Wind and water erode rocks, which is influenced by natural geological forces and weather patterns. 2. The wind and water pick up the eroded sediment, forming sediment particles that are transported by these natural elements. 3. As sediment particles are carried away, they eventually settle in a new location, where deposition occurs. 4. Over time, multiple layers of sediment accumulate, with the older layers becoming compacted due to the pressure from the newer sediment layers above it. 5. This prolonged compression results in the formation of sedimentary rocks. Given the nature of this sedimentation process, whether or not sealer is applied to wood has no direct effect on the amount of sediment that wind and water pick up. Wood sealer is designed to protect wood from environmental damage, but it is not a contributing factor to the natural geological process involved in sediment erosion, transportation, and deposition. Therefore, the presence or absence of sealed wood in the environment will have no measurable impact on the sediment picked up by wind and water. In conclusion, the correct answer is C: No effect. Whether or not sealer is applied to wood does not influence the amount of sediment picked up by wind and water and is unrelated to the natural processes that lead to the formation of sedimentary rocks."},{"question":"Q: Question: what is the function of the hard palate? Would \\"Also on the anterior portion of the roof of the hard palate is the Rugae which are the irregular ridges in the mucous membrane that help facilitate the movement of food backwards towards the pharynx.\\" be a reasonable answer? The answer is:","response":"Yes, that would be a reasonable answer. To provide further context and a step-by-step explanation: 1. The primary function of the hard palate is to separate the nasal cavity from the oral cavity. This allows for simultaneous breathing and eating without the risk of food entering the nasal passages. 2. The hard palate also plays a crucial role in the process of chewing and swallowing. It provides a stable surface against which the tongue can compress food during mastication. 3. The Rugae, which are the irregular ridges in the mucous membrane covering the hard palate, contribute to this process. They help facilitate the movement of food backwards towards the pharynx by providing additional traction and contact points for the tongue to manipulate the food. 4. Furthermore, the hard palate is involved in speech production, particularly in the formation of certain consonant sounds that require the tongue to make contact with the roof of the mouth. In summary, the function of the hard palate is to separate the nasal and oral cavities, facilitate chewing and swallowing, and play a role in speech production. The statement \\"Also on the anterior portion of the roof of the hard palate is the Rugae which are the irregular ridges in the mucous membrane that help facilitate the movement of food backwards towards the pharynx\\" accurately describes one of the functions of the hard palate and its anatomical features."},{"question":"Answer the following question: James loved going down.

You'll be given the following question. Please do chain-of-thought reasoning. Pick which sentence is not logical. Options: - Sentence A: \\"The sky is blue.\\" - Sentence B: \\"The sky is made of diamonds\\"","response":"To determine which sentence is not logical, let's analyze both sentences: - Sentence A: \\"The sky is blue.\\" The sky often appears blue due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. When sunlight passes through Earth's atmosphere, gases and particles in the atmosphere scatter the light, and our eyes perceive the blue color. This observation is consistent with our everyday experience and scientific understanding. Therefore, Sentence A is logical. - Sentence B: \\"The sky is made of diamonds.\\" The sky is not made of diamonds, but rather it consists of different layers of gases, mainly nitrogen and oxygen, along with cloud formations and other elements like dust and water vapor. Diamonds are made of carbon and require high pressure and temperatures to form, which do not exist in the Earth's atmosphere. Also, we have no empirical evidence or scientific basis to support the claim that the sky is made of diamonds. Therefore, Sentence B is not logical. Based on the chain-of-thought reasoning, Sentence B: \\"The sky is made of diamonds\\" is the sentence that is not logical."},{"question":"One of the following sentences is nonsensical.

So think first.","response":"To determine which sentence is nonsensical, let's analyze each sentence's meaning: Sentence A: \\"The nurse cared for the healthy patient\\" This sentence implies that a nurse is taking care of a patient who is in good health. While it may be less common for a nurse to care for a healthy patient, it is not entirely nonsensical as there could be instances where a healthy individual requires a nurse's assistance or for preventive care. Sentence B: \\"The nurse cared for the sick patient\\" This sentence implies that a nurse is taking care of a patient who is unwell. This is a commonly expected situation for nurses, as their primary role includes providing care and support to people dealing with illnesses or health issues. Both sentences are technically sensible. However, if we had to choose one that is slightly less logical or more unusual, it would be Sentence A: \\"The nurse cared for the healthy patient\\" because it is less common for a nurse to care for a healthy individual compared to a sick patient. But neither sentence is truly nonsensical."},{"question":"A struggle for succession in the mid-twelfth century gave the Fujiwara an opportunity to regain their former power.

Answer: The greenhouse effect is the natural process of the Earth's atmosphere trapping heat and keeping the planet at a temperature suitable for human habitation. However, due to human activities, an enhanced greenhouse effect is occurring, leading to global warming. The main causes of the enhanced greenhouse effect are: 1. Burning of Fossil Fuels: The combustion of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) releases carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere. Human dependence on these fuels for electricity generation, industry, and transportation has led to a substantial increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Carbon dioxide is a major greenhouse gas that traps heat and contributes to global warming. 2. Deforestation: Trees and plants absorb CO2 during the process of photosynthesis. Large-scale deforestation reduces the amount of CO2 absorbed and leads to higher concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere. Deforestation is primarily caused by land-use changes, such as agriculture, logging, and urbanization, which further exacerbates the greenhouse effect. 3. Agriculture and Livestock Farming: Agriculture contributes to greenhouse gas emissions through the release of methane (CH4) from livestock farming and the decomposition of organic matter in rice paddies. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas with a significantly higher global warming potential compared to CO2. Nitrous oxide (N2O), another greenhouse gas, is released through the use of nitrogen-based fertilizers and other agricultural practices. These gases contribute significantly to global warming. 4. Industrial Processes: Some industrial processes, such as cement production and refrigeration, release greenhouse gases like CO2 and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) into the atmosphere. HFCs are particularly harmful since they have a substantially higher global warming potential than CO2. 5. Waste Management: Decomposition of organic waste in landfills produces methane gas which contributes to global warming. Additionally, some waste management practices, such as waste incineration, produce CO2 emissions. These factors combined have caused an increase in global average temperatures due to the higher concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The consequences of global warming are far-reaching and include more frequent and intense heatwaves, shifting precipitation patterns, rising sea levels, and an increase in the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events. Improving energy efficiency, transitioning to renewable energy sources, afforestation, and implementing sustainable agriculture and waste management practices are some of the ways we can address and mitigate the enhanced greenhouse effect and its impacts on the planet."},{"question":"Write a sentence in English.","response":"1.

Armenians kept to their traditions and certain diasporans rose to fame with their music. In the post-Genocide Armenian community of the United States, the so-called \\"kef\\" style Armenian dance music, using Armenian and Middle Eastern folk instruments (often electrified/amplified) and some western instruments, was popular. This style preserved the folk songs and dances of Western Armenia, and many artists also played the contemporary popular songs of Turkey and other Middle Eastern countries from which the Armenians emigrated. Richard Hagopian is perhaps the most famous artist of the traditional \\"kef\\" style and the Vosbikian Band was notable in the 40s and 50s for developing their own style of \\"kef music\\" heavily influenced by the popular American Big Band Jazz of the time. Later, stemming from the Middle Eastern Armenian diaspora and influenced by Continental European (especially French) pop music, the Armenian pop music genre grew to fame in the 60s and 70s with artists such as Adiss Harmandian and Harout Pamboukjian performing to the Armenian diaspora and Armenia. Also with artists such as Sirusho, performing pop music combined with Armenian folk music in today's entertainment industry. Other Armenian diasporans that rose to fame in classical or international music circles are world-renowned French-Armenian singer and composer Charles Aznavour, pianist Sahan Arzruni, prominent opera sopranos such as Hasmik Papian and more recently Isabel Bayrakdarian and Anna Kasyan. Certain Armenians settled to sing non-Armenian tunes such as the heavy metal band System of a Down (which nonetheless often incorporates traditional Armenian instrumentals and styling into their songs) or pop star Cher. Ruben Hakobyan (Ruben Sasuntsi) is a well recognized Armenian ethnographic and patriotic folk singer who has achieved widespread national recognition due to his devotion to Armenian folk music and exceptional talent. In the Armenian diaspora, Armenian revolutionary songs are popular with the youth.[citation needed] These songs encourage Armenian patriotism and are generally about Armenian history and national heroes.

The conflict was caused by Prussian ambitions to extend German unification and French fears of the shift in the European balance of power that would result if the Prussians succeeded. Some historians argue that the Prussian chancellor Otto von Bismarck deliberately provoked a French attack in order to draw the southern German statesBaden, Württemberg, Bavaria and Hesse-Darmstadtinto an alliance with the North German Confederation dominated by Prussia, while others contend that Bismarck did not plan anything and merely exploited the circumstances as they unfolded. - An assault rifle is a selective-fire rifle that uses an intermediate cartridge and a detachable magazine. Assault rifles were first used during World War II. Though Western nations were slow to accept the assault rifle concept after World War II, by the end of the 20th century they had become the standard weapon in most of the world's armies, replacing semi-automatic rifles, battle rifles and sub-machine guns in most roles. Examples include the StG 44, AK-47 and the M16 rifle. - The French Army, officially the Land Army (to distinguish it from the Air Army) is the land-based and largest component of the French Armed Forces. Along with the French Air Force, the French Navy and the National Gendarmerie, it is responsible to the French government. The current Chief of Staff of the French Army (C.E.M.A.T.) is General Jean-Pierre Bosser, a direct subordinate of the Chief of the Defence Staff (C.E.M.A.). All soldiers are considered professionals following the suspension of conscription, voted in parliament in 1997 and made effective in 2001. - The Fusil Gras Modèle 1874 M80 was a French service rifle of the 19th century . The Gras used by the French Army was an adaptation to metallic cartridge of the Chassepot breech - loading rifle by Colonel Basile Gras . - The service rifle (also known as standard-issue rifle) of a given army or armed force is that which it issues as standard to its soldiers. In modern forces, this is typically a highly versatile and rugged assault rifle, battle rifle or carbine suitable for use in nearly all theatres and environments. Service rifles are also often selected for their upgradability (e.g., the addition of underslung grenade launchers, sights, flashlights, laser sights, etc.) - The Chassepot, officially known as Fusil modèle 1866, was a bolt action military breechloading rifle, famous as the arm of the French forces in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870/1871. It replaced an assortment of Minié muzzleloading rifles many of which were converted in 1867 to breech loading (the Tabatière rifles). A great improvement to existing military rifles in 1866, the Chassepot marked the commencement of the era of modern bolt action, breech-loading, military rifles. Beginning in 1874, the rifle was easily converted to fire metallic cartridges (under the name of Gras rifle), a step which would have been impossible to achieve with the Dreyse needle rifle. - The French Navy (\\"national navy\\"), informally , is the maritime arm of the French Armed Forces. Tracing its roots back to 1624 it is one of the world's oldest naval forces and historically played a key part in establishing the French colonial empire. Since the early foundings, its roles have been defined as maintaining intelligence, protecting populations, preventing crises, intervening wherever necessary to reestablish peace, and dissuading any threats against vital French interests. The Marine nationale consists of four branches: the \\"Force d'Action Navale\\", the \\"Forces Sous-marines\\", the \\"Aéronavale\\" and the \\"Fusiliers Marins\\" (including Commandos Marine). As a blue-water navy the Marine nationale operates a wide range of fighting vessels, including a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, nuclear-powered submarines, frigates, patrol boats and support ships. The French Navy does not use prefixes of the names of its ships (such as the Royal Navy uses HMS, for instance). Foreign commentators sometimes use the prefixes \\"FS\\" (for \\"French Ship\\") or FNS (for \\"French Navy Ship\\"); these are not official, however. - Conscription, or drafting, is the compulsory enlistment of people in a national service, most often a military service. Conscription dates back to antiquity and continues in some countries to the present day under various names. The modern system of near-universal national conscription for young men dates to the French Revolution in the 1790s, where it became the basis of a very large and powerful military. Most European nations later copied the system in peacetime, so that men at a certain age would serve 18 years on active duty and then transfer to the reserve force.

In this case, option (3) seems most relevant, as the text explicitly states that the cat is suffering from the runs due to the antibiotics. Nevertheless, let's explore all the available choices in detail: (1) They will go back to the vet for more: It is unclear if the cat owner will go back to the vet for more antibiotics. Since the cat is experiencing an adverse reaction to the medication, the owner might consult the vet for advice on whether to continue the treatment or seek an alternative solution. (2) None of the above choices: This option is vague and might not offer an appropriate response to the specific situation pertaining to the cat. Although it is possible that the other options are not accurate, there is a clear indication that the antibiotics have affected the cat, as mentioned in the text. (3) They will have the runs until they feel better: This option is the most likely outcome based on the information provided in the text. Due to the antibiotics, the cat has developed diarrhea, which seems to be a temporary side effect. Once the cat's body has adjusted or finished the course of antibiotics, it is expected that the cat's condition will improve, and the runs will cease. The owner should keep a close eye on the cat's health and consult the veterinarian if the symptoms worsen or persist. (4) They will use the litter box: As the text specifically states that the cat cannot use the litter box when it has the runs, this option seems unlikely. The cat may have trouble controlling its bowel movements during this time, which can contribute to the inability to use the litter box. Once the cat's health improves and the runs subside, it is more likely that the cat will return to normal litter box habits. In conclusion, the most probable outcome is option (3), where the cat will have the runs until they feel better. While the other choices may contain elements of truth, they don't fully address the situation or the effects of the antibiotics on the cat. The cat owner should continue to monitor their pet's condition and consult the vet if needed."},{"question":"Write an email with the following subject: Merry Christmas","response":"Subject: Merry Christmas: Greetings, Reflections, and Best Wishes for the New Year!

Douglas set about introducing more squadrons and dispersing the few GL sets to create a carpet effect in the southern counties. Still, in February 1941, there remained only seven squadrons with 87 pilots, under half the required strength. The GL carpet was supported by six GCI sets controlling radar-equipped night-fighters. By the height of the Blitz, they were becoming more successful. The number of contacts and combats rose in 1941, from 44 and two in 48 sorties in January 1941, to 204 and 74 in May (643 sorties). But even in May, 67% of the sorties were visual cat's-eye missions. Curiously, while 43% of the contacts in May 1941 were by visual sightings, they accounted for 61% of the combats. Yet when compared with Luftwaffe daylight operations, there was a sharp decline in German losses to 1%. If a vigilant bomber crew could spot the fighter first, they had a decent chance at evading it.\\" Answer: Answer:","response":"The night fighters were special because they were radar-equipped, allowing them to detect and engage enemy aircraft during nighttime operations. This technology significantly improved their chances of making contact with and combating enemy planes, leading to higher success rates during the Blitz. However, visual sightings still accounted for a significant portion of contacts and combats, showing that the night fighters' abilities were not solely reliant on radar technology. Their presence, combined with the GL carpet and GCI sets, formed an important part of the British air defense strategy during World War II."},{"question":"Select from the following. (1). In 2004.

So there I was, this past weekend: properly liquored up and inhaling some pretty delicious chicken quesadillas (yeah, I go to dayclubs for the food). Now, I'm completely lost in thought, thinking about how delicious cheese and sour cream together can be when I decide it's time to get some free drinks at the blackjack table.

Luke Garratt. Ms Yang posed as globetrotting Interpol agent 'Mr Li' in order to con various middle-aged single women out of money and possesions. A 54-year old Chinese woman conned victims out of thousands by claiming she was a 'superhuman' male police officer who could turn himself invisible. The con-woman, identified only as Ms Yang, duped her victims out of at least £12,000 by pretending to be 'Mr Li', an officer of Interpol and member of the Chinese Ministry of Finance with superhuman powers. According to the Telegraph, she would use this alter-ego to seduce people she met on a forum for middle-aged singles, before stealing from them. When Ms Yang became short on cash in early 2013, she allegedly faked documents to access and post on the internet forum, where she posed as 'Mr Li' a senior communist party official. She would identify her marks, chat with them, and establish the lie that she was a superhuman police officer. Her first victim was Ms Zhang, a 48-year-old woman who began a relationship with 'Mr Li' in March 2013, and by June, the couple had moved in together. Ms Zhang, who was, according to the Beijing News 'quite suspicious' was allegedly utterly taken in by the lies. The lie was continued to the point that Ms Yang would cut her hair short and deepen her voice when telling stories to Ms Zhang about how she (as Mr Li) had cracked 'major' interpol cases using his superhuman powers. The thievery began when 'Mr Li' claimed he had lost his wallet and needed money to 'recieve international friends'. Ms. Zhang lent her partner around £11,800 (120,000 yuan) under the guise. that Mr Li would repay her, and that the money would 'help him do things. for the country'. Ms Yang's fabricated character 'Mr Li' more closely resembled a comic book character like Susan Storm (The Invisible Woman) than a real-life Interpol agent, but she still managed to con thousands out of her marks. The debt was never settled, and in August 'Mr Li' vanished from Ms Zhang's life. When Ms Zhang, heartbroken, went to look for 'Mr Li' at the Ministry of Finance, she was told that he did not exist. 'Mr Li' then moved on to another person, conning a mark, a 52-year-old woman named Ms Song, out of a laptop computer. A third victim, a pensioner, was conned out of £400. Her cover was eventually blown when her first lover, Ms Zhang, approached the police looking for 'Mr Li', beofre being told that 'Mr Li never existed, and was actually a 54-year-old woman.

He is testing three strains of bacteria, case A, case B, and case C. In case A the bacteria does not respond to antibiotics. In case B the bacteria resists antibiotics. Finally, in case C, the bacteria does not develop any immunity to antibiotics and eventually perishes. In which case the organism would less likely have genetic disorder, case B or case C? Answer:","response":"In order to determine which case is less likely to have a genetic disorder, we must first understand the differences in their responses to antibiotics. - In case A, the bacteria do not respond to antibiotics. This could indicate a genetic disorder rendering the bacteria unable to interact with the antibiotics, or they might simply be inherently resistant to the antibiotics tested. - In case B, the bacteria resist antibiotics. This implies that the bacteria have developed a defense mechanism to survive in the presence of antibiotics, which could be a result of a natural selection process, where the resistant bacteria survive and proliferate. - In case C, the bacteria do not develop any immunity to antibiotics and eventually perish. This implies that the bacteria are susceptible to the antibiotics and have no defense mechanism to prevent their destruction. Based on these descriptions, it appears that case C is less likely to have a genetic disorder compared to case B. In case C, the bacteria's inability to develop resistance may suggest a genetic makeup that is more susceptible to antibiotics, but it does not indicate a genetic disorder. On the other hand, case B shows the presence of resistance to antibiotics, which could be an outcome of natural selection and adaptation. However, the development of such resistance can also involve genetic mutations or acquisition of genes providing resistance from other bacteria, which in some cases can be considered a genetic change or disorder when compared to the original strain. It is essential to note that determining whether a genetic disorder is present in any given case is complex and requires in-depth genetic analysis. Assumptions based on antibiotic resistance or susceptibility alone do not offer conclusive evidence about the presence of a genetic disorder."},{"question":"What is the solution to this math problem?

Canola oil works well. You may also choose olive or coconut oil. However, olive and coconut oils have lower boiling points than canola oil. Choose your base depending on your application. If your final dish's recipe calls for a particular type of oil, you may consider that or a reliable substitute as an appropriate oil base. You want to start with dry marijuana. You may choose to stick with only the flowers. Some people will use all parts of the plant. Keep in mind that you will want to strain your oil later. Try not to grind your pot so finely that it will go through your strainer. A coffee grinder or food processor will work well. Just don't turn your marijuana into powder. The strength of your cannabis cooking oil will vary by your mixture. Pour your oil into a slow cooker, double boiler, or saucepan. Add your ground marijuana and stir. Make sure all your marijuana is covered in oil. If you don't know what mixture will work, start with a mixture of two parts oil to one part marijuana by volume. For example, mix 2 cups of oil with 1 cup of ground marijuana or 100 millilitres of oil to 50 millilitres of marijuana. How you heat your mixture will depend on what you are cooking in. How much you are cooking will also impact your cooking method. The goal is to get your oil and pot mixture hot without scorching. Stir the mixture frequently. You can add a little water to the mix to avoid scorching. If using a slow cooker, cook the mixture on low for at least 6 hours. You may extend that to three days for a better infusion. If using a double boiler, cook on low for 6-8 hours. Eight hours will give you a better infusion. Stir occasionally and keep a close eye on your water level. Don't let your double boiler go dry. If using a saucepan, cook on low for no less than 3 hours. Stir frequently to avoid scorching. This method will be most susceptible to scorching. Do this while the oil is still hot for best results. You can strain the oil using a wire strainer to remove the larger pieces of marijuana. If you still have solids you want to get rid of, strain a second time through a coffee strainer. This will take a lot of time so be careful and patient. You may want to do small batches while you continue to simmer the mixture. Alternately, you can do your straining through cheesecloth. Use multiple layers for more filtration. Put your cheesecloth over the top of a large mixing bowl. Secure the sides with a rubber band. Pour the mixture into the bowl. If you can get cheesecloth, this method is often preferred because you can filter more at a time than you can with a coffee strainer. If you only have small coffee filters, try using a rubber band for protection. Find a tall glass and place the coffee strainer on top. Cup the top a little into the glass. Use a rubber band around the top of the glass and over the edges of the filter to hold the filter in place. If you use a glass container to pour your hot oil into, heat your glass up first. Consider running your glass under warm water and then scalding hot water for a few minutes. This should keep the glass from shattering from the intense heat. When your oil has been strained, store your oil in a proper container with an airtight lid. Your oil will lose potency when exposed to oxygen. It will stay good for about two months. You can extend the shelf life longer by refrigerating it. Your cooking oil will likely be very potent. You probably do not want to substitute all of your cooking oil with marijuana infused oil. Try substituting only a small portion such as half fluid ounce or more until you know the strength of your oil. Summary:","response":"Marijuana is fat-soluble, requiring oils with high fat content for cooking purposes. Canola, olive, and coconut oils can be used as a base. The oil should be combined with dry, ground marijuana in a slow cooker, double boiler, or saucepan. The general ratio is two parts oil to one part marijuana. Heating the mixture without scorching is essential. Slow cookers should be set to low for at least 6 hours, double boilers on low for 6-8 hours, and saucepans on low for a minimum of 3 hours. During cooking, stirring frequently is important, and water can be added to avoid scorching. Strain the hot oil mixture through a wire strainer, coffee strainer, or cheesecloth to remove solids. Store the infused oil in an airtight container, away from oxygen, for up to two months, or refrigerate for longer shelf life. Note that the oil will likely be potent, so avoid complete substitution in your recipes; start with small portions until you are aware of the strength of the infused oil."},{"question":"Write the next sentence.

A Russian lady came up to me and just asked me my name , where I lived , etc . I was so flustered the whole time , but I was able to respond to most of her questions . After that was over , I went to lunch . Question Why were they flustered ? Possible answers: Options: A. They were attracted to the Russian lady .. B. They were scared of the Russian lady .. C. They were anxious to hear a decision .. D. They were nervous during their interview .. The answer:","response":"D. They were nervous during their interview. The individual was flustered most likely because of the high-pressure situation of the speaking part/interview. It's common for people to experience nervousness or anxiety during interviews or when speaking to unfamiliar individuals, especially when being evaluated. The context provided suggests that this person may have been undergoing a speaking examination or interview, which can be inherently stressful for many people. Feeling flustered in these situations can stem from a multitude of factors, such as the fear of making mistakes, being judged, struggling with language barriers, or simply not knowing what to expect. There is no indication in the provided context that the person was attracted to or scared of the Russian lady, or that they were anxious to hear a specific decision. It appears that the main contributing factor to their flustered state was the difficulty they encountered during the speaking part/interview itself. When people are put into situations like this, their ability to think clearly and respond appropriately may be hindered by their nerves, making it even more challenging to engage in effective communication. Nonetheless, this individual was able to respond to most of the questions asked by the Russian lady, which implies that they managed to find a way to push past their nervousness and complete the task at hand. In summary, the person was flustered during the speaking part because of the nerves and anxiety associated with the interview-like situation, rather than any specific attribute or intention from the Russian lady. Overcoming nervousness during high-pressure situations is a valuable skill that can be improved with experience and practice, so this experience may ultimately serve as a learning opportunity for the individual."},{"question":"The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose bandshell raised 25 million from donors? , can you please find it?

The five-count indictment charges James Everett Dutschke, 41, with producing and using the deadly toxin as a weapon, using the mail to threaten Obama, Republican Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi and Lee County Judge Sadie Holland. The indictment alleges Dutschke tried to implicate someone else for the crimes. That other man, an Elvis impersonator named Paul Kevin Curtis, was arrested on April 17. He claimed he'd been framed, and the charges against him were dropped less than a week later. Dutschke was then arrested April 27 and charged with producing the ricin. Curtis had said the two men knew each other and had a falling out. New poison letters put ricin under microscope. An affidavit released earlier said investigators conducted searches of Dutschke's home and former place of business and found incriminating items including latex gloves and a dust mask. The mask tested positive for ricin. According to court papers, each letter contained the same message, saying in part, \\"Maybe I have your attention now Even if that means someone must die. This must stop. To see a wrong and not expose it, is to become a silent partner to its continuance.\\" What is ricin? The letters all ended with the words \\"I am KC and I approve this message.\\" That was a phrase commonly used by Paul Kevin Curtis in online postings. The indictment claims Dutschke used such language in the messages \\"to make it appear that Paul Kevin Curtis was responsible\\" for the letters. If convicted Dutschke could face up to life in prison and hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines. He is scheduled to be arraigned in Oxford, Mississippi, on Thursday. CNN's message to Dutschke's lawyer was not immediately returned. Ricin: Almost never deadly.

Question: suppose the weather is less windy happens, how will it affect MORE erosion by the ocean. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer to this question is:","response":"less. If the weather becomes less windy, it will generally cause a decrease in the intensity and frequency of ocean waves hitting the land. This, in turn, will result in less force being applied to the sand and rocks along the shoreline, leading to less erosion by the ocean. With regards to the second effect mentioned (ocean water pulling sand off beaches), a decrease in wave energy due to less windy conditions will have a lessening effect on this process as well. When waves are less powerful, they are less likely to pull sand off of the beaches and cause significant erosion. Consequently, this perturbation will lead to reduced erosion at the shoreline."},{"question":"Here is some data: Georgia (3) VACATOR Vacant; Georgia (3) DATE_OF_SUCCESSORS_FORMAL_INSTALLATION February 1, 1871.

Solve -45*f - 25*f + 7560 = 25*f + 13*f for f.","response":"Let's solve the given equation step by step. Given equation: -45f - 25f + 7560 = 25f + 13f Step 1: Combine like terms on both sides of the equation. On the left-hand side, we have -45f and -25f. Combining these: -45f - 25f = -70f On the right-hand side, we have 25f and 13f. Combining these: 25f + 13f = 38f Now, our equation becomes: -70f + 7560 = 38f Step 2: Isolate the variable 'f' by moving the terms with 'f' to one side of the equation and constants to the other side. To move the 38f term from the right-hand side to the left-hand side, we need to subtract it from both sides: -70f - 38f = 38f - 38f - 7560 Adding the like terms: -108f = -7560 Step 3: Solve for 'f'. Now, to isolate 'f', we'll divide both sides by -108: f = -7560 / -108 When we calculate the right-hand side, we get: f ≈ 70 So, the solution to the given equation is f ≈ 70."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Article: An ape has a larger brain than any animal except man, though it is much smaller than a man's brain.

Many people think that gorillas are very fierce. They are often described as standing upright like a man, beating their fists and roaring. In their home, in the forests of Central Africa, however, they are not at all like this, They are peaceful animals and never use their great strength unless attacked.

Jeffrey suspected Adam had an addiction to pain pills, so","response":"he decided to watch for signs and symptoms that might confirm his suspicions. Although their friendship was longstanding and deeply rooted, Jeffrey felt a sense of trepidation and responsibility for his friend's well-being. The recent shift in Adam's behavior had led Jeffrey to believe that more than just chance was causing the rapidly increasing battles the two friends were having. As days turned into weeks, Jeffrey began to take closer notice of Adam's routine. He started collecting information about his friend's social life, work commitments, and daily habits, thinking that any change could possibly be connected to pain pill usage. Jeffrey noticed a few red flags that fueled his suspicions. First and foremost, there was a significant withdrawal from social activities. Adam, once the life of the party, was now often making excuses to avoid social gatherings, even with their closest friends. Moreover, he seemed to have a constant aura of lethargy and exhaustion, frequently complaining about a lack of sleep and feeling unwell. In an attempt to find concrete evidence, Jeffrey decided to search Adam's home for any pain pills he might be hiding. In the depths of Adam's medicine cabinet, he found several prescription bottles containing various types of painkillers, most of which had been recently refilled despite their not-so-recent dates of issue. This discovery only deepened Jeffrey's concern for his friend. Now faced with the difficult decision of how to approach Adam about his addiction, Jeffrey consulted a therapist to seek guidance on the best way to broach the subject. The therapist suggested that Jeffrey express his genuine concern for Adam's well-being, creating a safe and non-judgmental environment for Adam to open up about his struggles. Heeding the therapist's advice, Jeffrey invited Adam over to his home for a quiet and intimate dinner. Over their meal, he expressed his worry for his friend and voiced the concern that Adam may be developing a dependence on painkillers. He tried to remain as compassionate and understanding as possible, highlighting their long friendship as a source of support during this difficult time. Adam seemed defensive at first, denying any problem and insisting that the prescriptions were only for temporary pain relief. However, as Jeffrey persisted, sharing his observations and evidence, Adam's facade began to crumble. With tears in his eyes, Adam admitted that he was, in fact, struggling with painkiller addiction. Once Adam's secret was out in the open, Jeffrey pledged to help his friend overcome the addiction. Together, they researched rehabilitation centers and support groups that catered to individuals dealing with prescription drug abuse. Despite the long road that lay ahead, Jeffrey remained Adam's rock during the entire process, demonstrating the true strength and resilience of their friendship. As the months passed and Adam gradually regained his footing in sobriety, Jeffrey marveled at the courage and determination his friend displayed. Their bond, once frayed by addiction, was now stronger than ever, and they vowed to continue prioritizing their friendship and well-being above all else."},{"question":"Přehodnocení pravidel týkajících se vlastnictví a modelu podniku se spoluúčastí V současné době směrnice požaduje, aby auditoři drželi většinu hlasovacích práv v auditorské firmě a ovládali správní radu[28].

Imagine watching a movie about a superhero named Super Sam. After watching, you decide to tell your friends what you think. You might say, \\"I watched a movie called Super Sam. It was really fun!

The place is London Paddington, which is a train station with the code TRQQP. Therefore, there should be a comma after \\"London Paddington\\" to indicate the start of this additional information, and a comma after \\"TRQQP Train Station\\" to signify the end of this side-note. The sentence then continues to the final destination - \\"to Aylesbury.\\" This usage of commas works like parentheses, to set off information that describes or adds to something previously mentioned."},{"question":"Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Gary Wright was born and raised in Cresskill, New Jersey. A child actor, he made his TV debut at the age of seven, on the show Captain Video and His Video Rangers, filmed in New York. Among other acting work, he appeared in TV and radio commercials, before being offered a part in the 1954 Broadway production of the musical Fanny. Wright played the role of Cesario, the son of Fanny, who was played by future Brady Bunch matriarch Florence Henderson. The only members from the original lineup, Wright and Mike Harrison relaunched Spooky Tooth with Jones and Graham from Wonderwheel, and Chris Stewart, formerly the bassist with English singer Terry Reid. Salewicz visited the band while they were recording at Island's Notting Hill studio and remarked of Wright's role in the group, \\"it is clear who is the leader of this brand of Spooky Tooth, and, I suspect, of the original, too\\"; Salewicz described Wright as \\"urbane, loquacious with the remnants of a New Jersey accent, and a touch of Dudley Moore about the face\\". On their new album, You Broke My Heart So I Busted Your Jaw (1973), Wright composed six of the eight tracks, including \\"Cotton Growing Man\\", \\"Wildfire\\" and \\"Self Seeking Man\\", and co-wrote the remaining two. With the group's standing having been elevated since 1970 - a situation that music journalist Steven Rosen likened at the time to the Yardbirds, the Move and other 1960s bands after their break-up - Spooky Tooth toured extensively to promote the album. Rolling Stone reviewer Jon Tiven praised Wright's songwriting on You Broke My Heart, adding: \\"there is tremendous consistency to these originals ... and 'Wildfire' is ample proof that Gary could have written for the Temptations if he really wanted to.\\" The band released a follow-up, Witness, in November 1973, by which point Graham had departed, with Mike Kellie returning on drums. By February 1974, Stewart and Harrison had also left. In January that year, Wright accompanied George Harrison to India, where they journeyed to Varanasi (Benares), the Hindu spiritual capital of India, and home to Harrison's friend Ravi Shankar. The visit would influence the spiritual quality of Wright's lyrics when he returned to his solo career. In England, he and Harrison worked together on The Place I Love (1974), the debut album by English duo Splinter. In addition to playing keyboards, Wright served as what author Simon Leng terms \\"a sounding board and musical amanuensis\\" on the project, which was the first album released on Harrison's Dark Horse record label. Wright regrouped with Spooky Tooth for a final album, The Mirror (1974), with Mike Patto as their new vocalist. Following further personnel changes, The Mirror was issued by Goodear Records in the UK in October 1974, a month after Wright had disbanded the group.

Choices: - generational alterations - eukaryotic alterations - mutational alterations - chromosomal alterations A: A:","response":"To find the correct term related to major changes in the genetic material, I will analyze each of the choices given, and then select the most appropriate one. 1. Generational alterations: This term does not seem to specifically relate to changes in genetic material. It could refer to changes between generations, but it is not clear whether it implies genetic changes or other types of changes in a lineage. 2. Eukaryotic alterations: Eukaryotic refers to a type of cell with a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles. While eukaryotic organisms undergo genetic changes, this term does not specifically describe major changes in the genetic material but focuses on the type of cell or organism. 3. Mutational alterations: Mutation is a term that directly refers to changes in the genetic material, either in the DNA sequence or the structure of chromosomes. This choice appears to be more relevant in the context of major changes in the genetic material. 4. Chromosomal alterations: Chromosomal alterations involve changes in the structure or number of chromosomes, which hold the genetic material in cells. This choice is also related to major changes in the genetic material. Between the two relevant choices, \\"mutational alterations\\" and \\"chromosomal alterations\\", I will choose the term that encompasses a broader range of major changes in the genetic material.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Collin Hoskins, a convicted felon, is struggling to finish the last three days of his probation. Collin, along with his short-tempered best friend Miles Turner, works for a moving company located in Oakland, a city in the Bay Area. One night while waiting for a red light, Collin witnesses a white police officer gun down a black civilian. As Collin is haunted by the incident, he begins to have nightmares and experiences hallucinations. At the same time, Miles becomes distraught by the gentrification of Oakland, and a resulting sense of loss of identity, home, and belonging. Miles purchases a gun from a friend on the basis of self-protection, an action which Collin strongly disapproves. As Miles continues to display erratic behavior, Collin's ex-girlfriend Val warns Collin of the dangers that may come from a continued friendship with Miles. Later that evening while having dinner, Miles' gun accidentally ends up in the hands of his young son Sean, an incident which horrifies Sean's mother Ashley, forcing both Collin and Miles to leave the house. At a party, an agitated Miles assaults a black man who misinterpreted Miles' persona as cultural appropriation, leading to a fight between the two.

Hypothesis: A toddler is in the sink playing with soap. .Multi-select problem: Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true? Pick from: A). yes. B). it is not possible to tell. C). no.","response":"B). it is not possible to tell. The statement \\"A small child is playing with soap suds in a sink.\\" is the given premise and the hypothesis presented is \\"A toddler is in the sink playing with soap.\\" Although there is quite a similarity between the premise and the hypothesis, there are minor but important differences that make it not possible to randomly decide that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true. Firstly, note that 'a small child' and 'a toddler' might not be the same. While a toddler is a technical term commonly referring to kids between the age of 12 to 36 months, a small child can be defined as a child that falls into a wider age range. It can be a toddler, but it may also refer to kids who are older than a toddler but are still considered young or small. Therefore, the child mentioned in the premise could be a toddler, but it could also be a child who is a bit older. Secondly, the premise states that the child is playing with soap suds ‘in a sink,’ while the hypothesis mentions that the toddler is 'in the sink playing with soap.' In the premise, it is not explicitly noted whether the child is in the sink or perhaps standing or sitting beside it and reaching over to play with the soap suds. On the contrary, the hypothesis puts the toddler directly in the sink. Additionally, it's important to mention the differentiation between soap and soap suds. In its original state, soap is a solid substance that becomes soap suds as it mixes with water. Thus, playing with soap suds is different from playing with soap - as soap suds require water and soap does not. For these reasons, while there's similarity between the premise and the hypothesis, we cannot definitively conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true. Thus, the correct answer is B) it is not possible to tell. The child could be a toddler, and they might be in the sink, but based solely on the given premise, those elements are not confirmed."},{"question":"Premise: \\"Menorca gets big-time package holidaymakers, especially from Great Britain, and beaches and roads get awfully crowded in the height of the summer season, but the island seldom feels frenetic.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"Menorca's road system sometimes cannot handle traffic volumes in summer.\\" true?","response":"Yes, based on the premise, the hypothesis \\"Menorca's road system sometimes cannot handle traffic volumes in summer\\" can be true.

Robert Matthew Van Winkle was born in Dallas, Texas, on October 31, 1967. Van Winkle has never known his biological father; he was given the family name of the Dutch man his mother was married to at the time of his birth. When Van Winkle was four, his mother divorced. Afterward, he grew up moving between Dallas and Miami, where his new stepfather worked at a car dealership. After almost non-stop touring for the previous three years, Ice took a break from music in 1993 and began competing in jet skiing (becoming the 6th best jet ski racer in the world and obtaining sponsorship from Kawasaki) as well as resuming Motocross racing. By 1994, Ice received less publicity and became removed from the public spotlight. After becoming more interested with the Rastafari movement, Ice became a vegetarian, grew dreadlocks and talked more openly about smoking cannabis. On March 22, 1994, Ice released his second studio album, Mind Blowin'. Reviews were unfavorable. Entertainment Weekly reviewer James Bernard called the album \\"more clunky than funky\\". Rolling Stone reviewer Danyel Smith praised the song \\"Get Loose\\" as \\"snappy\\", writing that although the lyrics are \\"inane\\", \\"the song is a thumping party, one of the few places where Ice loosens up. He sounds solid at the beginning of 'The Wrath' as well ... In 'Now and Forever,' a wet dream kind of song, Ice goes back to goofy lyrics.\\" Allrovi reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that \\"There isn't a single moment that establishes a distinct musical identity, and the whole thing is rather embarrassing.\\" Primus bassist Les Claypool stated in response to Ice's cannabis-oriented lyrics: \\"That's all fine and dandy and cute, but it could be misconstrued and manipulated by the wrong people.\\" When asked about the drug oriented sound years later, Vanilla Ice said \\"A lot of the record is drug oriented because I was doing a lot of drugs at the time\\". Shortly afterward, SBK went bankrupt. At around this time, Ice began using ecstasy, cocaine and heroin. During periods of heavy drug use, Ice received many tattoos from artist acquaintances. According to Ice, he \\"was in [his] binge days. [He] didn't even realize how many [he] was getting\\". Ice attempted suicide with a heroin overdose on July 4, 1994 but was revived by his friends. After being revived, Ice decided that it was time to change his lifestyle. As a symbol of his attempt to begin anew, he got a tattoo of a leaf on his stomach. After expanding his Mind Blowin tour overseas in 1995, Ice sold his estate in California and took a break from music, rather focusing on motocrossing and jet skiing in Florida. By the summer Ice was the world's No. 6-ranked sit-down Jet Ski racer, competing nearly every weekend and earning a Kawasaki sponsorship. Uncertain about his future career, Ice studied real estate and started working on the side renovating and selling houses. In late 1995, Ice set up a recording studio in Miami and joined a grunge band, Pickin Scabz. The name was set to reflect Ice's career and how he was healing from his suicide attempt and that he was now \\"picking up the pieces\\". Ice expressed an interest in performing hip hop-influenced rock music, but found that the band was unable to produce the sound he was looking for. In 1996, longtime associate and friend Monte Lipman signed Ice as an artist for Universal Republic Records. He did guest vocals with no stage name for the song \\"Boom\\" by Bloodhound Gang on their CD One Fierce Beer Coaster.

Is \\"The hypnotic electronic dance song \\"On and On\\", produced in 1984 by Chicago DJ Jesse Saunders and co-written by Vince Lawrence, had elements that became staples of the early house sound, such as the Roland TB-303 bass synthesizer and minimal vocals as well as a Roland (specifically TR-808) drum machine and Korg (specifically Poly-61) synthesizer.\\" the correct answer?","response":"Yes, the statement provided is correct. \\"On and On\\" is indeed a hypnotic electronic dance song produced in 1984 by Chicago-based DJ Jesse Saunders. Saunders, along with co-writer Vince Lawrence, pioneered the early house sound through the incorporation of a range of innovative musical elements. One of the key features of \\"On and On\\" was the use of the Roland TB-303 bass synthesizer. This instrument, released in 1981, was initially designed to accompany guitarists during practice sessions, but it soon found popularity among electronic musicians for its unique, squelchy \\"acid\\" bass sound. This particular sound would go on to become a defining characteristic of the acid house subgenre, which emerged in the late 1980s. The Roland TR-808 drum machine, another staple of the early house sound, was also used in the song's production. As one of the most influential drum machines ever made, the TR-808 offered a wealth of highly customizable rhythm and percussion options. Its distinctive sounds – particularly its booming, synthesized kick drum – played an integral role in shaping not only house music but also various other electronic and hip-hop genres. Additionally, the Korg Poly-61 synthesizer was employed in the making of \\"On and On.\\" Released in late 1982, the Poly-61 was Korg's first digitally controlled analog synthesizer and enabled musicians to produce complex, layered sounds. Its combination of digital programming and warm analog tones made it a popular choice for artists across genres, further solidifying its place in electronic music history. Lastly, \\"On and On\\" featured minimal, repetitive vocals, which became another hallmark of the early house sound. This stripped-back approach to songwriting allowed for an emphasis on the track's rhythm and groove, ultimately laying the groundwork for countless other producers to follow. In conclusion, Jesse Saunders and Vince Lawrence's 1984 song \\"On and On\\" is a groundbreaking example of early house music. It captures the era's pioneering spirit, showcasing a unique synthesis of innovative sonic components, such as the Roland TB-303 bass synthesizer, Roland TR-808 drum machine, and Korg Poly-61 synthesizer, in addition to minimal vocals, which went on to define the genre for years to come."},{"question":"Translate to Turkish: Still, Selimi says, there should be no doubt as to the eventual goal -- to create the military force of a sovereign country. \\"Even though Kosovo's army will be called the 'Kosovo Security Force', it will [nevertheless] be the army of Kosovo,\\" he said.","response":"Öncelikle, İngilizce metni Türkçe'ye çevirmek için her kelimeyi ve ifadeyi anlayarak Türkçe karşılıklarını bulmalıyım.

The Hamburg group shared the anti-U.S. fervor of the other candidates for the operation, but added the enormous advantages of fluency in English and familiarity with life in the West, based on years that each member of the group had spent living in Germany. Not surprisingly, Mohamed Atta, Ramzi Binalshibh, Marwan al Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah would all become key players in the 9/11 conspiracy. Mohamed Atta was born on September 1, 1968, in Kafr el Sheikh, Egypt, to a middle-class family headed by his father, an attorney. After graduating from Cairo University with a degree in architectural engineering in 1990, Atta worked as an urban planner in Cairo for a couple of years. In the fall of 1991, he asked a German family he had met in Cairo to help him continue his education in Germany. They suggested he come to Hamburg and invited him to live with them there, at least initially. After completing a course in German, Atta traveled to Germany for the first time in July 1992. He resided briefly in Stuttgart and then, in the fall of 1992, moved to Hamburg to live with his host family. After enrolling at the University of Hamburg, he promptly transferred into the city engineering and planning course at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg, where he would remain registered as a student until the fall of 1999. He appears to have applied himself fairly seriously to his studies (at least in comparison to his jihadist friends) and actually received his degree shortly before traveling to Afghanistan. In school, Atta came across as very intelligent and reasonably pleasant, with an excellent command of the German language. When Atta arrived in Germany, he appeared religious, but not fanatically so. This would change, especially as his tendency to assert leadership became increasingly pronounced. According to Binalshibh, as early as 1995 Atta sought to organize a Muslim student association in Hamburg. In the fall of 1997, he joined a working group at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, a group designed to bridge the gap between Muslims and Christians. Atta proved a poor bridge, however, because of his abrasive and increasingly dogmatic personality. But among those who shared his beliefs, Atta stood out as a decisionmaker. After reading the above, is \\"Quds mosque\\" the correct answer to the question \\"What group did Atta join that failed at trying to bring together two religions?\\"?","response":"Yes, based on the information provided, \\"Quds mosque\\" is the correct answer to the question \\"What group did Atta join that failed at trying to bring together two religions?\\" Atta joined a working group at the Quds mosque in Hamburg in the fall of 1997, which aimed to bridge the gap between Muslims and Christians. However, his abrasive and increasingly dogmatic personality made him a poor bridge, and the group's attempt to bring together the two religions failed."},{"question":"People celebrate by going places and riding rides.

A new study has revealed a 49 per cent increase in risk among people consuming a diet with a high glycemic index. The index measures how quickly blood sugar levels are raised after a meal, and foods with a high GI include white bread or bagels, corn flakes and puffed rice. However, diets high in fruits and vegetables were found to decrease the risk. Lead study author Dr Stephanie Melkonian, of University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, said: \\"We observed a 49 per cent increased risk of lung cancer among subjects with the highest daily GI compared to those with the lowest daily GI. • Breath test that tells you if you have lung cancer \\"Diets high in glycemic index result in higher levels of blood glucose and insulin, which promote perturbations in the insulin-like growth factors (IGFs). \\"Previous research suggests increased levels of IGFs are associated with increased lung cancer risk. \\"However, the association between glycemic index and lung cancer risk was unclear.\\" In the UK, there are around 45,525 new cases of the disease diagnosed each year, while 35,371 people lose their life to the disease annually, according to Cancer Research UK.

Five cancer red flags to never ignore The study, published in the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention, is the largest ever to investigate the potential link between glycemic index and lung cancer. Scientists surveyed 1,905 patients newly diagnosed with lung cancer and compared the results with 2,413 healthy individuals. Senior study author Dr Xifeng Wu said: \\"The associations were more pronounced among subjects who were never smokers, diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma or had less than 12 years of education. \\"This suggests that it is the average quality, instead of quantity, of carbohydrates consumed that may modulate lung cancer risk.\\" Photo: Alamy Dr Wu added: \\"The results from this study suggest that, besides maintaining healthy lifestyles, such as avoiding tobacco, limiting alcohol consumption and being physically active, reducing the consumption of foods and beverages with high glycemic index may serve as a means to lower the risk of lung cancer.\\" • Lung cancer victims lack sympathy ||||| Scientists from the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center have found that people who eat a diet full of high glycemic index foods—think processed white bread, bagels, white rice, baguettes—had a 49% higher risk of developing lung cancer, even if they’ve never smoked a single cigarette. The study, which was published in Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention this week, is the largest ever to investigate the potential links between glycemic index and lung cancer, according to the authors. A glycemic index is a measurement of how rapidly carbohydrates elevate blood sugar levels in the body. The higher the glycemic index, the more rapidly blood sugar levels rise after a meal which results in elevated levels of blood glucose and insulin. That in turns raises what’s called insulin-like growth factors, which are linked to an increased lung cancer risk, according to the scientists. Scientists at MD Anderson surveyed 1,905 patients newly diagnosed with lung cancer and another 2,413 healthy individuals, all non-Hispanic whites. Those subjects reported their past dietary habits and health histories, and they were then divided into groups based on their associated glycemic index and glycemic load, a measure of carbohydrate quantity. “We observed a 49% increased risk of lung cancer among subjects with the highest daily glycemic index compared to those with the lowest daily glycemic index,” said Xifeng Wu, professor of epidemiology and senior author of the study. “The associates were more pronounced among subjects who were never smokers.” Interestingly, there was no link between the glycemic load—i.e. the quantity of carbohydrates consumed—and lung cancer, which suggests that it’s the quality, not the amount of carbohydrates, that has the biggest effect on lung cancer risk, said Wu. Lung cancer is the second most common cancer among both men and women in the U.S. It’s also the leading cause of cancer mortality, with over 150,000 deaths from lung cancer expected in the U.S. this year alone, according to the American Cancer Society. Smoking and tobacco use is still the leading cause, though it doesn’t account for all cases. Researchers had long suspected a link between a high-glycemic index diet and lung cancer risk, but the link between the two was unclear until now. Among non-smokers in the study, those within the highest glycemic index group were more than twice as likely to develop lung cancer as those in the lowest group. For smokers, the difference was elevated by 31% between the two groups. “The results from this study suggest that, besides maintaining healthy lifestyles, such as avoiding tobacco, limiting alcohol consumption, and being physically active, reducing the consumption of foods and beverages with high glycemic index may serve as a means to lower the risk of lung cancer,” said Wu. Low glycemic index foods include things like 100% stone-ground whole wheat bread, rolled or steel-cut oatmeal, most fruits, and non-starchy vegetables. ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE People who eat a sugary, starchy diet may be raising their risk of lung cancer, even if they don’t smoke, researchers say. They found that people who recall eating more foods that have a high glycemic index also were more likely to develop lung cancer. Glycemic index is a term that’s familiar to people with diabetes. It describes food that raises blood sugar and stimulates production of insulin — think bagels, white rice and some fruits such as melon and pineapple. It’s not the first study to link glycemic index with cancer risk, but it’s rare to link it with lung cancer. That may be mostly because lung cancer is so overwhelmingly caused by smoking. The team at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston studied 1,905 people who had just been diagnosed with lung cancer and compared them to 2,415 people without cancer. They quizzed them about their eating habits, smoking, income and other factors. \\"Reducing the consumption of foods and beverages with high glycemic index may serve as a means to lower the risk of lung cancer.\\" People who ate the most foods with a high glycemic index were about 50 percent more likely to be in the lung cancer group than people who reported they ate the fewest high-glycemic foods, the team reported in the journal Cancer Epidemiology and Biomarkers. The link was stronger among people who never smoked; non-smokers were more than twice as likely to have lung cancer if they reported eating a high-glycemic diet. “The results from this study suggest that, besides maintaining healthy lifestyles, reducing the consumption of foods and beverages with high glycemic index may serve as a means to lower the risk of lung cancer,” said Dr. Xifeng Wu, who led the study. Related: Here's how sugar might fuel the growth of cancer How can this happen? Doctors aren’t sure, but there’s a theory that high-glycemic foods stimulate the body to make insulin, which in turn affects the growth of cells via compounds called insulin-like growth factors or IGF. Cancer is the uncontrolled proliferation of cells, so it might be that the high-glycemic foods are fueling the growth of tiny tumors. “IGFs have been shown to play a critical role in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation in cancer and there is evidence to suggest that IGFs are elevated in lung cancer patients,” Wu’s team wrote. It’s a suspect in several types of cancer. “Previous studies have investigated the association between glycemic index, and the related measure glycemic load, and a variety of cancers including colorectal, stomach, pancreas, endometrial, ovarian, prostate, and thyroid but these studies are limited and results have been largely inconclusive,” the researchers wrote. This study is not conclusive, either. For one thing, the researchers asked their volunteers to remember what they ate. For another, it’s an association. People who eat high-glycemic foods may also do something else that also raises their risk of cancer. And this particular study focused only on non-Hispanic white people. Marji McCullough, an expert in nutritional epidemiology at the American Cancer Society, says it will be important to look at people who don't have cancer now and watch what they eat for years or decades, and see who develops cancer. Related: Cancer experts are mad about the dietary guidelines Lung cancer is the No. 1 cancer killer in the U.S., killing more than 150,000 people a year. It causes only vague symptoms at first, so when most people are diagnosed, the cancer has already spread and is then far more likely to be fatal. Experts know diet and lifestyle can affect cancer. Obesity, lack of exercise, eating red meat and lots of high-fat dairy foods, and eating too few fruits and vegetables can all raise a person’s odds of developing cancer. This study adds to a growing body of evidence that people can lower their cancer risk not only by staying away from tobacco and exercising more, but by choosing a healthier diet. \\"Aside from not smoking, it’s important to follow cancer prevention guidelines that maintain healthy body weight, physical activity, and eating an overall healthy diet rich in vegetables and plant food and lower red and processed meat. Choose foods that help maintain healthy body weight,\\" McCullough said. According to the American Diabetes Association, low-glycemic foods include: 100 percent stone-ground whole wheat or pumpernickel bread Oatmeal (rolled or steel-cut), oat bran, muesli Pasta, converted rice, barley, bulgar Sweet potato, corn, yam, lima/butter beans, peas, legumes and lentils Most fruits, non-starchy vegetables and carrots Medium glycemic index foods include: Whole wheat, rye and pita bread Quick oats Brown, wild or basmati rice, couscous High glycemic index foods include: ||||| Abstract Background: Postprandial glucose (PPG) and insulin responses play a role in carcinogenesis. We evaluated the association between dietary glycemic index (GI) and glycemic load (GL), markers of carbohydrate intake and PPG, and lung cancer risk in non-Hispanic whites. Methods: GL and GI were assessed among 1,905 newly diagnosed lung cancer cases recruited from the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX) and 2,413 healthy controls recruited at Kelsey-Seybold Clinics (Houston, TX). We assessed associations between quintiles of GI/GL and lung cancer risk and effect modification by various risk factors. ORs and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using multivariable logistic regression. Results: We observed a significant association between GI [5th vs. 1st quintile (Q) OR = 1.49; 95% CI, 1.21–1.83; P trend <0.001] and lung cancer risk and GI ac (5th vs. 1st Q OR = 1.48; 95% CI, 1.20–1.81; P trend = 0.001) and lung cancer risk. We observed a more pronounced association between GI and lung cancer risk among never smokers (5th vs. 1st Q OR = 2.25; 95% CI, 1.42–3.57), squamous cell carcinomas (SCC; 5th vs. 1st Q OR = 1.92; 95% CI, 1.30–2.83), and those with less than 12 years of education (5th vs. 1st Q OR = 1.75; 95% CI, 1.19–2.58, P interaction = 0.02). Conclusion: This study suggests that dietary GI and other lung cancer risk factors may jointly and independently influence lung cancer etiology. Impact: Understanding the role of GI in lung cancer could inform prevention strategies and elucidate biologic pathways related to lung cancer risk.

The men and women sang separately on consecutive nights, and the bottom two in each groups were eliminated each week until only six of each remained to form the top twelve. How many men were in the top twelve on season five of American Idol?","response":"To find out how many men were in the top twelve on season five of American Idol, we can follow these steps: 1. Analyze the given information: In seasons four to seven and nine, twenty-four semi-finalists were divided equally by gender, with an equal gender division in the top twelve. 2. Since season five is within seasons four to seven and nine, it would also have an equal gender division in the top twelve. 3. Divide the top twelve contestants into two equal groups, one group for men and one group for women. 4. Since the groups are equal, there would be equal numbers of men and women in the top twelve. Top twelve contestants = 12 Equal division of contestants = men + women -number of men = number of women 5. Calculate the number of men in the top twelve by dividing the total number of top contestants by 2.

Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","response":"Answer to Question 1: For a natural gas line, the type of copper pipe typically used is the Type K or Type L. Both these copper pipes possess properties that make them suitable for use in gas lines. Type K copper pipes, also known as heavy-wall copper pipes, have the thickest walls and provide great strength and durability, making them ideal for heavy-duty purposes. These pipes are available in several sizes and can be joined through various means, including soldering, brazing, compression connections, and flared connections. Type L copper pipes have a medium level of thickness, making them appropriate for above-ground applications within indoor settings. They are also considered to be suitable for gas lines, although they are somewhat less durable than Type K pipes. As with Type K pipes, Type L pipes can be assembled using soldering, brazing, compression connections, or flared connections. Answer to Question 2: For a gas line, which may refer to either natural gas or propane gas lines, the recommended types of copper pipes are still Type K and Type L due to their physical properties and durability. Both types have appropriate wall thickness and corrosion resistance for gas line applications. It's essential to verify local building codes and regulations before selecting copper pipes, as some jurisdictions may have specific pipe requirements for specific gas types. Regarding whether questions 1 and 2 are asking the same thing: Yes, questions 1 and 2 are essentially asking the same thing, which type of copper pipe is needed for a gas line. Question 1 specifies \\"natural gas line,\\" while question 2 simply mentions \\"gas line.\\" Nonetheless, both natural gas and propane gas lines generally require the same type of copper pipes, which are Type K and Type L, as mentioned earlier. It is crucial to note, however, that local building codes and regulations should always be followed when deciding on the right type of pipe for any gas line installation."},{"question":"SACRAMENTO (AP) _ The winning numbers in Wednesday evening”s drawing of the California Lottery”s “Daily 3 Evening” game were: 6-4-0 (six, four, zero) ¶ Ticket-holders with all three winning numbers in the order given win the top prize.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: Choices: - fibers - ions - seeds - spores A: Answer:","response":"Meiosis in the sporophyte produces haploid cells called spores. In the context of the life cycle of plants and some algae, meiosis is a crucial process that occurs in the sporophyte generation, which is the diploid (2n) phase of the life cycle. During meiosis, the chromosome number is reduced by half, ultimately resulting in the production of haploid (1n) cells. These haploid cells are called spores. The process of meiosis has major implications for the genetic diversity within populations, as it involves the exchange of genetic material and the production of new combinations of alleles. As the sporophyte undergoes meiosis, the resulting spores inherit a unique set of genetic material, ensuring that the offspring - or gametophyte generation - will display a wide array of genetic variation. Spores, as opposed to other options like fibers, ions, or seeds, are reproductive units capable of developing into a new organism, specifically into gametophytes, without the need for fusion with another reproductive cell. Spores are formed in structures called sporangia that are found in the sporophyte generation of plants and some algae. Furthermore, they have protective walls that help them withstand harsh environmental conditions, enabling them to be dispersed to new habitats and colonize various environments. In conclusion, the sporophyte generation undergoes meiosis to produce haploid cells termed spores, which play a significant role in the life cycle of plants and some algae. Spores are not only responsible for increasing genetic diversity but also serve as agents of dispersal and successful colonization of new environments."},{"question":"Background: Stephen Russell Davies was born on 27 April 1963 at Mount Pleasant Hospital in Swansea. His father, Vivian Davies (1925-2015), and his mother, Barbara (1929-1999), were teachers. Davies was the youngest of three children and their only son. Because he was born by C-section, his mother was placed on a morphine drip and was institutionalised after an overdose resulted in a psychotic episode. Context: During his production tenure on Children's Ward, Davies continued to seek other freelance writing jobs, particularly for soap operas; his intention was to eventually work on the popular and long-running Granada soap Coronation Street. In pursuit of this career plan, he storylined soaps such as Families and wrote scripts for shows such as Cluedo, a game show based on the board game of the same name, and Do the Right Thing, a localised version of the Brazilian panel show Voce Decide with Terry Wogan as presenter and Frank Skinner as a regular panellist. One writing job, for The House of Windsor, a soap opera about footmen in Buckingham Palace, was so poorly received that his other scripts for the show would be written under the pseudonym Leo Vaughn. In 1994, Davies quit all of his producing jobs, and was offered a scriptwriting role on the late-night soap opera Revelations, created by him, Tony Wood, and Brian B. Thompson. The series was a tongue-in-cheek deconstruction of organised religion, and featured his first overtly homosexual character: a lesbian vicar portrayed by Sue Holderness, who came out of the closet in a two-hander episode with Carole Nimmons. Davies attributes the revelation about Holderness's character as a consequence of both the \\"pressure cooker nature\\" of the show and the recent ordination of female vicars in the Church of England. He let his contract with Granada expire and pitched a new early-evening soap opera to Channel 4, RU, with its creator Bill Moffat, Sandra Hastie, a producer on Moffat's previous series Press Gang, and co-writer Paul Cornell. Although the slot was eventually taken by Hollyoaks, he and Cornell mutually benefited from the pitch: Davies introduced Cornell to the Children's Ward producers and established contact with Moffat's son Steven, and Cornell introduced Davies to Virgin Publishing. Davies wrote one Doctor Who Virgin New Adventures novel, Damaged Goods, in which the Doctor tracks a Class A drug tainted by Time Lord technology across several galaxies. The book includes several themes that Davies would intersperse in his later works--including a family called \\"Tyler\\" and companion Chris Cwej participating in casual homosexual sex-- and a subplot formed the inspiration for The Mother War, a proposed but never produced thriller for Granada about a woman, Eva Jericho, and a calcified foetus in her uterus. Davies continued to propose dramas to Channel 4, including Springhill, an apocalyptic soap-opera, co-created by Frank Cottrell Boyce and Paul Abbott, which aired simultaneously on Sky One and Channel 4 in 1996-1997. Set in suburban Liverpool, the series focuses on the devoutly Catholic Freeman family and their encounter and conflict with Eva Morrigan (Katharine Rogers). He storylined for the second series, but submitted fewer scripts; Granada had commissioned him to write for their soap The Grand, temporarily storyline for Coronation Street, and write the straight-to-video special, Coronation Street: Viva Las Vegas!. The second series of Springhill continued his penchant for symbolism; in particular, it depicted Marion Freeman (Judy Holt) and Eva as personifications of good and evil, and climaxed with a finale set in an ultra-liberal dystopian future where premarital sex and homosexuality are embraced by the Church. Boyce later commented that without Davies' input, the show would have been a \\"dry run\\" for Abbott's hit show Shameless. Question: any other show Answer:","response":"Yes, besides the shows already mentioned, Stephen Russell Davies, also known as Russell T Davies, has worked on many other TV shows. One of the most popular shows he worked on is called Doctor Who. Doctor Who is a fun and exciting science-fiction show about a time-traveling alien called The Doctor who saves planets and helps people using a special spaceship called the TARDIS. Russell T Davies was a writer and producer for Doctor Who from 2005 to 2010, bringing the show back to life after it had been off the air for many years. He also created a show called Torchwood, which is like a more grown-up version of Doctor Who. Torchwood is about a group of people who work together to protect Earth from strange and scary aliens. Some other shows Russell T Davies worked on include Queer as Folk, a drama about the lives of three young friends who are part of the LGBTQ+ community, and Years and Years, a show that tells the story of a family living through many changes in the world from 2019 to 2034."},{"question":"What is the solution to this math problem? Solve 2*i = 5*i + 9 for i.","response":"Okay, little buddy! Let's solve this math problem step by step. We have the equation: 2 * i = 5 * i + 9 Let's think about this: on the left side, we have \\"2 times i\\" and on the right side, we have \\"5 times i\\" plus 9. Now, we want to find out what \\"i\\" is. Let's start by moving the \\"2 times i\\" from the left side to the right side. When we move something over, it changes its sign. So, \\"2 times i\\" becomes \\"-2 times i\\". Now our equation looks like this: 5 * i - 2 * i = 9 Next, let's combine \\"5 times i\\" and \\"-2 times i\\". That gives us: 3 * i = 9 We're almost there! Now, we need to figure out what i is. We have \\"3 times i\\" equals 9, so to find \\"i\\", we need to divide both sides by 3: i = 3 And there you have it! The solution is i=3.

Linebackers are members of the defensive team, and line up approximately three to five yards (4 m) behind the line of scrimmage, behind the defensive linemen, and therefore \\"back up the line.\\" Linebackers generally align themselves before the ball is snapped by standing upright in a \\"two point stance\\" (as opposed to the defensive linemen, who put one or two hands on the ground for a \\"three point stance\\" or \\"four point stance\\" before the ball is snapped). - In American and Canadian football, a line of scrimmage is an imaginary transverse line (across the width of the football field) beyond which a team cannot cross until the next play has begun. Its location is based on the spot where the ball is placed after the end of the most recent play and following the assessment of any penalty yards. - A university (\\"a whole\\", \\"a corporation\\") is an institution of higher (or tertiary) education and research which grants academic degrees in various subjects.

Even after the emergence of the professional National Football League (NFL), college football remained extremely popular throughout the U.S. Although the college game has a much larger margin for talent than its pro counterpart, the sheer number of fans following major colleges provides a financial equalizer for the game, with Division I programs the highest level playing in huge stadiums, six of which have seating capacity exceeding 100,000. In many cases, college stadiums employ bench-style seating, as opposed to individual seats with backs and arm rests. This allows them to seat more fans in a given amount of space than the typical professional stadium, which tends to have more features and comforts for fans. (Only two stadiums owned by U.S. colleges or universities Papa John's Cardinal Stadium at the University of Louisville and FAU Stadium at Florida Atlantic University consist entirely of chairback seating.) - Ronald McKinnon ( born September 20 , 1973 ) is a former American football linebacker in the National Football League .

Christmas Day is a public holiday in many of the world's nations, is celebrated religiously by the vast majority of Christians, as well as culturally by a number of non-Christian people, and is an integral part of the holiday season, while some Christian groups reject the celebration. In several countries, celebrating Christmas Eve on December 24 has the main focus rather than December 25, with gift-giving and sharing a traditional meal with the family. - A touchdown is a means of scoring in both American and Canadian football.

It was owned locally by Walter Stiles ' Albert M. Cadwell . It was locally owned by Walter Stiles & Albert M. Cadwell .","response":"While both sentences convey the idea of local ownership and mention the same individuals, Walter Stiles and Albert M. Cadwell, they are not exactly the same in phrasing or punctuation. Here's a detailed breakdown of each sentence and their differences: 1. \\"It was owned locally by Walter Stiles ' Albert M. Cadwell.\\" This sentence suggests that the ownership was local and involved Walter Stiles and Albert M. Cadwell. However, the use of an apostrophe (') before Albert M. Cadwell's name is incorrect and seems out of place. It could be a typographical error or an attempt to indicate a possessive relationship, but it is not clear in this context. A more appropriate conjunction, such as \\"and,\\" should be used. 2. \\"It was locally owned by Walter Stiles & Albert M. Cadwell.\\" This sentence also implies that the ownership was local and connected to Walter Stiles and Albert M. Cadwell. The use of the ampersand (&) here is a more appropriate way to represent the conjunction between the two individuals. It clearly denotes that both parties are involved in the ownership of the object or property in question. Although both sentences are intended to convey the same idea, the second sentence is more grammatically correct and would be the preferred choice for accurate communication. The confusion arising from the use of the apostrophe in the first sentence can be resolved by opting for more appropriate punctuation or conjunctions. Here is a revised version of the first sentence which better matches the meaning of the second: 1a. \\"It was owned locally by Walter Stiles and Albert M. Cadwell.\\" This revised sentence is now similar in meaning to the second sentence and correctly denotes the local ownership by both Walter Stiles and Albert M. Cadwell."},{"question":"Article:Emma Rice became the venue's artistic director last January, only to announce her departure nine months later after a series of disputes with the board. Now, actress Michelle Terry is taking the reins. Speaking from the stage at the Globe theatre, she spoke about Rice's tenure, gender-blind casting and her own lack of theatre directing experience. Here are six things she told us about her vision for the venue. When Terry was appointed, some critics pointed out that she had zero directing experience. But it turns out that this isn't going to be a problem. \\"I'm not going to direct [any plays], so nobody needs to worry about that,\\" she says. \\"I think it's a skill that I don't have, I think it's a particular skill, and my passion is acting.\\" So much so, that Terry plans to take to the stage herself pretty soon. \\"Being part of an ensemble is part of my first season's plans, and it's really important to me that I am part of that ensemble. \\"I think for me that's what creates the best Shakespeare, collaboration in this space with the artists, with the audience, that's where you get the meaning making, that you're in a collective imaginative space.\\" Forthcoming productions at the Globe will have equal roles for men and women. \\"The whole season will be 50/50, and that's not just small parts played by women or men,\\" Terry says. \\"Across the season, the body of work will have equal amounts for male, female, it will be gender blind, race blind, disability blind. \\"I have benefitted from that being a possibility. When I played Henry V [last summer], we had Brexit, the Chilcot inquiry, Theresa May as prime minister - these are all things that serve that play, and me being a woman was the last thing on people's minds. So I know it works. \\"And also, Shakespeare didn't worry about gender - he had men playing women - so I don't know why we have to worry about it.\\" Have the outgoing and incoming directors had any contact? \\"We've met. I met her as part of the application process, we've had cups of tea,\\" Terry says. \\"Most people that work in theatre are freelancers, nobody is part of the building, we all sort of move on. So it really is a community venture, so there's never any... people will talk about there being competition but for me it's a collaborative process.\\" She adds: \\"You know Emma's work, if you've seen Kneehigh [the theatre in Cornwall that Rice was the artistic director of] you know what she does. \\"So part of that was going, 'Does that work in here?' And the decision was made, in whatever way that came about, 'No', and now I am part of the new experiment, and I hope I last,\\" she says, joking: \\"I'll see you at Christmas.\\" One of Rice's most controversial decisions was to use artificial lights and sound amplification. But purists preferred the traditional unplugged nature of the venue, and Terry confirmed that the decision to use no more amplified sound was made before she got the job. \\"The decision has already been made - there will be no amplified sound, no imposed lighting rig, and for me that's what I knew,\\" she says. \\"I haven't worked here under Emma's tenure, so what I know is this space as a raw naked space, and I suppose for me it's less about what was added on, but what was missed when you have that. \\"What you want to do is reach out and touch the hands of those people. I think it's that direct connection with the audience.\\" Terry has a clear idea about how to get children enthused about Shakespeare from a young age. \\"By experiencing it,\\" she says simply. \\"It's so experiential here... no kid in Shakespeare's time would've been made to sit down and read. They're plays. \\"They make much more sense when you're on your feet reading them, interacting, and it's the same for the audience. So the more opportunity we can give to kids to experience that, the better. \\"And also, teachers were taught badly, so they're frightened of teaching it. So enabling teachers to experience it and giving them a different offering about what they could do with kids in the classroom [is important].\\" We'd all be pretty happy to land our dream job without even having to download the application form - but it seems Michelle's appointment kind of happened by accident. \\"Weirdly, I didn't apply for this job,\\" she says. Terry recalls the time when the job was advertised and conversations were being had across the theatre world about the Globe's future. \\"Everyone that works here in my experience has wanted to come back. So there are a lot of people, me included, [who were] saying, 'I would love to be part of the artistic conversation'. \\"So I wrote a letter to Neil [Constable, Globe chief executive] sort of pledging my allegiance, going 'I'd love to be part of that artistic conversation', and he wrote back asking if I'd like to convert it into a formal application, and at that point I thought, yes I would.\\" That idea turned out quite well. \\"Every artistic adventure involves risk,\\" she says as she looks to the future of the venue. \\"I take great courage in the fact they've taken an enormous risk by putting an actor in this position. I think that smacks of bravery, and it gives me great hope.\\" Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? Pick from: a). no. b). yes.","response":"While there is no absolute answer to whether the US elections will be rigged, one can analyze it from different perspectives to gain a better understanding of the potential for rigging and the likelihood of it occurring. Whether or not the winners are planned in advance is a separate question that requires a distinct analysis. Therefore, I would choose answer option a). No, these questions are not the same. Concerning the potential rigging of an election, the United States has several measures in place to ensure the legitimacy of their electoral processes, which involve multiple audits, verifications, and safeguards. Election authorities at the federal, state, and local levels work diligently to maintain fair and transparent elections. For example, most voting systems used in the US produce a paper record or a voter-verified paper audit trail (VVPAT) to ensure that the results can be double-checked independently in case of disputes or suspected fraud. Additionally, numerous polls are run by independent organizations, providing an indirect yet considerable check on the electoral process. However, no system is entirely foolproof, and the potential for fraud or manipulation does exist. Misdeeds can arise from various possibilities, such as voter suppression, gerrymandering, or even outright hacking of the electronic voting systems. Nonetheless, most of these fraudulent activities would require coordination on a massive scale, making it extremely difficult to accomplish successfully, especially without detection. The idea of pre-determined winners relates to the concept of conspiracy theories, in which powerful and unknown entities manipulate the election process to ensure a particular candidate's victory. While election fraud has occurred in the past, claiming that the winners are planned in advance would need substantial and credible evidence to support such an assertion. Moreover, the democratic nature of the US political system, along with its tight checks and balances, makes it highly unlikely that any shadowy organization would be capable of deciding the winners without being exposed eventually. In conclusion, while the risk of election rigging and predetermined winners cannot be deemed entirely non-existent, the numerous safeguards and transparent processes in place at multiple levels of the US electoral system mitigate these risks significantly. The questions mentioned above are different in nature, as one addresses the potential for electoral manipulation, while the other delves into the realm of conspiracy theories."},{"question":"Culture and Sports: Macedonian journalists, photographers receive UN awards Translate to Turkish","response":"Kültür ve Sporlar: Makedonyalı gazeteciler, fotoğrafçılar Birleşmiş Milletler ödülleri alıyor Makedonyalı gazeteciler ve fotoğrafçılar, dünya genelinde çeşitli konuları işleyen haber ve fotoğraf işlerine yaptıkları olağanüstü katkılarından dolayı Birleşmiş Milletler ödülleri almaya layık görüldüler.

Being above the earth gives a whole new perspective on the world around us. As the beginning of a hot air balloon ride, the balloon is flat because the pressure inside the balloon equals the pressure outside.

Thảo was told by Khiêm, his superior, to locate Diệm and prevent him from being killed. When Thảo arrived at Ma Tuyen's house, he phoned his superiors. Diệm and Nhu overheard him and Thơ drove them to the nearby Catholic church of St. Francis Xavier, which they had frequented over the years. Lieutenant Thơ died a few months later in a plane crash, but his diary was not found until 1970. Thơ recorded Diệm's words as they left the house of Ma Tuyen as being \\"I don't know whether I will live or die and I don't care, but tell Nguyễn Khánh that I have great affection for him and he should avenge me\\". Soon after the early morning mass was celebrated for All Souls' Day (the Catholic day of the dead) and after the congregation had left the building, the Ngô brothers walked through the shady courtyard and into the church wearing dark grey suits. It was speculated that they were recognised by an informant as they walked through the yard. Inside the church, the brothers prayed and received Communion.A few minutes later, just after 10:00, an armoured personnel carrier and two jeeps entered the narrow alcove housing the church building.

More delegates to the presidential nominating conventions can be won on Super Tuesday than on any other single day of the primary calendar. Since Super Tuesday primaries and caucuses are typically held in a large number of states from geographically and socially diverse regions of the country, it typically represents a presidential candidate's first test of national electability. Thus, candidates seeking the presidency traditionally must do well on this day to help secure their party's nomination. In fact, convincing wins in Super Tuesday primaries have usually propelled candidates to their party's nomination. Super Tuesday is in either February or March of the presidential election year. During the 2016 election year, Super Tuesday was held on March 1. - The Potomac primary (named after the river that splits the region), also called Chesapeake Tuesday, the Beltway primary, and the Crabcake primary, is the confluence of three Democratic presidential primaries and three Republican presidential primaries that takes place after Super Tuesday. - The 2008 Virginia Republican primary took place on February 12 , 2008 .

It is a phenomenon characterized primarily by members of most arachnid orders, as well as several insect orders. The adaptive foraging hypothesis, aggressive spillover hypothesis and mistaken identity hypothesis are among the proposed theories to explain how sexual cannibalism evolved. This behavior is believed to have evolved as a manifestation of sexual conflict, occurring when the reproductive interests of males and females differ. In many species that exhibit sexual cannibalism, the female consumes the male upon detection. Females of cannibalistic species are generally hostile and unwilling to mate; thus many males of these species have developed adaptive behaviors to counteract female aggression. - The Western United States, commonly referred to as the American West, the Far West, or simply the West, traditionally refers to the region comprising the westernmost states of the United States.

Between 255-246 BCE, the governor of Bactria, Sogdiana and Margiana (most of present-day Afghanistan), one Diodotus, took this process to its logical extreme and declared himself king. Diodotus II, son of Diodotus, was overthrown in about 230 BC by Euthydemus, possibly the satrap of Sogdiana, who then started his own dynasty. In c. 210 BC, the Greco-Bactrian kingdom was invaded by a resurgent Seleucid empire under Antiochus III. While victorious in the field, it seems Antiochus came to realise that there were advantages in the status quo (perhaps sensing that Bactria could not be governed from Syria), and married one of his daughters to Euthydemus's son, thus legitimising the Greco-Bactria dynasty. Soon afterwards the Greco-Bactrian kingdom seems to have expanded, possibly taking advantage of the defeat of the Parthian king Arsaces II by Antiochus.\\", answer the following question.

The oldest brother looked through his telescope and saw a palace in the distance. A princess was lying in bed sick. The second opened his carpet and said. \\"Let's ride this carpet and go to the palace.\\" The three brothers went to the palace on the flying carpet to save the sick princess. The three brothers met the king and told him why they had come. The king said. \\"If you cure the princess, I will let one of you marry the princess.\\" The youngest brother gave the princess the apple he found.

Monteux believed that the trouble began when the two factions began attacking each other, but their mutual anger was soon diverted towards the orchestra: \\"Everything available was tossed in our direction, but we continued to play on\\". Around forty of the worst offenders were ejected—possibly with the intervention of the police, although this is uncorroborated. Through all the disturbances the performance continued without interruption. The unrest receded significantly during Part II, and by some accounts Maria Piltz's rendering of the final \\"Sacrificial Dance\\" was watched in reasonable silence. At the end there were several curtain calls for the dancers, for Monteux and the orchestra, and for Stravinsky and Nijinsky before the evening's programme continued.Among the more hostile press reviews was that of Le Figaro's critic, Henri Quittard, who called the work \\"a laborious and puerile barbarity\\" and added \\"We are sorry to see an artist such as M. Stravinsky involve himself in this disconcerting adventure\\". On the other hand, Gustav Linor, writing in the leading theatrical magazine Comoedia, thought the performance was superb, especially that of Maria Piltz; the disturbances, while deplorable, were merely \\"a rowdy debate\\" between two ill-mannered factions. Emile Raudin, of Les Marges, who had barely heard the music, wrote: \\"Couldn't we ask M. Astruc ... to set aside one performance for well-intentioned spectators? ... We could at least propose to evict the female element\\". The composer Alfredo Casella thought that the demonstrations were aimed at Nijinsky's choreography rather than at the music, a view shared by the critic Michel-Dimitri Calvocoressi, who..., can you guess it ? Answer:","response":"The question is asking for the first initial of the person who didn't believe the story that Cocteau gave about the group taking a cab. After reading the passage, we can see that the person whose opinion we need to find isn't mentioned explicitly. However, we can make an educated guess based on the information provided in the article. The article mentions multiple people providing their reviews and opinions on the performance: 1. Henri Quittard 2. Gustav Linor 3. Emile Raudin 4. Alfredo Casella 5. Michel-Dimitri Calvocoressi Out of these, the person likely to not believe Cocteau's story about the group taking a cab would be the one who had a different perspective on the situation and offered an alternative narrative on the events. Gustav Linor's opinion seems the most divergent from Cocteau's assertion, as he described the disturbances as \\"a rowdy debate\\" between two ill-mannered factions. This makes Gustav Linor a plausible candidate for the person who didn't believe Cocteau's story. So, the answer is G (the first initial of Gustav Linor)."},{"question":"Compose the next sentence for this paragraph.

After graduating in mass communication from the University of Sydney and working as a television reporter in Sri Lanka, she joined the modeling industry. She was crowned the Miss Sri Lanka Universe 2006, and represented her country at Miss Universe 2006. Fernandez shares a close bond with her family, and admits that she misses being around them. She says: \\"I miss them so much everyday. You don't realise when you live away from home how difficult life can be [...] At the same time, staying away from them has taught me to be more responsible. It has taught me so many things about myself, about priorities and time management.\\" In March 2012, Fernandez turned vegetarian for a 40-day period to observe Lent, a period from Ash Wednesday to Holy Saturday. In 2008, Fernandez started dating Bahraini prince Hassan bin Rashid Al Khalifa, whom she met at a mutual friend's party; they separated in 2011. While filming Housefull 2 in 2011, Fernandez began a romantic relationship with director Sajid Khan. The relationship attracted media coverage in India and there was speculation of an impending wedding. However, the relationship ended in May 2013. In addition to acting in films, Fernandez has supported charitable organisations and a number of causes. In 2011, on the behalf of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), she sent a letter to the Mumbai Municipal Commissioner asking for an end to horse-drawn carriage rides in Mumbai. In early 2013, she asked the consulate general of the Philippines, William John T Perera in Colombo, to hasten the transfer of an elephant from its inadequate housing at the Manila Zoo to a humane sanctuary. Later that year, she auctioned a breakfast in Mayfair, London, where she raised around PS4000 for the Pratham NGO, which helps children's primary education. In 2014, Fernandez was named \\"Woman Of The Year\\" by PETA (India) for advocating the protection of animals. The following year, she auctioned her outfits on an online portal for a philanthropic cause. Some of her outfits included the ones she wore in the song \\"Party On My Mind\\" (from Race 2) and \\"Hangover\\" (from Kick).

How many viewers understood that the husband agreed, in exchange for substantial financial remuneration, not to return to and reclaim his wife until Oswald was dead? 2) The ending is highly unsatisfying because arbitrary and accidental. The original screenplay called for Maria to commit suicide after the reading of Oswald's will, on finding out that her husband had in effect sold their marriage to Oswald. In the final version, however, Maria only runs water from a faucet across her wrist in a gesture of suicide. Maria is then summarily blown up, rather than having to confront and live with the consequences of her self-delusion and moral compromise. 3) Fassbinder seeks to forcibly superimpose the public on the private, the political on the personal. Contrary to what the critics and \\"experts\\" assert, I don't think it works. Merely intruding historic radio news or the sound of the jackhammers of German reconstruction in the soundtrack on the dramatic events of the movie does not make those historical events integral to the drama. The selfish ambition of Maria's rise from poverty to prosperity is meant to parallel the so-called economic miracle of postwar Germany. Maria is thus intended to be a woman specific to and reflective of her time and place, but is in reality unoriginal and nonspecific. Women have been asserting their independence by using sex for self-advancement for ages. 4) Lastly, there are several instances of inexcusable sloppiness and amateurishness -- Fassbinder's drug addiction and consequent impatience and inattention have had their effect. Unknown people talk off screen without ever being seen; music is clumsily intrusive in places; and melodramatic posturing sporadically substitutes for acting.

David Anderson has published a review of so-called bulk interception powers. He found there was no viable alternative to the use of the powers by GCHQ, MI5 and MI6 in the fight against terror. He also backed the hacking of phones and computers \\"in principle\\", with some reservations. The operational case for this kind of surveillance, known as \\"bulk equipment interference,\\" was \\"not yet proven\\" as it had yet to be used, he said. His findings are a boost for Prime Minister Theresa May, who ordered the review when she was home secretary, in response to privacy concerns raised by Labour. Many of the practices investigated by Mr Anderson, who was given access to details of operations by British spies in Afghanistan and other foreign territories, had been secret until recently. They will be put on a firm legal footing by the government's Investigatory Powers Bill, dubbed the \\"snooper's charter\\" by critics, which is due to return to Parliament later this year. The review focused on the activities of the security services and did not examine the case for the retention of internet records for 12 months - the other controversial aspect of the bill. In a statement, Mrs May said: \\"Mr Anderson's report demonstrates how the bulk powers contained in the Investigatory Powers Bill are of crucial importance to our security and intelligence agencies. \\"These powers often provide the only means by which our agencies are able to protect the British public from the most serious threats that we face. It is vital that we retain them, while ensuring their use is subject to robust safeguards and world-leading oversight which are enshrined in the IP Bill.\\" Shadow Home Secretary Andy Burnham welcomed the report but said it was \\"concerning\\" that Mrs May had not accepted it in full. \\"She and the home secretary must accept the report in its entirety and deliver on the separate concessions extracted by Labour in the Commons - tougher restrictions on the use of Internet Connection Records and stronger protections for journalists and lawyers,\\" he said. Bulk interception differs from targeted interception - bugging a suspect's phone for example - in that it involves the harvesting of large quantities of data from the internet and emails. The data is then sifted and sorted by investigators. In his review, David Anderson said bulk powers were used by Britain's spy agencies for \\"cyber-defence, counter-espionage and counterterrorism,\\" as well as investigations into child sexual abuse and organised crime. Alternative methods of gathering data were available but were \\"often less effective, more dangerous, more resource-intensive, more intrusive or slower,\\" the review says. He backed three kinds of bulk data acquisition: But he expressed some reservations about a fourth practice - bulk equipment interference, which involves hacking into smart phones or computers over \\"a large geographical area\\", saying there was \\"a distinct (though not yet proven) operational case\\" for it. Unlike the other bulk powers described in the review, this one has yet to be used, it says. Mr Anderson also recommended that an independent panel of technical experts be set up to advise about the impact of changing technology \\"on how MI5, MI6 and GCHQ could reduce the privacy footprint of their activities\\". Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Alistair Carmichael welcomed the report - but said it was now up to MPs and peers to scrutinise the Investigatory Powers Bill to ensure privacy intrusion is kept to a minimum. But he also criticised the fact that a similar review has not been carried out into plans to retain internet records, describing this as an \\"excessive and authoritarian measure that not only erodes our privacy but will likely to prove to be a waste of money and fall foul of our courts\\". Bella Sankey, policy director at campaign group Liberty, said: \\"Liberty called for an impartial, independent and expert inquiry into these intrusive powers - yet sadly this rushed review failed on all three counts.\\" She added: \\"This was an opportunity to properly consider the range of targeted methods that could be used as effective alternatives to indiscriminate and potentially unlawful powers. That chance has been wasted.\\"","response":"The review by David Anderson, the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, has concluded that the bulk interception powers of British intelligence agencies – MI5, MI6 and the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) – are a necessary part of combating terrorism and do not have a workable alternative. Anderson’s findings will likely be a boon for Prime Minister Theresa May, the former home secretary who had ordered the review to investigate privacy issues, a move that was criticised by Labour. The results of the review will legitimise the activities of the UK’s security services as they will be included in the government's Investigatory Powers Bill, commonly known as the \\"snooper’s charter\\". Such investigative activities were largely kept secret until recently and include the practice of bulk equipment interference – the hacking of computers and phones – which Anderson supports \\"in principle\\", albeit with certain concerns, and defines as an essential tool in fields such as \\"cyber-defence, counter-espionage and counterterrorism\\", as well as in the investigation of serious crimes such as child sexual abuse. Yet this operational case for hacking was \\"not yet proven\\", as it has not yet been implemented. Anderson has also recommended that an independent panel of technical experts be established to offer advice about the impacts of evolving technology, especially in relation to how MI5, MI6 and GCHQ might be able to reduce their invasion of privacy. Anderson’s report was welcomed by Shadow Home Secretary, Andy Burnham, but he also voiced fears about May’s failure to fully accept the report."},{"question":"The first military unit of the Ottoman State was an army that was organized by Osman I from the tribesmen inhabiting the hills of western Anatolia in the late 13th century. The military system became an intricate organization with the advance of the Empire. The Ottoman military was a complex system of recruiting and fief-holding. The main corps of the Ottoman Army included Janissary, Sipahi, Akıncı and Mehterân. The Ottoman army was once among the most advanced fighting forces in the world, being one of the first to use muskets and cannons. The Ottoman Turks began using falconets, which were short but wide cannons, during the Siege of Constantinople. The Ottoman cavalry depended on high speed and mobility rather than heavy armour, using bows and short swords on fast Turkoman and Arabian horses (progenitors of the Thoroughbred racing horse), and often applied tactics similar to those of the Mongol Empire, such as pretending to retreat while surrounding the enemy forces inside a crescent-shaped formation and then making the real attack. The decline in the army's performance became clear from the mid-17th century and after the Great Turkish War. The 18th century saw some limited success against Venice, but in the north the European-style Russian armies forced the Ottomans to concede land. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): In what conflict did the Ottoman Turks use falconets?","response":"In the given text, it is mentioned that the Ottoman Turks used falconets during the Siege of Constantinople."},{"question":"Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: Hinostroza's children told police that four hooded individuals broke into the house and shot their mother after having insulted her. Hypothesis: The four hooded individuals spoke with British accents.","response":"Based on the given paragraph, it is impossible to determine if the hypothesis that the four hooded individuals spoke with British accents is true. The paragraph does not provide any information about the accents or nationality of the attackers. It only states that they insulted Hinostroza's mother before shooting her. To validate or dismiss the hypothesis, we would need access to more information, such as statements from the children regarding the attackers' accents, any surveillance footage or audio recordings that captured their voices, or eyewitness accounts from other people who encountered them. Assuming that this information is eventually provided, we would then be able to compare the stated or recorded accents to commonly associated British accents, such as Received Pronunciation, Cockney, Scouse, Geordie, or various regional accents. Finally, expert analysis from linguists or accent specialists may be required in order to determine with more certainty if the four hooded individuals indeed spoke with British accents. In conclusion, without further information, the given paragraph does not allow us to determine whether the hypothesis is true or not."},{"question":"Test for natural language inference. Premise: \\"A monk riding in a tricycle observing the surrounding and a driver wearing a yellow shirt.\\" Hypothesis: \\"They are in a blizzard.\\" Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise? Options: - yes - no - it is not possible to tell Step by step answer:","response":"1. First, let's understand the premise and hypothesis. Premise: \\"A monk riding in a tricycle observing the surrounding and a driver wearing a yellow shirt.\\" This premise tells us that there is a monk on a tricycle observing the surroundings, and there is a driver wearing a yellow shirt. Hypothesis: \\"They are in a blizzard.\\" The hypothesis is stating that the monk and the driver are in a blizzard (a severe snowstorm). 2. Now, we need to evaluate if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. To be entailed, the hypothesis must necessarily be true based on the information given in the premise. 3. Analyze the premise for any information about a blizzard or weather conditions. In this case, there is no mention of a blizzard or any weather condition in the premise. 4. Determine whether the hypothesis is entailed by the premise.

Options: - Sentence A: \\"Eating hot pot in winter can make us feel cold\\" - Sentence B: \\"Eating hot pot in winter can keep us warm\\" Let's solve this gradually.","response":"To determine which sentence does not make sense, we need to analyze both sentences: Sentence A states, \\"Eating hot pot in winter can make us feel cold.\\" Hot pot is a popular Asian dish that involves cooking various ingredients in a simmering pot of soup or broth. Typically, hot pot is eaten during winter as a shared meal with friends and family, which provides a sense of warmth and comfort. In this context, it is counterintuitive to say that eating hot pot in winter can make us feel cold. The sensation of eating a hot meal will likely cause our internal body temperature to rise, creating a sense of warmth. Additionally, the steamy, hot atmosphere and the company of others contribute to increasing the overall warmth. Therefore, this statement does not seem logical. Sentence B states, \\"Eating hot pot in winter can keep us warm.\\" This statement aligns with the general understanding of hot pot and its effects on our body temperature. Eating hot pot in winter can help raise our internal body temperature, especially while consuming a hot soup or broth. Furthermore, sharing a meal with friends and family could be a source of comfort, increasing the sense of warmth. So, this statement makes sense. Conclusion: Based on the analysis, Sentence A: \\"Eating hot pot in winter can make us feel cold\\" does not make sense. On the other hand, Sentence B: \\"Eating hot pot in winter can keep us warm\\" is logically sound and does make sense."},{"question":"'How To Lose Friends & Alienate People' is a superb film.

Two females employees of a sex store have been convicted of stealing more than £1,400 worth of erotic products from the shop in just two weeks, after being caught on CCTV. Julie Preston, 42, and Rachael Greensides, 27, both worked in the Pulse and Cocktails store in Hull when they stole a range of sex toys, outfits and cash. The store manager became suspicious after another staff member raised the alarm. For two weeks, he watched CCTV footage of the pair stealing sex toys and erotica from the shop. Guilty: Rachael Greensides (left) and Julie Preston are seen here outside Hull Magistrates Court where they were sentenced to 12 month community orders for their crimes. Greensides was seen charging customers for goods and then voiding the sale and pocketing the money after they had left. Preston was seen to steal over £1,000 of products and cash from the store while Greensides stole over £420. Prosecutor Heather Levitt said both women had worked at the store for years before another employee alerted the manager to the fact that clothing was going missing. She said: 'The manager began to monitor the CCTV recordings and discovered them placing carrier bags behind the till and placing various adult items in them before removing the bag and putting it under the counter.' They were both arrested on July 31 and have since pleaded guilty to three counts of theft. The pair claimed they were under pressure to meet targets to sell high-value products and as a result they were keeping back the money from smaller purchases and later ringing them through the till as a high-value purchase. Their solicitor Mike Farr said: 'The aggravating feature is the breach of trust from their employer. 'They were both invited for a internal meeting with the company and made admissions and the police were called. They made full admissions based on the CCTV evidence put to them. Scene of the crime: The Pulse and Cocktails store in Hull where Preston and Greensides stole over £1,000 worth of sex products. 'The property involved is of a relatively low value. 'Preston pleaded guilty to stealing £1,088.60 and she handed back items that were still at her home. Greenside stole £421.20. 'The thefts were not predominantly for financial gain. Preston claims she took items home intending to sell them to friends. 'Both have lost their employment and their exemplary record.' The company told the Crown Prosecution Service it is seeking a civil action against the women for a further £3,018. Mr Farr told the court Preston has already paid back £1,400. Both women have not received their final wage packets and the thefts they are charged with have already been repaid. Magistrates gave both women 12-month community orders and ordered them to carry out 100 hours of unpaid work in the community as well being ordered to pay £85 court costs each.

Sentence 2: The Menorcan economy was incredibly wealthy and continued to boom for a long time. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","response":"To perform this task, I need to analyze and compare the information provided in the two sentences, with attention to their implicit and explicit meanings. The first sentence gives us the information that Menorca's economy was devastated for decades. This implies a negative economic condition in Menorca. In contrast, the second sentence states that the Menorcan economy was incredibly wealthy and had a long period of economic growth. This implies a positive economic condition in Menorca. Given that each sentence describes a different economic condition (one describes a disadvantaged economy while the other describes a prosperous economy), we can ascertain that the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. This is because the second sentence provides information that contradicts the information in the first sentence. In terms of formal logic, entailment means that if the information in the first set of propositions (here, the first sentence) is true, then the information in the second set of propositions (the second sentence) must inevitably be true. In this case, the information in the two sentences cannot both be true simultaneously. Therefore, we can conclude that the second sentence isn't entailed by the first sentence.

Article:","response":"Title: The Beginning of an End: Google Phases Out Adobe's Flash on Chrome In the ever-evolving world of technology, it is important for companies to keep up with the pace of change and provide an experience that caters to the needs of their users. Google has always been on the forefront of technological developments, and the company's decision to phase out full support for Adobe's Flash software on its Chrome browser is a testament to this. The announcement, made recently, states that the shift away from Flash will begin towards the end of 2016 and proceed gradually over time. Adobe's Flash has been the go-to plugin for multimedia content, particularly video streaming and interactive animations with impressive visual effects, since the early 2000s. Despite Flash's significant role in the rise of multimedia on the internet, it's long been notorious for its vulnerability to cyber attacks, slow page load times, and high resource consumption. As a result, tech giants like Apple and Mozilla have been steadily distancing themselves from the technology at an increasing pace in recent years. Google's announcement does not come as a surprise to industry insiders, as the push for modern, mobile-friendly web technologies like HTML5 has been in motion for quite some time now. Google's plans to phase-out full support for Flash is a maneuver consistent with the company's commitment to provide users with a seamless, efficient, and secure browsing experience. The optimization and functionality features offered by HTML5 increasingly appear to be a superior choice for multimedia content when compared to Flash. The gradual shift away from Flash will begin with the release of Chrome 55 in December 2016, which will have HTML5 set as its default browsing mode. Sites that still rely on Flash will need to request permission from users to run the Flash plugin in Chrome. This permission-based model, known as \\"click-to-play,\\" aims to raise awareness on the part of users and developers alike by pushing them to adopt the more sophisticated, secure alternative HTML5. Google is not entirely abandoning Flash overnight, however. Understanding that the process of transitioning away from the software can be a long and arduous one, the tech giant plans to maintain 'whitelists' of the top 10 websites using Flash - including popular platforms like Facebook, YouTube, and Amazon - and will continue providing full support for Flash on these sites for a limited period of time. It's expected that this whitelist will be reviewed and updated regularly, allowing more sites to be removed from the list as they abandon Flash technology. While the phasing out of Adobe's Flash may be seen as an end of an era, it is equally important to acknowledge the dawn of a new age in multimedia content provision. HTML5 being widely adopted by web developers will pave the way for better user experiences and more secure browsing. The decision by Google, one of the biggest players in the industry, to abandon Flash stands as a testament to the urgency with which web developers must now adapt to the shifting landscape. In conclusion, Google's announcement marks a significant change in the realm of web browsing and multimedia content. By phasing out its full support for Adobe's Flash on the Chrome browser, the company paves the way for the adoption of more modern web technologies like HTML5, while ensuring a safer and more efficient browsing experience for users. This decision can be seen as a pioneering move by Google, a frontrunner in the world of technology, encouraging other companies to follow suit and adopt new technologies in the face of an ever-changing digital landscape."},{"question":"Do these mean the same?

A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 °C (0.09 °F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a \\"thread\\" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to NASA, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5 °C (41 °F).A study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 (online in December 2012) identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth.

True to form, those who evaluated Seven Faces, such as Mordaunt Hall of The New York Times, did go into considerable detail regarding plot twists, as related herein below.Papa Chibou, the elderly caretaker of Musée Pratouchy, a Parisian wax museum, feels a strong kinship with the figures, particularly with that of Napoleon. He spots at the waxworks a romantic young couple, Georges, a lawyer, and Helene, the daughter of a stern judge who disapproves of his daughter's choice and forbids her to see Georges. Papa Chibou suggests to them that they can still stay in touch, without disobeying her father's directive not to speak with each other, by placing secret personal messages in the pockets of Napoleon's uniform. However, a missing letter and confusion in communication causes Georges to arrive at the mistaken conclusion that Helene has redirected her affections towards a foolish young man, who is unworthy of her and excessively preoccupied with his stylish personal appearance and elegant clothing., can you guess it ?

You need to create a question that can be answered from the story.

As the stories are sometimes movie plots, they will contain actor names in parentheses. You should not use those names. Only use character names. Try to ask a question about all parts of the plot, not just the beginning. Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Penguin Island is written in the style of a sprawling 18th- and 19th-century history book, concerned with grand metanarratives, mythologizing heroes, hagiography and romantic nationalism. It is about a fictitious island, inhabited by great auks, that existed off the northern coast of Europe. The history begins when a wayward Christian missionary monk lands on the island and perceives the upright, unafraid auks as a sort of pre-Christian society of noble pagans. Mostly blind and somewhat deaf, having mistaken the animals for humans, he baptizes them. This causes a problem for The Lord, who normally only allows humans to be baptized. After consulting with saints and theologians in Heaven, He resolves the dilemma by converting the baptized birds to humans with only a few physical traces of their ornithological origin, and giving them each a soul. Thus begins the history of Penguinia, and from there forward the history mirrors that of France (and more generally of Western Europe, including German-speaking areas and the British Isles). The narrative spans from the Migration Period (\\"Dark Ages\\"), when the Germanic tribes fought incessantly among themselves for territory; to the heroic Early Middle Ages with the rise of Charlemagne (\\"Draco the Great\\") and conflicts with Viking raiders (\\"porpoises\\"); through the Renaissance (Erasmus); and up to the modern era with motor cars; and even into a future time in which a thriving high-tech civilization is destroyed by a campaign of terrorist bombings, and everything begins again in an endless cycle. The longest-running plot thread, and probably the best known, satirizes the Dreyfus affair though both brief and complex satires of European history, politics, philosophy and theology are present throughout the novel. At various points, real historical figures such as Columba and Saint Augustine are part of the story, as well as fictionalized characters who represent historical people. Penguin Island is a satire on society and human nature in which morals, customs, and the origin of religion and laws are lampooned. For example, the origin of private property is presented as starting with the brutal and shameless murder of a farmer, and the seizure of his land, by a physically larger and stronger neighbour.

Hypothesis: Positive reinforcement and early learning are beneficial to childhood development. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise? OPT: a). yes. b). it is not possible to tell. c). no. And the answer is:","response":"a). yes. In the given premise, it's explicitly mentioned that educating a child from an early age is crucial, and parents should engage in their child's educational journey. It encourages parents to acknowledge their child's efforts and persistence rather than simply focusing on the outcomes. This essentially suggests the use of positive reinforcement as a motivational tool. All these points cater to the hypothesis which states, \\"positive reinforcement and early learning are beneficial to childhood development.\\" The actions described in the premise, including fostering early reading habits, involvement in school activities, refraining from punishing mistakes, allowing children to discover their unique learning styles, and praising hard work and perseverance instead of just the end results, all speak to both the concepts of positive reinforcement and early learning. Hence, the hypothesis that 'Positive reinforcement and early learning are beneficial to childhood development' is entailed by the premise. The roles of early learning and positive reinforcement in child development are pertinently recommended in the premise, leading to the conclusion that these two strategies are advantageous for a child's growth and development. In addition, several studies and psychological theories endorse this hypothesis, adding more weight to it. We know through research that children who start learning at an early age generally have a head start in their academic journey compared to those who don't. Similarly, positive reinforcement is a universally accepted method of encouraging desirable and beneficial behavior in children. It helps in instilling confidence and a sense of accomplishment in children which not only aids physical and intellectual development but also supports emotional and social growth.

It's been barely a month since the 28-year-old Phd student of African studies was picked up by the police and charged with sedition for allegedly shouting anti-India slogans at a meeting on the campus. (Two other students remain in custody.) It's barely a week since Mr Kumar, who's the president of the students' union and is affiliated to Communist Party of India, was freed on bail, and gave a stirring speech on the campus that went viral. Mr Kumar, according to political scientist Suhas Palshikar, is the latest student to be associated with the \\"simmering unrest\\" on Indian campuses, a \\"result of the BJP's newfound ideological aggression and political arrogance\\". Many are calling him a student icon. Over the last month, Mr Kumar has inspired a hefty Wikipedia entry, stirring paeans to a rising leader (Red Star over India, exulted The Telegraph), even listicles. His friends reckon he has already given 50 media interviews in five days. A little-know fringe group leader with a paltry bank balance announced a hefty bounty on his head, his Facebook account has been hacked, his mobile phone seized by the police. Some people have even begun raising money in his name. Mr Kumar's many admirers believe Prime Minister Narendra Modi has \\"met his match\\" in the feisty student. His critics have called him an anarchist, a misguided idealist, a sloganeering \\"Johnny-come-lately who is upstaging stalwarts\\", and given him gratuitous advice on how he should stop politicking and begin earning for his poor parents. \\"I get up in the morning, do some work for the union, and then do interviews all day. They say after TV channels and newspapers, the magazines will come,\\" he says. Mr Kumar appears to be basking in the warm glow of his meteoric media rise. When he's not handling the scrum, there's time for some light banter with friends. When a friend teases him about being an attention seeker, he quips, \\"Only (Prime Minister Modi) suffers from an attention seeker's syndrome.\\" Some hearty laughter follows. He's carrying some handwritten papers of Brecht's poetry, translated in Hindi - \\"The book is out of print, so we are sharing these handwritten poems.\\" Many believe that in a nation desperate for heroes and soaked in a febrile media culture adept at myth making and instant vilification, Mr Kumar has been thrust into an uncomfortable spotlight by a fumbling and offensive government and a clutch of hostile news channels. So does he feel like an accidental hero? \\"I am no hero,\\" says Mr Kumar. \\"Thank the people who made me a hero, including a section of the media who work for a particular party. The real heroes and heroines are those who are fighting for democracy against an authoritarian regime.\\" He does not suffer from any false modesty. He hasn't become famous overnight, he says. It has been a \\"gradual process\\" since he first arrived at JNU from his village in Begusarai in Bihar. (His father, a small farmer, cannot work any longer as he is paralysed after a stroke and his mother is a government childcare centre worker.) \\"I had a culture shock when I arrived in JNU. There are students from 145 countries here. My horizons have grown. Last year, I was voted as the leader of the students' union,\\" he says. Students say his rousing performance in November's presidential debate - a town-hall discussion, a day before the union election - made him a name on the campus. A Kumar speech, delivered in fluent Hindi, is usually an animated performance of oratory, rhetoric, wit and gladiatorial mojo. \\"The number of Facebook friends jumped from 2,000 to 5,000. A thousand people followed me. There is now pressure from people when you are not updating your status. Four hundred people like your status now, up from 20 before,\\" he says. \\"Things have obviously moved fast [since my arrest]. When my Facebook account is hacked, people raise money in my name and I am targeted to run down my university, I feel a bit uneasy.\\" Mr Kumar says his critics - mostly irate, older urbanites - who describe him as an amateur in politics forget that he was initiated very early when he was studying at a college in Patna. \\"I was part of a group in college which spoke out about why classes were not being held, why women were harassed, why sons of politicians were misbehaving on the campus.\\" \\"So you have to understand that my politics is rooted in my lived experiences. It didn't happen overnight.\\" I ask him about his politics. Some of it is an inspired mix of liberalism and boilerplate leftism: the battle in India is \\"between pro-democracy versus anti-democracy, pro-people versus pro-corporate\\". Other times, it is more nuanced: India's left parties need \\"to get rid of their purity\\", secular parties should unite against the scourge of religious politics, the \\"progressive forces\\" have regrettably ceded space to the right-wing, parties should leave their student wings alone to help them grow freely. Despite the events of the last month, Mr Kumar looks unusually calm. He is not easy to provoke. It is difficult to figure out whether he's being cheeky or earnest when he names Anupam Kher and Paresh Rawal, two Bollywood actors, who openly back Mr Modi's BJP aggressively, as his favourites. So there is also a life beyond beyond politics. Days before he was put behind bars for shouting slogans - reports say some of the videos of his speech telecast by some channels were doctored - he discovered Leonardo DiCaprio. \\"I am brushing up my English, so we went to watch The Revenant. I loved it, mainly because of Leo. My friends were telling me that he should have won the Oscar much earlier.

Until the early twentieth century , Marans was famous for the \`\` red bean of Marans '' and its fairs in honor of these particularly local beans .","response":"1. Analyze the two sentences and identify the key elements: Sentence 1: Until the early twentieth century, Marans was famous for the \\"local bean of Marans\\" and its fairs in honor of these especially red beans. Key elements: early twentieth century, Marans, famous, local bean of Marans, fairs, honor, especially red beans. Sentence 2: Until the early twentieth century, Marans was famous for the \\"red bean of Marans\\" and its fairs in honor of these particularly local beans. Key elements: early twentieth century, Marans, famous, red bean of Marans, fairs, honor, particularly local beans. 2. Compare the key elements in the sentences: The common elements are: early twentieth century, Marans, famous, fairs, honor. The differences lie in the characterization of the beans: - Sentence 1: local bean of Marans, especially red beans. - Sentence 2: red bean of Marans, particularly local beans. 3. Determine if these differences change the overall meaning: In Sentence 1, the focus is more on the beans being local to Marans, and the beans are notably red. In Sentence 2, the emphasis is on the red color of the beans, and these beans are especially local. Although the specific emphasis on the beans' characteristics is slightly switched, the overall meaning of the two sentences is similar: - Marans was famous for a specific type of bean (local, red) until the early twentieth century. - There were fairs in Marans to celebrate these beans. However, the switch in emphasis could lead to a nuanced difference in meaning: - Sentence 1 emphasizes more on the locality of the beans, with color being a secondary characteristic. - Sentence 2 emphasizes more on the color of the beans, with the locality being a secondary characteristic. In conclusion, while both sentences convey a similar overall meaning, there is a nuanced difference in the emphasis on the characteristics of the beans."},{"question":"Surely the best thing about colomba, the Easter equivalent to panettone, is the sugared, toasted almond topping that covers the whole thing and crumbles when you cut it, so you sort of have no choice but just to pick up the crusty sugary bits and eat those on their own. I’d always thought that colomba would make a very good baking project but was somewhat intimated by getting the right shape — it’s vaguely in the shape of a dove, if you use your imagination — and texture — wonderfully soft, fluffy, sweet yeasted bread. I had attempted making panettone (this fig, walnut and date panettone) a few years ago with fair results — absolutely delicious results, actually, they were just not as fluffy and bouncy as expertly made ones from your favourite pastry shop where panettoni are hung upside-down to maintain their height and airiness. But when I came across the familiar brown and gold paper forms for making colomba at the supermarket, I thought I’m only ever going to get a chance to make this now! Like the panettone, I referred to my favourite baking book for Italian specialties, Carol Field’s The Italian Baker. Field recounts a bit of history behind the colomba, which I’m sure is little known to anyone these days. Colomba is a fixture at Easter tables all around Italy (and is often given as presents), even though it comes from the north of Italy, Pavia. It is one of those traditions that are now a given, where a slice of colomba, perhaps eaten with pieces of a cracked chocolate Easter egg and an espresso or a glass of dessert wine, is a welcome end to the meal (or indeed breakfast the next day). But the legend behind it is a medieval one and rather disturbing — maybe it was made up to encourage young girls to learn how to bake their own colomba (and make sure it was good) to get themselves out of sticky, undesirable situations. Question: What did the author probably do with the colomba she made from the Field's recipe? === The answer to the above question is Select from: (I). not enough information (II). she probably ate them all (III). she probably didn't eat any (IV). she probably ate some and shared it with others Answer:","response":"(IV). she probably ate some and shared it with others"},{"question":"Given the sentence \\"A large black and brown dog is carrying something in its mouth while walking on grass.\\" is it true that \\"The dog is carrying a bone in it's mouth.\\"?

Assuming that: When the heart expels more blood with each stroke, the heart has to beat less often in order to maintain the same volume of blood flow. A:","response":"If someone has a larger than average physical heart, it is likely that it can pump more blood with each stroke. Assuming that the larger heart can indeed expel more blood with each stroke, it will require fewer beats to pump the same volume of blood. Consequently, the heart rate would be lower when compared to someone with an average-sized heart, given that the individual's body demands the same blood flow volume. In summary, if someone has a larger than average physical heart that effectively pumps more blood with each stroke, it will beat less frequently to maintain the same volume of blood flow. However, it is essential to note that other factors like fitness levels, age, and any underlying medical conditions could also influence the heart rate, even in those with larger hearts."},{"question":"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A Pakistani court Monday gave police two weeks to prepare their case for charging five Americans whom police suspect of planning terrorist attacks. Authorities have said they plan to prosecute the five men -- who are being held in jail -- under the country's anti-terrorism act. A court hearing was set for January 18. Police have said they are confident that the Americans were planning terrorist acts, according to Tahir Gujjrar, deputy superintendent of police in Sargodha, where the men were arrested December 9. Gujjrar told CNN a preliminary investigation suggests that the men came to Pakistan to wage jihad and had sought to link up with Jaish-e-Mohammed and Jamaat-ud-Dawa militant organizations, neither of which showed interest, he said. The men wanted to martyr themselves, he said. Jaish-e-Mohammed is the group believed to be responsible for the murder of journalist Daniel Pearl. But Mohammed Ameer Khan Rokhri, an attorney representing the men, said they testified on the Quran, the Muslim holy book, \\"that they have no connection with any banned organization,\\" including Jaish-e-Mohammed or al Qaeda. They told the court, \\"We are going to Afghanistan to help the Muslims who have been injured by the NATO forces and other Afghan forces,\\" the attorney said.

The document also calls for the two countries to jointly work on efforts to build a lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula, to establish new U.S.-North Korea relations and to recover the remains of prisoners of war and military members missing in action. The two sides also promised to hold follow-up negotiations. “We’re going to denuke North Korea,” Trump told VOA contributor Greta Van Susteren. He also said neither side issued ultimatums and that the agreement Tuesday was the result of months of negotiations. “You know that could have ended in a war, that could have ended with many millions of people — you know North Korea very well, Seoul has 28 million people, that could have ended with millions of people dead but we ended with a deal,” he said. Trump also told VOA that U.S. troops stationed in South Korea will remain in place, but announced one concession long-sought by North Korea. \\"We are going to get out of the war games that cost so much money,\\" he said. Trump said at later news conference that existing U.S. sanctions will remain in place until North Korean nuclear weapons \\"are no longer a factor.\\" As for verification, Trump said he and Kim discussed the issue and that monitoring denuclearization efforts would be achieved “by having a lot of people there.” He also predicted Kim would begin work right away to “live up to” the agreement.

Translate this to English?","response":"Group: Non-destructive Control and Diagnostic Devices (7) List ... The given text seems to be related to a categorization or grouping of non-destructive control and diagnostic devices. Non-destructive testing and diagnostics are important aspects of various industries, such as manufacturing, construction, and engineering. These tests and diagnostics are used to assess the quality, safety, and integrity of materials, products, and structures without causing damage or destruction to them. The list mentioned seems to consist of 7 major types of such devices. Below, I have provided an explanation and elaboration of these non-destructive control and diagnostic devices in detail. 1. Ultrasonic Testing Devices: Ultrasonic testing devices use high-frequency sound waves to detect flaws, cracks, and other discontinuities in materials. These devices are widely used in many industries, such as aerospace, automotive, and construction, to ensure the structural integrity and safety of components. 2. Radiographic Testing Devices: Radiographic testing involves the use of X-rays or gamma rays to inspect materials and components for flaws and defects. This technique provides a detailed image of the internal structure of the object being tested, making it a valuable tool for detecting hidden flaws, cracks, and inclusions. 3. Magnetic Particle Testing Devices: Magnetic particle testing is a method of detecting surface and near-surface defects in ferromagnetic materials. The device creates a magnetic field around the object being tested, and any discontinuities in the material will cause the magnetic field to leak. Magnetic particles are then applied to the surface of the object, and any deviation in the magnetic field will cause the particles to gather around the defect, making it visible. 4. Eddy Current Testing Devices: Eddy current testing devices use electromagnetic induction to detect flaws and defects in conductive materials. An electrical current is induced in the material, and any changes in the flow of the current reveal the presence of discontinuities within the material. This method is frequently used to assess the condition of pipes, tubes, and other cylindrical structures. 5. Visual Inspection Devices: Visual inspection is the simplest and most widely used non-destructive testing technique. Devices like borescopes, videoscopes, and endoscopes allow inspectors to thoroughly examine the interior and exterior of materials and components for defects, cracks, and other issues. 6. Acoustic Emission Testing Devices: Acoustic emission testing involves monitoring the sound waves generated when a material is subjected to stress. These devices can detect the early stages of material failure by identifying the unique sound signatures associated with specific types of defects and flaws. 7. Infrared Thermography Devices: Infrared thermography is a non-contact method for detecting temperature variations on the surface of an object. It uses infrared cameras to capture thermal images of the surface, which can reveal underlying problems like overheating, insulation failures, and moisture infiltration. In conclusion, these non-destructive control and diagnostic devices play a critical role in ensuring the quality, safety, and longevity of various materials, structures, and products. They help prevent catastrophic failures, reduce waste, and minimize downtime for repairs and maintenance."},{"question":"How to choose an ipa<br>Look for an ipa from a brewery you like.

The robot, Emma (Leslie Bibb), takes a jack-o'-lantern to blow out the light but her boyfriend, Henry (Tahmoh Penikett), tells her that it's against tradition to un-decorate before midnight. Emma asserts that she wants all the decorations gone before her mother visits the next morning, saying that the yard looks like a crime scene, and blows out the candle. Henry, a true fan of the holiday, promises to remove everything early the next morning and convinces Emma to meet him inside for some \\"alone time\\".

As she removes the sheets off one of the ghost-crows, it lunges at her, covering her in the white cloth. In the ensuing struggle, Emma tumbles onto the sidewalk where passing trick-or-treaters stop to investigate. Under the sheets, a figure takes a bitten pumpkin-shaped sucker and slits Emma's throat. Her blood stains through the sheets and the children run away. The hidden assailant drags Emma's body back to the yard as Henry lies upstairs, passed out and with the TV on high volume. Some time later, he notices Emma has not come up and goes down to the yard where he notices that one of the ghost-crows now has lights attached to it. He removes the sheet and screams at the sight of Emma's disembodied head on a stake, the pumpkin sucker lodged in her mouth.Meanwhile, the Halloween festivities and parties continue throughout the town and a parade marches down the main street while the silhouette of a short figure walks through the crowd, dragging a burlap bag with a dark stain at the bottom.1.

Observing the abundance of game birds Martin wrote: There is plenty of land and water fowl in this isle—as hawks, eagles of two kinds (the one grey and of a larger size, the other much less and black, but more destructive to young cattle), black cock, heath-hen, plovers, pigeons, wild geese, ptarmigan, and cranes. Of this latter sort I have seen sixty on the shore in a flock together. The sea fowls are malls of all kinds—coulterneb, guillemot, sea cormorant, &c. The natives observe that the latter, if perfectly black, makes no good broth, nor is its flesh worth eating; but that a cormorant, which hath any white feathers or down, makes good broth, and the flesh of it is good food; and the broth is usually drunk by nurses to increase their milk. Similarly, Samuel Johnson noted that: At the tables where a stranger is received, neither plenty nor delicacy is wanting. A tract of land so thinly inhabited, must have much wild-fowl; and I scarcely remember to have seen a dinner without them. The moor-game is every where to be had. That the sea abounds with fish, needs not be told, for it supplies a great part of Europe. The Isle of Sky has stags and roebucks, but no hares. They sell very numerous droves of oxen yearly to England, and therefore cannot be supposed to want beef at home.

By mid-1858 the problems with the Thames had been building for several years. In his novel Little Dorrit—published as a serial between 1855 and 1857—Charles Dickens wrote that the Thames was \\"a deadly sewer ... in the place of a fine, fresh river\\". In a letter to a friend, Dickens said: \\"I can certify that the offensive smells, even in that short whiff, have been of a most head-and-stomach-distending nature\\", while the social scientist and journalist George Godwin wrote that \\"in parts the deposit is more than six feet deep\\" on the Thames foreshore, and that \\"the whole of this is thickly impregnated with impure matter\\". In June 1858 the temperatures in the shade in London averaged 34–36 °C (93–97 °F)—rising to 48 °C (118 °F) in the sun. Combined with an extended spell of dry weather, the level of the Thames dropped and raw effluent from the sewers remained on the banks of the river. Queen Victoria and Prince Albert attempted to take a pleasure cruise on the Thames, but returned to shore within a few minutes because the smell was so terrible. The press soon began calling the event \\"The Great Stink\\"; the leading article in the City Press observed that \\"Gentility of speech is at an end—it stinks, and whoso once inhales the stink can never forget it and can count himself lucky if he lives to remember it\\". A writer for The Standard concurred with the opinion. One of its reporters described the river as a \\"pestiferous and typhus breeding abomination\\", while a second wrote that \\"the amount of poisonous gases which is thrown off is proportionate to the increase of the sewage which is passed into the stream\\". The leading article in The Illustrated London News commented that: We can colonise the remotest ends of the earth; we can conquer India; we can pay the interest of the most enormous debt ever contracted; we can spread our name, and our fame, and our fructifying wealth to every part of the world; but we cannot clean the River Thames.

While another critic says she is a \\"Vocal acrobat, being able to sing long and complex melismas and vocal runs effortlessly, and in key. Her vocal abilities mean she is identified as the centerpiece of Destiny's Child. The Daily Mail calls Beyoncé's voice \\"versatile\\", capable of exploring power ballads, soul, rock belting, operatic flourishes, and hip hop. Jon Pareles of The New York Times commented that her voice is \\"velvety yet tart, with an insistent flutter and reserves of soul belting\\". Rosen notes that the hip hop era highly influenced Beyoncé's strange rhythmic vocal style, but also finds her quite traditionalist in her use of balladry, gospel and falsetto.

Cornell University professors Lana Hall and Karen Bunch interviewed(,) 3900 people in the survey. \\"People who eat less than 30 percent of their food away from home eat the most nutritiously,\\" they said. \\"In general, Americans don't have nutrient, except for iron and calcium,\\" they reported. They have the opposite problem----over--consumption , especially of fat. The food at many fast food restaurants is often low in vitamins. \\"People who eat more than 30 percent of total calories away from home eat foods that are generally low in nutrients per calorie,\\" the professors said. More calories and enough nutrient intake are required to achieve. One of the major health risks is eating too much fat. The professor found than fat consumption became greater as income went up.

She was an independent member of Seanad Éireann . She was elected Pro-Chancellor of the University of Dublin in 2012 . By profession she is a University Professor and medical practitioner . In 1966 she married John McEntagart of Dublin , Merchant and they have three children . She is a member of the Church of Ireland .

As an undergraduate , among many other distinctions she won the Sir James Craig Memorial Prize in Medicine . She represented the University of Dublin constituency in the Seanad from 1993 until 2007 . She did not stand in the 2007 Seanad election , and Ivana Bacik was elected to succeed her . - An upper house, sometimes called a Senate, is one of two chambers of a bicameral legislature (or one of three chambers of a tricameral legislature), the other chamber being the lower house. The house formally designated as the upper house is usually smaller, and often has more restricted power, than the lower house. Examples of upper houses in countries include the UK's House of Lords, Canada's Senate, India's Rajya Sabha, Russia's Federation Council, Ireland's Seanad, Germany's Bundesrat and the United States Senate. - The English Reformation was a series of events in 16th century England by which the Church of England broke away from the authority of the Pope and the Roman Catholic Church. These events were, in part, associated with the wider process of the European Protestant Reformation, a religious and political movement that affected the practice of Christianity across all of Europe during this period. Many factors contributed to the process: the decline of feudalism and the rise of nationalism, the rise of the common law, the invention of the printing press and increased circulation of the Bible, and the transmission of new knowledge and ideas among scholars, the upper and middle classes and readers in general. However, the various phases of the English Reformation, which also covered Wales and Ireland, were largely driven by changes in government policy, to which public opinion gradually accommodated itself. - The Church of Ireland is a Christian church in Ireland and an autonomous province of the Anglican Communion. It is organised on an all-Ireland basis and is the second-largest Christian church on the island after the Roman Catholic Church. Like other Anglican churches, it has retained elements of pre-Reformation practice, notably its episcopal polity, while rejecting the primacy of the Bishop of Rome. Nevertheless, in theological and liturgical matters, it incorporates many principles of the Reformation, particularly those espoused during the English Reformation. The church self identifies as being both Catholic and Reformed. Within the church, differences exist between those members who are more Catholic-leaning (high church) and those who are more Protestant-leaning (low church or evangelical). For historical and cultural reasons, the Church of Ireland is generally identified as a Protestant church. The Church of Ireland is the second-largest in the Republic of Ireland, with around 130,000 members, and the third-largest in Northern Ireland, with around 260,000 members. - The University of Dublin, corporately designated the Chancellor, Doctors and Masters of the University of Dublin, is a university located in Dublin, Ireland. It was founded in 1592 when Queen Elizabeth I issued a charter for Trinity College, as \\"the mother of a university\\", thereby making it Ireland's oldest operating university. It was modelled after the collegiate universities of Oxford and of Cambridge, but unlike these only one college was established; as such, the designations \\"Trinity College\\" and \\"University of Dublin\\" are usually synonymous for practical purposes. - Seanad Éireann (\\"Senate of Ireland\\") is the upper house of the Oireachtas (the Irish legislature), which also comprises the President of Ireland and Dáil Éireann (the lower house). It is commonly called the Seanad or Senate and its members senators (\\"seanadóirí\\" in Irish, singular: \\"seanadóir\\"). Unlike Dáil Éireann, it is not directly elected but consists of a mixture of members chosen by various methods. Its powers are much weaker than those of the Dáil and it can only delay laws with which it disagrees, rather than veto them outright. It has been located, since its establishment, in Leinster House.

The action comes after The Washington Post reported that the government was seizing state and federal tax refunds that were on their way to about 400,000 Americans who had relatives who owed money to the Social Security agency. In many cases, the people whose refunds were intercepted had never heard of any debt, and the debts dated as far back as the middle of the past century. “I have directed an immediate halt to further referrals under the Treasury Offset Program to recover debts owed to the agency that are 10 years old and older pending a thorough review of our responsibility and discretion under the current law,” the acting Social Security commissioner, Carolyn Colvin, said in a statement. Colvin said anyone who has received Social Security or Supplemental Security Income benefits and “believes they have been incorrectly assessed with an overpayment” should contact the agency and “seek options to resolve the overpayment.” The effort to collect on old debts began with a single line in the 2008 farm bill that lifted the statute of limitations on debts to the government that are more than 10 years old. The Treasury Department then set up rules that allowed the government to settle such debts by intercepting taxpayers’ refunds. The department has collected about 2 billion in intercepted tax refunds this year, 75 million of that on debts delinquent for more than 10 years. If you're one of the millions of Americans using your tax refund like a “forced savings account,” here's why you shouldn’t — with marshmallow Peeps to help explain. Michelle Singletary contributed to this video. (Kate M. Tobey and Gillian Brockell/The Washington Post) Mary Grice, a federal worker who lives in Takoma Park, Md., never got the refunds she was expecting to see in her mailbox this year. The government seized her checks because of a 2,996 debt that was supposedly incurred under her father’s Social Security number. Her father died in 1960, when she was 4, and her mother received survivors’ benefits thereafter. But 37 years passed between when the Social Security agency says it overpaid someone in the Grice family and when Mary Grice’s refund was taken. She was unable to find out from the agency exactly who received the overpayment — her mother or perhaps her father’s first wife, both of whom are no longer living. The suspension of the collection effort is “the right thing to do,” said Grice’s attorney, Robert Vogel. “It’s a first step. The next thing they have to do is stop collecting debts from children under any circumstances.” Vogel filed suit in federal court in Greenbelt, Md., last week, alleging that the government denied Grice due process by failing to give her notice of the debt and by taking the money from her, even though she was not receiving government benefits at the time the debt was incurred. Vogel and several members of Congress argued that the government should not be holding children accountable for the financial acts of their parents. The Federal Trade Commission, on its Web site, advises Americans that “family members typically are not obligated to pay the debts of a deceased relative from their own assets.” After The Post’s article was published late last week, many hundreds of taxpayers whose refunds had been intercepted came forward and complained to members of Congress that they had been given no notice of the debts and that the government had not explained why they were being held responsible for debts that their deceased parents may have incurred. In a note Social Security officials sent to several members of Congress on Monday, the agency said, “We will be reexamining our responsibilities under current law for such referrals and will be notifying you of our conclusions upon completion of the thorough review.” In a letter to Treasury Secretary Jack Lew on Monday, Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) said that government agencies were apparently “not properly notifying individuals or allowing them to inspect records of the debt they supposedly owe, which are violations of the law.” Grassley said that although Congress did authorize the government to seek payment on old debts, the law “says nothing about allowing the government to offset payments from an individual to pay debts not in his or her name. It is unclear where the government has that authority.” The senator said that Congress created a rigorous system to ensure that debt collection is handled transparently but that “it appears that agencies are abusing this system.” ||||| A few weeks ago, with no notice, the U.S. government intercepted Mary Grice’s tax refunds from both the IRS and the state of Maryland. Grice had no idea that Uncle Sam had seized her money until some days later, when she got a letter saying that her refund had gone to satisfy an old debt to the government — a very old debt. When Grice was 4, back in 1960, her father died, leaving her mother with five children to raise. Until the kids turned 18, Sadie Grice got survivor benefits from Social Security to help feed and clothe them. Now, Social Security claims it overpaid someone in the Grice family — it’s not sure who — in 1977. After 37 years of silence, four years after Sadie Grice died, the government is coming after her daughter. Why the feds chose to take Mary’s money, rather than her surviving siblings’, is a mystery. Across the nation, hundreds of thousands of taxpayers who are expecting refunds this month are instead getting letters like the one Grice got, informing them that because of a debt they never knew about — often a debt incurred by their parents — the government has confiscated their check. The Treasury Department has intercepted 1.9 billion in tax refunds already this year — 75 million of that on debts delinquent for more than 10 years, said Jeffrey Schramek, assistant commissioner of the department’s debt management service. The aggressive effort to collect old debts started three years ago — the result of a single sentence tucked into the farm bill lifting the 10-year statute of limitations on old debts to Uncle Sam. If you're one of the millions of Americans using your tax refund like a \\"forced savings account,\\" here's why you shouldn't—with marshmallow Peeps to help explain. Michelle Singletary contributed to this video. (Kate M. Tobey and Gillian Brockell/The Washington Post) No one seems eager to take credit for reopening all these long-closed cases. A Social Security spokeswoman says the agency didn’t seek the change; ask Treasury. Treasury says it wasn’t us; try Congress. Congressional staffers say the request probably came from the bureaucracy. The only explanation the government provides for suddenly going after decades-old debts comes from Social Security spokeswoman Dorothy Clark: “We have an obligation to current and future Social Security beneficiaries to attempt to recoup money that people received when it was not due.” Since the drive to collect on very old debts began in 2011, the Treasury Department has collected 424 million in debts that were more than 10 years old. Those debts were owed to many federal agencies, but the one that has many Americans howling this tax season is the Social Security Administration, which has found 400,000 taxpayers who collectively owe 714 million on debts more than 10 years old. The agency expects to have begun proceedings against all of those people by this summer. “It was a shock,” said Grice, 58. “What incenses me is the way they went about this. They gave me no notice, they can’t prove that I received any overpayment, and they use intimidation tactics, threatening to report this to the credit bureaus.” Grice filed suit against the Social Security Administration in federal court in Greenbelt this week, alleging that the government violated her right to due process by holding her responsible for a 2,996 debt supposedly incurred under her father’s Social Security number. Social Security officials told Grice that six people — Grice, her four siblings and her father’s first wife, whom she never knew — had received benefits under her father’s account. The government doesn’t look into exactly who got the overpayment; the policy is to seek compensation from the oldest sibling and work down through the family until the debt is paid. The Federal Trade Commission, on its Web site, advises Americans that “family members typically are not obligated to pay the debts of a deceased relative from their own assets.” But Social Security officials say that if children indirectly received assistance from public dollars paid to a parent, the children’s money can be taken, no matter how long ago any overpayment occurred. The IRS has seen plenty of excuses from people trying to get out of paying their taxes. Jackie Kucinich takes a look at the agency's own list of creative ways folks have tried to dodge tax day. (Julie Percha/The Washington Post) “While we are responsible for collecting delinquent debts owed to taxpayers, we understand the importance of ensuring that debtors are treated fairly,” Treasury’s Schramek said in a statement responding to questions from The Washington Post. He said Treasury requires that debtors be given due process. Social Security spokeswoman Clark, who declined to discuss Grice’s or any other case, even with the taxpayer’s permission, said the agency is “sensitive to concerns about our attempts to arrange repayment of overpayments.” She said that before taking any money, Social Security makes “multiple attempts to contact debtors via the U.S. Mail and by phone.” Grice, who works for the Food and Drug Administration and lives in Takoma Park, in the same apartment she’s resided in since 1984, never got any notice about a debt. Social Security officials told her they had sent their notice to her post office box in Roxboro, N.C. Grice rented that box from 1977 to 1979 and never since. And Social Security has Grice’s current address: Every year, it sends her a statement about her benefits. “Their record-keeping seems to be very spotty,” she said. Treasury officials say that before they will take someone’s refund, the agency owed the money must certify the debt, meaning there must be evidence of the overpayment. But Social Security officials told Grice they had no records explaining the debt. “The craziest part of this whole thing is the way the government seizes a child’s money to satisfy a debt that child never even knew about,” says Robert Vogel, Grice’s attorney. “They’ll say that somebody got paid for that child’s benefit, but the child had no control over the money and there’s no way to know if the parent ever used the money for the benefit of that kid.” Grice, the middle of five children, said neither of her surviving siblings — one older, one younger — has had any money taken by the government. When Grice asked why she had been selected to pay the debt, she was told it was because she had an income and her address popped up — the correct one this time. Grice found a lawyer willing to take her case without charge. Vogel is exercised about the constitutional violations he sees in the retroactive lifting of the 10-year limit on debt collection. “Can the government really bring back to life a case that was long dead?” the lawyer asked. “Can it really be right to seize a child’s money to satisfy a parent’s debt?” But many other taxpayers whose refunds have been taken say they’ve been unable to contest the confiscations because of the cost, because Social Security cannot provide records detailing the original overpayment, and because the citizens, following advice from the IRS to keep financial documents for just three years, had long since trashed their own records. In Glenarm, Ill., Brenda and Mike Samonds have spent the past year trying to figure out how to get back the 189.10 tax refund the government seized, claiming that Mike’s mother, who died 33 years ago, had been overpaid on survivor’s benefits after Mike’s father died in 1969. “It was never Mike’s money, it was his mother’s,” Brenda Samonds said. “The government took the money first and then they sent us the letter. We could never get one sentence from them explaining why the money was taken.” The government mailed its notice about the debt to the house Mike’s mother lived in 40 years ago. The Social Security spokeswoman said the agency uses a private contractor to seek current addresses and is supposed to halt collections if notices are returned as undeliverable. After hours on the phone trying and failing to get information about the debt Mike’s mother was said to owe, the Samondses gave up. After waiting on hold for two hours with Social Security last week, Ted Verbich also concluded it wasn’t worth the time or money to fight for the 172 the government intercepted last month. In 1977, Verbich, now 57, was in college at the University of Maryland when he took a full-time job in an accountant’s office. Because he was earning income, he knew he had to give up the survivor’s benefits his mother had received since his father died, when Verbich was 4. But his 70 monthly checks — “They helped with the car payment,” he said — kept coming for a short time after he started work, and Verbich was notified in 1978 that he had to repay about 600. He did. Thirty-six years later, with no notice, “they snatched my Maryland tax refund,” said Verbich, a federal worker who has lived at the same address in Glendale, Md,. for 30 years and regularly receives Social Security statements there. The feds insisted that he owed 172 but could provide no documents to back up the claim. Verbich has given up on getting his refund, but he wants a receipt stating that his debt to his country is resolved. “I’ll put in the request,” a Social Security clerk told Verbich, “but in reality, you’ll never get anything.” Grice was also told there was little point in seeking a waiver of her debt. Collections can only be halted if the person passes two tests, Clark said: The taxpayer must prove that he “is without fault, and [that] repayment of the overpayment would deprive the person of income needed for ordinary living expenses.” More than 1,200 appeals have been filed on the old cases, Clark said; taxpayers have won about 10 percent of those appeals. The Treasury initially held the full amount of Grice’s federal and state refunds, a total of 4,462. Last week, after The Washington Post inquired about Grice’s case, the government returned the portion of her refund above the 2,996 owed on her father’s account. But unless the feds can prove that she ever received any of the overpayment, Grice wants all of her money back. “Look, I love a good fight, especially for principle,” she said. “My mom used to say, �?This country is carried on the backs of the little people,’ and now I see what she meant. This is really sad.” |||||Summary:","response":"The Social Security Administration announced that it will stop attempting to collect taxpayers' debts to the government that are more than 10 years old.

Nelson A. Rockefeller sought the presidential nomination that year not long after his marriage had ended and he had wed a divorced woman, Margaretta Murphy (known as Happy), whom people had compared to Wallis Simpson. “To men and women of dogmatic morality,” the film’s narrator intones with a discernable condescension toward the ordinary, “this appears the manners of Manhattan — Babylon of the East.” A distrust of Ivy League sophistication had by then already fomented. Illuminating this is footage of an a cappella group stumping for Goldwater, singing: “Pity that Harvard poor bunch/Just think about their doom/They’ll have to leave the White House and go back to their classroom.” Watching the films, you find yourself wondering repeatedly: Whatever happened to the campaign song, or rather, whatever happened to the campaign song not merely appropriated from the Fleetwood Mac catalog. What the films offer in range, they lack in intimacy. White’s initial entry, “The Making of the President, 1960,” is considered the best in his opus (which included a fourth book on the contest between Nixon and George S. McGovern in 1972). It won the Pulitzer Prize for nonfiction in 1962, and the companion film garnered four Emmys. While the film is the trilogy’s most richly told chapter, it cannot accommodate the endless array of novelistic observations for which its source material has been celebrated. White traveled the campaign as a reporter, not as a man with a multimedia agenda. Writing of election night in 1960, for instance, White delivers Kennedy from his perch in Hyannis Port, Mass., where, we are told, the singer Morton Downey, a guest of Joseph Kennedy’s, was serving as a waiter handing out sandwiches and pastry. “Caroline, a scratch on her nose,” White offers, “was waiting to say good night to her father, and he bounced her on his knee several times, then sent her upstairs to bed and settled down to his first drink of the day, a daiquiri.” The tone of the book, though authoritative, is rendered with a kind of modesty that the language of the films refuses. The style of the Wolper films is distancing; the narration is continuous and oratorical. “This is a story of power,” the 1960 film begins, its camera scanning the buttons of the White House phones with an aura of cold war consequence. “At the end of the ganglia of wires that run from this console quivers the power of America from thermonuclear striking force to missiles in the deep,” the voice-over proceeds. The effect of the approach is noteworthy because by 1960 changes in technology — specifically in the availability of lightweight film equipment and sound synchronizing systems — allowed for a cinéma vérité style to take shape in television documentaries. In 1960 Robert Drew, a former Life magazine correspondent, along with Richard Leacock, Albert Maysles and others, made “Primary,” a documentary about the contest between Kennedy and Humphrey in Wisconsin, which originally appeared on ABC and was delivered with the sense of immediacy the new techniques provided. The “Making of the President” films must have felt already comparatively old-fashioned when they were shown. White, an odd-looking figure with a stilted speaking manner, is not necessarily a welcome visual presence in them. Still, the films offer a concise education in the intricacies of American politicking in advance of an election year in which our divisions remain so acute.

Let set for two days.","response":"Title: The Art of Using Campden Tablets in Homemade Fruit Wine: When, Why, and How Introduction Many people are venturing into the world of homemade fruit wines, and capturing the essence of seasonal fruits through fermentation is an excellent way to create delicious beverages to share with friends and family. One of the essential steps in this process is ensuring that your fruit juice is free from unwanted bacteria and wild yeast that would spoil the final product. The use of Campden tablets is a widespread practice among home winemakers to achieve this goal. In this article, we will discuss when and why you should use Campden tablets and provide a detailed guide on incorporating them into your homemade fruit wine. When and Why to Use Campden Tablets Campden tablets, named for the town of Campden in England, contain potassium or sodium metabisulfite, a useful sanitizing and preserving agent in the wine-making process. When mixed with fruit juice or water, they release a gas called sulfur dioxide (SO2), which effectively kills bacteria, mold, and wild yeast, preventing spoilage and oxidation. It also helps to stabilize the wine by enhancing flavor, color and improving its shelf life. As a winemaker, it is essential to use Campden tablets in the initial stage of making fruit wine to ensure a clean and safe environment for fermentation. You should add Campden tablets to the juice before introducing your preferred wine yeast strain. How to Use Campden Tablets in Homemade Fruit Wine Step 1: Gather the necessary equipment and ingredients Before starting the process, make sure you have all the necessary tools and ingredients at hand. You will need: - Fresh fruit juice or must (combination of crushed fruit and juice) - Campden tablets - A fermenter (such as a sanitized food-grade plastic bucket or glass carboy) - Yeast - A long-handled spoon for stirring (preferably stainless steel or food-grade plastic) Step 2: Preparing the juice To start, pour the fruit juice or must into your sanitized fermenter, ensuring there's enough room for fermentation. In the case of a full fermenter, allow for sufficient headspace (1-2 gallons) to avoid a foam-induced overflow. It is crucial to ensure that your juice is free of debris and unwanted particles while transferring it into the fermenter. Step 3: Crushing Campden tablets For a standard 5-gallon batch, you'll need one Campden tablet per gallon of juice to sanitize and stabilize the must effectively. Crush the tablets with a pestle and mortar or any improvised method, such as placing the tablets between two spoons and applying pressure. Be cautious not to inhale the dust generated during this process, as it can cause respiratory irritation. Step 4: Stirring Campden tablets into the juice Once the tablets are crushed, add the powder to the juice in your fermenter. Use your sterilized long-handled spoon to stir it in thoroughly, ensuring that the Campden tablets are well distributed and dissolved in the juice. This step is crucial to achieve an even and effective release of sulfur dioxide throughout the juice. Step 5: Let the juice set After stirring the Campden tablets into the juice, let it rest for approximately 24 to 48 hours. During this resting period, the Campden tablets' active ingredient will work by killing any wild yeasts, bacteria, and mold present in the juice, preparing it for the preferred wine yeast's addition. Step 6: Starting the fermentation After the resting period has passed, it is time to proceed with fermentation. Add your chosen wine yeast strain, following the manufacturer's instructions. Monitor the fermentation process and maintain a consistent temperature according to the yeast's specifications. Conclusion Using Campden tablets in your homemade fruit wine is a critical step to guarantee a successful outcome. A clean and sanitized must ensures that your preferred yeast strain can flourish without competition from wild yeast and bacteria and lead to a delicious, stable wine. Following these simple steps will set you on the path to becoming a skilled home winemaker, producing delightful wines that capture the essence of each fruit and season to share and enjoy for years to come."},{"question":"Is \\"French determination to regain Alsace-Lorraine and fear of another Franco-German war, along with British apprehension about the balance of power, became factors in the causes of World War I.\\" a good answer to the question \\"Following the unification of Germany, who maintained great authority in international affairs for two decades?\\"","response":"No, the given answer does not effectively address the question, \\"Following the unification of Germany, who maintained great authority in international affairs for two decades?\\" The answer provided talks about the factors and events leading up to World War I, but it does not identify any specific individual or entity that maintained great authority in international affairs.

After subtracting, we simplify the equation to a single term on each side. That simplification results in: 76v = 760. Step 4: Solve for \\"v\\". To solve for \\"v\\" in the equation 76v = 760, we divide both sides of the equation by 76. This is done to cancel out the 76 multiplying the v on the left side to leave v by itself. So we have: v = 760 / 76. Step 5: Simplify the right-hand side. Upon simplification, we have: v = 10. Thus, the solution to the given equation 96v = 83v - 63v - 760 is v = 10. Each step was necessary to isolate the variable and solve the equation correctly. By doing each step, we ensure the integrity of the mathematics and preserve the equality of the equation."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Article: When an ant dies, other ants move the dead insect out. Sometimes, the dead ant get moved away very soon--within an hour of dying. This behavior is interesting to scientists, who wonder how ants know for sure--and so soon--that another ant is dead. One scientist recently came up with a way to explain this ant behavior. Dong-Hwan Choe is a biologist. Choe found that Argentine ants have a chemical on the outside of their bodies that signals to other ants, \\"I'm dead--take me away.\\" But there's a _ to Choe's discovery. Choe says that the living ants--not just the dead ones--have this death chemical. In other words, while an ant crawls around, perhaps in a picnic or home, it's telling other ants that it's dead. What keeps ants from dragging away the living ants?Choe found that Argentine ants have two additional chemicals on their bodies, and these tell nearby ants something like, \\"Wait--I'm not dead yet.\\" So Choe's research turned up two sets of chemical signals in ants: one says, \\"I'm dead,\\" and the other set says, \\"I'm not dead yet.\\" Other scientists have tried to figure out how ants know when another ant is dead. If an ant is knocked unconscious, for example, other ants leave it alone until it wakes up. That means ants know that unmoving ants can still be alive. Choe suspects that when an Argentine ant dies, the chemical that says \\"Wait-I'm not dead yet\\" quickly goes away. Once that chemical is gone, only the one that says \\"I'm dead\\" is left. \\"It's because the dead ant no longer smells like a living ant that it gets carried to the graveyard, not because its body releases new unique chemicals after death,\\" said Choe. When other ants detect the \\"dead\\" chemical without the \\"not dead yet\\" chemical, they drag away the body. Understanding this behavior may help scientists figure out how to stop Argentine ants from invading new places and causing problems. Choe would like to find a way to use the newly discovered chemicals to spread ant killer to Argentine ant nests. The ants' removal behavior is important to the...

Please write the text above using proper case.","response":"Symptoms, Stage 2, Grade 3. Now that the text above has been written using proper case, here's a detailed response on understanding the stages and grades of a condition, particularly cancer, along with the common symptoms of cancer. Staging and grading systems are commonly used to describe the status of cancer and give insight into its progression, severity, and the best treatment options. Both play a crucial role in determining the prognosis and treatment plan for cancer patients. Understanding the difference between the two is essential. Stage: The stage of cancer describes the extent of cancerous growth within the patient's body. It indicates the size of the initial tumor, and whether it has spread to other parts of the body or nearby lymph nodes. Cancer staging typically uses the TNM system (Tumor, Nodes, Metastasis). The stages range from Stage 0 to Stage 4, progressing in severity: 1. Stage 0: Abnormal cells are found but have not yet turned into cancer. 2. Stage 1: Cancer is small and localized, with no spread to other parts of the body. 3. Stage 2: Cancer is larger than stage 1, but has not yet spread or has only begun to invade nearby tissues and organs. 4. Stage 3: The primary tumor has grown larger, and cancer has spread to the neighboring lymph nodes. 5. Stage 4: Cancer has spread to distant parts of the body, organs, and/or more lymph nodes. Grade: The grade of cancer refers to how abnormal the cancer cells look compared to normal cells. This is determined by examining tissue samples under a microscope. The grading system typically ranges from Grade 1 to Grade 3, with increasing abnormality: 1. Grade 1: Cancer cells resemble normal cells, indicating a slower growth rate and a less aggressive cancer. 2. Grade 2: Cancer cells appear moderately abnormal, usually developing and spreading at a moderate rate. 3. Grade 3: Cancer cells appear very different from normal cells, indicating a faster growth rate, with a high likelihood of invasion and spread. Symptoms: Cancer symptoms can vary depending on the type and stage of cancer. Some common cancer symptoms include: 1. Unexplained weight loss 2. Fatigue 3. Skin changes (e.g., yellowing or darkening) 4. Pain that persists or worsens 5. Changes in the skin or appearance of moles, such as size, shape, or color 6. Difficulty swallowing or persistent indigestion 7. Persistent cough or hoarseness 8. Unusual bleeding or discharge 9. Changes in bowel or bladder habits 10. Presence of lumps or thickened areas in the breasts or other body parts. It is important to consult a medical professional if you are experiencing any persistent, unusual symptoms or health concerns. Early detection, diagnosis, and intervention can significantly improve the prognosis and effectiveness of cancer treatments.

Truck city had an economy that was based on tourism, while Farm city was based on agriculture. Which city caused fewer dead zones? Hint: Marine pollution is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles. The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter. A:","response":"Based on the information provided, it is likely that Farm City caused more dead zones as compared to Truck City. Farm City's economy is based on agriculture, which generally contributes to the pollution of the ocean through the use of fertilizers, pesticides, and waste from livestock and human activities. These pollutants can reach the ocean through rivers and waterways as runoff. The agricultural chemicals and waste often contain high levels of nutrients, particularly nitrogen and phosphorus. When these nutrients enter the ocean, they fuel excessive growth of algae, known as algal blooms. As the algae decompose, oxygen levels in the water drop, leading to hypoxia or low-oxygen conditions. This creates a dead zone, where most marine life cannot survive due to the lack of oxygen. On the other hand, Truck City's economy is based on tourism. While tourism can also contribute to marine pollution in the form of marine debris and litter on beaches, the impact on oxygen levels in the water is generally less severe compared to agriculture. Marine debris and litter may harm marine life directly, such as through ingestion or entanglement, but these forms of pollution do not typically deplete oxygen levels in the water to the same extent as agricultural pollutants. Moreover, tourist-based economies are often more conscious of the environmental impacts of their activities due to their reliance on pristine and attractive coastal environments. In conclusion, Farm City is more likely to cause dead zones due to the introduction of oxygen-depleting chemicals and waste from agricultural activities. Truck City, which relies on tourism, contributes mainly to marine debris and litter, which, while harmful to marine life, does not directly cause dead zones through oxygen depletion. However, it is essential to understand that both cities can take action to minimize their respective impacts on the ocean through sustainable practices and better waste management."},{"question":"Generate a sentence about this data: Alcatraz Versus the Evil Librarians LANGUAGE English language; English language SPOKEN_IN Great Britain; Alcatraz Versus the Evil Librarians COUNTRY United States; United States ETHNIC_GROUP Native Americans in the United States","response":"Step 1: Identify the main subjects in the data provided.

Pickaway County is mainly known for its agricultural contributions, and the county seat is Circleville. 2. Piirikunta: This is a Finnish term which translates to \\"county\\" or \\"district\\" in English. In the context of Finnish geography, a piirikunta is a territorial division or an administrative region within the country. So, the phrase \\"Pickawayn piirikunta\\" is mixing English and Finnish words and could be understood as \\"Pickaway County\\" or \\"Pickaway District.\\" However, it is essential to note that combining two different languages in one phrase like this is not a standard or conventional practice.

Question 2: How much water do I need to drink to dilute a urine analysis? Pick your answer from: (1). no (2). yes Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","response":"Question 1: Employee Screening: When you drink water excessively, is your first urination diluted? Excessive water intake could lead to a condition called water intoxication or hyponatremia, which is characterized by a low concentration of salt in the blood due to the dilution of electrolytes. When you drink a large volume of water in a short amount of time, your kidneys work to remove the excess water from your body. Consequently, the urine produced will have a lower concentration of solutes, leading to more diluted urine. So, the answer to question 1 would be (2). Yes, when you drink water excessively, your first urination can be diluted. Question 2: How much water do I need to drink to dilute a urine analysis? Diluting urine for the purpose of a urine analysis is generally not recommended or encouraged. However, I will provide some information on hydration and how it can affect urine concentration. In general, the amount of water needed to dilute urine would be determined by factors such as individual metabolism, body mass, level of physical activity, and environmental conditions like temperature and humidity. The Institute of Medicine recommends a daily water intake of approximately 3.7 liters (about 13 cups) for adult men and 2.7 liters (about 9 cups) for adult women. This includes water from all sources, including beverages and food. These guidelines are very general, and individual water needs may vary. To maintain proper hydration, paying attention to thirst cues and monitoring urine color can be useful indicators. Ideally, urine should be a pale straw color, indicating optimal hydration. Very dark yellow or amber-colored urine may indicate dehydration, while nearly colorless urine is a sign of overhydration. To dilute urine more than usual, you would have to drink significantly more water. It is worth noting that excessive water intake can cause health issues, and it's important to not exceed the limits of your body. In summary, the questions are not asking the same thing. Question 1 focuses on whether excessive water consumption will result in diluted urine, while Question 2 asks about the specific amount of water that would be necessary to affect a urine analysis deliberately. Therefore, although related, these questions target different aspects of the topic, and they cannot be answered with a simple (1) or (2)."},{"question":"Please capitalize where necessary: in this context, it is difficult to determine what happened and will happen and how it will look in a few or several years .","response":"In this context, it is difficult to determine what happened and will happen, and how it will look in a few or several years."},{"question":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

We can add them together to create a single term with \\"p\\": (24 + 212) * p - 4833 = 2011 236 * p - 4833 = 2011 Step 2: Isolate p by adding 4833 to both sides of the equation. Add 4833 to both sides to get rid of the constant term on the left side: 236 * p - 4833 + 4833 = 2011 + 4833 236 * p = 6844 Step 3: Solve for p by dividing both sides by 236. Now that the only term with p is isolated on the left side, we can solve for p by dividing both sides by 236: 236 * p / 236 = 6844 / 236 p = 29 So, the solution for p in the given equation 24*p + 212*p - 4833 = 2011 is p = 29."},{"question":"Given the question: Generate a question that has the following answer: Money. for the following movie plot: When occultist uncle Dr. Plato Zorba wills a huge ramshackle house to his nephew Cyrus and his impoverished family, they are shocked to find the house is haunted.

It’s set in Taranto, Puglia, on Italy’s southern heel and involves my daughter’s great-great-grandmother. The best known version is told by my husband Marco’s uncle, Riccardo, who remembers it being told to him by his elderly Nonna Anna herself. Anna Michela Comasia Maria Calianno. Her long name was a sign of her family’s noble status. She was born in Taranto, Puglia, in 1889, into a wealthy, well-educated Tarantine family of physicians, surgeons and landowners. One day, by chance, young Anna answered the door instead of the butler. There was Nicola Cardellicchio, the postman. He came from a poor family of bricklayers and wool spinners, raised by a single mother. “He was no adonis,” noted Nonna Anna. Nicola was rather short and stocky, but she liked him immediately. She continued answering the door whenever the postman passed. When Anna’s mother, Girolama, noticed her daughter’s growing interest in the postman, she forbid her to see him again, threatening to disown her. So Anna did what any lovesick girl would do: she ran away, eloping with Nicola. The couple had nine children in Taranto — Mario, Marco’s grandfather was born in the middle of the First World War — but times were very hard, and they moved north to Torino to look for work. Nonna Anna was perhaps not an instinctive cook. I wondered whether she ever had the possibility to learn how to cook. Her grandchildren, Angela (my mother in law) and Riccardo, remember her only ever making lesso (boiled meat) and these polpette, which became variously known in the family as “sugo di nonna Anna” and, oddly, “amatriciana” (which is actually a different recipe, a chilli-spiked sauce of fried guanciale and tomato to coat pasta). But these polpette – plump meat balls, cooked slowly in tomato sauce, a very traditional dish from Puglia – were passed down to Anna’s daughter in law, Angela’s Tuscan mother, Lina, who made them so often for her own family that she in turn taught her daughter in law,... According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: Why did Anna continue answering the door? Options: - not enough information - Because Girolama threatened to disown her - Because she married Nicola - Because she liked Nicola The answer to this question is:","response":"Because she liked Nicola"},{"question":"The answer to the question: What is the last name of the author that said the single that placed at number two on MTV News' list of The Best Songs of 2008 is \\"arguably the first song overtly marketed toward urban bachelorette parties\\"? is inside the article: Rolling Stone named \\"Single Ladies\\" the best song of 2008, and wrote, \\"The beat ... is irresistible and exuberant, the vocal hook is stormy and virtuosic.\\" \\"Single Ladies\\" ranked as the second-best song of the 2000s decade in the magazine's 2009 readers' poll, and Rolling Stone critics placed it at number 50 on the list of the 100 Best Songs of the Decade. \\"Single Ladies\\" was placed at number two on MTV News' list of The Best Songs of 2008; James Montgomery called it \\"hyperactive and supercharged in ways I never thought possible.

He wrote the lyrics to the standards \\"Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?\\" Harburg, the youngest of four surviving children (out of ten), was born Isidore Hochberg on the Lower East Side of New York City on April 8, 1896. His parents, Lewis Hochberg and Mary Ricing, were Yiddish-speaking Orthodox Jews who had emigrated from Russia. He later adopted the name Edgar Harburg, and came to be best known as Edgar \\"Yip\\" Harburg. He attended Townsend Harris High School, where he and Ira Gershwin, who met over a shared fondness for Gilbert and Sullivan, worked on the school paper and became lifelong friends. According to his son Ernie Harburg, Gilbert and Irish dramatist George Bernard Shaw taught his father, a \\"democratic socialist, [and] sworn challenger of all tyranny against the people, that 'humor is an act of courage' and dissent\\". After World War I, Harburg returned to New York and graduated from City College (later part of the City University of New York), which Ira Gershwin had initially attended with him, in 1921. After Harburg married and had two children, he started writing light verse for local newspapers. He became a co-owner of Consolidated Electrical Appliance Company, but the company went bankrupt following the crash of 1929, leaving Harburg \\"anywhere from 50,000 - 70,000 in debt,\\" which he insisted on paying back over the course of the next few decades. At this point, Harburg and Ira Gershwin agreed that Harburg should start writing song lyrics. Gershwin introduced Harburg to Jay Gorney, who collaborated with him on songs for an Earl Carroll Broadway review (Earl Carroll's Sketchbook): the show was successful and Harburg was engaged as lyricist for a series of successful revues, including Americana in 1932, for which he wrote the lyrics of \\"Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?\\" to the tune of a lullaby Gorney had learned as a child in Russia. This song swept the nation, becoming an anthem of the Great Depression. Harburg was a staunch critic of religion and an atheist. He wrote a poem entitled \\"Atheist\\" that summarized his views on god and religion. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Was there anything else interesting in the article?","response":"Yes, there was another interesting aspect mentioned in the article related to Harburg's personal views. Harburg was a staunch critic of religion and an atheist, which was reflected in a poem he wrote entitled \\"Atheist.\\" This poem summarized his views on god and religion.

This was the scene in Zhuzhou,Hunan Province on May 17.Nine people were killed and 16 injured. Things were similar last year in the Sichuan earthquake. Thousands of people were buried in the ruins and lost their lives. What if we could have warned them? People are always _ to find a way of preventing buildings' collapse. Better materials and technology help,but they are not a solution. Just like humans,a building has its own life cycle from \\"birth\\" to \\"death\\".If we know when a building is going to collapse,we can repair it in advance or get out of it before it falls. Now,scientists at the University of Illinois have developed a material that turns red before it breaks. The invention could be used in things like climbing ropes or bridge supports. The research was led by Nancy Sottos,a professor at the university's Beckman Institute,and Douglas Davis,a graduate research assistant. The secret behind the colorchanging material is a type of molecule .A molecule is a group of atoms held together by chemical bonds. Imagine you and your friends standing in a circle,holding hands. Each person stands for one atom,your hands represent the bonds,and the entire circle represents a molecule. If one person lets go of his or her hands,the molecule changes color. The research team put the molecule into a soft material. When the researchers stretched the material,it turned bright red for a few seconds before it broke into two pieces. When they repeatedly stretched and relaxed the material,without breaking it,it only turned a little red. The major problem is that light can get rid of the red color. When the team shone bright light on the molecule,the broken bond was fixed,and the color disappeared. If the bright light keeps the red color from appearing,the material's warning system will be useless. Scientists still have a lot of work to do before the colorchanging molecules can be used outside the lab. Question: What can we infer from the passage? Options: A: The colorchanging molecules are certain to be used outside the lab. B: There will be no collapse with the help of the colorchanging material. C: There is a long way to go before the material can be applied. D: The problem caused by bright light will be solved by scientists.

It's important to maintain the salmon's quality, texture, and taste while preserving its safety. There are several methods to choose from, but here we'll discuss the top three — refrigeration, cold water, and microwave — and provide a detailed explanation of each method. 1. Refrigeration (Recommended Method): Thawing salmon in the refrigerator is the best and safest method, as it maintains a consistent temperature and minimizes the risk of bacterial growth that can happen at room temperature. a. Place the frozen salmon in a leak-proof container or on a plate to catch any juices. This prevents cross-contamination with other foods in the fridge. b. Put the container or plate on the bottom shelf of the refrigerator to avoid any drips onto other items below. c. Allow adequate time for thawing. For every 1 pound (0.5 kg) of salmon, it takes approximately 12-24 hours of total thawing time in the fridge. For example, if you have a 2-pound (1 kg) salmon fillet, plan for 24-48 hours of thawing time. d. Check the salmon periodically to see if it has thawed completely by gently pressing it with your fingertip. Once thawed, it should yield to the touch. e. Cook the salmon within 24 hours of thawing for the best taste, texture, and safety. f. It's not recommended to refreeze thawed salmon, as the texture and taste can become compromised. If you absolutely must refreeze it, cook it first, then freeze the cooked fish. 2. Cold Water Thawing (Quick Method): This method is useful when you need to thaw salmon faster than it takes in the refrigerator. a. Place the frozen salmon in a sealed, leak-proof plastic bag to prevent water from entering and contaminating the fish. Double-bagging is recommended for added protection. b. Fill a large bowl or sink with cold tap water. Ensure the water temperature remains cold to lessen the risk of harmful bacteria growth. The water should be approximately 40°F (4°C) or below. c. Immerse the sealed plastic bag containing the salmon fully into the water. d. Change the water every 30 minutes to maintain a cold temperature and promote even thawing. e. For every 1 pound (0.5 kg) of salmon, allow about 1 hour of thawing time using the cold water method. Therefore, a 2-pound (1 kg) salmon fillet would take roughly 2 hours to thaw. f. Cook the salmon immediately after thawing, as harmful bacteria can start to grow rapidly once it reaches a certain temperature. g. Avoid refreezing thawed salmon to prevent loss of quality, texture, and taste. 3. Microwave Thawing (Emergency Method): This method should only be used as a last resort, as it can cause uneven thawing and partially cook the salmon in certain areas. a. Remove the salmon from any packaging and place it on a microwave-safe plate. b. Use your microwave's defrost function, which usually has a lower wattage setting specifically designed for thawing foods. Check the manufacturer's recommendations for defrosting instructions. c. Thaw the salmon for a few minutes at a time, checking the progress frequently. Rotate or rearrange the fish as needed for even defrosting. d. Do not let the salmon begin to cook in the microwave. If any portions start to cook or become warm, remove them and continue thawing the remainder. e. Cook the thawed salmon immediately, as the microwave can cause uneven temperature distribution, which can lead to bacterial growth. f. Refreezing thawed salmon after microwave defrosting is not recommended due to the potential damage to texture, taste, and quality. In summary, the best way to thaw frozen salmon is by using the refrigeration method, followed by cold water thawing in case you need a quicker solution. Microwave thawing is the least preferred method but can be used in emergencies. Remember to prioritize food safety during the thawing process to avoid any potential health risks."},{"question":"What key details about waleed al hayam can be extracted from the following bio?

But it has been a case of the calm before the storm today with much of the country basking in the warm conditions and clear skies - and some stunning sunsets across parts of the South. The spectacular summery weather is set to come to a dramatic end, however, with forecasters predicting that dismal conditions will settle in over the next few days. Scroll down for video. Calm before the storm: Two men enjoy what could be the last of the glorious Indian Summer weather as they take a row on the River Cam in Cambridge this morning. Forecasters have predicted dismal conditions over the next few days, but much of Britain has been enjoying the glorious weather that typified much of September. This stunning scene was captured across Aylesbury Vale in Buckinghamshire last night, but the sun is also setting on the glorious weather with up to 60mm of rain falling in a matter of hours in some parts. Sunlight bursts through the mist over Corfe Castle in Dorset. Despite the settled weather in the last few dayts, the The Met Office has said that downpours over the next few days could lead to surface water flooding. Up to 60mm of rain could fall in a matter of hours while severe gales of up to 70mph are set to batter parts of the north with temperatures plunging by 10C. The grim forecast comes days after early figures indicated last month is set to be the driest September across the UK since records began in 1910. It is also likely to finish in the top five warmest Septembers. The Met Office warned severe gales with gusts of up to 70mph were possible in north-west Scotland in a yellow 'be aware' alert. The sun sets over Aylesbury Vale in Buckinghamshire in a picture taken from Dunstable Downs. Severe weather warnings of rain are in place for parts of the north and west of Britain today and tomorrow. Picturesque: This autumnal scene was captured at Sycamore Gap along Hadrian's Wall last night. The grim forecast comes days after early figures indicated last month is set to be the driest September across the UK since records began in 1910. With the sun shinging and beneath clear blue skies, a man enjoys the fine weather as he walks his dog along the beach in Hastings, East Sussex. Despite the dire weather forecast, these four girls found it warm enough today to paddle in the sea at the beach in Hastings, East Sussex. Fine day for a walk: The surface of the water sparkles in the October sun today as a man walks his dog along the shore at Hastings. The Chief Forecaster's assessment said: 'Although such wind speeds are not unusual across these areas of Scotland, the contrast with the recent quiet weather means that a few minor impacts may occur.' A yellow warning for rain was also issued with 'heavy and persistent' downpours predicted in parts of southern Scotland, Northern Ireland, northern England and Wales from Friday afternoon until Saturday morning. Forecasters said between 20mm (0.8in) and 40mm (1.6in) could fall 'quite widely' across the warning area, while some places could see more than 60mm (2.4in) with much of the rain falling within a few hours. Making a splash: A 'super-pod' of more than a thousand dolphins was spotted off the coast of pembrokeshire - as they swim further inland to feed and raise their young. Experts at The Sea Trust counted the mass off the Pembrokeshire coast in the Bristol Channel. They say the pod is at least a thousand strong but admit it could be an under-estimate as they are impossible to keep track of. Sailing volunteers on the boat 'Cartlett Lady' were surrounded for nearly three hours by 'wall to wall' dolphins as they surveyed a 35 mile stretch. The Met Office said the downpours could lead to surface water flooding, saying: 'The public should be aware of the potential for some localised impacts to travel due to surface water flooding.' It said the high pressure which settled over Britain and protected it from Atlantic depressions in September is in the process of moving - and making room for conditions more in keeping with October. Drivers are being warned of the risk of flash flooding. A man heads out early to the banks o the River Cam in Cambridgeshire for some fishing. Rain is set to sweep in over the South and East of England tomorrow morning. A team of rowers head out for an early morning row on the River Cam while a thin blanket of mist covers the trees in the back ground. The calm scenes are set to come to an end when an Atlantic front moves in across Britain. Enjoy it while it lasts: Temperatures across Britain have remained above average for the beginning of October - but the mercury could plummet by 10C in some parts with the glorious conditions expected to come to an end tomorrow. Forecasters say the high pressure that settled over Britain for much of September is finally moving away and wetter and cooler conditions are set to return. Temperatures could take a plunge in the next few days with forecasters predicting a return to conditions more in keeping with average October weather. University rowers take a breather during an early morning practice session on the River Cam. The scene is a sharp contrast to the weather predicted over the next few days.

The sun shines through the trees along the banks of the River Cam as two women enjoy a morning row. Wet weather is set to sweep in from tonight. Darron Burness, head of the AA's flood rescue team, said: 'It's a case of \\"change of month, change of weather\\". 'After precious little rain in September, autumn will fall sharply into focus tomorrow as it turns wet and windy across many areas.

'Be wary of places where water may accumulate; for instance, dips in the road and under bridges. 'In dark, wet conditions, it can be extremely difficult to distinguish between a road that's flooded and one that is simply very wet until it's too late. 'Tomorrow evening's rush hour could be particularly affected, so allow a bit more time if you're heading away for the weekend, and check your car's lights and wiper blades.'","response":"Recently, Britain had very dry and warm weather, but this weekend, some places will get lots of rain and strong winds.

Article: Imagine a house that keeps itself warm in the wintertime. Think of the savings in terms of fuel bills and unfriendly emissions. Such houses in fact exist, called \\"passive houses\\". The concept of these highly energy-efficient buildings took root in the 1990s, before slowly consolidating as a niche construction concept in the 2000s. Are passive houses now actively moving into the mainstream as sustainable buildings? For Brian McGarry, an economics lecturer who built a family house based on passive housing criteria in the Pyrenees this year, the arguments look convincing. As his first full winter in the low energy house draws in, we asked him to keep us informed. Do passive houses work? I had never heard of a passive house in February 2012, when I purchased a plot of land. Nor did I expect that I would be persuaded to build a pre-constructed, custom-designed house based on energy-efficient passive house criteria. It promised to be easier and quicker to build, cheaper to run, and more comfortable to live in. The objective was to incorporate the fundamental concepts of passive energy management into my project: an airtight and highly insulated building envelope; large southfacing double or triple-glazed windows (if possible, filled with argon gas) that passively capture the energy of the sun; a heat recovery ventilation system to provide fresh air; and a simple, low-cost heating system consisting of a modern wood-burning stove, a bathroom heater and a portable radiator backup for when the sun doesn't shine and temperatures decline. No significant limitations were placed on the design, and it had excellent environmental credentials. Moreover, the cost was no more than a conventional build.

Because of this, Los Angeles is able to power many of its buildings and factories using renewable resources. Las Vegas, however, receives barely any sunlight or wind throughout the entire year. As a result, they use little renewable resources and instead power most of the city through non-renewable resources like fossil fuels. Which city, Los Angeles or Las Vegas, emits less greenhouse gases? A:","response":"A: Los Angeles emits less greenhouse gases compared to Las Vegas due to its higher reliance on renewable energy sources. As stated, Los Angeles receives a steady supply of sunlight and wind throughout the year, enabling the city to generate a significant amount of renewable energy to power its buildings and factories. This reduces the dependency on non-renewable resources like fossil fuels, which are major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. On the other hand, Las Vegas lacks sufficient sunlight and wind, leading to a higher dependence on non-renewable energy sources. As a result, the city emits more greenhouse gases than Los Angeles, considering the carbon footprint associated with the burning of fossil fuels. It is worth noting that the total greenhouse gas emissions for a city may also vary based on factors like population, industry, and transportation habits, but due to the fundamental differences in energy sources, Los Angeles would generally emit less greenhouse gases thanks to its reliance on renewable resources."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What has already been acquired by Trafford Council for £12 million? from the following article ? Along with the rest of Trafford, Stretford maintains a selective education system assessed by the 11-plus examination. The proportion of pupils leaving Stretford Grammar School with five or more GCSEs at grades A*–C in 2006, was 98.3%, compared to an average of 66.7% for all secondary schools in Trafford and a national UK average of 61.3%. The proportion of students from minority ethnic backgrounds, and for whom English is an additional language, is much higher than the average. Stretford Grammar was awarded specialist Science College status in September 2005. The school was assessed as \\"good\\" in its April 2015 Ofsted report.Stretford High School Community Languages College, like Stretford Grammar, has a much higher proportion than the national average of pupils with a first language other than English, many of them being either asylum seekers or refugees. In 2004 Stretford High School was made subject to special measures, as it was considered not to be providing an adequate education for its pupils. Substantial improvement has taken place since then; the school was assessed as \\"satisfactory\\" in its November 2005 Ofsted report and was removed from special measures. Further improvements saw Stretford High School gain an \\"outstanding\\" assessment from Ofsted, following its February 2008 inspection. GCSE results also placed the school in the top 1% of schools in the country for adding value to its students.Stretford also has the specialist Arts College, Lostock College.

Michele Bachmann was in her element at the CNN/Tea Party Republican Debate. With her campaign flagging, the founder of the Tea Party Caucus in Congress delivered a surprise body blow to the GOP front-runner, Texas Gov. Rick Perry. Challenging Perry on his 2007 executive order that required Texas schoolgirls to receive vaccinations against the sexually transmitted HPV virus, Bachmann suggested the governor acted for purely political reasons. \\"I just wanted to add that we cannot forget that in the midst of this executive order there is a big drug company that made millions of dollars because of this mandate.

It was a conflict between Argentina and the United Kingdom over the Falkland Islands, South Georgia, and South Sandwich Islands. These territories are located in the South Atlantic, and at the time, they were under British administration. The conflict began on April 2, 1982, when Argentine forces invaded and occupied the Falkland Islands in an attempt to establish Argentine sovereignty over the territories, claiming historical ownership. The following day, Argentina also invaded South Georgia. In response, the United Kingdom, under the leadership of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, assembled a naval task force and dispatched it to the South Atlantic to recapture the islands. The Falklands War lasted for 74 days and included various military engagements encompassing air, naval, and ground forces. On April 25, 1982, British forces recaptured the South Georgia Islands, and by May 21, they had successfully landed on the Falkland Islands, notably at San Carlos Water on East Falkland. The war witnessed a series of individual battles, such as the Battle of Goose Green, the Battle of Mount Longdon, and the Battle of Mount Tumbledown. British forces succeeded in breaking the Argentine occupation, which subsequently led to the liberation of the Falkland Islands' capital, Stanley, on June 14, 1982. Argentina formally surrendered, marking the end of the Falklands War. The conflict resulted in the deaths of 649 Argentine military personnel, 255 British military personnel, and three Falkland Islanders. The Falklands War had significant political consequences. In Argentina, the military dictatorship led by General Leopoldo Galtieri faced a wave of internal unrest and saw its regime weakened, ultimately leading to a change in government and a return to democracy in 1983. In the United Kingdom, the Thatcher government's response to the conflict earned it considerable popularity, which contributed to the Conservative Party's victory in the 1983 general election. Since the war, the United Kingdom has maintained a sizable military presence on the Falkland Islands to deter any potential attempts to regain control. Although diplomatic relations between Argentina and the UK have improved throughout the years, the issue of sovereignty over the Falkland Islands continues to remain a contentious matter between both countries."},{"question":"Write the next sentence.
