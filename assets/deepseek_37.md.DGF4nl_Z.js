Which layer of the Earth is believed to be formed of molten iron and nickel?","response":"The layer of the Earth believed to be primarily composed of molten iron and nickel is the outer core. Earth's structure comprises five main layers, which include (starting from the outermost) the crust, the upper mantle, the lower mantle, the outer core, and the inner core. Each of these layers has distinct properties and compositions. The outer core, positioned between the lower mantle and the inner core, is a fluid layer with an estimated thickness of approximately 2,200 kilometers (1,367 miles). It is thought to be a dense, viscous fluid primarily composed of molten iron (Fe) and nickel (Ni), along with smaller proportions of other elements such as sulfur (S), oxygen (O), and silicon (Si). Additionally, the outer core is believed to have a temperature range of 4,000 to 6,000 degrees Celsius (7,200 to 10,800 degrees Fahrenheit), which is hot enough to keep the iron and nickel in a molten, liquid state. The outer core plays a significant role in the Earth's geophysics, most notably in the generation of Earth's magnetic field. This magnetic field is created through a process called the dynamo effect, which is driven by the movement of the molten iron and nickel within the outer core. As the Earth rotates, the fluid motions of this layer combined with Earth's rotation cause electric currents to flow. These currents generate magnetic fields, which eventually combine to create the overall geomagnetic field that surrounds and protects the Earth from solar radiation and harmful particles. Due to the outer core's fluid nature, it allows the rigid inner core to rotate at a slightly different speed than the rest of the planet. While the exact reason for this differential rotation is not yet fully understood, it is believed to be a consequence of the complex dynamics between the Earth's various layers. The information about Earth's layers, including the outer core, has been gathered through a combination of direct and indirect methodologies. Seismic studies, such as measuring the speed and direction of seismic waves generated during earthquakes, have provided key insights into the nature of the Earth's interior. Additionally, laboratory experiments and computer simulations are performed to mimic and study the high-pressure and high-temperature conditions that exist at these depths. Though it is impossible to directly access the outer core, the data and knowledge gathered through these methods have shaped our understanding of this intriguing layer composed mainly of molten iron and nickel."},{"question":"Q:Question: As the counterweight began to rise the elevator began to what into the mine? Choices: - park - reduce - descend - fall - set The rationale to choose \\"descend\\" as the answer is that: A:","response":"The rationale to choose \\"descend\\" as the answer is that the counterweight and the elevator are connected in such a way that when the counterweight rises, it pulls the elevator in the opposite direction. In the context of a mine, this opposite direction would be downwards, towards the bottom of the mine.

Translate to Romanian Romanian:","response":"Cu aceste raiduri, grupurile au fost perturbate înainte ca actele teroriste să poată fi realizate, dar urmăririle penale nu au urmat întotdeauna arestările. În această situație, autoritățile au reușit să prevină atentatele teroriste prin intermediul unor raiduri bine planificate și coordonate, însă procesele judiciare ulterioare nu au fost întotdeauna pe măsura succesului inițial în prevenirea atacurilor. Aceasta s-a datorat în mare parte unor inexactități juridice și a dificultăților de a stabili probe solide împotriva suspecților arestați. În primul rând, probatoriul adus de procurori împotriva suspecților arestați nu a fost întotdeauna solid și convingător. Acest lucru s-a datorat în special complexității și secretului care înconjoară acțiunile teroriste în general și a incapacității investigatoarelor de a obține informații sau probe concrete despre planurile teroriste în curs de dezvoltare. În astfel de cazuri, judecătorii au fost adesea reticenți în a condamna persoanele acuzate doar pe baza unor informații și declarații ambigue și/sau a unor dovezi insuficiente. În al doilea rând, imaturitatea sau lipsa de pregătire a unor procurori și judecători în domeniul securității naționale și al combaterii terorismului a fost de asemenea un factor care a contribuit la neînceperea rapidă și eficientă a urmăririlor penale în astfel de cazuri. Aceasta a dus la situații în care procesele au stagnat sau au fost amânate în mod repetat, lăsând loc apariției unor îndoieli legitime referitoare la vinovăția suspecților arestați. În al treilea rând, legislația națională în materie de terorism s-a dovedit a fi insuficientă sau inadecvată în unele cazuri, îngreunând astfel eforturile procurorilor de a construi cazuri judiciare solide. De exemplu, în unele țări, legislația privind terorismul se poate concentra în mod disproportionat asupra aspectelor legate de finanțarea terorismului sau de recrutarea de noi membri, lăsând în același timp lacune semnificative în ceea ce privește urmărirea penală a persoanelor implicate în planificarea sau pregătirea efectivă a unor atentate. În concluzie, succesul limitat al urmăririlor penale în cazurile de terorism după arestări reușite poate fi atribuit dificultăților de a stabili probe solide, precum și unor deficiențe sistemice și legislative. Pentru a elimina astfel de obstacole și a asigura un proces echitabil și eficient în cazurile de terorism, este necesară o abordare mult mai coordonată și bine gândită la nivel național și internațional.

Generate a detailed description of this data","response":"The data provided is related to the plant family Poaceae, their classification within the biological taxonomy, and a specific reference to Ardmore Airport in New Zealand. It also includes information about the surface type of this airport's second runway. Let's analyze the data and provide a detailed description. 1. Poaceae: Poaceae, also commonly known as the grass family, is a large and diverse group of flowering plants found all around the world. There are roughly 12,000 species within this family, and they are characterized by their thin leaves, lack of petals, and wind-pollinated flowers. Grasses are extremely important for both ecosystems and human civilization, as they serve as a primary food source for various animal species and humans. Additionally, they are widely used for agricultural purposes, particularly for cereal crops (e.g., wheat, rice, and corn) and pasture land. 2. Division: In the biological classification of organisms, the term 'division' is used for the ranking above the class level and below the kingdom level, mainly in the context of plants. The given data suggests that Poaceae belongs to a particular division of the flowering plants. 3. Flowering plant: The Poaceae family belongs to the group of flowering plants, also scientifically known as Angiosperms. These plants are unique because they produce flowers as reproductive structures and bear seeds enclosed in fruits. Flowering plants are by far the most diverse and ecologically successful group of plants on Earth, accounting for over 90% of all plant species. 4. Ardmore Airport (New Zealand): Ardmore Airport is a well-known airport located in Auckland, New Zealand. The airport mainly serves general aviation, training flights, and private aircraft. It has two runways, and the data provided gives information specifically about the surface type of its second runway. 5. 2ndRunwaySurfaceType: The second runway surface type refers to the type of material used for constructing the runway. In this case, the type is Poaceae, indicating a grass surface. Grass runways are relatively common for smaller airports, like Ardmore Airport, where large commercial aircraft are not usually present. These runways are generally less expensive to build and maintain than paved ones; however, they may be affected by weather conditions, as they may become soft and muddy during heavy rainfall. 6. Order: In biological classification, the 'order' is a taxonomic rank between the class and family levels. The given information states that the Poaceae family belongs to the order 'Poales.' To summarize, this data provides information about the Poaceae family, the order Poales, and its classification within the division of flowering plants. It also presents specific details about Ardmore Airport in New Zealand, highlighting the grass surface type (Poaceae) of the airport's second runway."},{"question":"Premise: \\"The per child credit will be broadly distributed--though not to the poor (who pay no taxes, so can't use the credit).\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"The per-child credit is the most useful at lower income levels, though not at the bottom of the poverty scale, where it is not usable.\\"?","response":"Okay, imagine you have a big jar of cookies.

Now that's a great deal! Tip: Arrive to your movie at least 30-40 minutes prior to the show. This is so you can have a choice in seating. There are comfy la-z-boy type seats with sliding table tops (large lecture hall style desks) and then there are office chairs placed way too close together over a long table top (diner style counter top).

Make use of the sentences in the paragraph to provide a corresponding output supporting the claim. 3) The explanation should be at least one and at most twelve sentences long. Problem:Paragraph: The story nicely calls out different questions that readers might have, including whether insurance will pay for the therapy. It answers, “Many will not. Charges for patients can range from 10 to 75 per session, says Edo Zylstra, CEO of KinetaCore, a company that offers intensive three-day weekend courses in dry needling to physical therapists.” This was a tough call, since the story includes a general discussion of the benefits. But what it doesn’t do is report on any quantified benefits, such as how much pain relief people report in the studies, or for how long. It does tell us that the evidence shows the technique “may be useful” and points out other findings, such as the evidence overall shows “mixed results.” We like that the story called out risks specifically, which is something we don’t see often. It says, “Needling can produce minor bleeding and some soreness, but in trained hands, and with the use of sterile needles and gloves, “it’s a very safe procedure,” Briggs says. In rare cases, deep needling can lead to a punctured lung or injuries to nerves and blood vessels, and acupuncturists fear non-specialists will be more likely to make such mistakes, Burgoon says.” The story would have been stronger if it had quoted a source with no vested interest in discussing risks. Also, it’s worth pointing out that these risks are real whether “trained hands” do the procedure or not. The section “What do published studies say?” includes a look at findings from a review and a meta-analysis, and lets us know the findings of these efforts are mixed. From early in the story, there are statements about the lack of evidence supporting this therapy and the need for more research. There is no disease mongering in this piece. The story should be commended for its extensive sourcing. There are many sources packed into this piece and likely more sources who were interviewed and not quoted given the amount of reporting that clearly went into it. At the same time, most of the sources have a potential conflict of interest in some way: All of these potential conflicts are called out in the piece, which is commendable. The one person who brings a fairly down-the-middle view is Matt Briggs, a physical therapist who is studying the technique to see whether it works. But our question about him is whether he also is a practitioner of the technique. We would have liked to have seen more exploration of alternatives — or shall we say the standard of care — for injuries like the one described in the lead, runner’s knee. We’re not given a strong idea of what the evidence says is generally the right path to choose for practitioners and patients. We know the toolkit for pain is quite shallow, but physical therapy, diet, exercise, carefully targeted medication, and, at times, surgical interventions all have long track records. We would have liked to have seen more weight given to the proven techniques along the way. The story essentially lets people know that this is something that is becoming more popular but that not very many physical therapists are trained in it yet. The story establishes what’s new and why it’s being written about with this statement: “And there, Briggs says, is where dry needling is lacking. While some studies have shown promise, he says, “the quality of the evidence is not strong.” That’s why Briggs and his colleagues are starting a study looking at dry needling in “runner’s knee,” the condition that has plagued Pierce. Their goal, and the goal of other researchers now looking at dry needling, is to produce results rigorous enough to show whether it really works.” The story does not rely on a news release. Claim: Dry needling' for pain therapy is under scrutiny Solution:","response":"The paragraph provides various points to support the claim that dry needling for pain therapy is under scrutiny. First, the paragraph mentions that the technique's benefits have not been adequately quantified, such as how much pain relief people report and for how long. Furthermore, while there is some evidence that it may be useful, the overall findings show \\"mixed results.\\" The story also highlights the risks involved, such as minor bleeding, soreness, and in rare cases, deep needling that can lead to punctured lungs or injuries to nerves and blood vessels. The paragraph also states that the technique is currently lacking strong evidence and that more research, such as a study on runner's knee, is needed to determine its effectiveness. Additionally, the story emphasizes the need for better exploration of alternatives or standard care options, comparing dry needling to proven techniques like physical therapy, diet, exercise, carefully targeted medication, and surgical interventions at times."},{"question":"Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Eutherians are the most widespread of the mammals, occurring throughout the world. There are several groups of eutherians, including Insectivora, the insect eaters; Edentata, the toothless anteaters; Rodentia, the rodents; Chiroptera, the bats; Cetacea, the aquatic mammals including whales; Carnivora, carnivorous mammals including dogs, cats, and bears; and Primates, which includes humans. Eutherian mammals are sometimes called placental mammals, because all species have a complex placenta that connects a fetus to the mother, allowing for gas, fluid, waste, and nutrient exchange. While other mammals may possess a less complex placenta or briefly have a placenta, all eutherians have a complex placenta during gestation. Primates Order Primates of class Mammalia includes lemurs, tarsiers, monkeys, and the apes, which include humans. Non-human primates live primarily in tropical or subtropical regions of South America, Africa, and Asia. They range in size from the mouse lemur at 30 grams (1 ounce) to the mountain gorilla at 200 kilograms (441 pounds). The characteristics and evolution of primates are of particular interest to us as they allow us to understand the evolution of our own species. All primate species have adaptations for climbing trees, as they all descended from tree-dwellers, although not all species are arboreal. This arboreal heritage of primates resulted in hands and feet that are adapted for brachiation, or climbing and swinging through trees.

Traditionally, it is applied using a brush or wand applicator that has a tube filled with the product. Mascara comes in various colors, although the most common ones are black, brown, or blue. The purpose of mascara is to emphasize the eyes and make them appear more striking, as well as to accentuate their shape and size. There are different types of mascara available in the market, with varying formulas and purposes. These may include: 1. Volumizing mascara: This type of mascara contains ingredients that help to build up volume to each eyelash, making them appear thicker and more pronounced. It works by thickening the base of the eyelashes for a more dramatic look. 2. Lengthening mascara: Lengthening mascaras are designed to elongate and separate each eyelash, making the lashes appear longer and more defined. These mascaras often contain special fibers that attach to the tip of the natural lashes, creating an extended effect. 3. Curling mascara: Curling mascara works by lifting and curling the natural lashes, giving the eyes a more open and awake appearance. Many of these mascaras contain a polymer formula that shapes and holds the eyelashes in a curl, while others rely on specially designed brushes to provide the curling effect. 4. Waterproof mascara: Waterproof mascara is specially formulated to resist moisture, ensuring that the product stays in place even in contact with water. This makes it an ideal choice for those who live in humid climates or participate in activities where their eyes may come into contact with water, such as swimming or exercising. 5. Tubing mascara: This type of mascara creates a tube-like layer around each individual eyelash, providing volume and length without smudging or flaking. Tubing mascaras are typically water-resistant and can be removed easily without the use of makeup remover, making them a popular choice for many makeup users. Some general tips for applying mascara include ensuring that the eyelashes are clean and free of makeup or residue, wiggling the wand at the base of the lashes to build up volume, and applying the mascara from root to tip in a zigzag motion for even coverage. Finding the right mascara for oneself depends on individual preferences and desired results. It's essential to experiment with various products and formulations to understand which mascara best suits an individual's needs. Regular or long-wearing mascara can provide a suitable option for day-to-day wear, while waterproof or specially-formulated mascaras may be required based on the person's lifestyle and preferences. In terms of safety, it is essential to replace mascara regularly, every three to six months, to avoid bacterial growth and potential eye infections. Additionally, never share mascara with others, as this can spread bacteria and increase the risk of infection. Lastly, always remove mascara properly at the end of the day, to preserve and maintain the health of the eyelashes."},{"question":"Question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: WASHINGTON — When Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton announced her vice presidential choice, she referred to Virginia Senator Tim Kaine as a progressive who is \\"everything Donald Trump and Mike Pence are not.” Timothy Michael \\"Tim\\" Kaine was born on February 26, 1958, in St. Paul, Minnesota, but grew up in the metro area of Kansas City, Missouri. He is the eldest son of an ironworker and a home economics teacher. Kaine attended an all-boys Jesuit high school, joining spring mission drives to fund Jesuit activities in Honduras. He went on to earn a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of Missouri before entering Harvard Law School. Kaine took time off from his law studies to work with the Jesuit Volunteer Corps in Honduras for nine months in 1980-81, helping Jesuit missionaries who ran a Catholic school in El Progreso. His time there reportedly helped form his support for citizenship for undocumented immigrants in the United States – a stance likely to attract Latino voters. He also learned to speak fluent Spanish, seen as a possible advantage with Hispanic voters. At Harvard, Kaine met his wife, Anne Holton, the daughter of former Republican Virginia Governor Linwood Holton (1970-74), who desegregated the commonwealth's public schools. She now serves as Virginia's secretary of education. They have three children. After law school, the Kaines settled in Richmond, Virginia, where he spent nearly two decades as an attorney focusing on civil rights and fair housing. He helped found the Virginia Coalition to End Homelessness and was a board member of the Virginia chapter of Housing Opportunities Made Equal. Kaine entered politics in 1994 when he was elected to the Richmond City Council, then became the city's mayor. Virginia's voters chose him as their lieutenant governor in 2001.

Should maybe take in to consideration that she has a customer waiting.","response":"The sentiment expressed in this review can be described as negative, with a hint of frustration and dissatisfaction. The reviewer seems to be disappointed by the hair stylist's lack of attentiveness and concern for customers waiting, indicating a subpar experience. Below, a more in-depth analysis of the review's sentiment is provided: 1. Overall dissatisfaction: The reviewer starts by mentioning their relatively short stay of 5 minutes, which immediately sets the tone for their negative experience. By discussing the limited time spent at the salon, the reviewer helps to establish that they did not have satisfying customer experience. 2. Criticism of service quality: In this review, the customer highlights the insufficient number of staff members, specifically pointing out only one hair stylist present. This observation further emphasizes their discontent with the service, as a lack of staff tends to result in delays and inefficient operations, reducing customer satisfaction. 3. Disapproval of professionalism: The reviewer criticizes the stylist's actions, which include chatting, watching YouTube videos, and stopping frequently while attending to a client. This behavior is perceived as unprofessional, as the stylist does not appear to be fully focused on their work. Consequently, this perception contributes to the negative sentiment expressed in the review. 4. Frustration with wait time: The reviewer's mention of waiting for service while the stylist remains occupied with non-work-related activities demonstrates their frustration with the situation. This indicates the reviewer's expectation of efficient and expedient service, which appears to have been unmet. 5. Appeal for consideration: Lastly, the reviewer suggests that the hair stylist should \\"take into consideration that she has a customer waiting,\\" expressing their dissatisfaction with the stylist's apparent lack of concern for her clients' time. This recommendation can be interpreted as a plea for improved customer service and a desire to be acknowledged. In summary, the sentiment of this review is predominantly negative as the reviewer emphasizes their dissatisfaction, frustration, and disappointment with the salon experience. The perceived lack of professionalism, inadequate staffing, and disregard for customer wait time all contribute to the overall negative tone of the review."},{"question":"Please capitalize where necessary: ozokerite, lignite wax or peat wax \\"natural products\\", whether or not coloured (excl. crude)","response":"Ozokerite, Lignite Wax or Peat Wax are considered \\"Natural Products\\" among waxes.

After all, with the international visibility and prestige of the Gunners, it's hard to find a football player who wouldn't be interested in wearing their iconic red and white jersey at the famed Emirates Stadium. He explains that he completely understands why Wenger chose New Arsenal centre back, Gabriel Paulista, from Spain, as he was an accomplished player and a well-regarded talent on the global stage. Eventually, it became apparent that Wenger's interest veered towards securing a Brazilian dynamism in his team's back line than betting on Perrin's leadership and French defensive solidity. While he admits the circumstances were not ideal and the public denial from Wenger was tough to swallow, Perrin does not show any sign of bitterness or resentment towards Arsenal or Wenger. To him, these are common occurrences in the big games of transfers and he takes them as part of his professional journey. He confesses, though, that the hope of joining Arsenal gave him sleepless nights and the eventual disappointment took a while to settle in. Perrin also believes that the transfer talks with Arsenal, regardless of the outcome, have somehow reaffirmed his worth as a player. It's not every day that a renowned club like Arsenal would consider him as a potential part of its squad.

The prolific defender takes this as a valuable experience and motivation to improve his game further. These instances act as silver linings on his football career cloud, pushing him harder to gain more attention from other top football clubs.

His days at Saint-Etienne are not over, and he plans to continue proving himself on the pitch - always striving, always focused, always ready to exploit potential opportunities for growth and success.

With an all-star cast, exceptional visual effects, and a mind-bending storyline, Inception offers a unique take on the heist thriller that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. The film follows Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), an expert “extractor” who specializes in stealing valuable ideas and secrets from people’s minds while they are deep in sleep. Cobb is haunted by the death of his wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), whose memory threatens to destroy his own sanity. When a wealthy businessman, Saito (Ken Watanabe), offers Cobb an opportunity to clear up his criminal past and regain his life, he embarks on a seemingly impossible mission: inception. Cobb and his team must plant an idea into the subconscious mind of their target, Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy), heir to a global business empire. Inception stands out due to its highly original plot and remarkable character development. DiCaprio delivers an outstanding performance as the emotionally tormented Cobb, while Joseph Gordon-Levitt, as both a loyal friend and efficient team member, demonstrates his acting versatility.

In the coast towns and elsewhere Syrians and Jews made war. The Jews assaulted Gadara and Gaulonitis, Sebaste and Ascalon, Anthedon and Gaza, putting many to the sword. Then came their own turn, for the Syrians and Greeks rose upon them and slaughtered them without mercy. As yet, however, there had been no blood shed in Tyre, though all knew that it must come.

Volhyniassa puhutaan yleensä slaavilaisia kieliä, kuten ukrainaa ja venäjää, sekä puolaa ja valkovenäjää. Volhynian historialliseen ja kulttuurilliseen merkitykseen liittyy sen strateginen sijainti Euroopan ja Aasian risteyskohdassa, mikä on houkutellut monia merkittäviä valloittajia ja kauppiaita alueelle. Volhynia on ollut tärkeä osa Varangian reittiä, joka yhdisti Skandinavian ja Bysantin valtakunnan, sekä Silkkitien monia sivupolkuja. Tämä on johtanut laajaan kulttuurienvaihtoon ja erilaisten perinteiden ja innovaatioiden kehittymiseen alueella. Varhaisimmat merkinnät Volhynian alueesta ovat peräisin antiikin kreikkalaisten historioitsijoiden teoksista, jotka kuvaavat alueen väestöä koillisen Euroopan laitamilla. Volhynia yhdistettiin Kiovan Rusiin 900-luvulla ja siitä tuli tärkeä poliittinen ja taloudellinen keskus. Kiovan Rusin hajoamisen jälkeen alue päätyi Liettuan suuriruhtinaskunnan, Puolan kuningaskunnan, Ruotsin valtakunnan ja muiden valtakuntien ja valtioiden hallintaan eri aikakausina. 1800-luvulla Volhynia jaettiin Venäjän ja Itävallan välillä, ja sen molemmilla puolilla kukoistivat erilaiset poliittiset, kielelliset ja uskonnolliset perinteet. Ensimmäisen maailmansodan jälkeen Volhynian alue jaettiin uudelleen, ja sen osat päätyivät Puolan ja Neuvostoliiton hallintaan. Toisen maailmansodan aikana alue kärsi suurista tuhoista ja kansainvälisistä konflikteista, johon kuuluu myös Volhynian joukkomurha, jossa tapettiin tuhansia puolalaisia ja juutalaisia siviilejä. Nykyään Volhynia on jaettu useiden valtioiden välillä, ja alueen luonnonympäristöön, arkkitehtuuriin ja perinteisiin vaikuttavat edelleen sen monimutkainen historia ja kulttuurien yhteentörmäys. Säilyneet linnoitukset, kirkot, palatsit ja muut historialliset rakennukset kertovat tarinaa alueen merkittävästä menneisyydestä, ja Volhynian alue tarjoaa matkailijoille ja tutkijoille ainutlaatuisen tilaisuuden tutkia Euroopan monimuotoisuutta ja historiallista rikkautta."},{"question":"Given this review: \\"just amazing\\" Would you recommend this app to a friend?

This was the last and decisive battle that was necessary for a quick end to the war, even though it is speculated that the fortress would have fallen eventually due to starvation. The most important result was that now the Ottoman command lost all hopes of regaining the initiative, which made any further fighting pointless. How many casulties did General Ivanov's army suffer in total?","response":"General Ivanov's army, which included the Bulgarian 2nd Army and two Serb divisions, suffered a total of 8,093 Bulgarian casualties and 1,462 Serbian casualties. So, the total number of casualties for General Ivanov's army was 8,093 + 1,462 = 9,555."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Information: - Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia (also called Metazoa). The animal kingdom emerged as a basal clade within Apoikozoa as a sister of the choanoflagellates. Sponges are the most basal clade of animals. Animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently at some point in their lives. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later in their lives. All animals are heterotrophs: they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance. - Carnivora (from Latin \\"car\\" (stem \\"carn-\\") \\"flesh\\" and \\"vorre\\" \\"to devour\\") is a diverse order that includes over 280 species of placental mammals. Its members are formally referred to as carnivorans, whereas the word \\"carnivore\\" (often popularly applied to members of this group) can refer to any meat-eating organism. Carnivorans are the most diverse in size of any mammalian order, ranging from the least weasel (\\"Mustela nivalis\\"), at as little as and , to the polar bear (\\"Ursus maritimus\\"), which can weigh up to , to the southern elephant seal (\\"Mirounga leonina\\"), whose adult males weigh up to and measure up to in length. - Rats are various medium-sized, long-tailed rodents of the superfamily Muroidea. \\"True rats\\" are members of the genus \\"Rattus\\", the most important of which to humans are the black rat, \\"Rattus rattus\\", and the brown rat, \\"Rattus norvegicus\\". Many members of other rodent genera and families are also referred to as rats, and share many characteristics with true rats. - Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin \\"mamma\\" \\"breast\\"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria. - Reptiles are tetrapod (four-limbed vertebrate) animals in the class Reptilia, comprising today's turtles, crocodilians, snakes, amphisbaenians, lizards, tuatara, and their extinct relatives. The study of these traditional reptile orders, historically combined with that of modern amphibians, is called herpetology. - Guatemala (, or ), officially the Republic of Guatemala, is a country in Central America bordered by Mexico to the north and west, the Pacific Ocean to the southwest, Belize to the northeast, the Caribbean to the east, Honduras to the east and El Salvador to the southeast. With an estimated population of around 15.8 million, it is the most populated state in Central America. A representative democracy, Guatemala's capital and largest city is Nueva Guatemala de la Asunción, also known as Guatemala City. - Omnivore is a consumption classification for animals that have the capability to obtain chemical energy and nutrients from materials originating from plant and animal origin. Often, omnivores also have the ability to incorporate food sources such as algae, fungi, and bacteria into their diet as well. - Central America is the southernmost, isthmian portion of the North American continent, which connects with South America on the southeast. Central America is bordered by Mexico to the north, Colombia to the southeast, the Caribbean Sea to the east, and the Pacific Ocean to the west. Central America consists of seven countries: Belize, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama. The combined population of Central America is between 41,739,000 (2009 estimate) and 42,688,190 (2012 estimate). - An endotherm (from Greek \\"endon\\" \\"within\\" and \\"therm\\" \\"heat\\") is an organism that maintains its body at a metabolically favorable temperature, largely by the use of heat set free by its internal bodily functions instead of relying almost purely on ambient heat. Such internally generated heat is mainly an incidental product of the animal's routine metabolism, but under conditions of excessive cold or low activity an endotherm might apply special mechanisms adapted specifically to heat production. Examples include special-function muscular exertion such as shivering, and uncoupled oxidative metabolism such as within brown adipose tissue. Only birds and mammals are extant universally endothermic groups of animals. Certain lamnid sharks, tuna and billfishes are also endothermic. - Theria (Greek: \\"\\", wild beast) is a subclass of mammals amongst the Theriiformes (the sister taxa to Yinotheria). Theria includes the eutherians (including the placental mammals) and the metatherians (including the marsupials). - A mammary gland is an exocrine gland in mammals that produces milk to feed young offspring. Mammals get their name from the word \\"mammary\\". The mammary glands are arranged in organs such as the breasts in primates (for example, humans and chimpanzees), the udder in ruminants (for example, cows, goats, and deer), and the dugs of other animals (for example, dogs and cats). Lactorrhea, the occasional production of milk by the glands, can occur in any mammal, but in most mammals lactation, the production of enough milk for nursing, occurs only in phenotypic females who have gestated in recent months or years. It is directed by hormonal guidance from sex steroids. In a few mammalian species, male lactation can occur. - Synapsids (Greek, 'fused arch'), synonymous with theropsids (Greek, 'beast-face'), are a group of animals that includes mammals and every animal more closely related to mammals than to other living amniotes. They are easily separated from other amniotes by having a temporal fenestra, an opening low in the skull roof behind each eye, leaving a bony arch beneath each; this accounts for their name. Primitive synapsids are usually called pelycosaurs or pelycosaur-grade synapsids; more advanced mammal-like ones, therapsids. The non-mammalian members are described as mammal-like reptiles in classical systematics; they can also be called stem mammals or proto-mammals. Synapsids evolved from basal amniotes and are one of the two major groups of the later amniotes; the other is the sauropsids, a group that includes modern reptiles and birds. The distinctive temporal fenestra developed in the ancestral synapsid about 312 million years ago, during the Late Carboniferous period. - Panama City is the capital and largest city of the Republic of Panama. It has an urban population of 430,299, and its population totals 880,691 when rural areas are included. The city is located at the Pacific entrance of the Panama Canal, in the province of Panama. The city is the political and administrative center of the country, as well as a hub for international banking and commerce. It is considered a \\"gamma+\\" world city, one of three Central American cities listed in this category. - Sauropsida (\\"lizard faces\\") is a group of amniotes that includes all existing birds and reptiles as well as their fossil ancestors and other extinct relatives. Large land animals are either in this group or in its sister group, Synapsida, which includes mammals and their fossil relatives. This clade includes Parareptilia and other extinct clades. All living sauropsids are members of the sub-group Diapsida, the Parareptilia clade having died out 200 million years ago. The term originated in 1864 with Thomas Henry Huxley, who grouped birds with reptiles based on fossil evidence. - Mexico (, modern Nahuatl ), officially the United Mexican States, is a federal republic in the southern half of North America. It is bordered to the north by the United States; to the south and west by the Pacific Ocean; to the southeast by Guatemala, Belize, and the Caribbean Sea; and to the east by the Gulf of Mexico. Covering almost two million square kilometers (over 760,000 sq mi), Mexico is the sixth largest country in the Americas by total area and the 13th largest independent nation in the world. With an estimated population of over 120 million, it is the eleventh most populous country and the most populous Spanish-speaking country in the world while being the second most populous country in Latin America. Mexico is a federation comprising 31 states and a federal district that is also its capital and most populous city. Other metropolises include Guadalajara, Monterrey, Puebla, Toluca, Tijuana and León. - Miacoidea is a paraphyletic superfamily that had been traditionally divided into two families of carnivores: Miacidae (the miacids) and Viverravidae. Miacoids were primitive carnivores that lived during the Paleocene and Eocene Epochs, about 33-66 million years ago. Today, Miacidae is recognized as a paraphyletic array of stem taxa that probably resulted in some \\"miacid\\" genera ending up just outside the order Carnivora, the crown-group within the Carnivoramorpha. Carnivoramorpha consists of both Miacoidea and Carnivora, but excludes the order Creodonta that existed alongside Carnivoramorpha. Miacoids are regarded as basal carnivoramorphs. The miacids are a paraphyletic group containing all miacoids that are not viverravids. - In an ecosystem, predation is a biological interaction where a predator (an organism that is hunting) feeds on its prey (the organism that is attacked). Predators may or may not kill their prey prior to feeding on them, but the act of predation often results in the death of the prey and the eventual absorption of the prey's tissue through consumption. Thus predation is often, though not always, carnivory. Other categories of consumption are herbivory (eating parts of plants), fungivory (eating parts of fungi), and detritivory (the consumption of dead organic material). All these consumption categories fall under the rubric of consumer-resource systems. It can often be difficult to separate various types of feeding behaviors. For example, some parasitic species prey on a host organism and then lay their eggs on it for their offspring to feed on it while it continues to live in or on its decaying corpse after it has died. The key characteristic of predation however is the predator's direct impact on the prey population. On the other hand, detritivores simply eat dead organic material arising from the decay of dead individuals and have no direct impact on the \\"donor\\" organism(s). - Hair is a protein filament that grows from follicles found in the dermis, or skin. Hair is one of the defining characteristics of mammals. The human body, apart from areas of glabrous skin, is covered in follicles which produce thick terminal and fine vellus hair. Most common interest in hair is focused on hair growth, hair types and hair care, but hair is also an important biomaterial primarily composed of protein, notably keratin. - Mustelodon is an extinct carnivore , which belongs to the family Viverravidae . This genus contains only one species , Mustelodon primerus . Fossils of this mammal were found in the 57 million years old deposits of Lago Nandarajo , near the northern border of Panama in Central America . Mustelodon had a length of approximately 80 cm ( head to tail ) and this carnivore superficially resembled the modern mongooses . Mustelodon fed on fruits , insects and smaller mammals like shrews . It is closely related to the more famous Protictis from the Paleocene of the United States ( Wannagan Creek - South Dakota , San Juan Basin - New Mexico ) . - A carnivore meaning 'meat eater' (Latin, \\"caro\\" meaning 'meat' or 'flesh' and \\"vorare\\" meaning 'to devour') is an organism that derives its energy and nutrient requirements from a diet consisting mainly or exclusively of animal tissue, whether through predation or scavenging. Animals that depend solely on animal flesh for their nutrient requirements are called obligate carnivores while those that also consume non-animal food are called facultative carnivores. Omnivores also consume both animal and non-animal food, and apart from the more general definition, there is no clearly defined ratio of plant to animal material that would distinguish a facultative carnivore from an omnivore. A carnivore that sits at the top of the food chain is termed an apex predator. - Costa Rica (literally meaning \\"Rich Coast\\"), officially the Republic of Costa Rica, is a country in Central America, bordered by Nicaragua to the north, Panama to the southeast, the Pacific Ocean to the west, the Caribbean Sea to the east, and Ecuador to the south of Cocos Island. It has a population of around 4.5 million, of whom nearly a quarter live in the metropolitan area of the capital and largest city, San José. - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds. - Vertebrates comprise all species of animals within the subphylum Vertebrata (chordates with backbones). Vertebrates represent the overwhelming majority of the phylum Chordata, with currently about 64,000 species described. Vertebrates include the jawless fish and the jawed vertebrates, which include the cartilaginous fish (sharks and rays) and the bony fish. - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water. - Viverravidae is an extinct family within the superfamily Miacoidea. They are related to carnivorans, and lived from the early Palaeocene to the Eocene. - Theriiformes is a subclass of mammals. The term was coined in 1997 by McKenna & Bell in their classification of mammals. - Panama, officially called the Republic of Panama, is a country usually considered to be entirely in North America or Central America. It is bordered by Costa Rica to the west, Colombia (in South America) to the southeast, the Caribbean Sea to the north and the Pacific Ocean to the south. The capital and largest city is Panama City, whose metropolitan area is home to nearly half of the country's 3.9 million people. What entity does 'mustelodon' has the relation 'parent taxon' with?

Educating yourself about the causes of nightmares and the ways in which to prevent them can help you successfully cope with and manage your nightmares. As a result, you may find that you are less stressed as a result of missing sleep or disturbing images and can get the sleep your body needs. Nightmares are often caused by stress, anxiety, trauma, and physical and mental illness. In some cases, doctors don't know what causes nightmares. Although nightmares can seem harmless, they can actually significantly affect you and your ability to function because these scary dreams are disrupting vital sleep time. Most nightmares occur about 90 minutes after you go to sleep and this pattern can continue throughout the night, significantly impacting your ability to relax and get much-needed rest. You may find that keeping a dream diary can help you learn about the source of your nightmares. Any time you wake up from a nightmare, write down what caused the disruption in your sleep and any other factors such as diet or alcohol that may exacerbate scary dreams. Over time, you may notice patterns that can help you take concrete steps to reduce or prevent nightmares. Place a small notebook and pen next to your bed so that you can write as soon as you wake up. If you don't like writing, keeping a small voice recorder next to you can be a good alternative. Take your dream diary to any doctor's appointments you may have to deal with your nightmare. This can provide your doctor clues about what is causing the bad dreams. You need time to switch into nighttime and sleep mode. Giving yourself an hour or more to relax can signal your body and brain that it's time to sleep and may help to reduce or prevent nightmares. Staying away from electronics including television and devices can help your brain relax and keep it from seeing images that may stimulate nightmares. You may also want to avoid reading anything that is scary, too. Keep the lights in your home and bedroom dimmed to help signal your body and brain that it is time to wind down. Consider avoiding exercise within three hours of your bedtime to help your body temperature return to normal and minimize the stimulation of your brain. A fixed bedtime routine can further signal your body and brain that it's time to relax and go to bed. Do anything that helps you relax. A bedtime routine is an excellent way to reduce anxiety and stress that can cause nightmares and disrupt your sleep. Reading a light novel with the lights dimmed may reduce stress and anxiety and entertain you while not overstimulating your brain and senses. Drinking herbal tea such as peppermint, lavender, or chamomile while you read may further relax you and keep you asleep. Take a warm bath to promote relaxation and drowsiness. There is evidence that alcohol and drugs such as marijuana or cocaine can cause nightmares. Limiting or quitting either substance altogether may control or prevent nightmares and help you get a better night's sleep. Do not drink more than 1-2 alcoholic drinks per day and stay away from any alcohol within three hours of your bedtime. Drinking caffeine or taking caffeine pills close to bedtime may also cause nightmares. Avoid caffeine within three hours of your bedtime. If you are having any problems quitting alcohol or drugs, see a doctor who can help formulate a treatment plan to quit. Having a nightlight in your room may help more readily cope with nightmares by helping to re-orient yourself if you suddenly wake up. Choose a light that is a soothing and non-stimulating color such as red or orange. Place the nightlight near your bed if possible. You may also want to add others in your bedroom or other rooms of your home. There is a lot of evidence that stress and anxiety are a primary cause of nightmares in adults. Lowering the amount of stress and anxiety in your daily life may reduce or prevent nightmares and help you get a better night sleep overall, which in turn can improve your ability to function. Avoid stressful situations as much as possible by removing yourself from them if you can. If not, consider taking a ten-minute walk to help you come down from the situation. Exercise is an excellent way to control stress and anxiety. Aiming to get at least 30 minutes of exercise most days of the week may help reduce and prevent your nightmares and ensure a full night's rest. Some research has shown that altering the storylines of your nightmares can help you to control and cope with them. Actively switch out terrifying aspects of nightmares with more positive images. You can work on story lines as soon as you wake up from a nightmare or even during the day. Look into your dream diary and write out new endings or elements to your dream, and remove anything that makes you uncomfortable. For example, if you dream that a giant sea monster eats you and your family, tell yourself or write in the notebook, “we got on the monster and rode it to a beautiful desert island and learned that the monster was a great entertainer.” If you find that nothing alleviates your nightmares or they are severely disrupting your ability to sleep, see your doctor. She may be able to identify the cause of the dreams including stress, medications, or illness. Take your dream diary with you to help your doctor better assess the situation. Your doctor will likely ask you a series of questions to help her understand when the nightmares started and what factors may contribute to them. Your doctor may suggest you see a psychologist or sleep specialist to help manage or cure your nightmares. She may also prescribe medication to control nightmares.","response":"Learning about what causes nightmares and how to prevent them can help you sleep better and feel less stressed, as nightmares can be caused by many things like stress, anxiety, and health issues, so keeping a dream diary and having a bedtime routine can help."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: SEOUL — Despite recent tensions over North Korea’s nuclear and missile tests, life is actually quite normal for American military families living at Camp Humphreys in South Korea, which is the largest overseas Army installation in the world. Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas tries to come to most of his daughters’ high school soccer games at Camp Humphreys. In fact, his family’s lifestyle at this sprawling U.S. military base is similar to one they would lead back home. “We go to church on Sundays. We see all our friends there. We’re on the soccer field most of the afternoons, or just going for bike ride, the same things we would do if we were back in the States,” said Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas, with the U.S. Eight Army. This is Puskas’ fourth tour in Korea. He met and married his Korean wife Mi-jung, during an earlier tour. His children have spent much of their lives at military bases in Korea. “I think it has given me a wider world view and has helped me understand other people a lot more,” said Elizabeth Puskas, the eldest daughter of the family who will attend college next year in the United States. The U.S. military in Korea is consolidating its forces in Camp Humphreys, including its military headquarters, as it moves to close older bases in congested Seoul and other regions of the country. Camp Humphreys is now the size of a small city, encompassing over 140 square kilometers of land, with construction underway to expand its capacity to accommodate over 40,000 people. There are modern apartments for soldiers and their families, schools, movie theaters, shopping centers and fast food restaurants to help bring some of the comforts of home to military life in Korea. The base even has its own golf course. “I have been around the army for part of the last 40 years as a soldier and now as a civilian, and this is as normal as any army post I’ve ever been on.

For instance, in the movie Star Trek, the workers could go to a replicator and order food, drinks or anything they could program into the computer. Before long, the item would appear. This is possible today, in a way, with technology we have had for years. Several manufacturers have created 3D printers. One company, MakerBot, has created a printer that the average person can afford. It is called The Replicator. You can download a lot of design software from the Internet for use with The Replicator. In the near future, rather than going to a store to buy what you need, you may be able to download what you want from the Internet and print it out at home. The process was first used with music. At the very beginning, music was recorded onto plastic disks with etching . Music can now be copied without a physical product. _ Rather than having to buy a physical book or magazine, you can now download them from the Internet in digital form. This technology is already used in engineering and architecture. Melissa Shoes, a Brazilian footwear company, is using this technology to create shoes.

The technology that was supposed to simplify our lives has become the vital time-suck: the average teen spends more than seven hours a day using technological devices, plus an additional hour just text-messaging friends. The advantage of technological devices is connectedness: email lets us respond on the go, and we are in touch with more people during more hours of the day than at any other time in history. But is it possible we're more lonely than ever, too? That's what MIT professor Sherry Turkle observes in her new book, Alone Together, a fascinating portrait of our changing relationship with technology. Turkle details the ways technology has redefined our comprehension of closeness and loneliness--and warns us of the danger of accepting such virtual relationships in place of lasting emotional connections.

Created by Bill Finger and Bob Kane, the character made her debut as \\"the Cat\\" in Batman #1 (June 1940). Catwoman, whose real name is Selina Kyle, has been Batman's most enduring love interest and is known for her complex love-hate relationship with him. As a Gotham City burglar, Catwoman typically wears a tight, one-piece outfit and uses a bullwhip for a weapon. Context: In 2011, DC Comics relaunched all titles, deemed the New 52, which rebooted the DC Universe continuity. Catwoman's monthly title now focused on Selina's earlier days as Catwoman, but not her origins. The series begins with Selina frantically escaping from unknown masked men who are invading her apartment. After flitting from rooftop to rooftop, Selina looks back just in time to see her apartment blown apart by explosives. She turns to her informant, Lola, who often supplies Catwoman with information and various jobs. In this instance, Lola tips Selina off to an unoccupied penthouse where Selina can lay low for a few weeks, as well as a job stealing a painting from Russian mobsters. For this job, Selina infiltrates a Russian club by posing as the bartender. There, she recognizes a man who murdered a friend of hers, and she takes her revenge. Once her cover is blown, Selina dons her Catwoman outfit and fights her way out of the club. It is revealed through Selina's inner monologue that she and Batman are lovers, and the premiere issue ends with the first sex scene between the two. Her revised origin in Catwoman #0 draws from Batman Returns. Catwoman is later confronted by Steve Trevor, who offers her a spot on Amanda Waller's new Justice League of America. Selina initially refuses, but accepts the offer after Trevor promises to help her track down a woman who has apparently been posing as Selina. It is later revealed that Catwoman was chosen specifically to take down Batman should the JLA ever need to defeat the original Justice League. The teams eventually come into conflict in the publisher's \\"Trinity War\\" crossover. In the Earth-Two continuity, Selina Kyle and Bruce Wayne are married, and their daughter, Helena Wayne, is that universe's Robin. In this universe, either Selina has reformed or was never a supervillain in the first place. It is revealed in issue #0 of Worlds' Finest that this Selina was killed while trying to stop what she believed was a human trafficking ring.

On the night of an undercard fight in Atlantic City, Micky's scheduled opponent is ill, and a substitute is found who is 20 pounds heavier than Micky, a huge difference in professional boxing, constituting two or three weight classes. Despite Micky's reservations, his mother and brother agree so that they can all get the purse and Micky is defeated. Micky retreats from the world and forms a relationship with Charlene Fleming, a former college athlete who dropped out and became a bartender. After several weeks, Alice arranges another fight for Micky, concerned it will turn out the same. His mother and seven sisters blame Charlene for his lack of motivation. Micky mentions he received an offer to be paid to train in Las Vegas, but Dicky says he will match the offer so he can keep training and working with his family. Dicky then tries to get money by posing his girlfriend as a prostitute and then, once she picks up a client, impersonating a police officer to steal the client's money. This is foiled by the actual police and Dicky is arrested after a chase and a fight with them.

I can see why Claire lives here as it’s a pretty beautiful place, it’s still suburban but there are trills, hills and birds everywhere, and for someone that’s passionate about the environment I can see why she lives here. Meeting Claire was awesome, after having spoken via phone or email for so long, it was nice to speak to her in person. The filming of the interview went extremely smoothly, I’d put this down to having planned out everything, such as all the questions I was going to ask prior to the interview. By this stage I had helped Riah film as well as Elise and it was noticeable how much smoother Riah’s interview went because she had pre-planned her questions. Rather than spending an hour asking various questions that you might not use anyway, it’s much more efficient to spend 20 minutes covering exactly what you want to cover. By this stage I’d also had practise setting up lights, doing sound and getting camera shots for people’s portraits so I already knew everything I wanted to shoot. Our setup was pretty simple, two large lights, one on Claire’s front right and one on Claire’s front left, two Canon EOS 60D DSLR’s at different positions (one straight on, one to the side), a Sony H2N handy recorder and a lapel mic. Everything ran super smoothly, we did the interview first then myself and Riah shot various things in Claire’s studio. Whilst shooting various things in Claire’s studio we also got a chance to both speak to her which was nice, discussing what it is like to be a woman in Melbourne’s art scene and finding out who some of her favourite artists were.

(a). peanuts (b). milk (c). gold (d). air","response":"(c). Gold A pure substance refers to a sample with consistent properties throughout its mass and has a fixed chemical composition. Out of the four options provided, gold is the best example of a pure substance. To further understand why gold is considered a pure substance, let's break down and discuss each choice: (a). Peanuts: Peanuts are not a pure substance, as they are a mixture of several compounds and nutrients such as proteins, fats, and fiber. Also, peanuts themselves can differ in terms of size, shape, and taste. As they have variable composition, they cannot be classified as a pure substance. (b). Milk: Milk is considered a heterogeneous mixture, mainly made up of water, fat, proteins, lactose, minerals, vitamins, and enzymes. It has a variable composition, depending on the animal source, diet, and other factors. Additionally, milk has colloidal particles and sometimes visible fats that can be separated through processes like filtration and pasteurization. Hence, milk does not qualify as a pure substance. (c). Gold: Gold is an element with the symbol \\"Au\\" and an atomic number of 79. It is a metal with consistent physical and chemical properties throughout its mass and a fixed chemical composition. In its pure form, gold is composed of only gold atoms, making it a pure substance. However, it is essential to note that jewelry gold is often alloyed with other metals to improve its strength and durability and is not considered a pure substance. (d). Air: Air is a mixture of various gases such as nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and trace amounts of other gases. Its composition may vary depending on factors such as altitude, temperature, humidity, and pollutant levels. It is therefore considered a mixture, rather than a pure substance. In conclusion, gold is the best example of a pure substance among the options provided. It is a single element with a consistent composition and properties throughout its mass. The other options - peanuts, milk, and air - are classified as mixtures, as they contain variable compositions and do not display the characteristics of a pure substance."},{"question":"Read the article and select the best answer.

Former Division I collegiate wrestler Scott Voss is a 42-year-old bored and disillusioned biology teacher at the failing Wilkinson High School. Budget cutbacks at the school jeopardize the continuation of its music program, which would result in its teacher, Marty Streb, being laid off. Concerned for both his colleague and his students, Scott attempts to raise the 48,000 necessary to keep the music program alive. He moonlights as a night instructor for an adult citizenship class, where student Niko asks him for outside tutoring.

Scott, helped by Niko and Marty, begins with small unsanctioned bouts paying only 750 to the loser.

Knowing the strength of the hydrogen peroxide solution will help you decide the best course of treatment, whether the burn affects the skin, eye, or digestive system. The container’s label will note its contents’ concentration. Most household hydrogen peroxide solutions are about 3% hydrogen peroxide and 97% water. These can cause minor irritation to the skin, eyes, or digestive system, stinging, and/or whitening of the skin, but can almost always be treated by simply flushing the area with cool water. Products that bleach hair can contain between 6 and 10% hydrogen peroxide, and can be more harmful than standard household solutions. Industrial solutions contain between 35 and 90% hydrogen peroxide. These can cause chemical burns that require immediate emergency care. You may notice blistering on the skin. Call emergency services immediately to treat exposures to industrial hydrogen peroxide. Free the burned or irritated area from contaminated clothing as soon as possible, especially when exposed to higher concentrations. Take off any clothes, jewelry, or other accessories that might have been splashed or soaked. Place the clothing in plastic bags if the concentration of hydrogen peroxide is 10% or higher. Hold the affected area under cool running water to rinse away the solution and ease pain. Flushing under a faucet will effectively treat small patches of skin exposed to household concentrations. Take a cool shower to flush larger patches of contaminated skin or areas exposed to a higher concentration. Chemical burns that result from hydrogen peroxide exposure can be treated like thermal burns. Continue to flush with cool water until pain starts to subside, use a mild soap to gently wash the area, and apply an antibacterial ointment. Avoid scrubbing or breaking any small blisters that develop. Consider applying an aloe vera gel to ease discomfort. Within a day of exposure, look for signs including worsening redness, irritation, and pus or discharge from the burn. Seek a follow-up examination if you experience any of these symptoms. Schedule an appointment with your primary care doctor, contact the medical professional who treated your wound, or visit a local clinic for a follow-up examination.

The sheer number of sand grains is astronomically huge. 2. Sand grains are continuously being added and removed from beaches through natural processes such as erosion, deposition, and weathering. 3. Human activity, such as beach replenishment and construction, also impacts the number of sand grains. 4.

Identify the item or service being reviewed. 2. Mention specific flaws or problems encountered. 3. Describe any attempts to address these issues, if applicable. 4. Share an overall rating or recommendation. Here's an example of a negative review for a fictional restaurant called \\"The Gourmet Deli\\": Title: Extremely Disappointing Dining Experience I had high hopes for The Gourmet Deli due to its promising menu and prime location, but my visit last night was thoroughly disappointing. The initial ambiance was quite pleasant, but that's where the positive aspects of my experience ended. First, the appetizers took over 30 minutes to arrive, which seemed excessive given that the restaurant was only half full. When the calamari eventually made it to our table, it was rubbery and overcooked, severely compromising the dish's flavor profile. Next, our entrees took another hour to be served. Both my Cajun chicken pasta and my partner's steak were cold and bland, leading us to believe they had been sitting under a heat lamp for quite some time. We politely informed the server of our dissatisfaction and were promised that a fresh batch would be prepared, but after another 30 minutes of waiting, we received the exact same dishes—only marginally warmer. Despite my repeated attempts to get the manager's attention to address our concerns, we were met with dismissiveness and an overall lack of professionalism. Ultimately, we decided to leave without finishing our meals, feeling robbed of our time and money. My overall experience at The Gourmet Deli was a bitter disappointment. I cannot recommend this restaurant to anyone given its subpar service, poor food quality, and indifferent management. I won't be returning anytime soon, and I urge others to try elsewhere for a satisfying dining experience."},{"question":"Teacher:You are given a sentence in Hebrew.

The Brexit vote is coming! Much has been written and said about what might happen if U.K. voters decide to ditch the European Union tomorrow, and much of it hasn't been reassuring. The U.K.’s economy will slow. U.K. companies will be poorer. Jobs will be lost. George Soros thinks the pound will plunge -- even more than it did when he made 1 billion betting against it back in 1992. That sounds bad. But before investors freak out about a Brexit-induced meltdown in the U.K., they would be wise to consider the current state of play. Regardless of whether the U.K. recommits to or abandons the EU, it's worth noting that the U.K. already is struggling with some fundamental market and economic weaknesses. The MSCI United Kingdom Index returned a handsome 10.5 percent annually from its inception in 1970 to June 2014 (including dividends). But the Index has since stumbled, returning a negative 8.9 percent annually from July 2014 through May of this year. The Index’s two-year decline is a symptom of corporate anemia in the U.K. The average return on common equity for the companies in the Index has plunged from 17.2 percent in June 2014 to just 4.2 percent today. One-year trailing earnings-per-share for the Index are only 40 percent of the ten-year trailing average EPS -- a sign that corporate earnings are in deep distress in the U.K. It's hard to imagine that corporate profitability in the U.K. would fare worse post Brexit. The pound hasn’t held up any better than earnings. The pound peaked in June 2014 and has declined 14 percent against the dollar since then. It’s also 16 percent cheaper than its average exchange rate against the dollar since 1971. The pound is as cheap today relative to the dollar as it was in 1992 when George Soros made a fortune betting on the pound's decline. Aren't these weaknesses already evidence of what Brexit opponents say a post-Brexit U.K. might look like? And since the current troubles began over two years ago, they can’t credibly be blamed on Brexit. The more likely culprit in this scenario is the business cycle, and it’s a useful reminder that while membership in the EU undoubtedly has major benefits, larger and more mundane economic forces will ultimately have a far greater impact on the U.K.’s economy over the medium term than its decision to love or leave the EU. Much of what investors fear about a Brexit may already be in the rear view mirror. It's also possible to overstate what EU membership has meant to the U.K. economy. Britain joined the European Community -- the predecessor of the EU -- in 1973. According to the International Monetary Fund, real GDP growth has averaged 2.2 percent annually in the U.K. since 1980 (the first year for which data is available), and real GDP per capita growth has averaged 1.9 percent annually over the same period. Both numbers are in line with historical growth rates for comparably mature economies, and it's quite possible that the U.K.'s economy could have grown at those rates without EU membership. Just look at comparably mature economies outside the EU. For example, real GDP growth has averaged 2.6 percent annually in the U.S. and 3.2 percent annually in Australia since 1980. And real GDP per capita growth has averaged 1.7 percent annually in the U.S. and 1.8 percent annually in Australia over the same period. When compared to other mature economies outside of the EU, it's not at all clear how much the U.K. has benefited economically from EU membership. Methodology: Average annual growth since 1980, the first year for which data is available. Granted, thousands of years of history point to the unimpeachable truth that trade helps economies expand and creates wealth (while often leaving battered lives, communities or professions along the way). The EU experiment has thus far only given us decades of economic data to analyze. There's also no way of knowing whether and to what extent the U.K. would have fared worse had it not joined the EU. By the same token, it's possible that the U.K. might have done even better had it not joined the EU. By the way, a rejection of the EU isn't necessarily a rejection of trade. Both the U.S. and Australia maintain relations with the EU and elsewhere that are in some respects similar to the economic cooperation enjoyed by EU member countries -- and there's no indication that similar relations can’t be (or won’t be) reached between the U.K. and the EU if the U.K. exits. None of this is to say, of course, that U.K. stocks or the pound won’t decline further in the uncertain days or weeks or even months following a Brexit. But whatever happens, there’s more room for things to get better in the U.K. in the coming years than to get worse. So take a breath. Your worst Brexit fears may have already been realized.

Answer:","response":"The first Red Nose Day took place on February 5, 1988. Red Nose Day is an annual fundraising event organized by the British charity, Comic Relief, which was founded in 1985 by renowned screenwriter Richard Curtis and comedian Lenny Henry. They came up with the idea after visiting Ethiopia during the 1984-1985 famine and being deeply affected by the suffering they witnessed. The purpose of Red Nose Day is to raise funds for various charitable initiatives and projects in the United Kingdom and abroad, predominantly in Africa. The event has grown into a highly anticipated, entertaining and engaging campaign that engages celebrities, performers, businesses, schools, and the general public. Red Nose Day involves the wearing of red foam noses, which have become symbolic of the campaign. The event is characterized by a lively atmosphere, with a focus on fun and laughter – hence the association with the phrase 'Comic Relief.' This approach seeks to make the fundraising process enjoyable while raising awareness for pressing social issues, such as poverty, homelessness, and global health crises. A key component of the Red Nose Day campaign involves a telethon - a televised event where celebrities, comedians, and musicians come together to perform and entertain viewers, encouraging them to donate to the cause. Often, these marquee events include comedy sketches, short films, musical performances, and documentaries highlighting the issues faced by people in need. Since its inception, Red Nose Day has expanded globally with several countries adopting the event, including the United States, which began hosting its own version of Red Nose Day in 2015. Over the years, Red Nose Day has raised significant funds, making a substantial, positive impact on the lives of millions. The charity's work has helped deliver essential services, including healthcare, clean water, education, and disaster relief efforts. By combining humor and compassion, Red Nose Day has become an iconic annual event that continues to bring smiles to faces while also making a tangible difference in the world."},{"question":"Here is some data about a restaurant: name = The Vaults, food = Fast food, priceRange = more than £30, familyFriendly = yes.

She published seven autobiographies, three books of essays, several books of poetry, and was credited with a list of plays, movies, and television shows spanning over 50 years. She received dozens of awards and more than 50 honorary degrees. Angelou is best known for her series of seven autobiographies, which focus on her childhood and early adult experiences. Context: In 1951, Angelou married Greek electrician, former sailor, and aspiring musician Tosh Angelos, despite the condemnation of interracial relationships at the time and the disapproval of her mother. She took modern dance classes during this time, and met dancers and choreographers Alvin Ailey and Ruth Beckford. Angelou and Ailey formed a dance team, calling themselves \\"Al and Rita\\", and performed modern dance at fraternal black organizations throughout San Francisco, but never became successful. Angelou, her new husband, and her son moved to New York City so she could study African dance with Trinidadian dancer Pearl Primus, but they returned to San Francisco a year later. After Angelou's marriage ended in 1954, she danced professionally in clubs around San Francisco, including the nightclub the Purple Onion, where she sang and danced to calypso music. Up to that point she went by the name of \\"Marguerite Johnson\\", or \\"Rita\\", but at the strong suggestion of her managers and supporters at the Purple Onion she changed her professional name to \\"Maya Angelou\\" (her nickname and former married surname), a \\"distinctive name\\" that set her apart and captured the feel of her calypso dance performances. During 1954 and 1955, Angelou toured Europe with a production of the opera Porgy and Bess. She began her practice of learning the language of every country she visited, and in a few years she gained proficiency in several languages. In 1957, riding on the popularity of calypso, Angelou recorded her first album, Miss Calypso, which was reissued as a CD in 1996. She appeared in an off-Broadway review that inspired the 1957 film Calypso Heat Wave, in which Angelou sang and performed her own compositions. Angelou met novelist John Oliver Killens in 1959 and, at his urging, moved to New York to concentrate on her writing career. She joined the Harlem Writers Guild, where she met several major African-American authors, including John Henrik Clarke, Rosa Guy, Paule Marshall, and Julian Mayfield, and was published for the first time. In 1960, after meeting civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. and hearing him speak, she and Killens organized \\"the legendary\\" Cabaret for Freedom to benefit the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), and she was named SCLC's Northern Coordinator. According to scholar Lyman B. Hagen, her contributions to civil rights as a fundraiser and SCLC organizer were successful and \\"eminently effective\\". Angelou also began her pro-Castro and anti-apartheid activism during this time. Question: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?. Whats the answer?","response":"Yes, there are some interesting things in this article about Maya Angelou. So, let's talk about a few like we're telling a story! First, Maya Angelou was not only a great writer, but she also loved to dance and sing. She even made an album called \\"Miss Calypso\\" where she sang fun calypso music. Calypso is a type of music that comes from the Caribbean and makes people want to dance. After moving to New York, Maya met a famous writer named John Oliver Killens, who encouraged her to focus on her writing. She joined a group called the Harlem Writers Guild, where she made friends with other talented writers who were also African-American. That's when she started getting her stories published! Another cool thing is that Maya cared a lot about civil rights, which means making sure everyone is treated fairly and with respect, no matter their skin color. So, she worked with a famous leader named Martin Luther King Jr. to help raise money and organize events for the good cause. Lastly, Maya was very interested in learning about different cultures and languages. When she traveled to other countries, she always tried to learn their language, and she eventually became good at speaking several different languages.

People spend maybe an hour or so to wandering around the town square, and buy a drink before hopping back on their transport back to the capital city of Romania. But, thanks to an epic tip-off from the travel ninja Shikha at Why Waste Annual Leave and a few other Brasov devotees, instead of following the crowds, we booked a couple of leisurely nights there. At the end of our day trip, instead of returning to Bucharest and getting stuck in the Sunday evening traffic, we checked into our hotel and waved our guide off. Yes, you can easily ‘do’ Brasov in an afternoon – it’s a popular stop off at the end of a day trip after visiting the “home” of Dracula – Bran castle, and the beautiful Peles castle – but having the leisure to linger was exquisite. In addition to trying local dishes, we also ate lunch at McDonalds. Yes, yes, as a blogger we shouldn’t pretend to eat anything other than caviar washed down with champagne and unicorn tears, but we were hungry and couldn’t be bothered to find somewhere. (For the record, we both opted for a Big Mac and a diet coke.) For the first half day, we wandered around whilst the skies were beautifully blue… …learned a lot of local history, admired the Hollywood style sign in the hills… …slipped into a couple of churches (not to mention dodged giggling kids racing around on miniature cars)… …some hidden, and some hidden in plain sight… …and admired the sign from our cosy hotel, as it lit up at twilight Our only full day dawned fairly murky for the most part, it was a Sunday so a lot of things were closed, so after hitting 20,000 steps and getting lost a few times in the less pretty corners of the city… According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: How does the blogger probably feel about having McDonalds in Brasov?

Cody has wanted to be a professional surfer ever since a visit from legendary surfer Ezekiel \\"Big Z\\" Topanga several years ago. When a talent scout shorebird named Mikey (Mario Cantone) arrives to find entrants for the \\"Big Z Memorial\\" surfing contest, Cody jumps at the chance despite the lackluster support from his family. En route to the contest, Cody befriends another entrant, Chicken Joe. The entrants arrive at Pen Gu Island, the site of the contest, where Cody meets and immediately falls in love with Lani, an eighteen-year-old female gentoo penguin who is a lifeguard. He also meets Tank \\"The Shredder\\" Evans, an egotistical penguin who has won the Big Z Memorial nine times since it was first held after Z's disappearance during a previous match ten years ago.

Celebrities party endlessly, they like to be seen at these parties, and to get due exposure in the media. In fact the film would have us believe that this exposure MAKES celebrities out of socialites and the newspapers have a huge hand in this. IMO there is much more synergy between the celebrities and media and it is a \\"I need you, you need me\\" kind of relationship. However, the media needs celebrities more and not vice versa. Anyhow, in this milieu of constant partying is thrown the social column (page 3 of the newspaper) reporter Konkana Sen Sharma. She is shown as this celebrity maker, very popular at the social gatherings. She has a good friend in the gay Abhijeet and in the struggling model Rohit (Bikram Saluja). She rooms with an air-hostess  the sassy Pearl (Sandhya Mridul), and a struggling actress - Gayatri (Tara Sharma). The editor of the newspaper is Boman Irani and a firebrand crime beat reporter is played by Atul Kulkarni. The movie has almost too many plot diversions and characters but does work at a certain level. The rich are shown to be rotten to the core for the most part, the movie biz shown to be sleazy to the max with casting couch scenarios, exploitation of power, hunger for media exposure. Into all this is layered in homosexuality, a homosexual encounter that seems to not have much to do with the story or plot, rampant drug use, pedophilia, police \\"encounter\\" deaths. In light of all this Pearl's desire to have a super rich husband, a socialite daughter indulging in a sexual encounter in a car, the bitching women, all seem benign ills. The film has absolutely excellent acting by Konkana Sen Sharma, Atul Kulkarni has almost no role  a pity in my opinion. But the supporting cast is more than competent (Boman Irani is very good). This is what saves the film for me. Mr. Bhandarkar bites off way more than he can chew or process onto celluloid and turns the film into a free for all bash. I wish he had focused on one or two aspects of societal ills and explored them more effectively. He berates societal exploitation yet himself exploits all the masala ingredients needed for a film to be successful. We have an item number in the framework of a Bollywood theme party, the drugged out kids dance a perfectly choreographed dance to a Western beat. I hope the next one from Madhur Bhandarkar dares to ditch even more of the Hindi film stereotyped ingredients. The film is a brave (albeit flawed) effort, certainly worth a watch. Choose your answer.

Of the practice of grouping all the violins together on the left, he wrote, \\"The new seating is, I admit, easier for the conductor and the second violins, but I firmly maintain that the second violins themselves sound far better on the right. ... When the new fashion reached us from America somewhere about 1908 it was adopted by some conductors, but Richter, Weingartner, Walter, Toscanini and many others kept what I feel is the right balance.\\"This care for balance was an important feature of Boult's music-making. Orchestral players across decades commented on his insistence that every important part should be heard without difficulty. His BBC principal violist wrote in 1938, \\"If a woodwind player has to complain that he has already been blowing 'fit to burst' there is trouble for somebody.\\" The trombonist Ray Premru wrote forty years later, \\"One of the old school, like Boult, is so refreshing because he will reduce the dynamic level – 'No, no, pianissimo, strings, let the soloist through, less from everyone else.' That is the old idea of balance.\\"As an educator, Boult influenced several generations of musicians, beginning with his conducting class at the Royal College of Music, London, which he ran from 1919 to 1930. As no such classes had been held before in Britain, Boult \\"created its curriculum from out of his own experience. ... From that first small class has come all the later formal training for conductors throughout Britain.\\" In the 1930s Boult ran a series of \\"conferences for conductors\\" at his country house near Guildford, sometimes helped by Vaughan Williams who lived a few miles away.

The U.S. handed power over to Iraq's interim government. 2. The interim government was chosen by the United Nations and Paul Bremer. 3. Paul Bremer is described as the former governor of Iraq. From this information, we can infer the following: - Paul Bremer had a role in choosing the interim government of Iraq along with the United Nations. - Paul Bremer is no longer the governor of Iraq, as he is described as the former governor. However, the information provided does not explicitly state that the U.S. chose Paul Bremer as the new governor of Iraq. It only mentions his involvement in choosing the interim government.

Had the marinated pork burrito. The pork was very good - juicy and flavorful. The rest, however, just wasn't good. The tortilla was noticeably sweet - an interesting touch, but it just didn't work with the rest of the ingredients. Rice was a bit acrid, as well. Despite the good reviews I've seen, it's unfortunately a place that I probably won't be going back to.","response":"The sentiment of the above review can be classified as generally negative. The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with most aspects of the meal they had at the restaurant, except for the marinated pork. In the initial part of the review, the customer acknowledges that the marinated pork burrito was enjoyable because the pork was \\"juicy and flavorful\\". However, this is the only positive aspect identified in the review. The reviewer goes on to express dissatisfaction with other components of the meal. They found the tortilla had been sweetened, which they considered to be an \\"interesting touch,\\" but ultimately decided that this sweetness did not complement the rest of the ingredient in the burrito. This shows that the customer was willing to appreciate innovative cooking choices; however, they felt that this particular innovation did not work. So, this part of the review expresses a disappointed sentiment. Continuing with the negative tone, the reviewer also mentions the rice being \\"a bit acrid\\", which means it had a bitter or harsh taste - clearly, another point that added to their overall discontentment with the meal. In the concluding section, the reviewer reveals their unfortunate conclusion - the fact they would probably not return to the place. Despite acknowledging the good reviews that this place has received from others, their own personal experience did not meet these expectations, which forms another impactful negative sentiment in the review. This suggests a strong negative sentiment because returning to a restaurant is typically a key indicator of customer satisfaction, which, in this instance, is missing. Therefore, while there is a minor positive sentiment noted (i.e., the quality of pork), the overall sentiment expressed in this review is primarily negative. This is based on the dissatisfaction with the majority components of the meal as well as the stated likelihood of not revisiting the restaurant."},{"question":"Answer the questions at the end based on the text. Tu Youyou has become the first Chinese woman to win a Nobel Prize, for her work in helping to create an anti-malaria medicine. The 84-year-old's route to the honour has been anything but traditional. In China, she is being called the \\"three nos\\" winner: no medical degree, no doctorate, and she's never worked overseas. In 1967, malaria, a then deadly disease, spread by mosquitoes was _ Chinese soldiers fighting Americans in the jungles of northern Vietnam. A secret research unit \\"Mission 523 \\"was formed to find a cure for the illness. Two years later, Tu Youyou was instructed to become the new head of \\"Mission 523\\". \\"Mission523\\" read ancient books carefully for a long time to find historical methods of fighting malaria. When she started her search for an anti-malarial drug, more than 240,000 compounds around the world had already been tested, without any success. Finally, the team found a brief reference to one substance, sweet wormwood , which had been used to treat malaria in China around 400 AD. The team took out one active compound in wormwood, and then tested it. But nothing was effective until Tu Youyou returned to the original ancient text. After another careful reading, she changed the drug recipe one final time, heating the compound without allowing it to reach boiling point. After the drug showed promising results in mice and monkeys, Tu Youyou volunteered to be the first human recipient of the new drug. \\" In any case, Tu Youyou is consistently praised for her drive and passion. One former colleague. Lianda Li, says Ms Tu is \\"unsociable and quite straightforward\\", adding that \\"if she disagrees with something, she will say it.\\" Another colleague, Fuming Liao, who has worked with Tu Youyou for more than 40 years, describes her as a \\"tough and stubborn woman\\".

A: A:","response":"In rare instances, structural rearrangements of chromosomes can result in the evolution of a new species. This phenomenon occurs when the rearrangement leads to genetic variation and reproductive isolation, which over time, can give rise to distinct populations with unique characteristics. Structural rearrangements include processes such as inversions, duplications, deletions, and translocations of genetic material within or between chromosomes. These changes can alter gene expression, disrupt gene function, or create entirely new combinations of genetic information, leading to variation within a population. If a particular arrangement provides some form of selective advantage or adaptation, it may be passed on to future generations. Reproductive isolation is a crucial component in the formation of a new species, as it prevents gene flow between separate populations. This isolation can be achieved through factors such as geographic separation, behavioral differences, or genetic incompatibility. Over time, the combination of genetic variation and reproductive isolation allows the populations to diverge significantly, ultimately resulting in the formation of a new species. In summary, although most structural rearrangements of chromosomes may produce nonviable, impaired, or infertile individuals, in rare cases, they can lead to the evolution of a new species by introducing genetic variation and promoting reproductive isolation."},{"question":"Complete the passage. (CNN) -- Chelsea kept the pressure on English Premier League title rivals Arsenal and Manchester City with a dominant victory over Manchester United -- and heaped more trouble on the defending champions. Cameroon striker Samuel Eto'o grabbed his first hat trick for Chelsea to seal a 3-1 win Sunday which edged Chelsea to within two points of league leaders Arsenal. Manchester United had started strongly at Stamford Bridge and the opening strike from Eto'o, which took a heavy deflection, came against the run of play. United pressed on and both Belgian teenage winger Adnan Januzaj and England striker Danny Welbeck came close to equalizing but it was effectively game over when Eto'o pounced again on the stroke of halftime, poking in Gary Cahill's cross.

Manchester United's woes continued as they struggled to find a way back into the match, lacking the cutting edge and creativity to break down a resolute Chelsea defense. Manager David Moyes threw on substitutes Javier Hernandez and Antonio Valencia in an attempt to salvage something from the game, but despite their efforts, it was Chelsea who remained firmly in control. United did manage to pull a consolation goal back when Hernandez found the net late in the game, capitalizing on a rare lapse in the Chelsea back line. However, it was too little, too late for the defending champions, who left Stamford Bridge empty-handed. The victory marked another important milestone for Chelsea manager José Mourinho, who maintained his impressive unbeaten home record in the Premier League, while Manchester United boss David Moyes was left ruing another missed opportunity to make up ground on their title rivals. With this loss, United's hopes of retaining their Premier League crown grew increasingly dim, leaving their fans and pundits questioning the team's direction and future under Moyes' leadership. Meanwhile, Chelsea's triumph further solidified their status as genuine title contenders, keeping them within touching distance of leaders Arsenal and second-placed Manchester City. In a season filled with twists and turns, there's no doubt that the race for the Premier League trophy will continue to captivate football fans around the world in the upcoming months."},{"question":"Q: In this task, you will be shown an English sentence.

Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (May 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Soren, a young barn owl, lives in the Tyto Forest with his family: his father, Noctus; his mother, Marella; his older brother, Kludd; his younger sister, Eglantine; and Mrs. P, the family's nest maid, a kindly blind snake. Soren enjoys listening to the 'Legends of Ga'Hoole,' which are mythical tales of warrior owls called the Guardians who fight against the Pure Ones. Kludd berates his brother's dreams, having grown tired of listening to the stories. When their father teaches them the first steps to flying, Kludd becomes jealous of Soren's natural branching ability. Later, when practicing branching while their parents are hunting, Kludd pushes Soren off a branch which forces them both to fall to the ground. They are attacked by a Tasmanian devil but are saved, and then kidnapped, by two owls, Jatt and Jutt. Along the way, more owlets are revealed to have been kidnapped. Soren meets Gylfie, a young elf owl who is also kidnapped. At St. Aegolius, the owlets are greeted by Nyra, who says that they will be divided into either soldiers or 'pickers'. When Soren and Gylfie protest, they are sorted as pickers while Kludd, who betrays Soren, is sent to be a soldier. Soren and Gylfie avoid being 'moon-blinked' (a catatonic state induced by sleeping under a full moon), while the others do not know and become moon-blinked. They are forced to 'pick' through owl's pellets, scouring for bits of metal 'flecks', which are being used to build a superweapon. They are spotted by Grimble, a boreal owl, who reveals that he works under the Pure Ones only to keep his family safe and that he isn't really a Pure One at all. He teaches them to fly, but Nyra finds out whilst coming to invite Soren to become a soldier. Kludd decides to stay behind and become a Pure One, despite Soren's pleas for him to come with him.

By May 1980, the rebels, with the assistance of a small number of SNA soldiers who continued to help the guerrilla war, controlled a substantial region of the Ogaden. However, by 1981 the insurgents were reduced to sporadic hit-and-run attacks and were finally defeated. In addition, the WSLF and SALF were significantly weakened after the Ogaden War. The former was practically defunct by the late 1980s, with its splinter group, the Ogaden National Liberation Front operating from headquarters in Kuwait. Even though elements of the ONLF would later manage to slip back into the Ogaden, their actions had little impact. For the Barre regime, the invasion was perhaps the greatest strategic blunder since independence, and it weakened the military. Almost one-third of the regular SNA soldiers, three-eighths of the armored units and half of the Somali Air Force were lost. The weakness of the Barre administration led it to effectively abandon the dream of a unified Greater Somalia. The failure of the war aggravated discontent with the Barre regime; the first organized opposition group, the Somali Salvation Democratic Front , was formed by army officers in 1979. The United States adopted Somalia as a Cold War ally from the late 1970s to 1988 in exchange for use of Somali bases, and a way to exert influence upon the region.

The advent of social media platforms has revolutionized the way people communicate, connect, and share information. Retailers and brands have used platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn to reach out to their customers and advertise their products and services to a global audience. This rapid rise of social media has had a significant impact on society at large, affecting everything from political campaigns and advocacy to the way individuals develop relationships and seek validation. Social media platforms have also come under fire for their role in spreading misinformation, fueling division, privacy concerns, and perpetuating negative socio-cultural trends such as cyberbullying. People's reliance on social media platforms for connecting with others, consuming news, and forming opinions has stirred up a debate about the extent to which these platforms have the power to shape perceptions, influence collective action, and ultimately impact societal norms and values. Hypothesis: Greater reliance on social media for news and communication will lead to increased social polarization and reduced face-to-face interactions, ultimately resulting in a society that is more connected yet divided at the same time. Given the increasingly pervasive influence of social media in our daily lives, it is crucial to study the effects of this shift on society. There are concerns that social media may be driving people towards a greater reliance on online interactions versus in-person communication. As a result, society may become more connected in terms of virtual networks, but this could come at the cost of decreased face-to-face engagement, deeper interpersonal connections, and empathy. This phenomenon might be amplified by the echo chambers and filter bubbles created by social media platforms, which tend to expose users to information and viewpoints that align with their existing beliefs. In turn, this limits the diversity of perspectives and contributes to social polarization. Moreover, the propensity of some social media platforms for spreading misinformation and hosting polarizing content enhances the potential for conflict, further deepening societal divides. The digital environment can nurture anonymity, lower inhibitions, and fuel divisive rhetoric that might not be as easily expressed in face-to-face conversations. Therefore, exploring the relationship between our growing dependence on social media and its effects on society will provide valuable insights into what the future may look like if reliance on these platforms continues to grow. Additionally, it will also contribute to the development of effective strategies and interventions aimed at addressing potential challenges associated with their widespread use."},{"question":"What is the most logical completion of this news story?.

One crucial factor to understanding the impact of a rebellion is discerning how widespread it was in terms of geographic area. In this article, we seek to answer the question: How many areas did the rebellion include? Since there have been countless rebellions throughout history, we will focus on a specific case study, the 1857 Indian Rebellion, and provide an overview of its geographical scope. The 1857 Indian Rebellion: Background: The Indian Rebellion of 1857, also known as the First War of Indian Independence or the Mutiny, was a significant uprising against British colonial forces and the East India Company. The main causes of the rebellion were deep-rooted discontent with the policies of the British authorities, the exploitation of Indian resources, cultural clashes, and a widespread loss of confidence in British administration. Geographical Analysis: 1. Initial Regions: The rebellion began in the town of Meerut, 40 miles northeast of Delhi, where Indian soldiers, known as sepoys, mutinied due to numerous grievances against their British officers. Following the initial revolt, the uprising expanded into several other regions. 2. The Core Regions: The core of the rebellion occurred in the north-central and central parts of India, particularly in the provinces of: a. Delhi: The Indian capital became a hub for the rebellious sepoys and Indian leaders. b. Uttar Pradesh: The cities of Meerut, Lucknow, and Cawnpore saw extensive combat and served to motivate the rebellion in other regions. c. Bihar: Notable battles took place in locations such as Arrah and Jagdishpur. 3. Widespread Unrest: The rebellion did not remain limited to the regions mentioned above. Instead, unrest and dissent were observed in multiple regions across India, and conflicts emerged in varying degrees. This widespread unrest was seen in areas such as: a. Madhya Pradesh: The cities of Jhansi and Gwalior saw significant local revolts. b. Rajasthan: The region bore witness to rebellions, as some rulers showed sympathy towards the cause, and soldiers from the region played a crucial role in the conflict. c. Haryana, Mumbai, and Pune: Although the degree of unrest was lower in these regions, skirmishes occurred, and the overall impact of the rebellion was felt. Conclusion: The Indian Rebellion of 1857 encompassed multiple areas, reflecting its vast geographical extent. The core regions included Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, and Bihar, while unrest and conflicts were also prevalent in states such as Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Haryana, Mumbai, and Pune. The rebellion demonstrated the widespread discontent among the Indian population against British rule and the desire for independence. Understanding the extent of this uprising helps us grasp the undeniable influence of key rebellions on the course of human history."},{"question":"Here's a revised version of the severence/policy memo.

Arawak peoples migrated to various Caribbean islands, arriving in Jamaica by the beginning of the eighth century. They were peaceful and lived by \\"slash-and-burn\\" farming. For meat, they bred pigs and ate iguana, both native to the island. They were highly skilled in such manual activities as thatching and weaving. In fact, the hammock was an AmerIndian invention that remains with us today; it is an object which, more than any other, evokes an image of a warm sunny day on a tropical isle. The Arawak left a legacy of paintings in places such as Runaway Caves near Discovery Bay, and shards of pottery found at their settlements near Nueva Sevilla and Spanish Town have added a little to our knowledge about them. Over 200 Arawak sites have been identified, and it is said that when the Spanish arrived in Jamaica there were approximately 100,000 Arawak living on the island. They called Jamaica \\"Xaymaca\\" (\\"land of wood and water\\"). Columbus and the Arrival of Europeans Columbus first arrived in Jamaica on 5 May 1494 at Discovery Bay, where there is now a small park in his honor. He stayed for only a few days but returned in 1502, landing here when the ships of his fleet became unserviceable; he waited at St. Ann's Bay for help to arrive from Cuba. After the death of Columbus in 1505, Jamaica became the property of his son Diego, who dispatched Don Juan de Esquivel to the island as Governor. Esquivel arrived in 1510 and created a base called Nueva Sevilla near St. Ann's Bay, from which he hoped to colonize the rest of the island. The Spanish immediately began subjugating the Arawak population, many of whom died under the yoke of oppression and of diseases carried by the Europeans. A number of them committed suicide rather than live the life created for them by the Spanish. The site of Nueva Sevilla proved to be unhealthy and mosquito-ridden, and in 1534 the Spanish founded Villa de la Vega, today known as Spanish Town. Pig breeding was the main occupation of these early settlers, but they also planted sugar cane and other crops that required large numbers of laborers. The number of Arawak had already fallen dramatically, so the Spanish began to import slaves from Africa to work the land; the first Africans arrived in 1517. Question: \\"What did the Arawak excel at prior to the coming of the Europeans?\\" Response: \\"Sugar cane farming\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?

One of them is a supervisory employee who is being allowed to retire, and another employee has resigned, the agency said. A third agent, another supervisory employee, is being pushed out, with the agency proposing he be removed. A U.S. official said the agent plans to fight his ouster. Another eight members allegedly involved in the scandal are on administrative leave with their security clearances suspended. Scandal raises questions about macho agency culture. The employees are accused of bringing prostitutes to a hotel in Colombia ahead of last week's visit by U.S. President Barack Obama, who was there to attend a pan-American summit. The alleged prostitutes, the youngest of whom are in their early 20s, had all signed in at Cartagena's Hotel El Caribe, where the Secret Service members apparently stayed, flashing their local ID cards. But one of the women, the source said, was involved in a dispute about how much she was allegedly to be paid for the night. That dispute brought the incident to light and sparked controversy in both countries. A review board is expected to be created to determine whether the alleged scandal is an isolated incident or emblematic of a broader agency culture, a source said. \\"The only way they will prevent this from happening again in the future is to find out if this is one particular case or if it's a pattern,\\" said U.S. Rep. Peter King, R-New York, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee. \\"We're working and doing our own investigation and whatever we need from the Secret Service we've been getting,\\" King said. \\"We want a minute-by-minute, hour-by-hour account of what happened, how it happened, what went on, who knew what was happening. And I have no doubt the Secret Service will give us that.\\" As many as 10 U.S. military personnel from all branches of the armed forces are being questioned about potential misconduct, including five members of America's elite Army Special Forces. Obama has said he expects a \\"rigorous\\" investigation. Investigators are also looking into whether drugs were involved, according to a separate source with knowledge of the investigation. Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan has told subordinates to use \\"all tools available\\" to conduct the investigation and has made it known that he believes drug testing is within his rights, the source said. It is not clear whether any of those accused have been tested, and authorities say drug use is not consistent with their findings so far, though they are continuing to investigate the allegations alongside local police. A U.S. official said the Secret Service interviewed all of the maids at the agents' hotel and the maids said they found no drugs in the rooms. The scandal is sure to come up when Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano testifies next week at a previously scheduled Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on oversight of the Department of Homeland Security. The hearing is scheduled for 10 a.m. ET Wednesday. At least one congressman, U.S. Rep. Randy Forbes, R-Virginia, has called for Sullivan to be replaced. \\"There's only so many strikes you get, in baseball it's three,\\" said Forbes, a senior member of the House Armed Serves Committee, referencing a 2009 security breach in which a Virginia couple crashed Obama's first White House state dinner, as well as apparent agency overspending in that same year. \\"I think he's had three,\\" Forbes added. \\"I think it's time to put somebody else in there to make sure we're getting a different culture in the Secret Service.\\" Forbes seeks director's ouster. Sullivan has directed the Secret Service since May 2006. He has been with the agency since 1983. A Colombian official said Wednesday the incident has has overshadowed his country's showcase of the \\"beautiful, calm city\\" of Cartagena during the summit. Nausicrate Perez, a municipal official in Cartagena, said authorities were waiting for more details on the alleged scandal because Cartagena has no confirmation that local people were involved. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, said he is in close touch with Sullivan and believes he is taking \\"serious action\\" to investigate the incident. The Secret Service agents and officers being investigated range in experience from relative newcomers to nearly 20-year veterans, two government officials with knowledge of the investigation said Monday. Each agent was offered an opportunity to take a polygraph test, according to a U.S. official. Some of the agents and military personnel maintain they didn't know the women were prostitutes, the official said. Even so, King said, \\"it was totally wrong to take a foreign national back to a hotel when the president is about to arrive.\\" House Oversight Committee Chairman Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, said he has a high level of confidence in Sullivan. While soliciting prostitution is in most cases legal for adults in Colombia, it is considered a breach of the Secret Service's conduct code, government sources said. Military law also bars service members from patronizing prostitutes, engaging in conduct unbecoming an officer or, for enlisted personnel, conduct \\"prejudicial to good order and discipline.\\" The military personnel allegedly involved were sent to Colombia to support the Secret Service. A military official who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigation told CNN that two of those being questioned are Marines and that Air Force and Navy personnel also are being questioned. CNN's National Security Contributor Fran Townsend, Juan Carlos Lopez, Dana Bash, Bob Kovach, John King, Barbara Starr, Jessica Yellin, Deirdre Walsh, Ted Barrett and journalist Fernando Ramos contributed to this report.

So long the hunter over the course of the current campaign, Hamilton is back in front for only the second time this season in the wake of the events in Sunday's Singapore Grand Prix. After bitter rival and Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg retired after 14 laps following a wiring loom failure in the steering column of his car, Hamilton went on to take the chequered flag. Lewis Hamilton dominated in Singapore to take a lead in the championship over teammate Nico Rosberg. The 29-year-old now has a three-point lead going into the final five races of the season, starting with next weekend's race in Japan, and followed swiftly a week later by the inaugural Russian Grand Prix. But despite the man now being hunted, Hamilton said: 'Nothing changes. 'I have believed, since the time I started training for this season, that I can win the world championship this year. 'And with a great car like this, even with some of the difficulties I've had, you know you are still within shooting range. 'You have to keep that positivity, belief and hope - hope is one of the most powerful things in the world - and I carry that with me each weekend. The Brit says he was always positive and won't change his mindset now he leads the way. 'I haven't lost that vision or that dream, that's still there, and I didn't leave Singapore thinking the title is more of a possibility. 'In my mind I'm still hunting for it and I've got to go just as hard, if not harder, over these final races. I've just got to keep going.' After winning the last two races from pole position, Hamilton would appear to have momentum on his side. But given Mercedes' unreliability of late, he is also aware of how quickly a situation can turn. 'Momentum is not something I generally talk about because it can be snatched away,' added Hamilton. Hamilton may have the momentum but Rosberg has shown how quickly it can all change over a season. 'Look at Nico. He had momentum from good results, and then one DNF (did not finish) and it was snatched away. 'I've also had that, so you just have to take it one race at a time. 'But I'm happy I've been at my best, getting the (recent) pole positions, maximising all the races.

The senior Ryan operated a newspaper delivery service for the Houston Post that required him to rise in the early morning hours to prepare 1,500 newspapers for delivery over a 55-mile route. The children were expected to help with the daily tasks. In 1965, after graduating from Alvin High School, Ryan was drafted by the New York Mets in the 12th round of the 1965 Major League Baseball draft. He was assigned the minor league Marion Mets in the Appalachian League. When Ryan was called up to the New York club the following year, he was the second-youngest player in the league. His first strikeout was Pat Jarvis, and he gave up his first major league home run to Joe Torre, a future NL MVP and Hall of Fame big-league manager. Ryan missed much of the 1967 season due to illness, an arm injury, and service with the Army Reserve; he pitched only 7 innings for the Mets' minor league affiliate in Jacksonville. Ryan returned to the major leagues to stay starting with the 1968 season. Ryan was unable to crack the Mets' pitching rotation, led by Tom Seaver and Jerry Koosman. Ryan was used more as a reliever and spot starter by the 1969 Mets. To deal with frequent blisters on his throwing hand he often soaked his fingers in pickle brine, although the technique's effectiveness was questioned by Ryan's teammates and coaches. Ryan pitched well for the Miracle Mets in the 1969 postseason. Against the Braves in the NLCS, Ryan completed a Mets sweep by throwing seven innings of relief in Game 3, getting his first playoff win (it would take him 12 years to get another). Then in the 1969 World Series, Ryan saved Game 3, pitching 2 1/3 shutout innings against the Baltimore Orioles. The Game 3 victory gave the Mets a 2-1 lead in the Series, which they went on to win in five games. It would be Ryan's only World Series appearance in his career. On April 18, 1970, Ryan tied a Mets record by striking out 15 batters in one game. Four days later, Ryan's teammate, Tom Seaver, topped it with a then MLB record 19 against the San Diego Padres (though Ryan would tie this record four years later). Ryan has credited his time with Seaver and the Mets with turning him from just a flamethrower to a pitcher. Contrary to popular belief, Ryan never wanted to be traded from the Mets and felt betrayed by the team that drafted him. His views on this only calmed once he started running the Rangers and gained a better understanding of the business side of baseball. did he have any other records?","response":"Yes, Nolan Ryan had other records. In the article, it says that on April 18, 1970, he tied a Mets record by striking out 15 batters in one game. Then, four days later, his teammate Tom Seaver set a new MLB record with 19 strikeouts in a game. However, Ryan would eventually tie this record four years later. So, Nolan Ryan had a record for striking out lots of batters, which is really good in baseball!"},{"question":"Hawk(e): The Movie is an independent comedy film co-directed by Phil Baker and Tom Turner and written by Phil Baker.

A step-by-step solution is:","response":"The given statement, \\"Four businessmen waiting at an outside food stand,\\" provides no information about the presence or absence of women at a meeting. It only provides information about the businessmen. To make any judgment about whether \\"The women are inside at a meeting\\" is true or not, we would need more context or additional information. Here's a step-by-step explanation: Step 1: Identify the components of the first statement: - Four businessmen - Waiting at an outside food stand Step 2: Examine the components of the second statement: - The women: There is no mention of women in the first statement, so there is no connection established between the businessmen and any women. - Inside at a meeting: There is no information provided about a meeting in the first statement, so it's unclear whether or not such a meeting is taking place or if women are attending. Step 3: Consider the relationship between the two statements. - There is no direct relationship based on the information provided. Step 4: Identify any assumptions. - The claim that \\"The women are inside at a meeting\\" is an assumption that is not supported by the information in the first statement. One might guess or speculate about the women's location, but further information is needed to make such a determination. Conclusion: Based on the information provided in the given statement about the four businessmen, it is not possible to determine whether the claim \\"The women are inside at a meeting\\" is true or not. Without additional context or information, we cannot draw any conclusions about the women's location or activities."},{"question":"Give the step-by-step reasoning process and then the final answer. In the Golden State Team, each player earned points. Draymond earned 12 points, Curry earned twice the points as Draymond, Kelly earned 9, Durant earned twice the points as Kelly, Klay earned half the points as Draymond. How many points did the Golden States have in total?","response":"Step 1: Determine the number of points Curry earned. Since Curry earned twice the points as Draymond and Draymond earned 12 points, we can find Curry's points by: Curry's points = 2 * Draymond's points = 2 * 12 = 24 points Step 2: Determine the number of points Durant earned. Since Durant earned twice the points as Kelly and Kelly earned 9 points, we can find Durant's points by: Durant's points = 2 * Kelly's points = 2 * 9 = 18 points Step 3: Determine the number of points Klay earned. Since Klay earned half the points as Draymond and Draymond earned 12 points, we can find Klay's points by: Klay's points = 0.5 * Draymond's points = 0.5 * 12 = 6 points Step 4: Calculate the total points earned by the Golden State Team. Total points = Draymond's points + Curry's points + Kelly's points + Durant's points + Klay's points Total points = 12 + 24 + 9 + 18 + 6 = 69 points So, the Golden State Team earned a total of 69 points."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Pick the option in line with common sense to answer the question. Questions: James had almost religious reverence for Bill, but Bill didn't return the feelings. How did Bill treat James. Options: - profanity - content - irreverence - blasphemy - contempt Answer:","response":"Based on the available options and in line with common sense, it can be inferred that Bill treated James with \\"irreverence\\". This answer is chosen as the best fit because it contrasts with the strong, almost religious admiration that James has for Bill. Irreverence implies that Bill does not hold James in the same high regard, and may not take their relationship seriously or give it the level of respect that James does. This option highlights the disparity in how they view and treat each other. The other options do not fit as well for various reasons: - Profanity: This option would suggest that Bill uses foul language or offensive expressions in response to James' admiration, but it does not address the actual treatment or emotional aspect of their relationship. - Content: While this term can be used to describe a person's emotions, in this context it is not specific enough to address the disparity between James' reverence and Bill's potential indifference or disdain. - Blasphemy: This option is closely related to religious disrespect and primarily refers to speaking sacrilegiously about sacred things or figures. It doesn't fit the context of interpersonal relationships in this scenario. - Contempt: Contempt is the feeling that a person or a thing is beneath consideration, worthless, or deserving of scorn.

In this multiple-choice question, the correct answer is \\"Tyrone Garrett is in bed, Garrett heads to the gym again.\\" This answer is correct because it connects to the earlier part of the passage, which talks about Garrett's attempts to improve his health and make positive changes. Furthermore, it refers to the correct person, Tyrone Garrett, whose actions are the focus of the passage. The other options are incorrect for various reasons: 1. \\"CNN is in bed, Garrett heads to the gym again.\\" - CNN is a news organization and not a person who would go to bed. This option is unrelated to the main subject of the passage (Tyrone Garrett). 2. \\"Garrett is in bed, Garrett heads to the gym again.\\" – This answer is illogical, as the sentence contradicts itself by saying Garrett is both in bed and heading to the gym at the same time. 3. \\"Hammond is in bed, Garrett heads to the gym again.\\" - Hammond is mentioned in the passage, but this sentence places the focus on her rather than Tyrone Garrett. 4. \\"London is in bed, Garrett heads to the gym again.\\" - There is no reference to anyone named London in the passage.

Those of African descent increased slightly from 30.8% to 32.3% during the first period (1980 and 1991) before falling to 30.2% in the 2002 census. With small growth in the overall population, the decline in the shares of the two larger groups has resulted in the relative increase of shares of the multiracial and Amerindian groups.

I want to lay out the solution in details.","response":"Sentence A: \\"The doctors composed a song in a studio\\" This sentence does not make much sense because doctors are medical professionals whose primary line of work is to diagnose and treat patients. While doctors can certainly engage in creative endeavors like composing music, it is not typically associated with their profession. This sentence might be surprising or seen as unusual, although it's still possible that a group of doctors could compose a song in their free time. Sentence B: \\"The musicians composed a song in a studio\\" This sentence makes perfect sense because musicians are professionals who create, perform, and compose music. Composing a song in a studio is a common activity for musicians, as it's where they can refine their art and produce their work. In conclusion, Sentence A does not make as much sense as Sentence B due to the association between the professionals and their typical activities. Sentence B aligns better with our expectations of what musicians do, while Sentence A introduces an element of surprise due to the unexpected combination of doctors and music composition. However, it's important to note that the doctors composing a song is not impossible; it's just not commonly associated with their profession."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

As the Marines leave, one Marine remains and makes his way towards the exit. The soldiers name is Jesse Rodriguez (Freddy Rodriguez). The film cuts to a house where a man, Edy Rodriguez (Alfred Molina) is on a ladder nailing up a welcome home sign for Jesse. The woman, his wife, Anna Rodriguez (Elizabeth Pena) gives him a rather disgruntled look before leaving to prepare for Jesse's return.Edy then travels to his store, a small neighbourhood supermarket. Along the way, and even in the store, Edy appears to be quite popular with the ladies.Back at the airport, Jesse finally meets up with his friends Johnny (Luis Gusman) and Ozzy (Jay Hernandez), who have come to pick him up. On the way to his fathers store, Jesse takes off his eye-patch to reveal that he can still see, but the area around his eye is badly injured. After some prompting from Johnny and Ozzy, he reveals that he was the lucky one, as his friend Timmy (I think that was his name, he never shows up in the film) was not as lucky and Jesse feels some guilt for this. On the way, the three pass a park and Jesse tells them to stop. The park was their childhood playground and the three take a little time off to play a game of softball and reminisce. While at the park, Ozzy spots Hector (Alexander Bautista), the man who killed his brother, recently been released from prison.

In French, the adjective \\"nouvelles\\" (new) is placed before the noun \\"mesures\\" (measures). Since \\"mesures\\" is a feminine plural noun, \\"nouvelles\\" takes the feminine plural form, thus it is \\"nouvelles\\" and not \\"nouveaux\\". - \\"to protect\\" is translated to \\"pour protéger\\". In this situation, \\"pour\\" serves the purpose of expressing the intention or goal of the new measures, and \\"protéger\\" is the infinitive form of the verb \\"to protect\\" in French. - \\"Canadians\\" would be translated to \\"les Canadiens\\". In French, \\"Canadien\\" refers to a male Canadian and \\"Canadienne\\" refers to a female Canadian. In some cases, the masculine form can be used to refer to both male and female Canadians in a group. Additionally, the French language requires the use of a definite article \\"les\\" before the plural form of the noun \\"Canadiens\\". - \\"17 October 2006\\" is translated to \\"17 octobre 2006\\".

Every broken limb or root, or deep wound from fire, insects, or falling timber, may afford an entrance for decay, which, once started, may penetrate to all parts of the trunk. The larvae of many insects bore into the trees and their tunnels remain indefinitely as sources of weakness. Whatever advantages, however, that sapwood may have in this connection are due solely to its relative age and position.\\" Answer: The answer to this question is:","response":"The breakdown of trees begins when there are broken limbs, roots or deep wounds caused by factors like fire, insects, or falling timber. These damages afford an entrance for decay which, once started, can spread to the entire trunk. The presence of insect larvae can also contribute to this breakdown, as they bore into the trees creating tunnels as sources of vulnerability."},{"question":"Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it?

Question 2: Do distance relationships work? How can you make it work? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","response":"No, the two questions are not asking the same thing. They are related, but they approach the topic of long-distance relationships from different angles. Question 1: “How do I survive a long distance relationship?” is requesting practical advice or strategies to make a long-distance relationship work. The user is likely in a long-distance relationship and wants to know what steps to take to keep the relationship healthy. Question 2: “Do distance relationships work? How can you make it work?” is broken down into two parts. The first part queries the possibility or likelihood of a long-distance relationship being successful, which is a more theoretical question. The second part is somewhat similar to Question 1, asking for advice on maintaining a successful long-distance relationship. This is my process of analyzing the questions: 1. Reading each question carefully to understand what specifically is being asked. 2. Comparing the key themes and specific questions between the two. 3. Recognizing that while they both center around the topic of long-distance relationships, they take different approaches: one is more practical/step-focused, while the other includes a theoretical query as well as a practical one."},{"question":"Single/multi-select question: Is it possible to conclude that \\"A person on a bike covered in mud from head to toe.\\" if \\"a person on a bike on the weekend\\"?

Answer:","response":"Mary Stuart Masterson starred in the musical \\"Nine,\\" which is indeed based on Federico Fellini's semi-autobiographical film \\"8½.\\" For a bit more background, \\"8½\\" was an Italian film released in 1963. Federico Fellini directed this critically acclaimed movie which famously delves into the creative struggles of a filmmaker suffering from \\"director's block.\\" The film drew heavily on Fellini's own life and experiences, making it semi-autobiographical in nature. Approximately two decades later, in 1982, the film was adapted into a Broadway stage musical titled \\"Nine,\\" with music and lyrics by Maury Yeston and a book by Arthur Kopit. It was a fairly unique concept for a musical, involving a central male character and several female characters that revolve around him, bringing to life the complexities and internal conflicts of the protagonist as presented in Fellini's film. Mary Stuart Masterson, a renowned American actress, is known for her varied roles in film, stage, and television. Her performances have ranged from the tomboyish 'Idgie' in \\"Fried Green Tomatoes\\" to the sweet-natured 'Joon' in \\"Benny & Joon,\\" showcasing her remarkable range and versatility. Masterson graced the stage in the revival of \\"Nine,\\" portraying the character of 'Luisa Contini.' The show ran from April 10, 2003 to December 14, 2003 at the Eugene O'Neill Theatre on Broadway. In this role, Masterson portrayed the weary, ignored, but devoted wife of the protagonist 'Guido Contini' (Fellini's alter-ego), capturing the complex emotional landscape of their marital relationship. While \\"Nine\\" is a male-centered narrative mainly focusing on Guido’s perspective, the female characters including Luisa, contribute significantly to the mood and depth of the story. Her performance in the musical was praised and she showed a powerful dramatic and vocal range throughout. Whether or not you're a fan of Fellini's \\"8½,\\" the musical version offers a compelling exploration of similar themes, and Mary Stuart Masterson's performance certainly added to its impact on the Broadway stage."},{"question":"Article: Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and other big cities are exciting places to live.

Couric was a special correspondent for ABC News, based in New York, a role she has incorporated into her talk show. Her first appearance on the network was a Sarah Jessica Parker interview on Nightline. Couric co-anchored coverage of the 10th anniversary of the September 11 attacks, alongside Diane Sawyer, Christiane Amanpour, Barbara Walters, Elizabeth Vargas, George Stephanopoulos, and Robin Roberts. Couric was hosting Today on NBC at the time of the attacks, and led CBS News's coverage of the 5th anniversary. Couric also guest co-hosted The View and Live! with Regis and Kelly. Couric interviewed Lady Gaga in primetime on Thanksgiving as part of A Very Gaga Thanksgiving.

This particular confession of faith is considered an important doctrinal document among Baptists, as it provides a statement of their beliefs and principles. Alongside other historically significant Baptist documents, such as the 1689 London Baptist Confession of Faith and the 1742 Philadelphia Baptist Confession, the 1833 New Hampshire Baptist Confession of Faith has had a significant impact on the development of Baptist theology and practice. The New Hampshire Baptist Confession of Faith was drafted by a committee of Baptist theologians and ministers, led by Reverend John Newton Brown. The confession was developed as a response to some of the challenges faced by the Baptist denomination in the United States at the time, particularly the rise of different theological perspectives and the need for a clear, unified statement of Baptist beliefs. The confession consists of 18 articles, which cover essential Christian doctrines such as the inspiration and authority of the Scriptures, the doctrine of the Trinity, the person and work of Christ, the nature of humanity, the doctrine of salvation, the role and function of the church, and the end times. Each article is written in a concise and clear manner, making the confession easily accessible and readable. Upon its completion, the New Hampshire Baptist Confession of Faith was quickly adopted by many Baptist churches and associations in the United States. Its influence extended beyond the Baptist denomination, as it was also used as a basis for other evangelical confessions and statements of faith in the 19th and 20th centuries. Today, the New Hampshire Baptist Confession of Faith remains an important doctrinal document for Baptists worldwide. It continues to provide a solid foundation for understanding and articulating the core principles and beliefs of the Baptist faith, helping to guide and shape the theological perspectives and practices of Baptist churches and their members."},{"question":"Write a sentence about the following things: advertise, hotel, identify, item, poster","response":"The local luxury hotel, renowned for its impeccable service and elegant ambiance, recently launched an enticing advertising campaign featuring a visually captivating poster that skilfully identified the various exclusive items and amenities offered to their distinguished guests, effectively showcasing their commitment towards providing the ultimate hospitality experience."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.

The pump is our only hope.\\" The two boys ran further until they came to a heavy pump. They helped to pull it to a stream not far from the village. Soon the pump was working well so the boys went to watch the fire. It had already reached the edge of the village. The boys saw that two houses were on fire, and the flames were attacking a third building. Suddenly there was a shout from one of the villagers. \\"Keep away!\\" a voice shouted. \\"There's paint stored in that building.\\" The boys and villagers moved away quickly. With a loud explosion , the whole building burst into flames, sending clouds of thick black smoke into the sky. At this time Peter and Jim began to think that the whole village would be burnt to the ground. The firemen had left the burning buildings and were pouring water onto the neighboring houses, trying to stop the fire from spreading. Then the wind died down. A second pump was brought up to help, and the fire was gradually put out. \\"It's soon finished,\\" Peter said to his friend. \\"We must go or we shall get home late.\\" \\"Yes, come on,\\" agreed Jim, and with a last look at the ruins, they walked back to their bicycles.

Since 2000, the UK government has pursued a policy of dispersal of Immigration to the United Kingdom since 1922 to ease pressure on social housing in the London area. The city is also home to some 8,406 (1.42%) Polish people. Since the United Kingdom Census 2001 the population decline has been reversed. The population was static for a time; but due to migration from other parts of Scotland as well as immigration from overseas, the population has begun to grow. The population of the city council area was 593,245 in 2011 and around 2,300,000 people live in the Glasgow travel to work area.

Some 11,800 British Empire soldiers, most of them Indians, became prisoners after the Siege of Kut in Mesopotamia in April 1916; 4,250 died in captivity. Although many were in a poor condition when captured, Ottoman officers forced them to march 1,100 kilometres to Anatolia. A survivor said: \\"We were driven along like beasts; to drop out was to die.\\" The survivors were then forced to build a railway through the Taurus Mountains. In Russia, when the prisoners from the Czech Legion of the Austro-Hungarian army were released in 1917, they re-armed themselves and briefly became a military and diplomatic force during the Russian Civil War. While the Allied prisoners of the Central Powers were quickly sent home at the end of active hostilities, the same treatment was not granted to Central Power prisoners of the Allies and Russia, many of whom served as forced labour, e.g., in France until 1920. They were released only after many approaches by the Red Cross to the Allied Supreme Council. German prisoners were still being held in Russia as late as 1924. Question: By how many years more were the Central Power prisoners of the Allies and Russia held than the prisoners from the Czech Legion of the Austro-Hungarian army? Answer:","response":"To answer the question, we will need to compare the timelines of the two groups of prisoners specified in the question: the Central Power prisoners of the Allies and Russia and the prisoners from the Czech Legion of the Austro-Hungarian army. According to the context given, the prisoners from the Czech Legion of the Austro-Hungarian army were released in 1917. On the other hand, the Central Power prisoners of the Allies and Russia were held until 1920 in France, according to the Red Cross approaches to the Allied Supreme Council. The difference will be 1920 - 1917 = 3 years. So, the Central Power prisoners of the Allies and Russia were held 3 years longer than the prisoners from the Czech Legion of the Austro-Hungarian army."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: FINAL EXAM Question 1.

The tropical thermocline is typically deeper than the thermocline at higher latitudes. Polar waters, which receive relatively little solar energy, are not stratified by temperature and generally lack a thermocline because surface water at polar latitudes are nearly as cold as water at greater depths. Below the thermocline, water is very cold, ranging from −1 °C to 3 °C. Because this deep and cold layer contains the bulk of ocean water, the average temperature of the world ocean is 3.9 °C. Now, I have a new situation: Keith was measuring the attributes of thermoclines. He selected two locations. One is near Miami, which is in the tropic. The other is near New York, which is in higher latitude. In total, he took four samples, sample A, sample B, sample C, and sample D. From Miami thermocline he took sample A. Then from below Miami thermocline he took sample B. From New York thermocline he took sample C. Finally, from below New York thermocline he took sample D. Answer this question please: Which thermocline would be deeper, sample A or sample C? The answer is:","response":"Sample A would be associated with a deeper thermocline. This is because the tropical thermocline, such as the one in Miami, is typically deeper than the thermocline at higher latitudes, like the one in New York. The reason behind this is that tropical waters receive more solar energy, causing a greater contrast in temperature between the surface waters and deeper waters.

War work again brought local prosperity during World War II, this time centered on Boeing aircraft. The war dispersed the city's numerous Japanese-American businessmen due to the Japanese American internment. After the war, the local economy dipped. It rose again with Boeing's growing dominance in the commercial airliner market. Seattle celebrated its restored prosperity and made a bid for world recognition with the Century 21 Exposition, the 1962 World's Fair. Another major local economic downturn was in the late 1960s and early 1970s, at a time when Boeing was heavily affected by the oil crises, loss of Government contracts, and costs and delays associated with the Boeing 747. Many people left the area to look for work elsewhere, and two local real estate agents put up a billboard reading \\"Will the last person leaving Seattle – Turn out the lights.\\"Seattle remained the corporate headquarters of Boeing until 2001, when the company separated its headquarters from its major production facilities; the headquarters were moved to Chicago.

They argue such an analogy fails because physical property is generally rivalrous while intellectual works are non-rivalrous (that is, if one makes a copy of a work, the enjoyment of the copy does not prevent enjoyment of the original). Other arguments along these lines claim that unlike the situation with tangible property, there is no natural scarcity of a particular idea or information: once it exists at all, it can be re-used and duplicated indefinitely without such re-use diminishing the original. Stephan Kinsella has objected to intellectual property on the grounds that the word \\"property\\" implies scarcity, which may not be applicable to ideas. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Who is one advocate of copyleft?","response":"One advocate of copyleft is Richard Stallman, a prominent software freedom activist and computer programmer. He is best known for founding the Free Software Foundation (FSF) in 1985 and launching the GNU Project, which aimed to develop a free Unix-like operating system, in 1983. Stallman is also the creator of the GNU General Public License (GPL), one of the most widely used copyleft licenses in the world. By introducing the concept of copyleft, he emphasized the importance of maintaining the free distribution and modification of software and information, ensuring that derivative works remain available under the same terms as the original. The copyleft movement is deeply rooted in Stallman's philosophy of free software, which seeks to guarantee that software users have the rights to run, study, share, and modify the software they use."},{"question":"Given the following question, let's solve step-by-step. Is the following statement true? \\"A Frogman (or men) don't see a lot of actual use.\\"","response":"First, let's break down the question and understand the context. A \\"Frogman\\" refers to a specialized type of military personnel trained in scuba diving or swimming underwater in a tactical capacity. They are primarily associated with naval operations and are also known as combat divers, special operations force members, or underwater operators. Frogmen are used for various missions, including reconnaissance, sabotage, intelligence collection, and underwater demolitions. Now, let's address the statement in question: \\"A Frogman (or men) don't see a lot of actual use.\\" To determine the accuracy of this statement, we'll look at some key factors: 1. Types of missions or operations involving frogmen 2. Frequency of these missions 1. Types of missions or operations involving frogmen: Frogmen play significant roles in naval special operations, particularly in: - Reconnaissance: They often scout enemy positions and gather critical information about enemy fortifications, activities, and equipment. - Sabotage: Frogmen may conduct covert, underwater sabotage missions targeting enemy ships, submarines, or infrastructure. - Underwater demolitions: They may be tasked with clearing underwater obstacles, such as mines, to enable the passage of friendly vessels. - Search and recovery: Frogmen are often utilized in search and recovery missions, like locating and retrieving sunken equipment or debris, and in rescue operations. - Combat support: Frogmen can provide support during naval assaults by covertly taking out enemy defenses, marking targets, or securing objectives. 2. Frequency of these missions: The frequency of missions involving frogmen varies depending on global and regional security situations. However, it can be inferred that frogmen do see actual use in special operations, especially given the increasing reliance on special operations forces and the evolving maritime security landscape. In conclusion, frogmen see actual use in various types of missions and operations. While the frequency of these missions may not be as high as traditional military personnel, it is inaccurate to say that frogmen, as a whole, don't see a lot of actual use. They hold a crucial role in naval special operations and their skills and expertise remain valuable for strategic and tactical purposes."},{"question":"What would be the ★-rating of this review (★ being the lowest and ★★★★★ being the highest)? \\"The viewer truncates my games at any point any time.

Stream of Consciousness Reasoning: When thinking about the possibility of humans surviving on Mars without any life-sustaining equipment, we must consider various factors that determine human survival. Firstly, the atmosphere on Mars is composed of about 96% carbon dioxide, 1.9% argon, 1.9% nitrogen, and trace amounts of oxygen and water vapor. This atmosphere isn't breathable for humans, and without any equipment providing oxygen, they would be unable to breathe and survive. Secondly, the average temperature on Mars is about -80 degrees Fahrenheit, with nighttime temperatures dropping as low as -195 Fahrenheit. The extreme cold would quickly lead to hypothermia and freezing, and humans would not be able to survive without proper insulation and climate control. In addition, the lack of any equipment would mean no source of heat. Thirdly, Mars has significantly lower gravity than Earth, only about 38% of Earth's gravity. Prolonged exposure to this lower gravity environment could lead to muscle atrophy and bone loss, posing challenges to human health and survival. Lastly, the lack of water on Mars is a significant obstacle. While there are ice deposits and some water in the soil, these sources would not be sufficient to adequately sustain human life without proper equipment to extract and purify them. Taking all these factors into consideration, it's clear that the answer to the question of whether humans can survive on Mars without any life-sustaining equipment is no."},{"question":"Information: - Lady Jane Cavendish ( 1621 -- 1669 ) was a noted poet and playwright .

Marked by vitality , integrity , perseverance , and creativity , Jane 's life and works tell the story of a Royalist woman 's indomitable spirit during the English Civil War and Restoration in England . - The English Civil War (16421651) was a series of armed conflicts and political machinations between Parliamentarians (\\"Roundheads\\") and Royalists (\\"Cavaliers\\") over, principally, the manner of England's government. The first (164246) and second (164849) wars pitted the supporters of King Charles I against the supporters of the Long Parliament, while the third (164951) saw fighting between supporters of King Charles II and supporters of the Rump Parliament. The war ended with the Parliamentarian victory at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651. - Worcester is a city in Worcestershire, England, southwest of Birmingham and north of Gloucester. The population is approximately 100,000. The River Severn flanks the western side of the city centre, which is overlooked by the 12th-century Worcester Cathedral. - Chelsea is an affluent area in southwest London, bounded to the south by the River Thames. Its frontage runs from Chelsea Bridge along the Chelsea Embankment, Cheyne Walk, Lots Road and Chelsea Harbour. Its eastern boundary was once defined by the River Westbourne, which is now in a pipe above Sloane Square tube station. The modern eastern boundary is Chelsea Bridge Road and the lower half of Sloane Street, including Sloane Square. To the north and northwest, the area fades into Knightsbridge and Brompton, but it is considered that the area north of King's Road as far northwest as Fulham Road is part of Chelsea. The football club Chelsea F.C. is based at Stamford Bridge in neighbouring Fulham. - Roundhead was the name given to the supporters of the Parliament of England during the English Civil War. Also known as Parliamentarians, they fought against Charles I of England and his supporters, the Cavaliers or Royalists, who claimed rule by absolute monarchy and the divine right of kings. The goal of the Roundhead party was to give the Parliament supreme control over executive administration. - Viscount Newhaven was a title in the Peerage of Scotland. It was created in 1681 for Charles Cheyne (or Cheyney), Member of Parliament and Clerk of the Pipe. He was made Lord Cheyne at the same time, also in the Peerage of Scotland. He married Lady Jane Cavendish, daughter of the first Duke of Newcastle and had a son, William Cheyne, who became 2nd Viscount Newhaven. William was a landowner in Chelsea, London, having purchased Henry VIII's palace. He died in 1728 leaving no male heir, the titles becoming extinct. - The Battle of Worcester took place on 3 September 1651 at Worcester, England, and was the final battle of the English Civil War. Oliver Cromwell's Parliamentarian \\"New Model Army\\", 28,000 strong, defeated King Charles II's 16,000 Royalists, of whom the vast majority were Scottish. - Cavalier first used by Roundheads as a term of abuse for the wealthier male Royalist supporters of King Charles I and his son Charles II of England during the English Civil War, the Interregnum, and the Restoration (1642 c. 1679). It was later adopted by the Royalists themselves. Although it referred originally to political and social attitudes and behaviour, of which clothing was a very small part, it has subsequently become strongly identified with the fashionable clothing of the court at the time. Prince Rupert, commander of much of Charles I's cavalry, is often considered to be an archetypal Cavalier. - The Peerage of Scotland is the section of the Peerage of the British Isles for those peers created by the King of Scots before 1707. Following that year's Treaty of Union, the Kingdom of Scots and the Kingdom of England were combined under the name of Great Britain, and a new Peerage of Great Britain was introduced in which subsequent titles were created. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south.

They lease cellphone towers and produce industrial sensors. Together, they have earned many of the top spots on this year’s Globe 100 list. Technology, broadly defined, has been the business bedrock of the Globe 100 for the past 25 years. Individual companies, and sometimes entire industries, have come and gone over that time. But the powerful influence of technology has always been reflected on the annual list of top public companies in Massachusetts. And it’s a big factor again in the Globe 100 of 2013. This year’s top 10 companies include the likes of Cubist Pharmaceuticals Inc., a Lexington developer of anti-infection drugs; Weston-based Biogen Idec Inc., which makes treatments for multiple sclerosis and other afflictions; and Parexel International Corp., a Waltham company that’s seeing brisk growth handling clinical drug trials for other firms. A number of this year’s top-performing companies hail from the computer, software, and telecommunications arenas. There’s voice-recognition technology from Nuance Communications Inc. of Burlington, cellphone and broadcast towers from American Tower Corp. of Boston, and fiber lasers for telecom and medical and other applications from IPG Photonics Corp. of Oxford. Strength in these areas comes as no surprise to Robert F. Clifford 3d with the New England Public Policy Center at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. When it comes to employment in the Boston area, “the major driver since the great recession has been computer systems, design, and related serv­ices,’’ he said. And over the past decade, scientific research and development serv­ices have surged 50 percent. “It’s the fastest growing industry in the Boston metropolitan area,’’ Clifford said. All told, technology, telecom, and biotech dominate the Globe 100, occupying 40 of the slots. But go deeper into the list and you’ll also find other sectors well represented, with 22 financial companies — insurers, banks, and investment firms — and 10 services firms, another important profession in the region that encompasses consultants, engineers, and architects. Many highly ranked companies made big jumps upward on the 2013 list. Smith & Wesson Holding Corp., the Springfield gun maker, was unranked last year but stands atop the Globe 100 for 2013. Cubist jumped from number 76 to number six. Parexel leaped from number 79 to number five. Many companies reached their perch on this year’s list despite an economy still struggling to regain its vigor. TJX Cos. of Framingham, a retailer to frugal shoppers, earned the number two spot on the list, rising from number 17. It posted revenue of 25.9 billion, more than any other company, followed by defense manufacturer Raytheon Co. of Waltham and data-storage giant EMC Corp. of Hopkinton. Both made the Globe 100’s top 20. A revived IPO market helped some companies make their way onto the list with high rankings. TripAdvisor Inc., the online travel-booking company based in Newton, arrived at number 11, and Dunkin’ Brands Group, owner of the Dunkin’ Donuts franchise, came in at number 17. A number of industrial companies also are featured on the list, like Cabot Corp. of Boston, which makes specialty chemicals and materials, and Sensata Technologies Holding of Attleboro, a maker of automotive sensors and controls for a number of industries. And while many of these companies posted strong revenue growth last year, executives still seem leery about the economy. Some have suggested they don’t expect a full recovery until 2014. For 25 years, the Globe 100 has tracked the strivers of the Massachusetts economy through all of its ups and downs. This year’s list once again documents the best performances, a few fresh faces, and the enduring commercial power of technology. Summary:","response":"Technology, telecom, and biotech firms have remained the driving force behind Massachusetts' economy, as highlighted in the Globe 100 list of top public companies. These industries have contributed substantially towards employment and sustained growth in the area. The list also shows representation from financial companies, services firms, and industrial companies, showcasing a diverse economic landscape for Massachusetts. The enduring commercial power of technology maintains its presence in the state's business scene."},{"question":"Translate \\"An economic and monetary union without effective and adequate social adjustment is not acceptable and would be intolerable for all workers, both white- and blue-collar.\\" to Finnish?","response":"\\"Taloudellinen ja rahaliitto ilman tehokasta ja riittävää sosiaalista sopeutumista ei ole hyväksyttävää ja olisi sietämätöntä kaikille työntekijöille, sekä valko- että sinikaulustyöntekijöille.\\" In this translation, it is important to note that I have translated the different parts of the sentence, while considering the particular nuances of the Finnish language.

While digging for a project, workers from LexCorp unearth the spaceship of Doomsday, a genetically-engineered super-soldier. The creature is highly hostile toward anything that moves; it kills the digging crew and begins a bloody rampage towards Metropolis. Superman and Doomsday engage in a battle until Superman kills Doomsday and succumbs to his own injuries. Lex Luthor (James Marsters) kills his personal assistant Mercy Graves to ensure no one else knows of LexCorp's involvement. The world mourns and Metropolis honors him with a memorial.

Therefore, it is true that the specific issue #37 of the Showcase series was published by DC Comics; however, we cannot definitively conclude that all Showcase comics are only published by DC Comics without further investigation. \\"Showcase\\" is a well-known comic book series published by DC Comics, which began its run in 1956. The series provided readers with a platform to explore new characters or storylines before they potentially transitioned into their own dedicated comic book series. This anthology format allowed DC Comics to test the popularity of different characters and concepts without committing to long-term individual series right away. Throughout its history, Showcase featured various comic book genres and characters such as science fiction, westerns, supernatural, and superheroes, including, but not limited to, the Flash, Green Lantern, and Lois Lane. It's important to note, however, that this information was not explicitly stated in the given description. Thus, considering the historical context and the fact that the Metal Men debuted in Showcase #37, which belonged to DC Comics, it is reasonable to infer that the Showcase comics as a whole were indeed published by DC Comics. However, in order to make a definitive statement about this, one must provide additional supporting evidence or directly address the entire publishing history of the Showcase series. In summary, the answer to the question of whether Showcase comics are only published by DC Comics can be cautiously inferred as \\"yes\\" based on the provided information about the Metal Men's debut and the context of the Showcase series.

Updated at 6:12pm EST with confirmation that the call did indeed come from the Santorum campaign LANSING, MI — Rick Santorum’s campaign is locked in a tight battle with Mitt Romney ahead of Tuesday’s Michigan primary. On Monday his camp started openly courting a demographic that’s not often reached out to in GOP primaries: Democrats. Michigan’s primary rules allow Dems to vote in the state’s GOP primaries. The liberal site DailyKos and other progressive partners have been trying to drum up enthusiasm for “Operation Hilarity” - an effort to get Democrats to vote in the GOP primary and tilt the vote against Mitt Romney. The Santorum campaign evidently decided they’d take votes from any legitimate source. Following some speculation that the robocall may have been a “false flag” effort designed to harm Santorum, a spokesman Hogan Gidley confirmed to TPM that they were indeed footing the bill, and reaching beyond party lines. “If we can get the Reagan Democrats in the primary, we can get them in the general,” he told TPM. It’s a controversial tactic. Bill Ballenger, a longtime Michigan politico and the editor of Inside Michigan Politics, spoke with TPM about the call earlier in the day. He said the call piqued his interest because it sounded like it could have come from a union targeting Romney ahead of the Feb. 28 primary. The call focuses on Romney’s opposition to the auto bailout and calls on Democrats to vote for Santorum Tuesday because of it. “It went on and on like this and I kept listening because I kind of smelled a rat,” Ballenger said. “And finally at the very end, in a tagline it says, ‘this call was paid for by the Santorum for president committee.’” TPM readers in Michigan reported Monday receiving the same robocall as Ballenger. TPM Reader BG emailed in to say he’d received a robocall where the “voice sounded Union-ish” and “said the word ‘Democrats’ repeatedly, though not as a derogatory label.” He stayed on to hear who claimed the call in the tagline at the end and “yup, it was from the official Santorum campaign.” TPM obtained audio of the call from a reader in Trenton, MI who said it showed up on his answering machine Monday morning. Ballenger confirmed the call was the one he heard. I asked Ballenger, who’s followed many elections in Michigan, if the Santorum call classifies as playing dirty. “This is a dirty trick,” he said. “I mean, first of all you know how these robocalls are. You get one, generally speaking, you kind of after the first couple of sentences you know what they’re after. If you don’t hang up right away you get the message, right? Well, most people don’t listen all the way through [and] you have to listen to the bitter end of this one to get the clincher. Otherwise, you’d hang up and you’d be convinced this came out of UAW Solidarity House or the Obama reelection campaign.” What’s more, Ballenger said, the messenger delivering an attack on Romney for opposing the auto bailout is a little disingenuous. “You talk about chutzpah: here’s Santorum who’s just as opposed to the bailout as Romney is, but he’s putting out robocalls to Democrats urging them to crossover and vote in the Republican for Santorum,” Ballenger said. “The only thing intellectually in the whole message that it seems to be the Santorum committee could use to justify this tactic is the one line that, you know, ‘Romney was all too happy to support bailing out Wall Street, but not Michigan.’ Santorum is in the position all along of ‘a plague on both their houses. No bailouts for anybody.’” There’s already another controversy about a pro-Santorum robocall which is tagged as coming from the National Rifle Association, but which the gun rights organization denies it is running. David Taintor contributed to the reporting for this article. ||||| Mitt Romney is calling Rick Santorum's calls to Democrats to vote in Tuesday's primary in Michigan \\"outrageous\\" and \\"disgusting\\" but Santorum says he's not doing anything besides getting people to vote in an open primary. Romney complained about the automated calls Tuesday, as Michigan voters go to the polls in the Republican presidential primary. Arizona also votes Tuesday in a winner-take-all battle, but Michigan, with its proportional delegate award system, has added value since Romney was born in the state and his father served as governor there. \\"I know why Obama doesn't want me to face him but I just think it's outrageous and a terrible dirty trick at the last hour, by the way, late in the afternoon on the day before the election, maybe hoping no one would notice, they start sending out calls to Democrats, union members telling them to go into the Republican primary and vote against Mitt Romney,\\" he said. \\"This is a new low for his campaign and that's saying something,\\" Romney told Fox News Santorum told Fox News on Monday night that he is trying to attract the Democratic voters he'll need in a general election campaign. He added that nothing he's said in his robo-call is any worse than the campaign Romney has run. \\"When he runs a robo-call of my voice from four years ago saying good things about him, that's not a low moment, and when I run a call basically saying, calling Democrats that are eligible to vote here, to vote for us, that's a low (moment)?\\" he said. \\"And of course, you know, it's interesting that he criticizes me for attracting Democrats because one of the things that the Governor Romney's people say is, oh, he can't attract Democrats. Well, guess what? We will wait and see. I think we can.\\" The robocall going around Monday says Democrats should send \\"a loud message\\" to Romney by voting for Santorum. The message says it's supported by \\"hard-working Democratic men and women\\" and paid for by the Santorum campaign. Indeed, Democrats have made no bones about their efforts to force a Romney loss in the GOP primary. The pro-President Obama super PAC, Moveon.org and the campaign itself have all run ads against Romney in the Wolverine State. On Monday, liberal blogger Markos Moulitsas of the Daily Kos wrote that a \\"million-dollar anti-Romney effort (with much of that money coming from Democrats and progressives) has dragged Romney back down to where Santorum can catch him.\\" He added that \\"the big-money campaign\\" aims to drive down Romney's numbers among independents and the Michigan Democratic Party is also engaged in getting Democrats to cast votes for Santorum, \\"reminding them that casting such votes in no way prohibits them from voting in Democratic contests later in the year.\\" \\"The quicker Romney can transition to 'general election' mode, the quicker he can move to the center and start repairing the damage. And as long as Santorum drives the debate, he helps galvanize base Democratic constituencies. ... There is no downside to dragging this contest out a month or two longer,\\" Kos wrote. While the two candidates run neck-and-neck -- late polling showing virtually no difference between the two -- Santorum is also asking volunteers to come out Tuesday night to \\"help in ensuring the accuracy of ballots collected.\\" Whoever wins in Michigan, the 30 delegate count will only go a small way toward gaining the 1,144 required to win the party nomination at the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Fla. So far, The Associated Press has tallied 123 delegates for Romney to 72 for Santorum. Newt Gingrich, who is focused on Washington state caucuses Saturday, with 40 delegates at stake and Super Tuesday states next week and not Tuesday's battle in Michigan, has 32 delegates and Ron Paul has 19. Next Tuesday's 10 primaries and caucuses will gin up another 419 delegates. But Michigan's battle would follow a three-state sweep by Santorum earlier in the month, which while not awarding delegates yet, forced Romney into a bit of a defensive mode in Michigan. He hosted nearly a dozen public events as he and his allies have spent more than 2 million on local television advertising. Romney predicted victory Monday night at the Royal Oak Music Theatre, where rocker-rapper Kid Rock performed. \\"I'm going to win in Michigan and I'm going to win across the country,\\" Romney said. Santorum, seeing fluctuations in polling, was more reserved on Monday night. \\"I think the fact that we are doing as well as we are is a pretty big deal in this state,\\" he said. ||||| Write a summary.","response":"Rick Santorum's campaign tried to get more votes in the Michigan primary by reaching out to Democrats, since Michigan's rules let them vote in the state's Republican primaries.

The Warming Glow, directed by the immensely talented Avery Bennett, has been the talk of the town since its premiere, capturing the hearts and minds of its audiences with a spellbinding concoction of superb acting, rich storytelling, and stunning cinematography. Set in a small coastal town with a rich and historic tapestry, The Warming Glow tells the story of Ella (played by the remarkably talented Emma Shaw), a young woman who rediscovers her passion for music when she inherits her late grandparent's house which was once a vibrant musical hub. Ella's journey is one of family, friendship, love, and rediscovering the joys of life. Supporting characters like the endearing old record store owner Johnathan (played by Academy Award winner William Freeman), and love interest Alex (played by the versatile and charismatic Noah Jackson) complement Ella's character and add a layer of depth and charm to the narrative. From the very first scene, The Warming Glow enraptures its viewers with a genuine warmth that is simultaneously nostalgic and new, reminiscent of the human stories found in classic cinema yet presented in Bennett's uniquely modern touch. The effortless blending of a heartwarming story with breathtaking visuals is a masterclass in filmmaking, showcasing Bennett's innate ability to harness the beauty and power of the natural and human landscape. The film’s cinematography is undoubtedly one of its strongest elements, with sweeping shots of the picturesque seaside town and its surrounding landscape.

At the core of The Warming Glow resides a masterfully crafted storyline that explores a plethora of universal themes, such as love, loss, the healing power of family, and overcoming one's deepest fears. Bennett's clever narrative juxtaposes moments of pure elation with periods of tender stillness, ultimately scratching beneath the surface of what it means to grow and find one’s purpose in life. None of this would be possible without the sincere and moving performances showcased by the talented ensemble. Emma Shaw's portrayal of Ella is both breathtakingly visceral and disarmingly vulnerable. Her ability to convey the complexities of the human psyche with just a glance is nothing short of genius. Freeman, as record store owner Johnathan, provides the perfect blend of inspirational wisdom and kindness while Noah Jackson as Alex effortlessly charms the audience with his charisma and nuanced performance. A spellbinding score by renowned composer Marie Gilbert weaves itself seamlessly throughout the narrative, subtly evoking a gamut of emotions in its listeners. The tender piano melodies that underscore Ella's introspective moments tug at heartstrings, quietly echoing the themes of the film. In conclusion, The Warming Glow is a cinematic masterpiece; a beautifully crafted ode to the enduring spirit of love, family, and the transformative power of music. Director Avery Bennett has achieved a filmmaking triumph, creating a film that one can't help but be swept away by, leaving the viewer with a lingering, heartwarming sensation that embraces with every breathtaking moment. The combination of a poignant, truthful story, mesmerizing performances, breathtaking visuals, and an enchanting score make The Warming Glow an unforgettable experience that will undoubtedly earn its place among the contemporary greats."},{"question":"Teacher:Given a sentence in English language, translate the sentence to Tagalog language keeping the meaning of the original sentence intact.

Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: The Tenant Movie plot: Trelkovsky (Roman Polanski), a quiet and unassuming man, rents an apartment in Paris whose previous tenant, Egyptologist Simone Choule, attempted to commit suicide by throwing herself out the window and through a pane of glass below. He visits Choule in the hospital but finds her entirely in bandages and unable to talk. Whilst still at Choule's bedside, Trelkovsky meets Simone's friend, Stella (Isabelle Adjani), who has also come to visit. Stella begins talking to Simone, who becomes aware of her visitors. Initially showing some signs of agitation upon seeing them, Choule soon lets out a disturbing cry, then dies. It isn't clear which of the two has caused this reaction. Apparently unaware that Choule is now dead, Trelkovsky tries to comfort Stella but dares not say that he never knew Simone, instead pretending to be another friend. They leave together and go out for a drink and a movie (1973's Enter The Dragon), where they fondle each other. Outside the theatre they part ways. As Trelkovsky occupies the apartment he is chastised unreasonably by his neighbors and landlord, Monsieur Zy (Melvyn Douglas), for hosting a party with his friends, apparently having a woman over, making too much noise in general, and not joining in on a petition against another neighbor. Trelkovsky attempts to adapt to his situation, but is increasingly disturbed by the apartment and the other tenants. He frequently sees his neighbors standing motionless in the toilet room (which he can see from his own window), and discovers a hole in the wall with a human tooth stashed inside. He receives a visit and a letter from one Georges Badar (Rufus), who secretly loves Simone and has believed her to be alive and well. Trelkovsky updates and comforts the man and spends the night out with him. Gradually he changes his breakfast habits to those of Simone, and shifts from Gauloises to Marlboro cigarettes. Trelkovsky becomes severely agitated and enraged when his apartment is robbed, while his neighbors and the concierge (Shelley Winters) continue... My question: Who makes the suicide attempt?

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less leaves on the trees happens, how will it affect the flashlight lamp does not glow. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","response":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests that there will be less leaves on the trees, and we are asked to consider how this might affect the flashlight lamp not glowing. To determine whether this perturbation has a direct or indirect effect on the flashlight's functionality, we need to examine the proposed changes and their potential impacts on the process of operating a flashlight. First, let's briefly review the process of how a flashlight works again: 1. Batteries are put in a flashlight. 2. The flashlight is turned on. 3. Two contact strips touch one another. 4. A circuit is completed between the batteries and the lamp. 5. The lamp in the flashlight begins to glow. 6. The reflector in the flashlight directs the lamp's beam. 7. A straight beam of light is generated. 8. The flashlight is turned off. 9. The circuit is broken. 10. The beam is no longer visible. Now, let's consider the possible effects that fewer leaves on the trees might have on the flashlight's functionality. 1. Direct effects: For the perturbation to have a direct effect, it must alter one or more steps of the flashlight operation process. In this case, there is no direct interaction between the leaves on trees and the internal workings of a flashlight. Therefore, the flashlight's core functionality (i.e., producing light when the circuit is complete) is not affected by the number of leaves on trees. 2. Indirect effects: Although a direct effect is unlikely, it is possible that less leaves on trees might result in a change in environmental conditions that could indirectly impact the flashlight's performance. For example, if the decrease in leaves were due to increased pollution, the batteries or the flashlight components might be exposed to harmful substances, leading to a decline in performance or even causing the lamp not to glow. Another potential effect could be that less leaves on the trees might result in more light penetration through the canopy, which could affect the visibility and the necessity of using a flashlight. However, these indirect effects are contextual and may not have the same influence in every situation. In summary, while the perturbation hypothesis of fewer leaves on trees does not directly impact the flashlight's process of producing light, there might be indirect effects on the flashlight's performance due to changes in environmental conditions. Nevertheless, these indirect impacts are not guaranteed and can vary depending on the specific context."},{"question":"The protagonist Preetam ( ( ( Ganesh , on a visit to Eva Mall amidst a heavy wind , spots a pretty girl , Nandini .

Question: What contains hemoglobin? Context: In nature, the red color of blood comes from hemoglobin, the iron-containing protein found in the red blood cells of all vertebrates. The red color of the Grand Canyon and other geological features is caused by hematite or red ochre, both forms of iron oxide. It also causes the red color of the planet Mars. The red sky at sunset and sunrise is caused by an optical effect known as Rayleigh scattering, which, when the sun is low or below the horizon, increases the red-wavelength light that reaches the eye. The color of autumn leaves is caused by pigments called anthocyanins, which are produced towards the end of summer, when the green chlorophyll is no longer produced. One to two percent of the human population has red hair; the color is produced by high levels of the reddish pigment pheomelanin (which also accounts for the red color of the lips) and relatively low levels of the dark pigment eumelanin.

Dr. Robert Verne (Robert Foxworth) is fed up with dealing with the squalor of city tenements, where he feels he isn't making a difference. He accepts a job from the Environmental Protection Agency to write a report on a logging operation near the Androscoggin River in Maine. The loggers are in a dispute with the local American Indian \\"Opies\\" (i.e., \\"O.P.s\\"), the original people. Dr. Verne's wife Maggie (Talia Shire) accompanies him on the trip.

The name originates from the 1848 tract \\"Manifesto of the Communist Party\\" by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. According to Leninist theory, a Communist party is the vanguard party of the working class (proletariat), whether ruling or non-ruling, but when such a party is in power in a specific country, the party is said to be the highest authority of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Vladimir Lenin's theories on the role of a Communist party were developed as the early 20th-century Russian social democracy divided into Bolshevik (meaning \\"\\"of the majority\\"\\") and Menshevik (meaning \\"of the minority\\") factions. Lenin, leader of the Bolsheviks, argued that a revolutionary party should be a small vanguard party with a centralized political command and a strict cadre policy; the Menshevik faction, however, argued that the party should be a broad-based mass movement. The Bolshevik party, which eventually became the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, took power in Russia after the October Revolution in 1917. With the creation of the Communist International, the Leninist concept of party building was copied by emerging Communist parties worldwide. - The South African Communist Party (SACP) is a communist party in South Africa. It was founded in 1921, was declared illegal in 1950, and participated in the struggle against apartheid. It is a partner of the Tripartite Alliance with the African National Congress and the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) and through this influences the South African government. - African Communist is the magazine of the South African Communist Party, published quarterly. The magazine was started by a group of Marxist-Leninists in 1959. It has its headquarters in Johannesburg. - The Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) is a trade union federation in South Africa. It was founded in 1985 and is the largest of the countrys three main trade union federations, with 21 affiliated trade unions, altogether organising 1.8 million workers. - The Tripartite Alliance is an alliance between the African National Congress (ANC), the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) and the South African Communist Party (SACP). The ANC holds a majority in the South African parliament, while the SACP and COSATU have not contested any democratic election in South Africa. - South Africa, officially the Republic of South Africa (RSA), is the southernmost country in Africa. It is bounded on the south by of coastline of Southern Africa stretching along the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans, on the north by the neighbouring countries of Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe, and on the east and northeast by Mozambique and Swaziland, and surrounding the kingdom of Lesotho. South Africa is the 25th-largest country in the world by land area, and with close to 56 million people, is the world's 24th-most populous nation. It is the southernmost country on the mainland of the Old World or the Eastern Hemisphere. It is the only country that borders both the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean. About 80 percent of South Africans are of Sub-Saharan African ancestry, divided among a variety of ethnic groups speaking different Bantu languages, nine of which have official status. The remaining population consists of Africa's largest communities of European (white), Asian (Indian), and multiracial (coloured) ancestry. - Moses Mncane Mabhida ( 11 October 1923 -- 8 March 1986 ) was a South African politician . Mabhida was leader of the South African Communist Party from 1978 until his death in 1986 . - The African National Congress (ANC) is the Republic of South Africa's governing social democratic political party. It has been the ruling party of post-apartheid South Africa on the national level, beginning with the election of Nelson Mandela in the 1994 election, the first election after the end of apartheid. Today, the ANC remains the dominant political party in South Africa, winning every election since 1994. Its leader Jacob Zuma is the incumbent president of South Africa. - Apartheid was a system of institutionalised racial segregation and discrimination in South Africa between 1948 and 1991, when it was abolished. The country's first multiracial elections under a universal franchise were held three years later in 1994. Broadly speaking, apartheid was delineated into \\"petty apartheid\\", which entailed the segregation of public facilities and social events, and \\"grand apartheid\\", which dictated housing and employment opportunities by race. Prior to the 1940s, some vestiges of apartheid had already emerged in the form of minority rule by white South Africans and the socially enforced separation of black South Africans from other races, which later extended to pass laws and land apportionment. Apartheid as a policy was embraced by the South African government shortly after the ascension of the National Party (NP) during the country's 1948 general elections. Apartheid was also enforced in South West Africa until it gained independence as Namibia in 1990. Given the information, choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'member of political party'. A:","response":"Based on the information provided, the following subject and object entities have the relation of 'member of political party': 1. Subject: Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels - Object: Communist Party Rational: Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels are best known for publishing the \\"Manifesto of the Communist Party,\\" which implies they were members of this political party. 2. Subject: Vladimir Lenin - Object: Bolshevik Party Vladimir Lenin, the leader of the Bolsheviks, was a member of this political faction that later evolved into the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. 3. Subject: members of emerging Communist parties worldwide - Object: Communist International This is inferred from the creation of the Communist International. The members of emerging Communist parties worldwide were copied from the Leninist concept of party building, thus indicating their membership. 4. Subject: Moses Mncane Mabhida - Object: South African Communist Party Moses Mncane Mabhida served as the leader of the South African Communist Party from 1978 until his death in 1986, clearly establishing his membership in the party. 5. Subject: Members of African National Congress (ANC) - Object: African National Congress (ANC) As ANC is a social democratic political party and has been the ruling party of post-apartheid South Africa, it implies that there are members identified as part of this political party. 6. Subject: People evoking struggle against apartheid - Object: South African Communist Party (SACP) SACP was part of the struggle against apartheid. It means that those who were involved in the struggle against apartheid might be considered as members of the South African Communist Party. 7. Subject: South African government - Object: Tripartite Alliance As stated, the South African Communist Party influences the South African government through its partnership in the Tripartite Alliance with the African National Congress and Congress of South African Trade Unions. This implies that the South African government could potentially have members from these three political parties. By 'member of political party', it is meant to identify individuals or entities that belong to a specific political party. The subject is the individual or entity, and the object is the political party to which they belong. The relationship is based on political affiliation and involvement."},{"question":"Question: Who is the rap singer in right round with kesha in the background? *(dancer)*? Would \\"According to one of the song's writers, the chorus refers to oral sex .\\" be a reasonable answer?","response":"The rap singer in the song \\"Right Round\\" featuring Kesha in the background is Flo Rida, an American rapper, singer, and songwriter. The collaboration has earned significant attention and chart success since its release in 2009. Flo Rida, whose real name is Tramar Lacel Dillard, is well-known for his catchy tunes and energetic performances. Meanwhile, Kesha, an American singer, songwriter, and rapper, provides uncredited background vocals on the track. Her full name is Kesha Rose Sebert, and she eventually rose to fame with her own single \\"Tik Tok\\" released in the same year. The song \\"Right Round\\" is a high-energy dance/pop-infused hip-hop track that samples the melody from the 1985 song \\"You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)\\" by Dead or Alive. As for the specific lyrical reference you mentioned in your question, \\"According to one of the song's writers, the chorus refers to oral sex,\\" it is indeed discussed in various interviews and reports surrounding the song. On the one hand, \\"Right Round\\" features lyrics that can be interpreted in various ways. Some listeners may take the lyrics at face value and interpret them as a catchy, fun dance song about enjoying a night out at a club or engaging in a playful, flirtatious relationship. On the other hand, some listeners and critics have noted the more suggestive nature of certain lines within the song, which could be interpreted as having a sexual undertone. One such interpretation is that the chorus refers to oral sex, as you've stated. It's important to remember that song lyrics can often be open to interpretation, and individuals may read different meanings into them based on their personal experiences, beliefs, and perspectives. In this case, while some people and the song's writer might see the chorus as a reference to oral sex, others might not necessarily perceive it that way. Music often brings about diverse interpretations, making it an integral part of its expressive nature. In conclusion, Flo Rida is the rapper in \\"Right Round,\\" with Kesha providing background vocals. As for the specific meaning behind the lyrics, it is plausible that the chorus refers to oral sex, as suggested by one of the song's writers. However, individual interpretations can vary, and, ultimately, the subjective nature of nuance in musical lyrics is what makes it an engaging and thought-provoking aspect of the art form."},{"question":"Magnetism can cause objects to repel each other, and drop metal objects such as golf clubs, and backpacks.

He drives 50 miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and Sunday for the rest of the days he drives 100 miles. He has to pay .1 per mile he drives. He also has to pay a weekly fee of 100. How much does he have to pay in a year.. Me: Hmmm, let me think. I think this is the detailed solution:","response":"First, let's determine how much Tom drives in a week: On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, he drives 50 miles each day; so that's 3 days * 50 miles = 150 miles. On the rest of the days (Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday), he drives 100 miles each day; so that's 4 days * 100 miles = 400 miles. Total miles he drives in a week = 150 miles + 400 miles = 550 miles. Now let's calculate his weekly cost: Cost for miles driven: 550 miles * 0.1/mile = 55. Weekly fee: 100. Total weekly cost: 55 + 100 = 155. Finally, let's calculate Tom's annual cost: There are 52 weeks in a year, so Tom's annual cost is 52 weeks * 155/week = 8,060. Therefore, Tom has to pay 8,060 in a year for the car lease, mileage, and weekly fees."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you're given a passage, further information available on a particular linked term from the statement, and an answer term.

Note that the answer to the question should be exactly the given answer, and if the answer is none, the answer to the question shouldn't be obtainable from the passage or linked information. Problem:Passage: Inside the SAPD, the first part of 1937 saw an intensification of differences over attitudes to a possible political party of the united left or a Popular front, and more precisely over the party's approach to the Soviet Union. The differences led to Peter Blachstein's exclusion from the SAPD. Others excluded at the same time included his political mentor and Erwin Ackerknecht: the three became the focus of a short-lived political grouping known as \\"Neuer Weg\\" (\\"New Way\\"). Blachstein was also affected more directly by the intense political tensions radiating out from Moscow, based on Stalin's suspicions - not entirely unfounded - that there might be comrades in the Soviet Union and further west in Europe who favoured an alternative Soviet leader. The POUM, of which Blachstein was a member, backed a broadly Trotskyite vision for a communist future and its members therefore became targets for Soviet agents. In June 1937 Blachstein was arrested in Barcelona by communist secret police and accused of spying for Franco and working for the Gestapo. With approximately 100 other foreign detainees he was taken to a large garage which had been adapted for use as an ad hoc prison. Because of the appalling hygiene he soon fell ill with Tuberculosis, as a result of which he was transferred to a sanatorium controlled by anarchist comrades.

Born in Nuremberg, Durer established his reputation and influence across Europe when he was still in his twenties due to his high-quality woodcut prints. He was in communication with the major Italian artists of his time, including Raphael, Giovanni Bellini and Leonardo da Vinci, and from 1512 he was patronized by emperor Maximilian I. Durer is commemorated by both the Lutheran and Episcopal Churches. Despite the regard in which he was held by the Venetians, Durer returned to Nuremberg by mid-1507, remaining in Germany until 1520. His reputation had spread throughout Europe and he was on friendly terms and in communication with most of the major artists including Raphael, Giovanni Bellini and--mainly through Lorenzo di Credi--Leonardo da Vinci. Between 1507 and 1511 Durer worked on some of his most celebrated paintings: Adam and Eve (1507), The Martyrdom of the Ten Thousand (1508, for Frederick of Saxony), Virgin with the Iris (1508), the altarpiece Assumption of the Virgin (1509, for Jacob Heller of Frankfurt), and Adoration of the Trinity (1511, for Matthaeus Landauer). During this period he also completed two woodcut series, the Great Passion and the Life of the Virgin, both published in 1511 together with a second edition of the Apocalypse series. The post-Venetian woodcuts show Durer's development of chiaroscuro modelling effects, creating a mid-tone throughout the print to which the highlights and shadows can be contrasted. Other works from this period include the thirty-seven woodcut subjects of the Little Passion, published first in 1511, and a set of fifteen small engravings on the same theme in 1512. Indeed, complaining that painting did not make enough money to justify the time spent when compared to his prints, he produced no paintings from 1513 to 1516. However, in 1513 and 1514 Durer created his three most famous engravings: Knight, Death, and the Devil (1513, probably based on Erasmus's treatise Enchiridion militis Christiani), St. Jerome in his Study, and the much-debated Melencolia I (both 1514). Further outstanding pen and ink drawings of Durer's period of art work of 1513 were drafts for his friend Willibald Prickheimer. These drafts were later used to design the famous chandeliers lusterweibchen. In 1515, he created his woodcut of a Rhinoceros which had arrived in Lisbon from a written description and sketch by another artist, without ever seeing the animal himself. An image of the Indian rhinoceros, the image has such force that it remains one of his best-known and was still used in some German school science text-books as late as last century. In the years leading to 1520 he produced a wide range of works, including the woodblocks for the first western printed star charts in 1515 and portraits in tempera on linen in 1516.

Then they become a list of wishes. Unless you are going to determine steps to make your wishes turn into goals AND you’re going to follow through with those steps, you probably should not make New Year’s resolutions. Full disclaimer before we completely dive in: I’m not against setting goals. I have always been a goal setter and sometimes even a goal achiever. If you’re the same, you may enjoy this audible, or if you’re interested in developing and achieving SMART goals try this e-book or this book. Why You Shouldn’t Make New Year’s Resolutions You’ll probably write the same things on a sheet of paper that you did the year before. Some of the common resolutions we’ve all heard are: Lose weight, exercise, spend less, save more, travel, go to church, and so on and so forth. There’s a reason these are common. We hear them (or write them) time and time again and…nothing changes. By mid-January, they’ll be long forgotten. Maybe even before January 15th, they aren’t a thought in our minds. They were good ideas two weeks prior (and the years before that), but that’s what they have remained…ideas. You didn’t think of a route to your destination. Saving money sounds great, but do you know what you’re already spending? Do you know what you need to cut and where you’ll put that amount? Have you factored in your new gym membership? What will you do with it? Will the autodraft payment that comes out each month help you shed those pounds? What churches are in your area? Do they have programs your family will be interested in? Do you know when the services are? You’re overwhelmed. You try to better yourself constantly. Maybe. Let’s say some of you try to better yourselves constantly. Which can be a good thing. But it can also be the reason you fail yourselves time and time again. You say yes when you should say no, sign up when you should wait a few more months, and have a list of ten New Year’s resolutions when you should focus on two. Question: When do people usually forget their resolutions by? === The answer to the above question is","response":"usually by mid-January. According to various studies, New Year’s resolutions are often forgotten or abandoned by the third week of January, although this can vary from individual to individual. The main reason for this is the lack of planning and proper goal setting, as well as the unrealistic expectations that people set for themselves without a clear, actionable plan or adequate self-discipline to follow through. Many people also often feel overwhelmed by the number of resolutions they set for themselves, which can lead to a sense of failure and discouragement, furthering their inability to stay committed to their New Year’s resolutions. Moreover, many resolutions fail because they are not specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, or time-bound (SMART) goals. For example, a common New Year’s resolution is to \\"lose weight\\". However, without a specific target, a measurable way to track progress, ensuring it is achievable, making it relevant to one’s life, and setting a deadline, this resolution is likely to fail. Therefore, it is advisable to make SMART resolutions if one wants to achieve them. In addition, another reason why New Year’s resolutions are often forgotten by mid-January is due to lack of motivation or commitment. People tend to be excited and motivated at the beginning of the year, but as the novelty wears off and the challenges start to show up, the excitement dwindles and with it, the commitment to their resolutions. Psychologically, there's also the aspect of \\"false hope syndrome\\". When people set New Year's resolutions, they also tend to overestimate their ability to change, leading to unrealistically high expectations. When these are not met, the resolution is often forgotten or dismissed. Lastly, some people also fail to create a supportive environment for their new habits. Without the appropriate environment, motivation, and resources that support new behaviors, it is easy for one to fall back into old habits. However, all this is not to discourage the setting of resolutions or goals. If one is truly determined and committed to making meaningful changes in their life, a well thought out resolution could be a useful tool. It's all about understanding one's limits, setting up realistic and achievable goals, maintaining a consistent level of commitment, and most importantly, being kind and patient with oneself in the process."},{"question":"Write a short summary for this text: the chief u.n. investigator into the assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafik hariri said in remarks published saturday that he was confident that syria was behind the killing .","response":"The chief U.N. investigator has expressed confidence that Syria was involved in the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, according to published remarks on Saturday."},{"question":"As Julie kept asking question after question, all I could think of was how desperately I needed a normal, healthy relationship.

Polanski pleaded guilty to unlawful sexual intercourse with a 13-year-old girl in 1978. Director lives in exile in France after fleeing the United States. Write an article based on these highlights.","response":"Title: 31-Year-Old Sex Offense Case Against Roman Polanski Faces Motion to Dismiss Introduction: Renowned film director Roman Polanski may soon find closure on a dark chapter in his life, as a motion has been filed to dismiss the longstanding sex offense case against him. The case dates back to 1978 when Polanski pleaded guilty to engaging in unlawful sexual intercourse with a 13-year-old girl. The director has since been living in exile in France, after fleeing the United States to avoid sentencing. (Step 1: Provide context on the history of the case and Roman Polanski's legal situation.) In 1977, Roman Polanski was originally charged with multiple counts relating to the sexual assault of a minor, including rape by use of drugs, perversion, and sodomy. However, in a plea bargain, he later pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of unlawful sexual intercourse in exchange for the dismissal of the other charges. Although Polanski underwent a psychiatric evaluation and had spent 42 days in prison, he fled the United States before his final sentencing as he feared that the judge would disregard the plea bargain, sending him back to prison for an extended period. (Step 2: Explain why a motion has been filed to dismiss the case now and the legal justification.) The motion to dismiss the case against Roman Polanski has been filed in light of new evidence and statements from the victim, Samantha Geimer, who has publicly asked for the case to be dropped multiple times. Additionally, legal experts argue that much time has elapsed since the original incident, further complicating the case. As a result, the court may consider both the victim's wishes and the difficulties of prosecuting such an old case when determining whether or not to proceed with the charges. (Step 3: Discuss the potential consequences of the case being dismissed for Polanski and the legal system.) If the court honors the motion to dismiss the charges against Roman Polanski, it would bring closure to a 31-year-old legal battle. However, the decision may also prompt debate surrounding the legal system's handling of high-profile criminal cases and its ability to effectively address sex crimes, particularly those involving minors. Consequently, the outcome of this case will likely have ramifications that extend beyond Polanski's personal situation. (Step 4: Address the implications that the outcome of the case might have on the broader public.) The resolution of Roman Polanski's sex offense case could impact the public's perception of justice and the legal system, particularly where high-profile individuals are concerned. Should the charges be dismissed, some may argue that Polanski's fame and resources allowed him to evade justice for more than three decades. Alternatively, others may view the potential dismissal as a demonstration of the legal system recognizing the limitations and difficulties of prosecuting historic cases. Conclusion: As the motion to dismiss the sex offense case against Roman Polanski awaits consideration by the courts, the world looks on with anticipation. The outcome of this case not only has the potential to directly impact Polanski's life but also carries significant implications for the legal system, the handling of sex crimes, and public perception of justice."},{"question":"Given the question: Article: On very cold winter days , a group of Japanese children travelled a long way and arrived at a small island where nobody lived.

A and B working together will finish twice the amount of work in days? Options: (A) 22 1/6 (B) 24 (C) 22 1/0 (D) 22 1/9 (E) 22 1/1 Think first, then make a decision. Some random thoughts:","response":"To solve this problem, we need to find the combined rate of A and B working together. We also need to determine how long it would take for them to complete twice the amount of work. Step 1: Find the work rate of A and B individually A can complete the job in 20 days, so A's work rate is 1/20 of the job per day. B can complete the job in 30 days, so B's work rate is 1/30 of the job per day. Step 2: Find the combined work rate of A and B A's work rate + B's work rate = (1/20) + (1/30) To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is the least common multiple of 20 and 30. The LCM(20, 30) is 60, so we can rewrite the fractions with 60 as their denominator. (3/60) + (2/60) = 5/60 So the combined work rate of A and B is 5/60 of the job per day. Step 3: Determine how long it takes for A and B to complete twice the amount of work Let x be the number of days it takes for A and B to complete twice the amount of work. (5/60) * x = 2 (since 2 times the job needs to be completed) To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 60/5, which is the reciprocal of 5/60. x = 2 * (60/5) x = 2 * 12 x = 24 So, A and B working together will finish twice the amount of work in 24 days.

Teacher: Let's think:","response":"To determine whether the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, we need to break down the information provided in both statements and see if the premise leads to the conclusion made in the hypothesis. Premise: \\"A rugby player is running with the ball as a defender moves to intervene.\\" From this premise, we know the following: 1. There is a rugby player. 2. This rugby player is running with the ball. 3. A defender is moving to intervene. Hypothesis: \\"The two men are playing rugby outside.\\" This hypothesis makes the following claims: 1. There are two men (we can assume that these are the rugby player and the defender mentioned in the premise). 2. These two men are playing rugby (which is supported by the premise's information about the rugby player and the defender). 3. They are playing outside. Now, let's analyze the information. The first two claims made in the hypothesis are supported by the information provided in the premise. We know there is a rugby player with the ball and a defender attempting to intervene, which implies that they are indeed playing rugby.

Of the below sentences, which one does *not* make sense? Options: - Sentence A: \\"If you want to protect your eyesight, see more of the scenery\\" - Sentence B: \\"If you want to protect your eyesight, look at the computer more often\\"","response":"To determine which sentence does not make sense, we need to evaluate their meanings and consider how they relate to protecting one's eyesight. Sentence A: \\"If you want to protect your eyesight, see more of the scenery\\" This sentence suggests that looking at the natural scenery may help protect your eyesight. Taking breaks from focusing on close-up objects such as screens, and looking at the scenery at a distance can help relax the eyes and reduce eye strain, which is beneficial for eye health. Sentence B: \\"If you want to protect your eyesight, look at the computer more often\\" This sentence implies that looking at the computer screen more often would protect one's eyesight. However, extended periods of screen time are associated with increased eye strain, dryness, and discomfort, which can negatively affect eye health. It is generally recommended to take breaks and reduce screen time to protect your eyesight. Based on the analysis above, it is clear that Sentence B: \\"If you want to protect your eyesight, look at the computer more often\\" does *not* make sense, as it contradicts the general advice and knowledge regarding eye health and screen time."},{"question":"Which nation’s football team won the 1970 FIFA World Cup?","response":"To find out which nation's football team won the 1970 FIFA World Cup, I will follow these steps: 1.

Given the context: What will Riley want to do next? A:","response":"Given the context provided, it can be inferred that Riley is a student in a classroom setting with the teacher instructing them to write down their name. Once Riley has successfully spelled and written their name correctly, their next course of action will depend on various factors, including the purpose of the request, classroom instructions, teacher expectation, and the student's disposition. 1. Continuing with the lesson: If writing down their name was part of a broader lesson or exercise, Riley may want to move onto the subsequent steps of the lesson once they've completed the task. This could involve writing down other pieces of information, following more directions from the teacher, or actively participating in an ongoing discussion or activity. 2. Demonstrating the correct spelling to the teacher: Riley might want to show their teacher the correctly spelled name as a form of confirmation. The teacher may have asked Riley and other students to spell their names correctly as a way of assessing their understanding and progress. In this case, Riley would want to demonstrate that they've understood the task and seek feedback or guidance on the next step. 3. Engaging with peers: If the context involves a group activity or peer interaction, Riley may want to proceed with the task by collaborating or sharing with their peers. This could involve discussing the correct spelling of their name with classmates, comparing their work, or engaging in a related group activity. 4. Awaiting further instructions: Once Riley has completed the task of writing their name, they may simply wait for the teacher to provide further instructions or direction. Riley could choose to remain attentive and poised to act on any new instructions the teacher has to offer, knowing that this is a part of the overall learning process. 5. Self-evaluation and reflection: Additionally, Riley might take the opportunity to reflect on their performance and understanding of the activity. After writing their name correctly, they may want to think about how well they have grasped the spelling and any potential areas for improvement. This self-evaluation could involve reviewing previous lessons, considering how they managed to spell their name correctly, and identifying strategies they could use to retain this knowledge in the future. In conclusion, Riley's next course of action will depend on the broader context of the instructions they received, the expectations of their teacher, and the student's personal disposition.

As her closest confidant, Mrs. Danvers regularly comments on Rebecca's exceptional grace and style. When asked what Rebecca was like, Frank Crawley (Reginald Denny), Maxim's best friend and manager of the estate, absent-mindedly tells the new Mrs. de Winter that Rebecca was an exceptional beauty. The new Mrs. de Winter is intimidated by her responsibilities and begins to doubt her relationship with her husband. The continuous reminders of Rebecca overwhelm her; she believes that Maxim is still deeply in love with his first wife. She also discovers that her husband sometimes becomes very angry at her for apparently insignificant actions. She also meets Rebecca's so-called \\"favorite cousin,\\" Jack Favell (George Sanders), who visits the house while Maxim is away. Mrs. Danvers attempts to persuade Mrs. de Winter to leap to her death. Trying to be the perfect wife, the young Mrs. de Winter convinces Maxim to hold a costume party, as he had done with Rebecca. She wants to plan her own costume, but Mrs. Danvers suggests she copy the beautiful outfit in the portrait of Lady Caroline de Winter, an ancestor of Maxim's.

Step 2: Boil the water Fill the kettle with water and turn it on or heat the water using another method (like a stove or microwave). You need to consider the heat and the boiling point of water to properly boil it. If using a coffee maker, ensure it is filled with water, and turn on the device. Step 3: Place coffee grounds or instant coffee in the mug Select ground coffee if you're using a coffee maker, or instant coffee for a quicker option. Place the appropriate amount (typically 1-2 tablespoons per 6 ounces of water) into the coffee maker filter or directly into your coffee mug. The physical state of the coffee makes a difference in how it quickly dissolves in hot water. Step 4: Brew or pour hot water If using a coffee maker, allow the machine to complete the brewing process. It functions by heating the water and dripping it through the coffee grounds to extract the flavor. If using instant coffee, pour the hot water directly into the mug over the coffee granules and allow it to dissolve. Step 5: Add optional ingredients If desired, add milk, sugar, or alternative sweeteners to taste. The density and viscosity of the milk or creamer can alter the flavor and texture of the coffee. Step 6: Stir the coffee Use a spoon to thoroughly mix the coffee and any additional ingredients to achieve an even taste and texture. The stirrer allows for proper distribution of the substances contained in the mixture. Step 7: Check temperature and serve Ensure that the coffee is at a suitable temperature for consumption. Once it reaches the desired temperature, the task is complete and the coffee is ready to drink. In this task, knowledge of various physical objects (coffee mug, kettle, coffee grounds or granules, and spoon) and their properties (temperature, solubility, and density) were required to properly prepare a cup of coffee."},{"question":"Write an article that answers the following question: Who made the first field goal of the game?","response":"Title: The First Field Goal of the Game: A Look Back at its Origin Introduction: Field goals are a common and crucial component of American football, with the potential to change the trajectory of a game in a matter of seconds. But who made the first field goal of the game, and when did this historic moment take place? In this article, we delve into the history of field goals and uncover the fascinating story behind this significant event in the evolution of American football. Step 1: Begin by researching the early history of field goals in American football To answer the question of who made the first field goal of the game, it is essential to first explore the origins of field goals in American football. Field goals, as well as touchdowns and extra point kicks, have been in existence since the early days of the sport. The first known game of American football was played on November 6, 1869, between Rutgers University and Princeton University. Step 2: Identify when field goals became a part of the game As we look back at the evolution of American football, we can see that field goals have played a significant role since its standardized rules were established. In 1883, the Intercollegiate Football Association (IFA) declared that field goals would be worth five points, with a subsequent decrease to four points in 1904. Step 3: Discover the first field goal made in a game With a contextual understanding of field goals' history, we can now pinpoint the first recorded field goal of the game. This achievement belongs to Pudge Heffelfinger, a player from Yale University. Heffelfinger successfully converted a field goal in a game against Princeton on November 13, 1882, earning the distinction of being the first player to achieve this feat. Step 4: Describe the significance of the first field goal and its impact on the game Pudge Heffelfinger's historic field goal set the stage for future innovations and strategy in American football. As teams realized the value of field goals, they began to place more emphasis on kickers and special teams, developing new techniques to improve accuracy and distance. Heffelfinger's landmark achievement demonstrated the importance of a well-rounded offensive strategy and paved the way for field goals to become an integral part of the sport. Conclusion: Pudge Heffelfinger's successful field goal in 1882 marked a turning point for American football, highlighting the significance of a diverse offensive strategy and profoundly influencing the way the game is played today. Though the rules and techniques surrounding field goals have evolved over the years, it is important to remember the pioneering efforts of those who came before us and laid the foundation for the sport we know and love."},{"question":"(CNN) -- Republicans now have the Senate Majority and control of Congress going into next year.

Analyzing the meaning of both sentences: The first sentence implies that Bridgeville was a smaller entity that belonged to Rock Hill, whereas the second sentence implies that Rock Hill was a smaller entity that belonged to Bridgeville. 4. Comparing the meanings: Since the first sentence suggests a hierarchy where Rock Hill is a larger entity and Bridgeville is a smaller one, and the second sentence suggests the opposite, they do not convey the same meaning.

Q: By Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Judah Brass, 19, has been hunkered down in Knoxville, Tennessee, with his parents and brothers and sisters for weeks. But a few days ago, they went for a hike in the Great Smoky Mountains in a park near their house. \\"Standing in the breeze, I was just so thankful,\\" he says, describing what it was like to see spring flowers and hear the croaking of frogs. \\"It was freeing.\\" He was one of the first to visit the Great Smoky Mountains park after it had re-opened. The park, along with Yellowstone National Park and many of the other national parks, had been shut because of the pandemic. Park officials were concerned about the virus, and they closed off access to many of the national parks in March. The parks are the country's treasures, showcasing beauty that ranges from the Florida Everglades to California's giant sequoias. With such impressive offerings, the parks attract crowds - last year, more than 4m people visited Yellowstone alone. But the Great Smoky Mountains, which has also reopened, is the busiest - a million visitors each month. It means people who have been cooped up for weeks can now head for the parks and enjoy the outdoors. The president celebrated the opening of the parks in a speech last month, saying that it showed the US had made progress in its effort to fight the virus. \\"People are going to be very happy,\\" he said. He's right - hikers and others are thrilled at the prospect of returning to the great outdoors. They know that spending time outdoors is good for one's mental, emotional and physical well-being. Science also shows that it helps people at work and allows them to find new ways to solve problems. Shelley Carson, a psychology professor at Harvard University, explains: \\"Being surrounded by natural beauty helps our ability to be creative.\\" But still hikers and nature lovers, even the most avid among them, are concerned about risks. They are worried about crowds at the park. They wonder if social-distancing guidelines will be followed, and they are not sure if it is safe to be in a place with so many people. Jon Waterman, a former park ranger and the author of a book entitled Atlas of the National Parks, clearly loves the parks. Still he thinks that this may not be the best time to visit them. \\"It will be difficult if not impossible to enforce social distancing rules,\\" he says. \\"Anyone thinking they can safely visit Yellowstone is not thinking clearly. Those crowded national parks are simply not going to be safe.\\" The re-opening of the parks comes at a key moment for the nation and its fight against the pandemic. Nearly 100,000 people have died of the virus, and the health guidelines for preventing infection remain in place - people are told to wash their hands frequently, practise social distancing and wear masks in public. Still the country is now opening up. State officials across the US have modified their stay-at-home orders, allowing people to venture out and resume some of their activities. For many, that means a visit to the park. Officials have tried to minimise the danger. They are opening the parks in phases in order to limit the number of people who will visit at the same time. And visitor centres are locked. A spokeswoman for the National Park Service told the BBC people should follow the White House health guidelines when they visit all of the parks and should keep their distance from others: \\"Give others plenty of room whether you are on a trail, at a boat launch or in a parking lot.\\" People have been rushing to the parks, though, making it hard to avoid the crowds. In some parts of the Great Smoky Mountains park, it was packed, says Anna Zanetti, a director of a non-profit organisation called Friends of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. They showed up in droves after it re-opened, and she says that led to \\"overcrowding\\". Meanwhile visitors to the other parks have flaunting the health guidelines. This week at Yellowstone, reports the Guardian, people were not wearing masks. Not all of the visitors to the parks have been cavalier. Before Judah Brass and other members of his family headed out to the Great Smoky Mountains, they packed masks and hand sanitiser \\"just in case\\", he says. They visited during the week, and the place was not crowded. Public health experts believe the benefits of opening up the national parks outweigh the risks, so long as visitors take precautions in the way the Brass family did. Bring masks and hand sanitiser, says Joseph Allen of the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health. If you are near others, you should wear your mask, he says, even when you are in a forest. (If you find yourself separate from others on a wooded path, he says \\"it's OK to put your mask down\\".) For Judah Brass, the benefits are clear so the precautions are worth the effort. \\"This big, beautiful view,\\" he says, recalling what he saw, \\"and the field in front of the mountains. It was just gorgeous.\\" A:","response":"National parks in the US have begun to reopen amid the pandemic, providing an opportunity for people to enjoy the outdoors and benefit their mental and physical well-being, but also raising concerns about safety and social distancing in crowded parks."},{"question":"Write highlights for this article: Preparing for Christmas is a mammoth task for everyone, but for grandmother Sylvia Pope getting ready for the big day requires three months of hard work. The bauble-loving pensioner is forced to start hanging her decorations in September to make sure they are all up by Christmas Day because it takes so long to attach each one to her ceiling by hand. The 72-year-old spends a few hours each day creating the festive masterpiece, that will this year contain a staggering 2061 balls - 10 more than last year. Bauble-loving grandmother Sylvia Pope, 72, started putting the Christmas decorations up at her home in Swansea, South Wales, in September. Mrs Pope spends a few hours each day perfecting the colourful creation to ensure that it is complete by December 25. 'I absolutely love Christmas and my grandchildren's faces light up when they see all the baubles. It really is magical for them and that is all that really matters,' said the 72-year-old. The living room at her home in Swansea, South Wales, is plastered with baubles from around the world. She says: 'This year I've bought 10 new baubles and my new addition include Mary Poppins, Captain Hook and Peter Pan. I already had Tinkerbell. My grandchildren love the films those characters are in. 'My favourite Christmas film is Miracle on 34th Street, but I haven't managed to find a bauble for that film yet.' She started collecting them in 1999 and has ones from around the world. Once Christmas is finished Mrs Pope carefully removes each bauble from the ceiling, individually wraps them and stores them in 36 boxes in her attic. She then has the 2,000 holes in her ceiling filled in, before re-painting it, so that it is ready in time to start again for next year. She started collecting the baubles in 1999 and now has a massive collection of 2061 festive balls from across the globe.

This year Mrs Pope has added 10 new additions to her display, including baubles featuring Mary Poppins, Captain Hook and Peter Pan. After the festivities this year the grandmother thinks that she may have to have her ceiling re-skimmed by a professional plasterer. 'Some people think it is over the top and tacky but when they see it for real its completely different. Most people love them and think they look fabulous'. Mrs Pope's collection also includes Disney characters, a London red bus, a New York taxi, aeroplanes, an old fashioned telephone and helicopters. She said: 'I normally spend about £100 a year on new baubles and visit all the festive markets to find new ones. This year I have spent about £80 so far but I haven't finished yet.

The statement only informs when the mosaics were discovered, in 2003, but does not give any information pertaining to when these mosaics were actually created or installed in the Bizere Monastery. Therefore, to correctly answer the question, it would be necessary to know the archaeological estimates or historical records that point to the period when the mosaics were made.

While attending the funeral of his father, Melvin Devereux (John Savage), meets a beautiful young woman (Sandi Schultz) who addresses him by name, although he cannot remember having met her before. After an enigmatic exchange of casual words, Devereux drives away, motoring aimlessly around New Orleans. Devereux decides to ignore warning barriers and drives onto a closed freeway. But the police follow him and he is forced to turn aside. His car breaks down in a decapitated area of the city. But the mysterious young woman again appears, suggesting that he try a mechanic located nearby to fix his car. After helping Devereux push his car to the garage, the young woman again refuses to explain how she knows him or tell him her name. While waiting, the woman suggests they go to a motel nearby, apparently for sex. After checking into a room, and getting ready in the bathroom, Devereux exits and discovers that she is gone, leaving behind a message written on a mirror in red lipstick which says that the time is not yet right.Having collected his repaired vehicle, Devereux encounters a hearse driving on the road ahead. When he attempts to overtake it, the driver (Richard Castleman) deliberately swerves to prevent him. Turning off onto more treacherous country roads, Devereux nearly gets stranded when his car gets stuck in muddy terrain, and he barely negotiates a rickety wooden bridge.At last finding his way back to the main road, he stops off at a local roadside bar for a drink where the hearse is also parked outside. In a drunken altercation, Deveveux challenges the driver to reveal whose body he is transporting.

While I do not have enough information to answer the specific question about the Italian documentary, I can provide more information regarding the BBC TV documentary about Chopin's life. The documentary you mentioned, \\"Chopin - The Women Behind the Music,\\" was produced by BBC Four in 2010. Directed by James Kent and presented by the pianist and composer Natasha Paremski, this documentary explores the life and music of the renowned Polish composer and pianist Frédéric Chopin. The film also focuses on the profound influence of several women in Chopin's life, including French writer George Sand, Polish countess Delfina Potocka, and Swedish opera singer Jenny Lind. These women inspired, supported, and shaped the composer's works, personal life, and career. In summary, \\"Chopin - The Women Behind the Music\\" is indeed a documentary that covers Chopin's life, but it does not answer the initial question about two people involved in creating an Italian television documentary.

It’s been a real asset for me to surf the internet with an extra level of security. However, there are a few areas of the app which could benefit from improvement. The speed of connection has been a tad slow at times, which can be frustrating for users who need quick access. Sometimes, the app crashes unexpectedly, although not frequently enough to be a big nuisance. Furthermore, while the user interface is straightforward, new users might struggle a bit because there's a lack of onboarding or in-depth tutorials. An improved tutorial and FAQs section would enhance its accessibility to all users, particularly novices.

This is all lower case. Can you fix that?","response":"Non-ECC / Non-Parity: Most stationary and laptop computers take non-ECC or non-parity memory. Non-ECC (Error Correction Code) or non-parity memory is the type of RAM used in the majority of stationary and laptop computers. This type of memory doesn't offer error correction, which makes it less expensive compared to ECC memory, which is designed to detect and correct memory errors. The lack of error correction makes non-ECC / non-parity memory faster, but also less reliable in specific, high-demand applications, such as servers and workstations. The primary difference between non-ECC and ECC memory lies in its ability to detect and correct memory errors. ECC memory is equipped with extra bits that enable it to identify and rectify certain types of memory errors, safeguarding data integrity. In contrast, non-ECC memory lacks this ability. As a result, non-ECC memory may be more susceptible to data corruption, which is typically not a significant concern for everyday users but can become critical for those engaged in high-stakes applications, like financial transactions or scientific simulations. Most consumer-grade computers, such as desktops and laptops, are built to handle non-ECC or non-parity memory due to its cost-effectiveness and sufficient performance for routine operations. For users who prioritize speed over data security, non-ECC memory is the ideal choice. However, for those who require a more reliable memory solution, ECC memory is the preferred option. Non-parity memory is another term commonly used to describe non-ECC memory. Parity memory incorporates a single parity bit to perform simple error detection, flagging the error without correcting it. Non-parity memory does not include this feature, making it functionally equivalent to non-ECC memory. In conclusion, non-ECC/non-parity memory is the most common type of RAM found in stationary and laptop computers due to its cost-effectiveness and acceptable performance for everyday use. While it lacks the error detection and correction features found in ECC memory, non-ECC/non-parity memory is sufficient for most consumer applications. However, users prioritizing data integrity and reliability should consider ECC memory for their computers."},{"question":"Data: name = Wildwood, eatType = coffee shop, food = Fast food, priceRange = cheap, customer rating = 5 out of 5, near = Ranch.

The post became available after the former head of the IMF Dominique Strauss-Kahn resigned. Mr Strauss-Kahn was arrested in the US last month on charges of an alleged sexual assault. He has denied the charges. The IMF said it expects to complete the selection process by 30 June. \\"The Executive Board will meet with the candidates in Washington DC and, thereafter, meet to discuss the strengths of the candidates and make a selection,\\" the fund said. Ms Lagarde is considered by many as the front runner for the post. She is backed by the European Union and in recent days she has also won the support of Egypt, Indonesia, and the United Arab Emirates. Mr Carstens has the support of Latin American countries. However, he acknowledged that his rival had the edge in the race. \\"I'm not fooling myself. It's like starting a soccer game with a 5-0 score,\\" Mr Carstens said during an appearance at the Peterson Institute for International Economics on Monday. However, Mr Carstens said that if a European candidate is appointed to the post, it may result in a conflict of interest, given the ongoing debt-crisis in some of the European countries. \\"We could have a situation where borrowers dominate the institution,\\" he said. Mr Carstens said that the European debt-crisis had snowballed into a big problem over the years and the region needed a fresh perspective in order to solve the problem. \\"What will help me is precisely to have a fresh pair of eyes,\\" he said. \\"Also someone coming from the outside can in a way speak of their mind more frankly and I think that will be an advantage,\\" he added. Ricardo Ochoa, head of international affairs at Mexico's finance ministry, said that Mr Carstens' experience as the head of the country's central bank, would allow him to be more sensitive to the problems of countries which needed IMF aid. \\"He has been on the other side of the table,\\" Mr Ochoa told the BBC. \\"Mexico already has been in the situation where important reforms have to be implemented, and I think that puts him in a situation - to have a more understanding and more sensitive IMF,\\" Mr Ochoa added. Summary:","response":"The top role at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is contested between French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde and Governor of the Bank of Mexico Agustin Carstens after Dominique Strauss-Kahn resigned following his arrest for an alleged sexual assault charge in the U.S, a charge he has denied. The IMF announced it expects to complete the selection process by June 30, involving meetings in Washington DC with the candidates. Lagarde is seen as a front-runner by many due to her endorsement by European Union, Egypt, Indonesia, and the United Arab Emirates. Carstens, who has support from various Latin American countries, is aware of his comparative disadvantage in the race, likening the situation to \\"starting a soccer game with a 5-0 score\\". However, Carstens highlighted potential complications if a European candidate like Lagarde is chosen. With the ongoing European debt crisis, he opined that the appointment of a European leader could lead to a conflict of interest. Carstens believes that this particular crisis has escalated significantly over time, requiring a fresh non-European perspective to aid in resolution. Moreover, he pointed out that an outsider candidate could potentially be more open and frank in their discussions, which would be advantageous. Ricardo Ochoa, head of international affairs at Mexico's finance ministry, also vouched for Carstens, reiterating his experience as the head of the country's central bank, which allows him to be more sensitive and understanding of the issues faced by countries requiring IMF’s assistance. According to Ochoa, this puts Carstens in a position to potentially lead a more empathetic and understanding IMF."},{"question":"There were 60 women at the party, and three-fourths of these women were married and brought their husbands with them to the party. If 3/4 of the men at the party were single, how many people attended the party? Give me reasons, before answering the question","response":"To find the total number of people at the party, we will first determine the number of married and single men and then add the total number of women. Let's break it down step by step. 1. Determine the number of married women at the party: 60 women * 3/4 = 45 married women 2. Since married women brought their husbands, there are also 45 married men at the party. 3. Now, let's find out how many men attended the party. We know that 3/4 of the men were single and only 1/4 were married (the husbands of the married women). Let 'x' be the total number of men at the party. So, x * 1/4 = 45 (the number of married men) 4. To find the total number of men (x), we can multiply both sides of the equation above by 4: x = 45 * 4 x = 180 5. So, there were 180 men at the party, where 45 of them were married, and the remaining (180 - 45) = 135 were single. Now that we have the number of men and women at the party, we can find the total number of people in attendance: 6. Total attendees = number of women + number of men Total attendees = 60 (women) + 180 (men) Total attendees = 240 Therefore, there were 240 people at the party when considering the given conditions."},{"question":"Q: In this task, you are given a sentence from the Bible in Persian, and your task is to translate it into English. پس رفت و گرفته، نزد مادر خود آورد. و مادرش خورشی ساخت بطوری که پدرش دوست می‌داشت.

The long-nosed, hairy mammals are not typically aggressive toward people and are considered a vulnerable species by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), largely due to deforestation and human settlements that encroach on their territory. However, they have poor vision and if frightened, they may defend themselves with front claws that are as long as pocketknives. The case studies of two fatal attacks by giant anteaters were described in the journal Wilderness and Environmental Medicine, which released the paper online this month, ahead of its publication in the December print issue. \\"Both were farmers, were hunting and were attacked by wounded or cornered animals,\\" lead author Vidal Haddad of the Botucatu School of Medicine at Sao Paulo State University told AFP. In the first case, a 47-year-old man was hunting with his two sons and his dogs when they came upon a giant anteater in northern Brazil. The hunter did not shoot at the animal, but he approached it with his knife drawn. The anteater stood on its hind legs and grabbed the man with its forelimbs, causing deep puncture wounds in his thighs and upper arms. The hunter bled to death at the scene, said the report, which noted that the encounter happened on August 1, 2012 but had not been described in scientific literature until now. The other case involved a 75-year-old man who died in 2010 when an anteater used its long front claws -- which typically help it dig into anthills -- to puncture his femoral arteries, located in the groin and thigh. \\"These injuries are very serious and we have no way of knowing whether it is a defense behavior acquired by the animals,\\" said Haddad. He stressed that such attacks are rare, but said they are important because they show the need for people to give wild animals plenty of space. - Easily startled - Giant anteaters (Myrmecophaga tridactyla) are believed to be extinct in Belize, El Salvador, Guatemala and Uruguay. Some 5,000 exist in the wild and can be found in parts of Central and South America. Overall their numbers have declined about 30 percent in the past decade due to habitat loss, roadkills, hunting, wildfires and burning of sugar cane plantations, according to the IUCN. They range in length from four to seven feet (1.2-2 meters), and may weigh as much as 100 pounds (45 kilograms). Giant anteaters eat mainly insects but they also enjoy citrus and avocados, according to zookeeper Rebecca Lohse who works with them in captivity at the Reid Park Zoo in Tucson, Arizona. \\"They are animals that can startle quickly -- planes going overheard, chainsaws, leaf blowers can startle them,\\" she said. \\"The way they defend themselves is by standing up on their rear legs and swinging their front legs in from the side,\\" she explained. \\"They have incredibly muscular forearms and those claws are several inches long.\\" Zookeepers generally avoid being in the same space as the animals, coaxing them into separate fenced-off areas when they approach their living quarters for cleaning, she added. Anteater expert Flavia Miranda, who works with the animals in Brazil, said she was concerned that the journal article could cause more woes for a creature that already faces plenty of threats to its livelihood. \\"We have a lot of problems with this species because people believe that (they) bring bad luck and kill the animal on purpose,\\" she told AFP in an email. \\"But I understand the importance of the article because recently I also had an accident with a giant anteater that almost cost me my life.\\" ||||| Habitat and Ecology: This terrestrial anteater is found in tropical moist forest, dry forest, savanna habitats and open grasslands; it has also been reported from the Gran Chaco (Meritt 2008, Noss et al. 2008) and timber plantations (Kreutz et al. 2013). Recent camera trap data suggest that the species may be more abundant in areas of upland forest in the Brazilian Amazon than previously thought (F. Miranda pers. comm. 2013). Giant anteaters require large areas for their survival, which should contain forested patches. Animals are generally solitary. Once per year, the female gives birth to a single young. Gestation length is 171 to 184 days (Bartmann 1983, Patzl et al. 1998, Knott et al. 2013). The mother carries the offspring on its back for approximately six months. Data from captive animals in European zoos show several females reproducing for the first time at 18-22 months, and the oldest known reproductive captive dams were 20-24 years old (unpublished report provided by I. Schappert). For wild females, sexual maturity is usually indicated as being around 2 years however, as it is not possible to determine their age once they reach adult size and long-term population studies on giant anteaters are lacking, there are no data on the longevity, survival rates, or reproductive rates of wild giant anteaters. The generation length of M. tridactyla in the wild is therefore unknown, but it is suspected to be around 7 years ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","response":"Giant anteaters in Brazil have reportedly killed two hunters in separate incidents, raising concerns about the animals' loss of habitat and the growing risk of dangerous encounters with people.

Step 2: Combine like terms on the right side. Before solving for v, we need to combine the like terms on the right side of the equation, which are the terms with the variable v: 29*v - 14*v can be simplified as: (29 - 14)*v = 15*v So now the equation is 11*v = 15*v. Step 3: Isolate the variable (v) To isolate v, we need to remove the terms involving v from one side of the equation. Since 11*v and 15*v are on opposite sides, we can subtract 11*v from both sides of the equation to cancel out the 11*v term on the left. This does not affect the equality: 11*v - 11*v = 15*v - 11*v Which simplifies to: 0 = 4*v Step 4: Solve for v To find the value of v, we need to eliminate the coefficient of v, which is 4. Divide both sides of the equation by 4: (0/4) = (4*v)/4 This simplifies to: v = 0 So the solution to the equation 11*v = 29*v - 14*v is v = 0."},{"question":"1564: The city of Ryazan posad was burned.:47 1571: Russo-Crimean War 1572: Battle of Molodi 1591: Raid reaches Moscow. :116 1591: Artillery stops a raid at Kolomenskoy on the Bank Line. :52 1592: Suburbs of Moscow burned.

She later uploaded the photo to her Facebook page, thinking her friends would get a kick out of it as well. To her chagrin, many of the comments she received were decidedly unsupportive of her shenanigans, so she decided to try and nip the outrage in the bud by posting a mea culpa of sorts. \\"Whoa whoa whoa... wait,\\" Stone wrote on October 20th. \\"This is just us, being the douchebags that we are, challenging authority in general. Much like the pic posted the night before, of me smoking right next to a no smoking sign.

A Facebook page called \\"Fire Lindsey Stone\\" was created less than a day ago and has already amassed over 4,000 likes. Started by a former servicemember, the page calls for Stone to be terminated from her job at LIFE, a Cape Cod-based nonprofit that houses adults with learning disabilities. \\"Let her employer know how much of a waste of oxygen this disrespectful person is,\\" wrote the page's creator, who notes that Stone's trip to Arlington National Cemetery was paid for by the organization.

The photo, taken by co-worker Jamie Schuh, went viral and sparked anger among veterans. “I can understand why veterans would be all upset over this,” says Edward LeBlanc who was in the Air Force for 20 years and served two tours in Vietnam. “It’s disrespectful, she’s telling us to go “F” ourselves and I don’t think that’s real bright and good for anybody.” Some angry comments were posted on the Facebook page of their employer, Living Independently Forever, Inc.,(LIFE) a non-profit organization in Hyannis that helps adults with disabilities on Cape Cod.

While posted on a public forum, the picture was intended only for our own amusement. We never meant any disrespect to any of the people nationwide who have served this country and defended our freedom so valiantly.

We are beyond remorseful that our actions have caused them such undue public scrutiny. The disrespect implied by our picture has nothing at all to do with LIFE’s mission statement or values. We regret having caused any suffering to the staff members, residents, families and friends. Again, we very sincerely apologize to everyone who took offense to the photo. We realize that it was an ignorant and distasteful thing for us to do, but we truly meant no harm. We are deeply sorry. – Lindsey Stone and Jamie Schuh” Lindsey’s father Peter spoke with WBZ-TV about the incident. “She had no intention of upsetting or offending anyone,” says Peter Stone. “It was poor judgment and she regrets every part of it.” Peter says Lindsey loved her job, but there are consequences for every action. “That was a private page,” he says. “She was goofing around and it got taken off the page.” “She is very, very sorry for what she did,” says her mother Jeanne, “and she never meant it to be disrespectful to anybody.” Sarah Wunsch, a Staff Attorney with the ACLU of Massachusetts does not think the women should not lose their jobs over the photo. “Other people have the right to say, ‘I think she’s a jerk or she’s disrespectful.’ I suppose they have the right to call for her to be fired,” says Wunsch. “But it doesn’t mean the employer should give into that.” “Offensiveness shouldn’t be the standard for what gets to be able to be said, because what’s offensive to you may not be offensive to me and vice versa,” says Wunsch.

They become friends, and Brian witnesses Sally's anarchic, bohemian life in the last days of the German Weimar Republic. Sally and Brian become lovers despite their earlier reservations; they conclude that his previous failures with women were because they were \\"the wrong three girls\\". Sally befriends Maximilian von Heune, a rich playboy baron who takes her and Brian to his country estate; it becomes ambiguous which of the duo Max is seducing. After a sexual experience with Brian, Max loses interest in the two and departs for Argentina. During an argument, when Sally tells Brian that she has been having sex with Max, Brian reveals that he has as well. Brian and Sally later reconcile, and Sally reveals that Max left them money and mockingly compares the sum with what a professional prostitute gets. Sally learns that she is pregnant, but is unsure of the father. Brian offers to marry her and take her back to his university life in Cambridge. At first they celebrate their resolution to start this new life together, but after a picnic between Sally and Brian in which Brian acts distant and uninterested, Sally starts to doubt continuing with the pregnancy, and is disheartened by the vision of herself as a bored faculty wife washing dirty diapers. Ultimately she has an abortion, without informing Brian in advance. When he confronts her, she shares her fears and the two reach an understanding.

Answer: We observe different shades of colors in the sky during a sunset at the beach due to a phenomenon called scattering of light. As the sun sets, its light has to travel through a greater distance in the Earth's atmosphere. The atmosphere scatters shorter wavelengths of light (such as blue and green) more than longer wavelengths (like red and orange). As a result, the longer wavelengths become more dominant, and we witness a vibrant display of colors in the sky, including shades of red, orange, and yellow. Moreover, the presence of water and atmospheric particles like dust and pollution can influence the intensity of colors during the sunset."},{"question":"Answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"Lord Bathurst died in what year?\\" is in \\"Among the reasons this speech was so greatly admired was its passage on Lord Bathurst (1684–1775); Burke describes an angel in 1704 prophesying to Bathurst the future greatness of England and also of America: \\"Young man, There is America – which at this day serves little more than to amuse you with stories of savage men, and uncouth manners; yet shall, before you taste of death, shew itself equal to the whole of that commerce which now attracts the envy of the world\\".

Recently, he detected four asteroids, asteroid A, asteroid B, asteroid C, and asteroid D. Asteroid A and asteroid B are of the same mass, but asteroid A is farther from the earth than asteroid B. Asteroid C and asteroid D are at the same distance form the earth, but asteroid C has more mass than asteroid D. He also figured out that all of these asteroids have less mass than earth. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: In clssical theory, if Rob needs to find out the object with stronger gravitational pull, which one would he choose, earth or asteroid A? Hint: The classical explanation of gravity is that a force of attraction acts at a distance between two objects and the magnitude of the force is directly proportional to each of the masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the objects. The objects move toward each other due to this force of attraction. Einstein’s new concept of gravity states that matter (mass) causes the space around the matter to curve and also distorts time. A straight line through this curved space would also be curved in order to be a straight line. A:","response":"In classical theory, to determine which object has a stronger gravitational pull - Earth or asteroid A - we can compare the gravitational forces acting between Earth and another object (we'll call it object X) and asteroid A and the same object X. Step 1: Write the equations for the gravitational forces between the objects. Gravitational force between Earth (E) and object X (F_Ex) : F_Ex = G * (mass of E) * (mass of X) / (distance between E and X)^2 Gravitational force between asteroid A (A) and object X (F_Ax) : F_Ax = G * (mass of A) * (mass of X) / (distance between A and X)^2 Step 2: Compare the equations. In the equation, G and mass of X are constants that are present in both equations, so we only need to compare the remaining values: - Mass: Earth's mass is greater than asteroid A, as mentioned in the paragraph. - Distance: The distance between asteroid A and object X is greater than the distance between Earth and object X, as asteroid A is farther from Earth. Step 3: Analyze and justify. Since the mass of Earth is greater and it is closer in distance to object X than asteroid A is, Earth will have a stronger gravitational pull compared to asteroid A. So, Rob would choose Earth as the object with a stronger gravitational pull in the classical theory."},{"question":"Briefly summarize this sentence: prosecutors said tuesday they want more evidence from police before determining whether to press charges against chris brown , who 's accused in a domestic dispute that reportedly involves pop superstar rihanna .

This statement primarily describes Apple's initial efforts to address labor issues at Foxconn, its manufacturer, by conducting its own audit. The actual answer to the question is that in 2012, Apple joined the Fair Labor Association (FLA), a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting and protecting workers' rights and improving working conditions globally. The FLA conducts independent audits and assessments of its member companies to ensure compliance with fair labor standards and practices. After joining the FLA, Apple allowed the organization to conduct independent assessments of its suppliers, including Foxconn, to ensure adherence to Apple's Supplier Code of Conduct and other labor standards. These assessments led to numerous improvements in labor policies and working conditions at Apple's manufacturing facilities, including Foxconn.

He was born William Francis Sutton, Jr., on June 30, 1901, and died on November 2, 1980. Sutton was a master of disguise and known for his meticulous planning of over 50 bank robberies during his criminal career, which spanned four decades from the 1920s to 1950s. He managed to steal an estimated 2 million over the course of his heists. However, there is some controversy over whether Sutton actually made this statement. The quote was popularized by journalist Mitch Ohnstad, who attributed it to Sutton in his newspaper column. In later years, Sutton denied ever saying it, stating that instead the credit belonged to someone else. Some sources suggest that during an interview with a journalist, Sutton was asked by the interviewer why he robbed banks, and the reporter created the iconic quote based on his response. Regardless of its origin, the quote has passed into popular use and become synonymous with Sutton's name. Willie Sutton's life was punctuated by a series of bank robberies, prison escapes, and eventual recapture. His criminal career prompted US law enforcement to seek innovative ways to apprehend bank robbers. Sutton's eventual capture in 1952 was a direct result of the then-new technique of sending \\"wanted\\" photos electronically via a system called \\"fax simile\\" (an early version of the fax machine). He was recognized by a passer-by after the circulation of his photograph. Sutton was sentenced to 105 years in prison but was eventually paroled in 1969. After his release, Sutton capitalized on his notoriety by becoming a consultant on bank security, co-authoring two books, and advising police officers on the techniques used by bank robbers. Despite his criminal past, the tale of Willie Sutton continues to captivate the public as an example of the quintessential career criminal, and his alleged quote remains central to his infamy."},{"question":"What is the sentiment of the following review?

(CNN) -- Now that President Obama has set the timetable for withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq, the debate has begun over its possible consequences. U.S. troops secure a street in in the southern Dura district of Baghdad, Iraq, this week. Does it provide enough time for Iraqis to forge a functioning government and an economy that benefits everyone? And if it doesn't, could a civil war be the result? The plan, as outlined in a February 27 speech by Obama, calls for most U.S. troops to leave Iraq by August 2010. A \\"transitional force\\" of 35,000 to 50,000 troops will remain in the country to assist Iraqi security forces, protect Americans and fight terrorism, Obama said. Track Obama's First 100 Days Obama's plan is predicated on a relative decrease in violence in Iraq and the belief that","response":"the Iraqi government and security forces can take on the responsibility of maintaining stability and order once the U.S. troops have withdrawn. While the plan has its proponents who argue that it sends a clear message of the United States' commitment to ending the Iraq war and allows Iraqis to take control of their own destiny, there are critics who fear that this timeline may not be sufficient for Iraq to build a fully functioning government and economy, ultimately leading to chaos or even a civil war. To address these concerns, it is essential to analyze different factors that will influence the success of the plan. Firstly, the capacity of Iraqi security forces will be crucial in maintaining order after the U.S. troop withdrawal. While there have been improvements in the performance of these forces, questions remain about their ability to take on the full responsibility of combating insurgent groups and maintaining law and order. The transitional force left behind by the U.S. will provide support, but it is ultimately the performance of the Iraqi forces that will determine the stability of the country. Secondly, a functioning and inclusive government will be key in preventing the renewal of sectarian conflict and civil war. Efforts to build a functioning government have shown some progress, but internal political struggles and factionalism still pose a risk. A failure to achieve political consensus among different Iraqi factions, address issues related to power-sharing, corruption, service delivery, and the representation of minority groups could create an environment in which civil unrest and violence can flourish. Thirdly, the economic well-being of the country plays a significant role in fostering stability. The Iraqi government must aggressively work towards creating jobs, rebuilding infrastructure, and fostering economic growth to ensure that its people have a stake in the success of the country. The impact of external factors, such as fluctuations in oil prices and regional economic challenges, can complicate Iraq's efforts to develop a stable economy. Lastly, regional and international factors, such as the policies of neighboring countries like Iran and Turkey, can also influence the stability of Iraq. A more stable region, combined with continued international support, both in terms of diplomatic engagement and financial aid, will mitigate the risks of a civil war erupting. In conclusion, while President Obama's plan for troop withdrawal is based on the premise that the Iraqi government and security forces would be capable of maintaining stability, there remains a degree of uncertainty regarding the outcome. A combination of factors, including the performance of Iraqi security forces, the functionality of the government, economic well-being, and regional support, will determine whether Iraq can avoid descending into chaos or civil war. Ultimately, time will tell if the provided timeline proves to be enough for Iraq to forge its path to peace and stability."},{"question":"Given the question: This is a correct answer to the following question about United States ten-dollar bill.

Paris (CNN) A 9-year-old South African child diagnosed with HIV when he was 1 month old has been in HIV remission for 8½ years -- without regular treatment. This is the first reported case of a child controlling their HIV infection without drugs in Africa and the third known case globally. Soon after diagnosis, the child was placed on antiretroviral treatment, or ART, for 40 weeks, at which point treatment was stopped and the child's health was monitored. Blood tests in late 2015 revealed the child is in HIV remission, meaning levels of the virus in the blood are undetectable using standard tests. Subsequent testing of samples dating back to the child's infancy confirm remission was achieved soon after treatment was stopped.The 9-year-old has been in HIV remission for most of his lifeUnderstanding his biology may one day help other children come off HIV treatment Question:We could develop a product given to people in combination with _ so people can eventually stop ART, said Violari.

Some over-the-counter pain relievers have mild side effects, so follow the dosage the manufacturer sets for you. If the pain is constant, but you feel a sharp stabbing sensation along the roots, you may want to consider visiting a doctor. Sometimes root canal pain becomes more pronounced when the patient brushes the root. Although you'll be given pain medication during the root canal, you should take the otc pain relievers within an hour after the root canal. This will give them a chance to start working before your anesthesia wears off. While it's important to manage the pain after a root canal, it's crucial to remember that proper aftercare is also key to a successful recovery. Avoid chewing on the treated tooth for a few days, or until it's fully restored. This will allow the tooth to heal and prevent any further damage. Additionally, maintain good oral hygiene by brushing twice a day, flossing daily, and using a mouthwash. This will help prevent any infection or complications. If your root canal pain persists for more than a few days after the procedure or worsens over time, you should consult your dentist immediately. It may be a sign of an underlying issue, complications with the procedure, or an infection. Your dentist will be able to evaluate your symptoms and recommend an appropriate course of action, which may include further dental work, a prescription for stronger pain relief, or a referral to a specialist. Another option to alleviate root canal pain is the use of cold or warm compresses. Applying a cold compress to the outside of your cheek near the affected tooth can help to numb the area and reduce swelling, which in turn can help to alleviate pain. In contrast, a warm compress can help to increase blood flow and reduce any inflammation. It is essential to determine which method works best for you, but always remember to follow your dentist's specific instructions on when and how to use these compresses. Finally, it's essential to keep an open line of communication with your dentist throughout the entire process. From the initial diagnosis to the post-treatment follow-up, your dentist is your best resource for advice and guidance. Discuss any concerns or questions you may have with them, as they can help tailor your treatment and pain management strategies to fit your specific needs."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: I lost my baby boy at 31 weeks of pregnancy in February 2013.

For much of her career, Hedren's year of birth was reported as 1935. In 2004, however, she acknowledged that she was actually born in 1930 (which is consistent with the birth registration index at the Minnesota Historical Society). Her paternal grandparents were Swedish immigrants, while her maternal ancestry is German and Norwegian. The Birds (1963) was Hedren's screen debut. Hitchcock became her drama coach, and gave her an education in film-making as she attended many of the production meetings such as script, music or photography conferences. Hedren said, \\"I probably learned in three years what it would have taken me 15 years to learn otherwise.\\" She learned how to break down a script, to become another character, and to study the relationship of different characters. Hedren portrayed her role of Melanie Daniels as Hitchcock requested. She said, \\"He gives his actors very little leeway. He'll listen, but he has a very definite plan in mind as to how he wants his characters to act. With me, it was understandable, because I was not an actress of stature. I welcomed his guidance.\\" During the six months of principal photography, Hedren's schedule was tight, as she was only given one afternoon off a week. At first, she found the shooting \\"wonderful\\". Hitchcock told a reporter, after a few weeks of filming, that she was remarkable, and said, \\"She's already reaching the lows and highs of terror.\\" Nonetheless, Hedren recalled the week she did the final bird attack scene in a second-floor bedroom as the worst of her life. Before filming it, she asked Hitchcock about her character's motivations to go upstairs, and his response was, \\"Because I tell you to.\\" She was then assured that the crew would use mechanical birds. Instead, Hedren endured five solid days of prop men, protected by thick leather gloves, flinging dozens of live gulls, ravens and crows at her (their beaks clamped shut with elastic bands). In a state of exhaustion, when one of the birds gouged her cheek and narrowly missed her eye, Hedren sat down on the set and began crying. A physician ordered a week's rest. Hitchcock protested, according to Hedren, saying there was nobody but her to film. The doctor's reply was, \\"Are you trying to kill her?\\" She said the week also appeared to be an ordeal for the director. Universal's executives, who did not back Hitchcock's decision to hire Hedren in the first place, were impressed with her performance and Wasserman described it as \\"remarkable\\". While promoting The Birds, Hitchcock was full of praise for his new protegee, and compared her to Grace Kelly. \\"Tippi has a faster tempo, city glibness, more humor [than Grace Kelly]. She displayed jaunty assuredness, pertness, an attractive throw of the head. And she memorized and read lines extraordinarily well and is sharper in expression.\\" The film was screened out of competition in May at a prestigious invitational showing at the 1963 Cannes Film Festival. Hedren's performance was praised in Variety's review: \\"Aside from the birds, the film belongs to Hedren, who makes an auspicious screen bow. She virtually has to carry the picture alone for the first forty-five minute stretch, prior to the advent of the first wave of organized attackers from the sky. Miss Hedren has a star quality and Hitchcock has provided her with a potent vehicle to launch her career\\". Hedren received the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year, tied with Elke Sommer and Ursula Andress.

Today, we are going to talk about some amazing people who dance beautifully and a big question about classical music. Are you ready? Let's go! First, let's talk about Margot Fonteyn. She was a super-duper famous dancer in the 1900s. People loved to watch her dance because she was so graceful and elegant, like a swan gliding on a lake. She was so fantastic at dancing that many people think of her as the most iconic dancer of the 20th century. Iconic means she was so good that everyone remembers her as the best. Now, let's meet Ken Swift and Suzanne Farrell. Just like Margot, they are also very famous dancers, and they are as amazing as her. Ken could spin on his head and do cool tricks! He was a master of a type of dance called breakdancing, which is very energetic and exciting. Kids like us enjoy it a lot! Suzanne was another excellent dancer who could spin around and make beautiful shapes with her body. She could stretch her legs and point her toes like no one else. People loved watching her dance too! These three dancers, Margot Fonteyn, Ken Swift, and Suzanne Farrell, were so wonderful that they were voted as some of the top dancers of their time. Imagine how awesome it would be to see them dance together! Now let's talk about the big question coming up in February. People want to know who we think is the greatest classical composer. A composer is someone who writes music for other people to play, and classical music is a special kind of music that has been around for a very long time. Some of these composers wrote music for orchestras to play, and it can sometimes sound fancy and beautiful. In February, we are going to have a big vote to see who is the best classical composer out there, just like we did with the dancers. It's like choosing the yummiest ice cream flavor or the funniest cartoon. But, instead of ice cream or cartoons, we're picking our favorite person who writes classical music. And that's it for today, little friends! I hope you enjoyed learning about Margot Fonteyn, Ken Swift, and Suzanne Farrell, and don't forget to think about who your favorite classical composer is. It's going to be so much fun finding out who will be voted the greatest, and maybe you'll discover a new favorite along the way!"},{"question":"Information: - Sulpicius Alexander ( fl . late fourth century ) was a Roman historian of Germanic tribes . His work is lost , but his Historia in at least four books is quoted by Gregory of Tours . It was perhaps a continuation of the Res gestae by Ammianus Marcellinus ( which ended in 378 AD ) and dealt with events at least until the death of Valentinian II ( 392 AD ) . The work of Sulpicius Alexander as extracts in Gregory 's Decem Libri Historiarum ( II 9 ) is considered an important source in any discussion of the origin of the Frankish tribes . - The Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application (NERVA) was a U.S. nuclear thermal rocket engine development program that ran for roughly two decades. NERVA was a joint effort of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) and NASA, managed by the Space Nuclear Propulsion Office (SNPO) until both the program and the office ended at the end of 1972. - Valentinian II (371 15 May 392), was Roman Emperor from AD 375 to 392. - Ammianus Marcellinus (born c. 325330 died c. 391400) was a Roman soldier and historian who wrote the penultimate major historical account surviving from Antiquity (preceding Procopius). His work, known as the Res Gestae, chronicled in Latin the history of Rome from the accession of the emperor Nerva in 96 to the death of Valens at the Battle of Adrianople in 378, although only the sections covering the period 353378 survive. - St. Martin of Tours (316 or 336 8 November 397) was Bishop of Tours, whose shrine in France became a famous stopping-point for pilgrims on the road to Santiago de Compostela in Spain. He has become one of the most familiar and recognizable Christian saints, sometimes venerated as a military saint. As he was born in what is now Szombathely, Hungary, spent much of his childhood in Pavia, Italy, and lived most of his adult life in France, he is considered a spiritual bridge across Europe. - Valentinian I (3 July 321 17 November 375), also known as Valentinian the Great, was Roman emperor from 364 to 375. Upon becoming emperor he made his brother Valens his co-emperor, giving him rule of the eastern provinces while Valentinian retained the west. - Procopius of Caesarea (; 500 554 AD) was a prominent late antique scholar from Palaestina Prima. Accompanying the Roman general Belisarius in the wars of the Emperor Justinian, he became the principal Byzantine historian of the 6th century, writing the \\"Wars\\" (or \\"Histories\\"), the \\"Buildings of Justinian\\" and the now-celebrated (and infamous) \\"Secret History\\". He is commonly held to be the last major historian of the ancient Western world. - The Battle of Adrianople (9 August 378), sometimes known as the Battle of Hadrianopolis, was fought between an Eastern Roman army led by the Eastern Roman Emperor Valens and Gothic rebels (largely Thervings as well as Greutungs, non-Gothic Alans, and various local rebels) led by Fritigern. The battle took place about north of Adrianople (modern Edirne in European Turkey, near the border with Greece and Bulgaria) in the Roman province of Thracia. It ended with an overwhelming victory for the Goths and the death of Emperor Valens. - Gaul (Latin: \\"Gallia\\") was a region of Western Europe during the Iron Age that was inhabited by Celtic tribes, encompassing present day France, Luxembourg, Belgium, most of Switzerland, Northern Italy, as well as the parts of the Netherlands, Central Italy and Germany on the west bank of the Rhine. It covered an area of 190,800 mi² or 494,169 km². According to the testimony of Julius Caesar, Gaul was divided into three parts: Gallia Celtica, Belgica and Aquitania. Archaeologically, the Gauls were bearers of the La Tène culture, which extended across all of Gaul, as well as east to Raetia, Noricum, Pannonia and southwestern Germania during the 5th to 1st centuries BC. During the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, Gaul fell under Roman rule: Gallia Cisalpina was conquered in 203 BC and Gallia Narbonensis in 123 BC. Gaul was invaded after 120 BC by the Cimbri and the Teutons, who were in turn defeated by the Romans by 103 BC. Julius Caesar finally subdued the remaining parts of Gaul in his campaigns of 58 to 51 BC. - Valens (328 9 August 378), fully \\"Flavius Julius Valens Augustus\\", was Eastern Roman Emperor from 364 to 378. He was given the eastern half of the empire by his brother Valentinian I after the latter's accession to the throne. Valens, sometimes known as the Last True Roman, was defeated and killed in the Battle of Adrianople, which marked the beginning of the collapse of the decaying Western Roman Empire. - Saint Gregory of Tours (30 November c. 538 17 November 594) was a Gallo-Roman historian and Bishop of Tours, which made him a leading prelate of Gaul. He was born Georgius Florentius, later adding the name Gregorius in honour of his maternal great-grandfather. He is the main contemporary source for Merovingian history. His most notable work was his \\"Decem Libri Historiarum\\" or \\"Ten Books of Histories,\\" better known as the \\"Historia Francorum\\" (\\"History of the Franks\\"), a title given to it by later chroniclers, but he is also known for his accounts of the miracles of saints, especially four books of the miracles of Martin of Tours. St Martin's tomb was a major draw in the 6th century, and Gregory's writings had the practical aspect of promoting this highly organized devotion. - The Franks (or ') are historically first known as a group of Germanic tribes that inhabited the land between the Lower and Middle Rhine in the 3rd century AD, and second as the people of Gaul who merged with the Gallo-Roman populations during succeeding centuries, passing on their name to modern-day France and becoming part of the heritage of the modern French people. Some Franks raided Roman territory, while other Frankish tribes joined the Roman troops of Gaul. In later times, Franks became the military rulers of the northern part of Roman Gaul. With the coronation of their ruler Charlemagne as ' by Pope Leo III in 800 AD, he and his successors were recognised as legitimate successors to the emperors of the Western Roman Empire. - The Roman emperor was the ruler of the Roman Empire during the imperial period (starting in 27 BC). The emperors used a variety of different titles throughout history. Often when a given Roman is described as becoming \\"emperor\\" in English, it reflects his taking of the title \\"Augustus\\" or \\"Caesar\\". Another title often used was \\"imperator\\", originally a military honorific. Early Emperors also used the title \\"princeps\\" (first citizen). Emperors frequently amassed republican titles, notably \\"Princeps Senatus\\", \\"Consul\\" and \\"Pontifex Maximus\\".

Even though it's sunny outside he's going to have to bundle up due to the cold temperature. In his closet there is a large black coat and a large white coat. He can't decide which coat to wear. But I can use this background: Light may transfer its energy to matter rather than being reflected or transmitted by matter. This is called absorption . When light is absorbed, the added energy increases the temperature of matter. If you get into a car that has been sitting in the sun all day, the seats and other parts of the car’s interior may be almost too hot to touch, especially if they are black or very dark in color. That’s because dark colors absorb most of the sunlight that strikes them. What is an answer for this question: Which coat will absorb more sunlight? The answer is:","response":"The large black coat will absorb more sunlight compared to the large white coat. This is due to the fact that dark colors, such as black, have a higher tendency to absorb light energy rather than reflecting or transmitting it. When light energy is absorbed by a material, the added energy increases the temperature of that material. In the case of the two coats, the black coat will absorb more sunlight and consequently, its temperature will rise more than that of the white coat. The white coat, on the other hand, will reflect most of the sunlight and thus retain less heat energy. This occurs because white and lighter colors tend to reflect a larger portion of the light that strikes them. Therefore, when Johnathan has to choose between the large black coat and the large white coat to wear during winter, the black coat is likely to keep him warmer due to its capacity to absorb more sunlight and retain heat. In conclusion, while both coats may offer protection from the cold winter temperature, the large black coat will provide better insulation and warmth due to its ability to absorb more sunlight. This can be especially helpful in sunny winter conditions, where the extra absorbed sunlight can contribute to maintaining a comfortable body temperature while walking to work."},{"question":"Q: Context: The Gulf of Mexico (Spanish: Golfo de México) is an ocean basin and a marginal sea of the Atlantic Ocean, largely surrounded by the North American continent.

Of the following two sentences, which one is against common sense? Options: - Sentence A: \\"Paul was a three meters man\\" - Sentence B: \\"Paul was three years old\\"","response":"Sentence A: \\"Paul was a three meters man\\" is against common sense. Explanation: Common sense is the basic understanding and recognition of ordinary facts and principles that most people possess. In this context, Sentence A is against common sense because it is highly unlikely for a human being to be three meters tall. The average height of adult men is generally between 1.6 to 1.9 meters (5'3\\" to 6'4\\"), depending on the region and genetics. To be three meters tall (almost 9'10\\") would be extremely extraordinary and, as such, goes against common sense. It is important to note that this statement could be figurative or metaphorical in some contexts, but when taken literally, it defies common sense.

Gary Gray, and stars Samuel L. Jackson and Kevin Spacey as two hostage lieutenants. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary.

The group also raises funds for the Cinema for Peace Foundation and other charities. - A lava field, also called a lava plain or lava bed, is a large expanse of nearly flat-lying lava flows. Such features are generally composed of highly fluid basalt lava, and can extend for tens or even hundreds of miles across the underlying terrain. The extent of large lava fields is most readily grasped from the air or in satellite photos, where their typically dark, nearly black color contrasts sharply with the rest of the landscape. According to the US Geological Survey, monogenetic volcanic fields are collections of cinder cones, and/or Maar vents and associated lava flows and pyroclastic deposits. Sometimes a stratovolcano is at the center of the field, as at the San Francisco Volcanic Field in Arizona. Monogenetic volcano fields have systematic growth patterns that suggest they represent single magmatic systems in the same way that stratovolcanoes do, but monogenetic volcanoes grow laterally rather than vertically (Wood and Shoan, 1984). Detailed mapping indicates that some cinder cones in monogenetic fields (e.g., Cima, California, and Timber Mountain Volcanic Field, Nevada) may have had multiple eruptions separated by tens to hundreds of thousands of years (Wells, et al., 1989). Thus, some monogenetic cones may actually be polygenetic. This possibility differs from observations of historic eruptions (Wood, 1979), and is physically difficult to understand because cinder cone conduits are narrow and must solidify within a few years of eruption. Nonetheless, such multiple eruptions appear to have happened at least twice: Other cinder cones need to be closely reexamined. - Dancer in the Dark ( Danish : Danser i mørket ) is a 2000 Danish musical drama film directed by Lars von Trier and starring Icelandic singer Björk , Catherine Deneuve , David Morse , Cara Seymour , Peter Stormare , Siobhan Fallon Hogan , and Joel Grey .

To make potato stock","response":"Making potato stock is an excellent way to add depth of flavor to various dishes such as soups, stews, sauces, risottos, and more. Below, I have outlined a detailed step-by-step guide to help you create a delicious and versatile potato stock from scratch. Ingredients: - 2 pounds of potatoes (russet or other starchy varieties work best), washed and roughly chopped - 1 large onion, coarsely chopped - 2 carrots, scrubbed and roughly chopped - 2 celery stalks, trimmed and roughly chopped - 1 leek, green part and white part, thoroughly washed and sliced - 4 cloves of garlic, smashed - 1 bay leaf - 4 sprigs of fresh thyme - 1 tablespoon of whole black peppercorns - 8 cups of cold water - Salt, to taste Instructions: 1. Prepare the ingredients: Wash the potatoes thoroughly, then chop them into rough pieces, skin on, to increase their surface area and maximize the release of their starch and flavor. Chop the onion, carrots, celery, and leek, and smash the garlic to break up the cloves and release their flavor. 2. Combine ingredients in a large pot: Place the chopped potatoes, onion, carrots, celery, leek, smashed garlic, bay leaf, thyme sprigs, and whole black peppercorns in a large stockpot or Dutch oven. 3. Add cold water: Pour 8 cups of cold water into the pot, making sure all the ingredients are submerged. Using cold water is essential to extract the maximum flavor from the vegetables as it warms up and for the stock to remain clear. 4. Slowly bring to a simmer: Set the pot over medium heat and allow the water to heat slowly. Do not let it come to a rapid boil; a gentle simmer is ideal for releasing the flavors and nutrients from the ingredients. Once it reaches a simmer, lower the heat to maintain it. 5. Skim impurities: As the stock simmers, you may notice a foamy scum rising to the surface. Use a slotted spoon or fine mesh skimmer to remove it, as these impurities can affect the taste and appearance of the final product. 6. Simmer for 1.5 to 2 hours: Allow the stock to simmer gently for this duration, occasionally skimming the surface for impurities. The potato stock will reduce and thicken slightly, and the flavors will become more concentrated. 7. Season with salt: Add salt to taste, but be cautious not to over-season as the stock will reduce further and can become more intense in flavor. 8. Strain the stock: Once the stock has reduced and the flavors are well-developed, remove the pot from heat and let it cool slightly. Place a fine-mesh sieve or colander lined with cheesecloth over a large bowl or another pot. Carefully pour the stock through the sieve, discarding the solids. 9. Cool and store the stock: Allow the potato stock to cool completely before transferring it to an airtight container or jars. You can store the stock in the refrigerator for up to 4-5 days or freeze in airtight containers or ice cube trays for up to 3 months. Now you have successfully made your potato stock! Use it in various recipes, adding richness, natural thickening, and a depth of flavor to your culinary creations."},{"question":"Question: Information: - Field artillery is a category of mobile artillery used to support armies in the field. These weapons are specialized for mobility, tactical proficiency, long range, short range and extremely long range target engagement. - Infantry is the general branch of an army that engages in military combat on foot. As the troops who engage with the enemy in close-ranged combat, infantry units bear the largest brunt of warfare and typically suffer the greatest number of casualties during a military campaign. Historically, as the oldest branch of the combat arms, the infantry are the tip of the spear of a modern army, and continually undergo training that is typically more physically demanding and psychologically stressful than that of any other branch of the combat arms. Common representations of infantry fighting forces include the U.S. Army Infantry Branch, U.S. Marine Corps Infantry, Royal Canadian Infantry Corps, Infantry of the British Army, and the Royal Australian Corps of Infantry. - Artillery is a class of large military weapons built to fire munitions far beyond the range and power of infantry's small arms. Early artillery development focused on the ability to breach fortifications, and led to heavy, fairly immobile siege engines. As technology improved, lighter, more mobile field artillery developed for battlefield use. This development continues today; modern self-propelled artillery vehicles are highly mobile weapons of great versatility providing the largest share of an army's total firepower. - Fortifications are military constructions or buildings designed for the defense of territories in warfare, and also used to solidify rule in a region during peace time. Humans have constructed defensive works for many thousands of years, in a variety of increasingly complex designs. The term is derived from the Latin \\"fortis\\" (\\"strong\\") and \\"facere\\" (\\"to make\\"). - A siege is a military blockade of a city or fortress with the intent of conquering by attrition or assault. This derives from \\"sedere\\", Latin for \\"to sit\\". Siege warfare is a form of constant, low-intensity conflict characterized by one party holding a strong, static defensive position. Consequently, an opportunity for negotiation between combatants is not uncommon, as proximity and fluctuating advantage can encourage diplomacy. - A tractor unit (prime mover or traction unit) is a characteristically heavy-duty towing engine that provides motive power for hauling a towed or trailered load. These fall into two categories: very heavy-duty typically off-road capable, often 6×6, military and commercial tractor units, including ballast tractors, and heavy and medium duty military and commercial rear-wheel drive \\"semi tractors\\" used for hauling semi-trailers. - A ballast tractor is a specially weighted tractor unit of a heavy hauler combination. It is designed to utilize a drawbar to pull or push heavy or exceptionally large trailored loads. When feasible, lowboy-style semi-trailers are used to minimize a load's center of gravity. Typical drivetrains are 6×4 and 6×6. - In international arms control, small arms include revolvers and pistols, rifles and carbines, assault rifles, submachine guns and light machine guns. Together with light weapons (heavy machine guns; hand-held grenade launchers; portable anti-aircraft and anti-tank guns; recoilless rifles; portable launchers of anti-aircraft and anti-tank missile systems; and mortars of calibres of less than 100 mm), they comprise the Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) protocol. - A half-track is a civilian or military vehicle with regular wheels at the front for steering and continuous tracks at the back to propel the vehicle and carry most of the load. The purpose of this combination is to produce a vehicle with the cross-country capabilities of a tank and the handling of a wheeled vehicle. - Self-propelled artillery (also called mobile artillery or locomotive artillery) is artillery equipped with its own propulsion system to move towards its target. Within the term are covered self-propelled guns (or howitzers) and rocket artillery. They are high mobility vehicles, usually based on continuous tracks carrying either a large howitzer, field gun, a mortar or some form of rocket or missile launcher. They are usually used for long-range indirect bombardment support on the battlefield. - A semi-trailer (British English) or semitrailer (American English) is a trailer without a front axle. In the US, the term is also used to refer to the combination of a truck and a semi-trailer, a tractor-trailer. - An artillery tractor , also referred to as a gun tractor , is a specialized heavy - duty form of tractor unit used to tow artillery pieces of varying weights and calibres . It may be wheeled , tracked , or half - tracked . - A siege engine is a device that is designed to break or circumvent city walls and other fortifications in siege warfare. Some have been operated close to the fortifications, while others have been used to attack from a distance. From antiquity, siege engines were constructed largely of wood and tended to use mechanical advantage to fling stones and similar missiles. With the development of gunpowder and improved metallurgical techniques, siege engines became artillery. Collectively, siege engines or artillery together with the necessary troops and transport vehicles to conduct a siege are referred to as a siege-train. What is the relationship between 'artillery tractor' and 'military vehicle'? Answer:","response":"An artillery tractor is a type of military vehicle specifically designed for towing artillery pieces of varying weights and calibers. Military vehicles are a broad category of vehicles employed for various purposes in the armed forces, including transportation, combat, and support roles. Artillery tractors fall under the support role, providing essential mobility to artillery units in field operations, enabling them to be deployed more efficiently and effectively in combat situations. Thus, the relationship between 'artillery tractor' and 'military vehicle' is that an artillery tractor is a specialized subtype of military vehicles, designed for the specific purpose of towing and maneuvering artillery assets in the field."},{"question":"Process: - A bird picks a spot high spot, often in a tree - The bird collects bits of sticks and grass - The sticks and grasses are placed between support branches - Leaves, mud and spider webs are added to the sticks - The mud, leaves and webs glue the sticks together - The solid nest supports the eggs - suppose the bird finds more leaves happens, how will it affect the nest will stay in place more.

El Greco was disdained by the immediate generations after his death because his work was opposed in many respects to the principles of the early baroque style which came to the fore near the beginning of the 17th century and soon supplanted the last surviving traits of the 16th-century Mannerism. El Greco was deemed incomprehensible and had no important followers. Only his son and a few unknown painters produced weak copies of his works. Late 17th- and early 18th-century Spanish commentators praised his skill but criticized his antinaturalistic style and his complex iconography. Some of these commentators, such as Antonio Palomino and Juan Agustín Ceán Bermúdez, described his mature work as \\"contemptible\\", \\"ridiculous\\" and \\"worthy of scorn\\". The views of Palomino and Bermúdez were frequently repeated in Spanish historiography, adorned with terms such as \\"strange\\", \\"queer\\", \\"original\\", \\"eccentric\\" and \\"odd\\". The phrase \\"sunk in eccentricity\\", often encountered in such texts, in time developed into \\"madness\\".With the arrival of Romantic sentiments in the late 18th century, El Greco's works were examined anew. To French writer Théophile Gautier, El Greco was the precursor of the European Romantic movement in all its craving for the strange and the extreme. Gautier regarded El Greco as the ideal romantic hero (the \\"gifted\\", the \\"misunderstood\\", the \\"mad\\"), and was the first who explicitly expressed his admiration for El Greco's later technique.

By the end of the 15th century the belief was widely professed and taught in many theological faculties, but such was the influence of the Dominicans, and the weight of the arguments of Thomas Aquinas (who had been canonised in 1323 and declared \\"Doctor Angelicus\\" of the Church in 1567) that the Council of Trent (1545–63)—which might have been expected to affirm the doctrine—instead declined to take a position.

Question: What happened because people adapted to new languages instead of standing their ground on the traditional languages on a region in the 500s? Context: The geographical regions in which Iranian languages were spoken were pushed back in several areas by newly neighbouring languages. Arabic spread into some parts of Western Iran (Khuzestan), and Turkic languages spread through much of Central Asia, displacing various Iranian languages such as Sogdian and Bactrian in parts of what is today Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. In Eastern Europe, mostly comprising the territory of modern-day Ukraine, southern European Russia, and parts of the Balkans, the core region of the native Scythians, Sarmatians, and Alans had been decisively been taken over as a result of absorption and assimilation (e.g. Slavicisation) by the various Proto-Slavic population of the region, by the 6th century AD. This resulted in the displacement and extinction of the once predominant Scythian languages of the region. Sogdian's close relative Yaghnobi barely survives in a small area of the Zarafshan valley east of Samarkand, and Saka as Ossetic in the Caucasus, which is the sole remnant of the once predominant Scythian languages in Eastern Europe proper and large parts of the North Caucasus.

Lukather won three of his five Grammy Awards for work with Toto, twice as an artist and once as a producer. David Paich led the band's songwriting efforts during the development of 1978's Toto—he penned all but two of the album's tracks, including all four of its singles. Lukather also credits Jeff Porcaro for his leadership within the band during that period. However, Lukather's role in Toto evolved over time owing to the changing needs of the band. In August 1992, Jeff Porcaro collapsed while doing yard work at home and subsequently died of heart failure. The death profoundly affected Toto and Lukather in particular, who felt that he needed to step up and make sure the band kept going. Thus, he began taking more of a leadership role. Toto went through several lead vocalists over the years, including Bobby Kimball, Fergie Frederiksen, and Joseph Williams. After the 1990 dismissal of their fourth vocalist, Jean-Michel Byron, Toto was without a lead singer until around 1997; Lukather assumed most of the vocal duties for the band during that time. He performed lead vocals for every track on 1992's Kingdom of Desire and 1995's Tambu except for two instrumental tracks. The Tambu single \\"I Will Remember\\", co-written by Lukather and Stan Lynch, reached number 64 on UK charts. Some Tambu reviewers contrasted Lukather's vocals with those of former singers Kimball and Williams (and indeed, heavily criticized the entire album), some concert reviewers noted that he struggled vocally on certain songs, and a number of backup singers and guest vocalists accompanied the band's live shows during that period. It was not until Toto brought back Williams and Kimball to collaborate on 1998's Toto XX that Lukather returned predominantly to the role of backup vocalist.Lukather's songwriting contributions grew from a smattering of tracks on early Toto albums to co-writing... contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the hit single by the man who was intimated by the talent of the band's chief songwriter?, what is it ?

For the most part, jogging can be a healthy way to stay fit. However, problems can also develop for those who jog in the heat. Excessive sweating can lead to electrolyte loss that could be life-threatening. Early symptoms of electrolyte deficiency can include nausea, fatugue, and dizziness. If not treated, individuals can experience muscle weakness and increased heart rate (which could lead to a heart attack). Many sports drinks can be consumed to restore electrolytes quickly in the body. Ted and Randy liked jogging.

Plot title: Superman Movie plot: Prologue[edit] The short's prologue sums up the origins of Superman, and are as follows: \\"In the endless reaches of the universe, there once existed a planet known as Krypton; a planet that burned like a green star in the distant heavens. There, civilization was far advanced, and it brought forth a race of supermen, whose mental and physical powers were developed to the absolute peak of human perfection. But there came a day when giant quakes threatened to destroy Krypton forever. One of the planet's leading scientists, sensing the approach of doom, placed his infant son in a small rocket ship and sent it hurtling in the direction of the Earth, just as Krypton exploded. The rocket sped through star-studded space, landing safely on Earth with its precious burden: Krypton's sole survivor. A passing motorist found the uninjured child and took it to an orphanage. As the years went by and the child grew to maturity, he found himself possessed of amazing physical powers. Faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive, able to leap tall buildings in a single bound, the infant of Krypton is now the Man of Steel: SUPERMAN! To best be in a position to use his amazing powers in a never-ending battle for truth and justice, Superman has assumed the disguise of Clark Kent, mild-mannered reporter for a great metropolitan newspaper.\\" Main story[edit] Play media The animated short. The story cuts to the Daily Planet building, where editor Perry White reveals to his two best field reporters, Clark Kent and Lois Lane, that an anonymous figure has mailed another threatening note to the Planet. White assigns Kent to help Lois follow up her lead, but Lois instead insists that she'd \\"like the chance to crack the story on [her] own.\\" Lois takes off in a private plane to an undisclosed location on the top of a mountain, where the villain's secluded lair/laboratory is located. He is preparing to fire his futuristic weapon (perhaps a particle beam or death ray), until his pet bird spots Lois' aircraft and alerts...

This increased activity and energy requirement would result in an increase in the wolves' pulse rate. This is because the body needs to pump more blood, and thus oxygen, to support the muscles being used during this strenuous activity. Therefore, it can be said that the pulse rate of wolves will indeed increase when they are catching fast prey."},{"question":"Article: Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Nick Bitel \\"We fully expect the London Marathon to go ahead.\\" Security for Sunday's London Marathon will be reviewed after two fatal explosions hit the Boston Marathon, but the event will go ahead, officials say. At least three people were killed and more than 100 injured by the blasts near the finish of Monday's US event. About 375 Britons were listed as taking part, but there has been no confirmation of any British casualties. Sports Minister Hugh Robertson said he was \\"absolutely confident\\" the London Marathon could be kept safe. London had \\"enormous experience\\" of delivering major events and the UK had some of the best security professionals in the world, he told the BBC, adding: \\"This is one of those instances where the best way to show solidarity with Boston is to continue.\\" Home Secretary Theresa May has been briefed on the bombings by Scotland Yard Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick and MI5 chief Sir Jonathan Evans. At this stage, there are no plans for a meeting of the government's emergency committee Cobra, but high-level discussions were already planned and will go ahead because of Baroness Thatcher's funeral on Wednesday. Analysis Organisers of the London Marathon moved quickly to announce a full review of security following the tragic events in Boston. But chief executive Nick Bitel insisted there was \\"absolutely no chance\\" that this year's marathon would be cancelled. While that comment may have felt a bit knee jerk, the defiant sentiment was right. A total of 36,000 runners, including the double Olympic champion Mo Farah are due to take part in the race from Greenwich Park to The Mall. But, as with so many big city marathons, London's is a joyous celebration of all talents, not just the elite. This is what makes it one of the highlights of the British sporting calendar. The peaceful triumph of last summer's Olympic Games in London had reduced security concerns around this year's event. But protecting a 26-mile course which is completely open to hundreds of thousands of spectators is always a major challenge for the Metropolitan Police and organisers. The dreadful and terrifying images emerging from America overnight have ensured that the question of terrorism will now hang heavy over Sunday's event. What happened in Boston provides another chilling reminder of how vulnerable sport can be. The Metropolitan Police said security for the funeral in central London would not be affected by the Boston explosions and that it was a very different event. London Marathon chief executive Nick Bitel said in a statement: \\"We are deeply saddened and shocked by the news from Boston.\\" He later told the BBC that he \\"fully expected\\" the London Marathon, which first took place in 1981 and was completed by more than 37,000 people last year, to go ahead. He said security plans \\"take account of many contingencies, including this type of threat and incident, but one can't be complacent and when it has happened, you need to then review those plans you have in place to see what else may be necessary.\\" St James's Palace said Prince Harry would still attend the marathon to make the presentations to the winners. The London Marathon route, which is lined by hundreds of thousands of spectators every year, starts in Blackheath and finishes near Buckingham Palace, passing some of the capital's most recognisable landmarks including Tower Bridge, Canary Wharf and Big Ben. Of the deadly Boston blasts, UK Prime Minister David Cameron said: \\"The scenes from Boston are shocking and horrific - my thoughts are with all those who have been affected.\\" London Mayor Boris Johnson described the bombings as \\"shocking, cowardly and horrific\\". He has spoken to Met Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe about the possibility of extra security for the London Marathon. \\"We do have robust security measures in place, but given events in Boston it's only prudent for the police and the organisers of Sunday's race to re-examine those security arrangements,\\" he said. 'Runners offered blood' According to the Boston Marathon website, 374 of the more than 25,000 registered entrants to one of the US's biggest sporting events were British. UK Athletics confirmed that none of its elite runners had taken part. Keith Luxom, part of a group of 24 British runners, had already finished when the bombs went off. He told BBC Breakfast the jubilant mood changed to one of \\"shock, horror and total disbelief that people would target this great institution\\". \\"Lots of runners went to the hospitals and offered blood,\\" he said. \\"People were sharing mobile phones so people without one could phone home.\\" Mr Luxom, from Essex, says he will be running the London Marathon this weekend and he will be wearing his Boston finishing shirt. Image caption The explosions happened at what is one of the biggest sporting events in the US Sports Tours International, which organised a trip for 51 people - 40 runners and 11 non-runners - said all were accounted for. David Mouncey, from Bristol, who finished the marathon 15 minutes before the explosions went off, told the BBC: \\"I hadn't planned to do Boston next year, but I would very much like to go back to support the Boston people and show that [I'm] not cowed by what's happened.\\" Another runner, Owain Griffiths, from Cyncoed in Cardiff, said \\"a day of enjoyment\\" had descended into \\"unthinkable horror\\". Marathon world record holder Paula Radcliffe posted on Twitter: \\"Situation looks awful, thoughts with everyone. There are some very sick people out there, who would do something like this?\\" Police say they have also launched a review of security for the Greater Manchester Marathon, due to take place on Sunday 28 April. ||||| Mario Tama/Getty Images Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) police officers keep watch during the morning commute in Grand Central Terminal on April 16, 2013 in New York City.

Worries also reverberated across the Atlantic, where an already robust security operation was being beefed up for Wednesday’s ceremonial funeral for Margaret Thatcher, the former prime minister. The event at St. Paul’s Cathedral, to be attended by Queen Elizabeth II and other dignitaries, calls for a procession through London’s streets, with Thatcher’s flag-draped coffin carried on a horse-drawn carriage. Continue reading below British police were also reviewing security for Sunday’s London Marathon — the next major international race — because of the bombs that killed at least three people and injured more than 130 in Boston. There is no known specific or credible threat against the British race at the moment, a security official said. The London Marathon is a hugely popular race. Last year, some 37,500 athletes competed, with many more watching the springtime event. Seven members of Parliament are scheduled to take part. The Boston explosions were front-page news in Britain and elsewhere around the world, with The Sun website blaring “Marathon Slaughter, Three Dead in Bomb Carnage” and The Evening Standard proclaiming “Blasts Horror at Boston Marathon.” The explosions in Boston sparked alarm in Britain, where a massive security operation was put in place last summer to protect the successful London Olympics. The UK used military units to police the games, including antiair missiles based on some apartment buildings. In the two weeks before the Olympics, police arrested 14 people in two counterterrorism probes as part of a 66-day operation to prevent a terrorist attack during the Olympics. Across the United States, security was tightened at landmarks, government buildings, transit hubs, and sporting events. Law enforcement agencies also urged the public via Twitter and Facebook to report suspicious activity to the police. In New York, authorities deployed so-called critical response teams — highly visible patrol units that move in packs with lights and sirens — along with more than 1,000 counterterrorism officers. Highly trafficked areas like the Empire State building, Rockefeller Center, St. Patrick’s Cathedral, the United Nations, and the World Trade Center site were especially monitored. At the White House, the Secret Service expanded its security perimeter after the attacks, shutting down Pennsylvania Avenue and cordoning off the area with yellow police tape. Several Secret Service patrol cars blocked off entry points, although the White House was not on lockdown and tourists were allowed in the park across the street. In California, emergency management officials activated their statewide threat assessment system, established after the Sept. 11 attacks. In New Jersey, authorities raised security statewide, calling in off-duty state police officers and deploying bomb units, aviation crews, tactical teams, and search and rescue assets as a precaution. Transit and port officials in New York and New Jersey were on heightened alert at bridges, tunnels, and on rail lines between the two states, as well as on New York City’s subway system and commuter rails. ||||| What is a summary?","response":"After two fatal explosions at the Boston Marathon, security for the upcoming London Marathon will be reviewed, but the event will still happen. This happened at the US event where at least three people were killed and more than 100 were injured.

It's like if your school's sports day still goes ahead even though it rained last year and everyone was worried about getting wet. Following the Boston attacks, police in New York city got ready to protect their city too. They sent out more police cars and asked everyone to help by being extra aware. This is like if after a naughty child in your class starts a food fight at lunch, the teachers keep an eye out and ask everyone to help by watching out for more food fights.

With such a rich history of prolific goal scoring between the two clubs, let's take a closer look at the five hat-tricks scored during this exciting fixture. 1. Robbie Fowler's Double Hat-Trick Phenomenon: The first and perhaps most impressive of the lot is Liverpool icon Robbie Fowler's record of scoring not one, but two hat-tricks against the Gunners. Known for his blistering pace and lethal left-foot, Fowler bagged his first hat-trick in 1994, followed by another three-goal haul just two years later in 1996. With six goals to his name in this particular fixture, Fowler has written his name in Premier League history, setting the bar high for others to challenge. 2. Thierry Henry's Magical Display: In 2004, Arsenal's legendary forward Thierry Henry dazzled the Anfield crowd with a hat-trick of his own. Henry was widely regarded as one of the most gifted players in Premier League history, and his elegant display against Liverpool showcased his unparalleled finesse and clinical finishing. Scoring three goals in sublime fashion, the Frenchman's hat-trick went down as one of the finest individual performances the competition has ever seen. 3. Peter Crouch's Towering Presence: It was in 2007 when English striker Peter Crouch rose above the Arsenal defense to score a hat-trick for Liverpool. Known for his height and aerial prowess, Crouch combined these attributes with perfect timing and positioning to put three past the Gunners that day. Crouch's hat-trick demonstrated the diverse range of talent in the Premier League and highlighted Liverpool's effective utilization of the Englishman's unique skillset. 4. Andrey Arshavin's Four-Goal Masterclass: In a thrilling 4-4 draw at Anfield in 2009, Russian forward Andrey Arshavin became an instant fan favorite with Arsenal supporters by scoring all four of their goals against Liverpool. Although not a traditional hat-trick, Arshavin's quadruple effort placed him among the greats in this historic fixture. It remains one of the most enthralling individual performances by a player, stunning not only Arsenal fans but also admirers of the beautiful game all over the world. Conclusion: As we approach this weekend's Liverpool vs Arsenal encounter, fans will be anticipating yet another electric display of attacking football. With the illustrious history of hat-tricks in this fixture, supporters will be hoping to see the likes of Mohamed Salah or Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang join the list of Liverpool-Arsenal hat-trick heroes. Regardless of the outcome, it's safe to say that this Premier League clash is one to watch."},{"question":"I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

Finding Joe an irresistable target for his sarcastic on-air wit, a Howard Stern-like deejay named Zander Kelly (Dennis Miller), puts Joe on the air to tell his story. For three days Zander and a growing legion of listeners are surprised to find themselves captivated, delighted, and occasionally repelled by Joe's incredible tale of his search to find the parents who referred to him as \\"Joe Dirt\\" (rather than by his real last name, which he can no longer remember) and left him sitting in a garbage can at the Grand Canyon when he was 8 years old. Thorughout the film, the story reverts for short periods back to the KXLA studio for dialogue between Joe and Zander.Pivotal to Joe's story is the past relationship he reveals between himself and Brandy (Brittany Daniel), a beautiful farm girl from his adopted hometown of Silvertown, Idaho.

What is the reason for this? Question 2: I am 20 years old. Some patches on my face have not got any facial hair. What should I do to overcome this? OPTIONS: [-] no [-] yes Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","response":"Both questions address different aspects of facial hair growth. The two questions have different underlying causes and potential solutions. Here is a detailed answer to each question: Question 1: The main reason for the asymmetrical growth of facial hair can be attributed to various factors, including genetics, hormones, and lifestyle habits. It is not uncommon for hair to grow unevenly on different parts of the body or face. Some possible reasons for this asymmetry are: 1. Genetics: Genetic predisposition may play a crucial role in determining the pattern and distribution of facial hair. Your genetic makeup might influence the development of hair follicles and hair growth on the right side of your face. 2. Hormonal imbalances: Hormones such as testosterone affect hair growth, and any hormonal imbalances could lead to asymmetrical facial hair growth. If you suspect that hormonal imbalances might be the cause, consulting a doctor might be beneficial. 3. Injuries and scars: If you've had any injury or scar on the side of your face with lesser hair growth, the hair follicles may have been damaged, leading to uneven growth. 4. Dominant side influence: People may apply more pressure when shaving if they are right or left-handed, causing more irritation to the follicles and potentially leading to asymmetrical growth. Question 2: Patches without facial hair, known as bald patches or alopecia areata, can be caused by several factors such as genetics, hormonal imbalances, and deficiency of certain nutrients. To potentially resolve this issue, you could try the following approaches: 1. Be patient: At the age of 20, your facial hair growth might not be fully developed. Many individuals experience changes and improvements in their facial hair as they age. Being patient might be essential at this stage. 2. Balanced diet: Maintaining a diet rich in essential nutrients such as vitamins, minerals, and protein could promote overall hair growth. Foods rich in vitamin E, biotin, and antioxidants like spinach, nuts, seeds, and lean meat could be beneficial. 3. Consult a dermatologist: If you're concerned about the hairless patches, obtaining professional advice from a dermatologist can help identify the underlying causes and recommend appropriate treatments. 4. Topical treatments: Some over-the-counter solutions, such as minoxidil, might help stimulate hair growth in patchy areas. It is essential to consult with a dermatologist or healthcare professional before using such products. To sum up, the answer to these two questions is not the same, as each question addresses different aspects of facial hair growth – one concerns asymmetrical growth, while the other focuses on patchy growth. Both situations have different potential causes and approaches to overcome the issue."},{"question":"Миллиган, Билли Translate to English","response":"Milligan, Billy Billy Milligan (born William Stanley Milligan in 1955) was an American man who was the subject of a highly publicized case dealing with dissociative identity disorder (also known as multiple personality disorder). He was the first person to be acquitted of a crime in the United States based on this disorder as a defense. Milligan committed several crimes, including robbery, kidnapping, and rape, which he claimed were committed by one of the 24 different personalities that he allegedly had. Milligan's life and condition were both the subject of the 1981 book \\"The Minds of Billy Milligan\\" by Daniel Keyes (which was later turned into a film), as well as numerous media articles and documentaries. This case inspired significant debate regarding the use of dissociative identity disorder as a legal defense and the extent of its influence on criminal behavior. Billy Milligan's complicated life began with an abusive childhood, which is believed to have contributed to the development of his multiple personalities.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose You get less good health care happens, how will it affect You develop more serious Polio. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","response":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of receiving less good healthcare can have a significant, indirect effect on the process of developing more serious Polio. Polio is a highly infectious disease caused by a virus that mainly affects children under 5 years of age. It invades the nervous system, and in serious cases, cause paralysis. If you have good healthcare, the disease can be diagnosed and treated early before it progresses to more severe stages. This could involve methods like acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance to identify potential Polio cases, necessary treatments, and maintaining a high level of sanitation and hygiene which can help prevent the spread of the Polio virus. Additionally, good healthcare would likely involve receiving the Polio vaccine, which is the most effective way to prevent the disease. On the other hand, if you receive poor healthcare, you may not receive a diagnosis in a timely manner, or might not receive the correct treatment. Not having access to the Polio vaccine especially, or not receiving it because of subpar healthcare, greatly increases the chance of developing the disease. Furthermore, less good healthcare could also mean that there is a lack of education and awareness about the disease, leading to poor sanitation and hygiene, factors which contribute to the spread of the Polio virus. This indirect effect won't alter the process of inhaling and exhaling that you described, but it does impact the overall health status of an individual and can affect the proper functioning of their respiratory process due to the paralysis caused by serious Polio. So, although the perturbation does not directly affect the biological process of breathing, it affects the development of a serious disease—Polio—which in turn indirectly affects the individual's ability to carry out the process of breathing effectively."},{"question":"Article:The proposals were approved by 38 of the 41 England and Wales Cricket Board members, with 15 first-class counties in support of the competition.

Question: suppose lung is cleaned for oxygen to pass to blood vessels happens, how will it affect \\"the lung cant absorb air\\". How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","response":"If the lung is cleaned for oxygen to pass to blood vessels, it suggests that there has been some intervention or treatment to remove obstructions or improve the lung's ability to absorb air. This can have a direct impact on the initial problem of the lung not being able to absorb air. The perturbation, in this case, can be considered a positive change as it aims to improve lung function by ensuring that oxygen can pass through the alveoli and into blood vessels more efficiently. This change can lead to an increase in the lung's capacity to absorb air. When the lung's ability to absorb air is improved, it can lead to a more effective exchange of gases - oxygen entering the bloodstream and carbon dioxide being removed from the blood and exhaled. This increased efficiency can have a multitude of positive effects on overall respiration, making it easier for the individual to breathe and improving the delivery of oxygen to the body's tissues and organs. In turn, this can result in better overall health and well-being for the individual. Therefore, the supposed perturbation can significantly influence the second effect mentioned, \\"the lung can't absorb air\\", by making it less of an issue. The intervention can lead to an increased ability to absorb air due to the improved passing of oxygen to blood vessels. In summary, the supposed perturbation has a positive effect in reducing the problem of the lung not being able to absorb air effectively."},{"question":"Electronica is an umbrella term that encompasses a broad group of electronic-based styles such as techno, house, ambient, drum and bass, jungle, and industrial dance, among others.

Portions of montane grasslands and shrublands ecoregions worldwide include alpine tundra. Large regions of alpine tundra occur in the North American Cordillera, the Alps and Pyrenees of Europe, the Himalaya and Karakoram of Asia, the Andes of South America, and the Eastern Rift mountains of Africa.Alpine tundra occupies high-mountain summits, slopes, and ridges above timberline. Aspect plays a role as well; the treeline often occurs at higher elevations on warmer equator-facing slopes. Because the alpine zone is present only on mountains, much of the landscape is rugged and broken, with rocky, snowcapped peaks, cliffs, and talus slopes, but also contains areas of gently rolling to almost flat topography.Averaging over many locations and local microclimates, the treeline rises 75 metres (245 ft) when moving 1 degree south from 70 to 50°N, and 130 metres (430 ft) per degree from 50 to 30°N. Between 30°N and 20°S, the treeline is roughly constant, between 3,500 and 4,000 metres (11,500 and 13,100 ft). and the situation: Pam and Alice studied Earth's climate and vegetation. Pam studied more about high latitudes (70 to 50°N), while Alice studied about lower latitudes (30°N to 20°S). Answer the following question: Which person studied more about portions of montane grasslands? The answer to this question is:","response":"Alice studied more about portions of montane grasslands. This is because alpine tundra, which is found at high altitudes and mainly studied by Pam, is characterized by a harsh, cold environment with relatively low biodiversity, occurring above the treeline on mountain summits, slopes, and ridges. In contrast, montane grasslands and shrublands can be found at lower elevations and a wider range of latitudes, providing a more diverse and suitable environment for a variety of plant and animal life. Alice's focus on the lower latitudes (30°N to 20°S) would have exposed her to a broader range of ecosystems, which are likely to include more montane grasslands and shrublands that exist in subtropical and tropical regions. In these areas, the treeline is relatively stable and lies between 3,500 and 4,000 meters (11,500 and 13,100 ft), within which montane grasslands and shrublands can be more prevalent. In comparison, Pam's focus on high latitudes (70 to 50°N) would have involved the study of alpine tundra ecosystems that dominate the higher elevations within those latitudes. As alpine tundra occurs above the treeline, which rises at around 75 meters (245 ft) per degree when moving south from 70 to 50°N, the alpine tundra areas studied by Pam would not include as many montane grasslands and shrublands as the lower latitude regions studied by Alice. In conclusion, Alice, whose research concentrated on lower latitudes (30°N to 20°S), would have studied more about portions of montane grasslands and shrublands compared to Pam, whose research focused on high latitudes and primarily involved the alpine tundra ecosystem."},{"question":"Information: - The 14 British Overseas Territories (BOT) are territories under the jurisdiction and sovereignty of the United Kingdom. They are those parts of the former British Empire that have not chosen independence or have voted to remain British territories. Most of the inhabited territories are internally self-governing, with the UK retaining responsibility for defence and foreign relations. The rest are either uninhabited or have a transitory population of military or scientific personnel. They share the British monarch (Elizabeth II) as head of state. - Acts of Parliament, also called primary legislation, are statutes passed by a parliament (legislature). Act of the Oireachtas is an equivalent term used in the Republic of Ireland where the legislature is commonly known by its Irish name, . It is also comparable to an Act of Congress in the United States. - In England and Wales, a magistrates' court is a lower court, where almost all criminal proceedings start. Some civil matters are also decided here, notably family proceedings. They have been streamlined to deliver justice swiftly. In 2015 there were roughly 330 magistrates' courts in England and Wales, though the Government was considering closing up to 57 of these. The jurisdiction of magistrates' courts and rules governing them are set out in the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980. - The Architects Act 1997 ( c. 22 ) is the consolidating Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for the keeping and publishing of the statutory Register of Architects by the Architects Registration Board . It has the long title : An Act to consolidate the enactments relating to architects . It consolidated two Acts of the 1930s as later amended both by primary legislation and by Orders in Council implementing the EC directive on architects providing for the recognition of architects qualified in other EC states , and the changes which had been made by Part III of the Housing Grants , Construction and Regeneration Act 1996 . - The Parliament of the United Kingdom, commonly known as the UK Parliament or British Parliament, is the supreme legislative body in the United Kingdom, British Crown dependencies and British overseas territories. It alone possesses legislative supremacy and thereby ultimate power over all other political bodies in the UK and its territories. Its head is the Sovereign of the United Kingdom (currently Queen Elizabeth II) and its seat is the Palace of Westminster in the City of Westminster, London. - The City of Westminster is an Inner London borough which also holds city status. It occupies much of the central area of Greater London including most of the West End. It is to the west of and adjoining the ancient City of London, directly to the east of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, and its southern boundary is the River Thames. It was created with the 1965 establishment of Greater London. Upon creation, Westminster was awarded city status, which had been previously held by the smaller Metropolitan Borough of Westminster. - Under an Act passed by the UK Parliament in 1931, there was established an Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom (ARCUK), referred to in the Act as \\"the Council\\". The constitution of the Council was prescribed by the First Schedule to the Act. The Act made the Council a body corporate by the name Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom. It was habitually referred to colloquially by the acronym ARCUK. - The Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996 is an Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom. Its long title shows that it is a piece of omnibus legislation: - The Architects Registration Board (ARB) is the statutory body for the registration of architects in the United Kingdom. It operates under the Architects Act 1997 as , a consolidating Act. It began under the Architects (Registration) Act, 1931 which gave it the name the Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom (ARCUK). It prescribes architectural qualifications, maintains the Register of Architects and for registered persons has certain responsibilities for standards of professional conduct and competence. Its main source of income is fees payable under Part II of the Act by persons on their becoming registered or for their retention on the Register. The Board is required to pay into the Consolidated Fund of the United Kingdom any sum paid under a penalty order which its Professional Conduct Committee has made under Part III of the Act (in conduct cases). Fines imposed by Magistrates' Court (England and Wales) (or similar in Scotland or Northern Ireland) under Part IV of the Act (in misuse of title cases) are not payable to the Board. - From 1932 there has been a statutory Register of Architects under legislation of the United Kingdom Parliament originally enacted in 1931. The originating Act contained ancillary provisions for entering an architects name in the register and removing a name from it which later legislation has amended. The 1931 Act gave it the name the Register of Registered Architects, but by an Act of 1938 the name was changed to the Register of Architects. - A consolidated fund or the consolidated revenue fund is a term used in many countries with political systems derived from the Westminster system to describe the main bank account of the government. - The Palace of Westminster is the meeting place of the House of Commons and the House of Lords, the two houses of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Commonly known as the Houses of Parliament after its occupants, it is also known as the 'heart of British politics'. The Palace lies on the north bank of the River Thames in the City of Westminster, in central London. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world.

This principle, which was formulated in 1927, tells us that there is a limit to how accurately we can know things like where something is (position) and how fast it's moving (momentum), or how much energy it has and when it has that energy. It's a bit like trying to measure a really wiggly line with a ruler - you can get an idea, but it's hard to be exactly perfect.

Here is a detailed guide on the best way to handle screws: 1. Choose the right screw for the job: This is the first and most important step. Understanding what type of screw you need affects the final result. There are different types of screws designed for specific purposes such as wood screws, machine screws, sheet metal screws, and self-tapping screws, among others. Knowing the application and material being fastened will help you choose the correct screw type. 2. Select the correct size: Screws come in different sizes, both in terms of length and diameter. The size of the screw should match the thickness of the material being fastened and the depth of the pre-drilled hole (if applicable). A good rule of thumb is to choose a screw that is about 2.5 times longer than the thickness of the material you are fastening. 3. Pre-drill the hole: In many cases, especially when working with hardwoods and some plastics, pre-drilling a hole for the screw is essential. This prevents the material from splitting, cracking, or getting damaged during screw insertion. Use a drill bit slightly smaller than the screw's diameter to create a pilot hole. 4. Select the right screwdriver or power tool: Use the appropriate screwdriver or power tool to match the screw head type, such as flathead, Phillips-head, or hex-head. Manual screwdrivers are suitable for smaller jobs, but for larger or repetitive tasks, using a power tool like an electric screwdriver or a drill with an appropriate bit will save you time and effort. 5. Prepare the materials and tools: Gather all the required materials, such as the screw, the screwdriver, drill, and drill bits, along with any necessary safety equipment like gloves, goggles, and ear protection. 6. Set screws in place: Align the screw with the pre-drilled hole or the desired location on the material. Make sure that both pieces of material being fastened together are aligned properly before starting. 7. Begin screwing: Place the screwdriver or power tool onto the screw head, making sure it sits firmly to avoid slipping or stripping the head of the screw. Apply downward pressure and start turning the screwdriver clockwise. If using a power tool, start slow and gradually increase the speed to avoid damaging the material or the screw. 8. Drive screw to the proper depth: Keep turning the screw until it has been driven to the desired depth, making sure it is flush with the material or just slightly below the surface. Be cautious not to over-tighten the screw, as this can cause the material to crack or strip the screw's threads. 9. Finishing touches: For a neat appearance, you can cover the screw heads with wooden or plastic plugs, putty, or paint, depending on the application. 10. Practice good maintenance: Keep your screws, screwdrivers, and drills in good condition by cleaning and storing them properly after use. Keeping your tools dry and free of dust will help ensure their longevity and optimal performance. In summary, the best way to use screws involves choosing the right type and size of screw, pre-drilling pilot holes, using the appropriate screwdriver or power tool, and following the proper technique of screwing and fastening materials together while maintaining your tools in good condition."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Generate a question that has the following answer: crystal for the following movie plot: Jesse Huston (Sharon Stone) hires Allan Quatermain to find her father, believed lost on an expedition to find the fabled King Solomon's Mines.

Rio de Janeiro, in a dramatic victory over much-wealthier cities, won the right to host the 2016 Olympics, bringing the Games to South America for the first time and crystallizing Brazil's rise as an economic and political power. Chicago was knocked out in the first round of voting by the International Olympic Committee on Friday, despite a personal appeal by President Barack Obama, in a setback for the local organizers, the U.S. Olympic Committee and the president himself. Tokyo was also eliminated in the second round, leaving only Madrid to go toe-to-toe with Rio at the end. Brazil's strategy tapped into a strong current of resentment among delegates outside Europe and North America whose countries had also never hosted the Games. Brazil had lobbied these voters behind the scenes in a bid to win over a contingent they thought would be sympathetic to their cause. President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva pleaded with IOC voters to send a \\"powerful message...that the Olympic Games belong to all people, all continents, and to all humanity.\\" The vote for Rio rebuffed a Chicago bid that appeared flat and uninspired against Mr. da Silva's populist approach. The rebuff was an embarrassment to the president: Mr. Obama flew to Copenhagen overnight to deliver a seven-minute speech to the IOC Friday morning. First lady Michelle Obama spent much of this week in Copenhagen lobbying IOC members. Chicago television personality Oprah Winfrey also joined the campaign. The Journal's Matthew Futterman is covering the 2016 presentations from Copenhagen, in our new Dispatch blog. Here is more on each city's presentation. Heading into the vote, the conventional wisdom among Olympics watchers, bookmakers, and IOC members was that this was a two-city race between Rio and Chicago. But other than the speeches from the Obamas, Chicago's presentation left the delegates largely silent and unemotional. Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley and Pat Ryan, the leader of Chicago2016, the organization that led the city's bid for the Games, spoke about new sports programs the Olympics would help start and nearby universities that wanted to help in the effort. The pitch contrasted the one given by representatives of Rio, who spoke of an entire continent yearning for acceptance. Madrid's presentation also may have cooled Chicago's chances. In it, former IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch from Spain -- a man who still carries much influence in IOC corridors -- put forth a bittersweet request to his former colleagues. \\"I am very near the end of my time,\\" said Mr. Samaranch, 89 years old. \\"I ask you to consider granting my country the honor and the duty of hosting the Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2016.\\" The plea likely helped draw votes to Madrid in the first round of voting, when Chicago was knocked out, that might have otherwise helped Chicago survive to the second round. Yet the votes were little more than a gesture since holding the Games in Madrid in 2016 would have given Europe three consecutive Games after London in 2012 and Sochi, Russia, in 2014. After Chicago was eliminated, IOC members said Chicago's bid suffered from a lack of natural geographical support. Madrid had strong European backing, while Tokyo had Asian supporters and Rio was popular with much of the developing world. USOC chairman Larry Probst and President Stephanie Streeter, both of whom could shoulder the blame for Chicago's loss, rushed from the Bella Center in Copenhagen after the vote. Both declined to comment. This summer the USOC announced plans to start its own cable network, a move that angered prominent IOC members, who had not officially signed off on the plan. Weeks later, the USOC shelved the plan, partly to ease tension between the USOC and the IOC leading up to the vote. Chicago also was the only candidate lacking full government financial support of the Games. People celebrated at Rio de Janeiro's Copacabana beach after the announcement Friday. Mr. Obama's appearance before the IOC in the run-up to Friday's vote was the first time a sitting president had personally lobbied the IOC in the final stage. Losing the bid won't likely hurt the U.S. in a direct way, but the symbolic damage to its prestige, and that of the White House, might be lasting. The sniping has already started, with Republicans in Congress using the setback to argue that Mr. Obama should better choose his priorities. \\"This throws a little cold water on the Obama dream that simply having a fresh face and open-minded rhetoric will change the way the world views America,\\" said presidential historian David Greenberg. IOC member Guy Drot of France said there was little that Chicago and Mr. Obama could have done to resist the voters' desire to bring the Games to South America. \\"It should be another beginning for us after\\" Beijing in 2008, said Mr. Drot. \\"Then maybe some day we can go to Africa,\\" which hasn't hosted an Olympics. In the wake of Chicago's defeat, the USOC said it would take a pass on making a bid for the 2018 Winter Games. USOC spokeswoman Lindsey Hogan said the organization doesn't have time to put forth a competitive bid, saying, \\"Our focus has been with Chicago.\\" The win for Brazil set off a raucous celebration on Rio's Copacabana beach, where a Carnavalesque atmosphere had reigned since Friday morning. Some 30,000 people gathered to await the naming of the winner. Sergio Soares, who sells coconut water at a beachside stand, said he hoped the victory for Rio will help fix the city's crime problem. \\"I think this will lead to more money being invested and more police,\\" he said. At a time when Brazil has become an economic force with newly discovered oil reserves and growing clout in international trade talks, many locals said hosting the Olympics is the icing on the cake. Mr. da Silva, a former union leader who came up from poverty, has surprised many during his two terms in office by governing as a business-friendly centrist. Under his leadership, Brazil has won regard for its fiscal responsibility and garnered investment-grade status from Wall Street ratings agencies. Winning the Games could mark a kind of watershed. \\"I think the Olympics is going to present a new portrait of Brazil to the world as a serious, modern country,\\" said Vitoria Saddi, an economist at the Institute of Education and Research, a top business school in São Paulo. After the announcement of the final vote, Mr. da Silva said, \\"Brazil has moved from being on the level of a second-class country to a first-class country.\\" Rio overcame concerns about rampant drug-related crime by promising a government-backed budget of 14 billion to prepare for the Olympics, citing its successful hosting of the 2007 Pan Am Games. Olympic organizers were impressed with the public support (85% of residents want the Games), as well as its allure as a lush and beautiful oceanside city. Chicago was eliminated after the first round of voting when it garnered just 18 of 94 votes, compared with 22 for Tokyo, 26 for Rio and 28 for Madrid. On the second ballot, Rio pulled into the lead with 46 votes, while Madrid received 29 and Tokyo 20. Chicago's loss was also a blow to Mayor Daley, who had been criticized over the city's pledge to guarantee losses the Games might incur. \\"I was shocked. I was disappointed. I couldn't believe it,\\" Mr. Daley told the Associated Press. A huge gasp rose from several thousand people watching the voting on three enormous TV screens at Daley Plaza in downtown Chicago as the IOC announced their city had been eliminated. \\"All the air just went out of the city,\\" said longtime Chicagoan Nancy Newman, 43. \\"This would have put us on the map.

Proof that you a can start anywhere. The guy playing Sebastian sucks, too. He doesn't even look much like Ryan Phillipe. More like Joshua Jackson. The two other girls are terrible, as well. Then the dialogue is also crap. Sebastian (About to have threesome): If you cant beat them... Virgin Girl: Who says you can't beat 'em? Lame. The ending contradicts the entire plot of the original. In the first film, it is clearly stated that Kathryn and Sebastian never had sex. One of the reasons Sebastian wanted Kathryn so bad, aside from the fact that she's played by Sarah Michelle Gellar, was that she was \\"the only girl he couldn't have and it killed him\\". She was a tease who liked playing with him. The fact that she never gave it to him increased his wanting. Then in this P.O.S., it implies that he CAN have her, along with a girl on the side. What? And we don't even see the sex, either. It's implied, making it not only stupid, pointless, and contradictory, but worthless too. And in the first one, Kathryn rejects Sebastian because he fell in love, making him a loser. Even though he won the bet, that crumbled his chances. Then in this excrement, he looses AND falls in love. So she doesn't screw \\"losers\\", only complete losers? Another thing: it's stated that Sebastian has never been in love, so what do you call the thing with Virgin Girl? Then at the end, virgin girl is all of sudden revealed to be Kathryn's evil lesbian lover (dun dun dun) and, like I said, they go into a lame offscreen threesome. Stupid. There's several other plot contradictions. Did the writer even see the first film? A 5 year old can point his stuff out. After the threesome, Sebastian has sex with the blonde virgin, corrupting her innocent mind in the back of a limo while Kathryn and Virgin Girl Turned Evil Lesbian In Lame Sudden Plot Twist sit in the front, listen, and smile evilly into the camera. The end... Seeing Sebastian become the ass hole he was in the first one could have made an interesting film. I guess all it took to make little Sebastian bad was a threesome with two hot girls. Interesting. Would you say this review is positive or negative?","response":"I would say this review is negative.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Time is in the Chicago Park District, in the Washington Park community area on Chicago's South Side, near the Midway Plaisance. This location, adjoining the University of Chicago campus directly to the East, makes the sculpture a contributing structure to the Washington Park federal Registered Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Time is considered to be the most important piece of monumental art in the Park District, which hosts over 100 art works. Its importance stems from its sculptor, its message, the era in which it was created, and the design of its reflecting pool by Howard Van Doren Shaw. Robert Jones, director of design and construction for the Art Institute of Chicago at the time, stated in 1999 that Time was the first finished art piece to be made of any type of concrete.The sculpture is located a few blocks from Taft's studio, the Lorado Taft Midway Studios, now a Chicago Landmark and National Historic Landmark, located at 60th Street and Ingleside Avenue. Other notable sculptures nearby include Henry Moore's National Historic Landmark Nuclear Energy, which is on the site of the first self-sustaining nuclear reaction at the University of Chicago.

Options: - Sentence A: \\"Jane applied llamas on her luscious lips.\\" - Sentence B: \\"Jane applied lipstick on her luscious lips.\\" Let's solve this gradually.","response":"To determine which of the two sentences does not make sense, let's break them down and analyze the meaning and structure of each sentence. Sentence A: \\"Jane applied llamas on her luscious lips.\\" - Subject: Jane - Verb: applied - Object: llamas - Location: on her luscious lips. Sentence B: \\"Jane applied lipstick on her luscious lips.\\" - Subject: Jane - Verb: applied - Object: lipstick - Location: on her luscious lips. Comparing the two sentences, the main difference lies in the object being applied onto Jane's lips. In sentence A, the object is \\"llamas,\\" which are large domesticated mammals native to South America. Llamas are animals and cannot be applied to someone's lips. In contrast, the object in sentence B is \\"lipstick,\\" which is a cosmetic product made for use on lips. It is highly common and reasonable for one to apply lipstick to their lips. Therefore, we can deduce that Sentence A (\\"Jane applied llamas on her luscious lips.\\") does not make sense, as it involves applying an animal to one's lips, which is not a logical or feasible action. On the other hand, Sentence B (\\"Jane applied lipstick on her luscious lips.\\") makes complete sense, as applying lipstick to lips is a normal and coherent action."},{"question":"Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: When I was in primary school, sometimes I would meet a girl of the same age as me. Lisa was never active, but she was always very sweet and nice. In the 5th grade she came to my class. She was absent a lot , and one day I had the courage to ask why. She told me she was sick, and she explained she wore a wig because her medicine made her lose her hair. We left it at that. Anytime Lisa came to class--seldom--I would hang around with her on the playground. I received much ridicule from my friends for this because they thought I was ignoring them for Lisa. My family education taught me to be nice, and I felt Lisa's needs were much more important than others I knew. It had been months since Lisa was in our class, and one day our teacher was crying. She explained Lisa died the day before and would no longer be our classmate. She told us Lisa had fought a battle with cancer for years. I was shocked. Lisa never spoke of her illness as if it could kill her. Well, all these years I have kept Lisa in my mind and heart. When I go through the important events in my life, I think of Lisa. I've had a strong wish recently to find her mother and father. I'd like to tell them that though they never met me, their daughter had a sweet effect on my life. I have no idea what her parents' first names are. I write to your column and hope you can point me in the right direction. Lisa was such a lovely girl. Maybe her parents would be comforted by the fact that after all these years they are not the only ones who remember her.

They sometimes hung out together on the playground when Lisa attended school. C. The author was Lisa's caregiver during her illness. D. The author and Lisa were distant acquaintances. Answer: B. They sometimes hung out together on the playground when Lisa attended school. Explanation of the answer: The article mentions that the author would hang out with Lisa on the playground when she attended class, showing that they had some interaction and connection during their time in primary school, but does not suggest that they were close friends since kindergarten or had any caregiving role in Lisa's life. The fact that they had some interaction indicates that they were not distant acquaintances either."},{"question":"Sentence from a movie review: but toback 's deranged immediacy makes it seem fresh again .

The equation becomes: 108 = -18*c Now, in order to find the value of c, we should isolate c on one side of the equation. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by -18. c = 108 / -18 By performing the division, we get: c = -6 So, the solution to the equation 108 = -18*c - 0*c is c = -6."},{"question":"What is the solution to this math problem?

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","response":"Yes, the supposed perturbation does have an indirect effect on the process of sedimentary rock formation. Step-by-step justification: 1. When climate causes less wind and water, the rate of erosion may decrease. Since wind and water are the primary agents of erosion, a reduction in their intensity will likely result in rocks eroding at a slower pace. 2. With less erosion, there would be less sediment being picked up by the wind and water. This could result in lower sediment availability for transport to depositional areas. 3. Since there is less sediment being carried by wind, water, air, or ice, it may take longer for sediment to accumulate in deposition areas, which could delay the sediment piling process. 4. If sediment takes longer to accumulate, it may also take longer for the layers of sediment to build up and for the bottom layers to become compressed by the weight of newer sediment. 5. The slower buildup and compression of sediments could eventually result in less sedimentary rock being formed over time. In conclusion, the proposed perturbation of climate causing less wind and water indirectly affects sedimentary rock formation by slowing down the process of erosion, sediment transportation, deposition, and compression. This could potentially lead to a decrease in the overall amount of sedimentary rock being formed."},{"question":"How is \\"On the contrary, universities, as places of higher education and training, must also enable learners to become critical, analytical thinkers, because this will enable them to understand the world in which we live and to use their professional skills wisely.\\" said in Finnish?","response":"To translate the given sentence into Finnish, I will break it down into smaller parts and find appropriate words and phrases in Finnish.

Because that is a deep down desire of the majority, many people are always on a quest to slow down the aging process. So, our question for today is: What are the Anti-Aging Benefits of the Mediterranean Diet? First, we must acknowledge that no diet in the world can halt or slow the aging process. Aging is inevitable and food is not the elixir of life – although the type of food you choose can lengthen or shorten your life. What has been proven by numerous studies is that the Mediterranean diet lessens your risks of getting certain diseases. It also offers a range of health benefits that will allow you to age in a healthy way. When you whole-heartedly adopt the Mediterranean way of eating, you will reduce your risk of health problems such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, stroke, heart diseases, etc. That alone can be classified as anti-aging. Old age is often associated with health problems. If you can grow old and maintain your health, that would be a fine way to live. The Mediterranean diet can help you do that. Unfortunately, the standard diet for most Americans is filled with junk food, sugary sodas, fast foods and processed, additive-filled food, etc. – basically empty calories. Obesity is an epidemic. People eat whatever is the most convenient with little regard for their health. This is very upsetting and dangerous for the population as a whole. There is a wide assumption that healthy food is not delicious. People believe that to eat healthy they must live on a steady diet of raw carrots and steamed chicken breasts. As a result, they choose not to do so. They would much rather have a fast-food burger and cheese fries – it’s easier and tastier. What will likely happen to those who continue to eat burgers and cheese fries? Pick the correct answer from the following options: - not enough information - they will have an increased risk of disease - they will enjoy their food more - they will be healthier than those who don't The answer is:","response":"they will have an increased risk of disease"},{"question":"Q: Which waves have the longest wavelengths but the least energy in the atmosphere?

Both sentences convey the same information, namely that Cheadle Heath railway station was operational between 1901 and 1968 and served the village of Cheadle in Cheshire as well as the Stockport suburb of Cheadle Hulme. The structure and wording in each sentence are slightly different, but the core message remains the same in both. In Sentence 1, the information is presented in the following order: name of the railway station, years of operation, served locations, and an emphasis on Cheadle Hulme as a Stockport suburb. The sentence construction is mainly descriptive and informative. Sentence 2, on the other hand, uses a different structure in which the name of the railway station is first combined with its function, followed by a temporal reference to the years of operation and a list of the served locations. This sentence also emphasizes the relationship between Stockport and Cheadle Hulme as a suburb, but the overall message is the same as that conveyed in Sentence 1. In conclusion, these two sentences can be considered paraphrases of one another. They both effectively communicate that Cheadle Heath railway station was in service from 1901 to 1968 and served Cheadle village in Cheshire while also serving the Stockport suburb of Cheadle Hulme. Although the sentence structures and some wording choices differ, the meaning and main points remain consistent between the two sentences."},{"question":"Given the following question, let's solve step-by-step.

For the past four years, he has been trying to assemble the skeleton of a Brontosaurus but is missing one bone: the \\"intercostal clavicle\\". Adding to his stress is his impending marriage to the dour Alice Swallow and the need to impress Elizabeth Random, who is considering a million-dollar donation to his museum. The day before his wedding, David meets Susan Vance by chance on a golf course when she plays his ball. She is a free-spirited, somewhat scatterbrained young lady unfettered by logic. These qualities soon embroil David in several frustrating incidents. Susan's brother Mark has sent her a tame leopard named Baby from Brazil. Its tameness is helped by hearing \\"I Can't Give You Anything But Love\\". Susan thinks David is a zoologist, and manipulates him into accompanying her in taking Baby to her farm in Connecticut. Complications arise when Susan falls in love with him and tries to keep him at her house as long as possible, even hiding his clothes, to prevent his imminent marriage. David's prized intercostal clavicle is delivered, but Susan's aunt's dog George takes it and buries it somewhere. When Susan's aunt arrives, she discovers David in a negligee. To David's dismay, she turns out to be potential donor Elizabeth Random. A second message from Mark makes clear the leopard is for Elizabeth, as she always wanted one. Baby and George run off. The zoo is called to help capture Baby. Susan and David race to find Baby before the zoo and, mistaking a dangerous leopard (also portrayed by Nissa) from a nearby circus for Baby, let it out of its cage. contains an answer for the question: Who buried the intercostal clavicle?, what is it ?

A person is standing on stilts. They walk back and forth on a dirt trail. they","response":"carefully maintain their balance as they confidently stride across the uneven terrain, acutely aware of the rhythm of their steps. The sky overhead is a stunning blend of orange and purple hues as the sun lazily makes its descent towards the horizon. Each footfall raises a small puff of dust, leaving an intriguing trail of marks in the once undisturbed earth. People from the nearby village who've gathered along the sides of the trail, just slightly off the beaten path, are watching in awe and fascination as the stilt walker moves gracefully between them. Entranced by the daring display, young children point and gasp with delight while their parents look on with a mix of concern and admiration. There's a palpable energy in the air—an infectious blend of excitement and anxiety, as the villagers question their eyes. As the stilt walker progresses, they do not hesitate to indulge in flourishes and tricks, occasionally lifting one foot high to make a dramatic half-turn, or doing a quick succession of short, rapid steps to keep the onlookers on the edge of their seats. Despite the inherent risk in each of these moves, the person remains firmly grounded on their feet—their movements almost resembling a dance. To the casual passerby, the sight of the stilt walker navigating the dirt trail with deceptive ease might seem like a daring and random feat. However, there is more to this scene than meets the eye: the stilt walker is participating in an age-old village tradition that tests the skill, agility, and courage of its participants, while also providing a moment of unity and joy for the entire community. The last streaks of sunlight have vanished beneath the horizon, leaving only the soft, starry glow of twilight to illuminate the scene. Undeterred by the waning light, the stilt walker continues their journey, their eyes glinting with fierce determination. A sharpened, primal instinct to push beyond limits serves as their compass, leading the stilt walker inextricably forward toward their final destination—a near-mythic bonfire roaring with life and spirit at the far end of the trail, where the village awaits with bated breath. As the stilt walker approaches the bonfire, the crackling of the flames and the soft whispers of onlookers soon give way to a crescendo of thunderous applause from the villagers, their faces beaming with pride and joy. The walker completes a triumphant bow, their silhouette framed against the mesmerizing backdrop of the fire, and then descends from the stilts to join in the heartfelt laughter and camaraderie that surrounds them. For the village, this thrilling display of balance and artistry not only marks the conclusion of another successful tradition, but also serves as a reminder of the power and unyielding resilience inherent in the human spirit—where even in the face of adversity and seemingly insurmountable odds, individuals can, quite literally, rise above it all, with their head held high, their feet steady, and their heart full of courage and hope."},{"question":"Review: if the title is a jeopardy question , then the answer might be \`\` how does steven seagal come across these days ?

Investors are keenly waiting for any clues regarding the overall economic strength and the potential trajectory of interest rate hikes from the US central bank. In the global financial markets, actions taken by central banks, such as the US Federal Reserve, have significant consequences on various aspects of the economy, including inflation, growth, and exchange rates. As a result, investors and market participants keep a close eye on any news, updates, or indications from central bank authorities that could potentially influence their decision-making and investment strategies. In this case, the US Federal Reserve meeting is the focal point for investors who desperately seek information that might give them an edge in the market.

There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody). - South Dakota is a state located in the Midwestern region of the United States. It is named after the Lakota and Dakota Sioux Native American tribes, who compose a significant portion of the population and historically dominated the entire territory. South Dakota is the 17th most expansive, but the 5th least populous and the 5th least densely populated of the 50 United States. Once the southern portion of the Dakota Territory, South Dakota became a state on November 2, 1889, simultaneously with North Dakota. Pierre is the state capital and Sioux Falls, with a population of about 171,000, is South Dakota's largest city. - Americans are citizens of the United States of America. The country is home to people of many different national origins. As a result, Americans do not equate their nationality with ethnicity, but with citizenship and allegiance. Although citizens make up the majority of Americans, non-citizen residents, dual citizens, and expatriates may also claim an American identity. - The Sioux are groups of Native American tribes and First Nations peoples in North America. The term can refer to any ethnic group within the Great Sioux Nation or to any of the nation's many language dialects. The Sioux comprise three major divisions based on language divisions: the Dakota, Lakota, and Nakota. - The Territory of Dakota was an organized incorporated territory of the United States that existed from March 2, 1861, until November 2, 1889, when the final extent of the reduced territory was split and admitted to the Union as the states of North and South Dakota. - The South Dakota Department of Transportation is a state government organization in charge of maintaining public roadways of the U.S. state of South Dakota .

That less-than forehead-smacking insight is what makes a new study in the business journal Applied Economics something shy of breaking news. According to the authors—economists from Nottingham University Business School and the University of Sheffield in Britain—the same rule holds for international cricket matches. And the headline of the press release announcing the study made no effort to conceal its sublimely obvious conclusion: “Strong teams attract crowds for international cricket,” it read. But science is often a far more nuanced thing than it seems—provided it’s properly explained. There is a rich and regrettable tradition among journals to promote studies that fall into the category science journalists alternately refer to as “blinding flashes of the obvious” or “The Annals of Duh.” Take “Causes of Death in Very Old People,” for instance. Um…I’m going to guess old age. Then there is this: “Blood Pressure Drugs Don’t Protect Against Colorectal Cancer”—though they may protect against, you know, high blood pressure. Or these: “Moderate Doses of Alcohol Increase Social Bonding in Groups” and “Dogs Learn to Associate Words With Objects Differently Than Humans Do.” If you already kind of guessed that people loosen up and feel friendlier when they’ve downed a shot or two, or that your dog can’t talk, you’d have been forgiven for giving these studies a pass. But under the no-news veneer of all of the studies, there was true news to be found. Blood pressure drugs reduce the output of norepinephrine and some animal studies have shown that that neurotransmitter encourages the growth of colorectal cancer cells, but that finding wasn’t holding up in people. While human babies tend to group objects by shape—so once they know a ball is round they will assume all round things are balls until they have reason to believe otherwise—dogs seem to use texture or size as their way of defining categories. Being dogs, they may never move beyond that point. And as for the cricket findings: previous economic studies had always concluded that it was the closeness of the contest—in which two evenly matched though not necessarily terrific teams were playing—rather than the excellence of the home team that determined crowd size. Nifty findings all—and none of which you’d know anything about if you didn’t read past the headline of the study. In a counterfactual age in which science is too often denied or ignored or carelessly shrugged off, it pays for the scientists themselves to consider all this. They no longer have the luxury of simply writing for other scientists—assuming, generally rightly, that that audience is sensitive to the nuance. They must, instead, write for all of us—the people who can best benefit from the science, if only we can understand it.

Possible answers: going to enjoy new food, glad he tried pork, angry at himself Answer:","response":"It's not possible to definitively determine how Kendall would feel after eating pork for the first time after giving up the Jewish faith, as individual reactions can vary greatly. However, based on the given context, we can suggest a few possibilities: 1. Going to enjoy new food: Kendall might feel excited to try new kinds of food after leaving the strict dietary restrictions that the Jewish faith often imposes. Pork could be one of many foods he is eager to experience, and he might enjoy discovering new flavors and dishes. 2. Glad he tried pork: After eating pork, Kendall might feel a sense of satisfaction or relief for having taken this step. Trying pork could be seen as a symbolic way of confirming his decision to leave the Jewish faith, and actually enjoying the taste may reinforce that decision in his mind. 3. Angry at himself: On the other hand, Kendall might feel guilt, regret, or anger after eating pork. This could stem from an internal struggle surrounding his decision to leave the Jewish faith or lingering feelings of attachment to its customs. In this case, eating pork might serve as a reminder of what he has given up and cause him emotional distress. Again, it's essential to stress that individuals can respond differently, and the particular emotional reaction Kendall experiences might not be accurately represented by any of these possibilities."},{"question":"What is the solution to this math problem? Solve 32 = -8*b + 48 for b.","response":"Alright, let's solve the math problem step by step like we're playing with blocks.

To do that, we will divide both sides of the equation by -8: -16 / -8 = -8 * b / -8 Oh, look! The -8 on the right side cancels out: 2 = b So our adorable little friend 'b' has the value of 2!

The premise states that there is one female wearing a blue sweatshirt and ski cap. - The hypothesis, however, describes a female wearing a red shirt, which contradicts the information about the blue sweatshirt in the premise. 2. The premise mentions the female is holding a camera and jumping. - In the hypothesis, it states that the female is holding a fish. This does not match the details provided in the premise about holding a camera. 3. The hypothesis also describes the female wearing a basketball cap. - This detail contradicts the information in the premise, which states that the female is wearing a ski cap. Based on these contradictions between the premise and the hypothesis, we can conclude that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. The premise specifically talks about a female wearing a blue sweatshirt and ski cap while holding a camera and jumping. In contrast, the hypothesis describes a female with different clothing, holding a completely different object; hence, these two descriptions do not support or entail each other."},{"question":"i think that my most important message is, we are all born under the same stars, and there is room for us all in the universe.

A goblin A:","response":"Title: Blix's Redemption Genre: Fantasy/Adventure Plot: In the mystical land of Eldareth, the human kingdom of Aloreya has been at peace with its magical neighbors for centuries. However, a dark presence looms over this once-sacred utopia. Blix, a mischievous yet seemingly insignificant goblin, finds himself inadvertently caught in the vortex of an ancient prophecy that is bringing darkness and chaos to the land. Blix, often seen as an outsider among the goblin community due to his unusual intelligence and gentle nature, leads a group of conniving goblins known as the \\"Shadow Bandits.\\" The group, dissatisfied with their reputation as the lowest rung of mythical creatures, seeks to establish their value within the magical realm. To do this, they embark on a quest to steal the amulet of Relmor, a powerful relic believed to grant its possessor control over all mythical creatures. The opening act begins in the goblin-concealed underground city of Gnarlden, where Blix presents his ambitious plan to his fellow Shadow Bandits – including the sly and quick-footed Soren, the feisty and fearless Yara, and the aged, wise, yet comically bumbling Bralnor. The group sets forth into the perilous Eldareth, encountering numerous challenges including treacherous terrain, hostile magical beings, and the ancient traps guarding the amulet. As the story unfolds, a parallel plot line develops within the human kingdom of Aloreya, where King Harridan, a once-peaceful ruler, becomes increasingly tyrannical, driven by a mysterious advisor who keeps his face hidden beneath a hood. Though King Harridan's actions are meant to protect his people from the unrest in Eldareth, they are causing further unrest among his subjects. Unbeknownst to Blix, his quest to secure the amulet activates a dormant chain of events that resurrects an ancient and evil being, Azgorath. The prophecy reveals that a goblin will be responsible for the return of darkness, and so, Azgorath mistakenly targets Blix as the goblin to join him in his quest for power and domination over Eldareth. As Blix and the Shadow Bandits overcome their differences, confront their insecurities, and learn the value of unity, they discover the real intention behind their quest and the prophecy's true implications. Realizing that neither power nor control could bring happiness or satisfaction, Blix and his companions decide to change their course. The climax of the story takes place as Blix and the Shadow Bandits confront both Azgorath and the hooded-figure controlling King Harridan. In an epic battle, the bandits' courage and selflessness exceed everyone's expectations, as they defend both humans and magical creatures alike, ultimately defeating Azgorath and exposing the hooded-figure – who is revealed as a shape-shifting sorcerer serving Azgorath's will. The film concludes with a celebration in Aloreya, where humans and magical creatures rejoice in their newly-forged unity. The goblins' bravery and valor earn them a newfound respect in the magical realm, and Blix's heroism is recognized as a sign of hope and redemption for all."},{"question":"Q:Background: Tropical forests (rainforests) receive more insolation and rainfall over longer growing seasons than any other environment on earth. With these elevated temperatures, insolation and rainfall, biomass is extremely productive leading to the production of as much as 800 grams of carbon per square meter per year. Higher temperatures and larger amounts of water contribute to higher rates of chemical weathering. Increased rates of decomposition cause smaller amounts of fulvic acid to percolate and leach metals from the zone of active weathering. Thus, in stark contrast to soil in forests, tropical forests have little to no podzolization and therefore do not have marked visual and chemical contrasts with the soil layers. Instead, the mobile metals Mg, Fe and Al are precipitated as oxide minerals giving the soil a rusty red color. Paragraph: Burma had many tropical forests, while a sister country from a temperate climate, Belarus, had beautiful ancient temperate forests. Both countries were significant lumber exporters. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which country had a longer growing season?

Both belonging to the family Paridae, the classification of this bird has been updated over time using advances in genetic research. Eurasian blue tits are small, attractive, and acrobatic birds that are widely distributed across the United Kingdom, Europe, Western Asia, and North Africa. They are easily recognized by their bright blue and yellow plumage combined with subtle white and green hues. These charming birds have a blue cap and wings, white cheeks, a soft green back, and bright yellow undersides that are longitudinally divided by a dark line down the center. Males and females have similar appearances, with males having a slightly brighter blue coloration. Blue tits are primarily insectivores, feeding on a variety of insects, caterpillars, and spiders. However, during the winter months, their diet becomes more flexible to include seeds, fruits, and other plant-based food sources. In addition, these birds are known for visiting gardens, feeding on peanuts or suet provided in bird feeders. Eurasian blue tits are cavity nesters, often using tree holes, nest boxes, or even pipes and crevices in buildings to lay their eggs. Breeding season typically occurs from April to May, during which the female builds the nest and lays between 7 and 13 eggs. The incubation period lasts around 12-16 days, and after hatching, the chicks are fed by both parents until they fledge at approximately 21 days old. These birds are non-migratory and remain in their resident territory year-round. The conservation status of the Eurasian blue tit is \\"Least Concern,\\" according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), with their population remaining stable and widespread across its native range. They are well-adapted to various habitats, including deciduous and mixed forests, parks, gardens, and farmlands. As a result, they are frequently seen throughout Britain, making them a beloved part of the local avifauna."},{"question":"Instructions: You are given a statement written in Gujarati.

If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\". He moved rapidly. First, he promoted Confucian orthodoxy and reversed what he saw as his father's laxness by cracking down on unorthodox sects and by decapitating an anti-Manchu writer his father had pardoned. In 1723 he outlawed Christianity and expelled Christian missionaries, though some were allowed to remain in the capital. Next, he moved to control the government. He expanded his father's system of Palace Memorials which brought frank and detailed reports on local conditions directly to the throne without being intercepted by the bureaucracy, and created a small Grand Council of personal advisors which eventually grew into the emperor's de facto cabinet for the rest of the dynasty. He shrewdly filled key positions with Manchu and Han Chinese officials who depended on his patronage. When he began to realize that the financial crisis was even greater than he had thought, Yongzheng rejected his father's lenient approach to local landowning elites and mounted a campaign to enforce collection of the land tax. The increased revenues were to be used for \\"money to nourish honesty\\" among local officials and for local irrigation, schools, roads, and charity. Although these reforms were effective in the north, in the south and lower Yangzi valley, where Kangxi had wooed the elites, there were long established networks of officials and landowners. Yongzheng dispatched experienced Manchu commissioners to penetrate the thickets of falsified land registers and coded account books, but they were met with tricks, passivity, and even violence.

The discomfort and perceived difference in leg length were due to the fact that he was wearing mismatched boots with one having a thick sole and the other having a thin sole.

Upon realizing the issue with his footwear, he sent his servant to retrieve a different pair of boots, only to discover that the other pair had the same issue with one thick sole and one thin sole.

John Vass, appointed head gardener in 1939, left in 1957. Called up to the RAF in 1941, he had urged that the hedges be maintained, confident that everything else in the garden could be restored after the war. Ronald Platt succeeded him from 1957 to 1959. In 1959 Pamela Schwerdt and Sibylle Kreutzberger were appointed as joint replacements. They remained at Sissinghurst until 1991, their contributions, \\"as much, if not more than Vita's, mak[ing] it the most admired and popular 20th-century garden in England\\". In 2006 they were awarded the Royal Horticultural Society's Victoria Medal of Honour for their work at Sissinghurst. The pair were followed as head gardener by Sarah Cook, who was succeeded by Alexis Datta.In 2014, Troy Scott Smith, previously head gardener at Bodnant, was appointed – the first male head gardener since the 1950s. He has written of the challenges of maintaining the garden \\"in the manner of its creator, after they have gone\\". In 2018 Scott Smith announced plans to extend the flowering season at Sissinghurst beyond the autumn period established by Schwerdt and Kreutzberger, into the winter months, allowing for year-round opening of the garden. The gardening writer and landscape critic Tim Richardson, writing in 2015, described Scott Smith's re-making of the garden: \\"Sissinghurst, more than any other garden I know, inspires extremes of emotion. There is a feeling that this is Britain's leading garden – and so, arguably, the world's, a status that has proven to be both a great boon and an albatross around its neck\\". Scott Smith's plans include the reinstatement of every species of rose known to have been grown by Sackville-West. A new history of the garden by Sarah Raven was published in 2014. Sissinghurst continues to exert considerable influence, being described as a \\"Mecca\\" and a \\"place of pilgrimage\\" for gardeners from around the world and encouraging many imitators.

In addition to the dollar the coinage act officially established monetary units of mill or one-thousandth of a dollar (symbol ₥), cent or one-hundredth of a dollar (symbol ¢), dime or one-tenth of a dollar, and eagle or ten dollars, with prescribed weights and composition of gold, silver, or copper for each. It was proposed in the mid-1800s that one hundred dollars be known as a union, but no union coins were ever struck and only patterns for the 50 half union exist. However, only cents are in everyday use as divisions of the dollar; \\"dime\\" is used solely as the name of the coin with the value of 10¢, while \\"eagle\\" and \\"mill\\" are largely unknown to the general public, though mills are sometimes used in matters of tax levies, and gasoline prices are usually in the form of X.XX9 per gallon, e.g., 3.599, sometimes written as 3.599⁄10. When currently issued in circulating form, denominations equal to or less than a dollar are emitted as U.S. coins while denominations equal to or greater than a dollar are emitted as Federal Reserve notes (with the exception of gold, silver and platinum coins valued up to 100 as legal tender, but worth far more as bullion). Both one-dollar coins and notes are produced today, although the note form is significantly more common. In the past, \\"paper money\\" was occasionally issued in denominations less than a dollar (fractional currency) and gold coins were issued for circulation up to the value of 20 (known as the \\"double eagle\\", discontinued in the 1930s). The term eagle was used in the Coinage Act of 1792 for the denomination of ten dollars, and subsequently was used in naming gold coins. Paper currency less than one dollar in denomination, known as \\"fractional currency\\", was also sometimes pejoratively referred to as \\"shinplasters\\". In 1854, James Guthrie, then Secretary of the Treasury, proposed creating 100, 50 and 25 gold coins, which were referred to as a \\"Union\\", \\"Half Union\\", and \\"Quarter Union\\", thus implying a denomination of 1 Union = 100.

Their first two albums were released by the Sub Pop and Bella Union record labels, with their third by Nonesuch and Bella Union. The band came to prominence in 2008 with the release of their second EP, Sun Giant, and their self-titled debut album. Both received much critical praise and reviewers often noted the band's use of refined lyrics and vocal harmonies. Pecknold said that he would have liked the album to be released in 2009; however, the band's touring schedule delayed rehearsals of the new songs until February 2009. These sessions took place in a rented house outside Seattle, but were mostly scrapped, losing the band 60,000 of their own money. Further delays ensued because the drummer, Tillman, was scheduled to play a solo tour in Europe and North America throughout the 2009-10 winter. Pecknold later sent some demos to producer Phil Ek and expressed the hope that the second LP would emerge in late 2010. In December 2009, Pecknold said he wanted the new LP to sound \\"less poppy, less upbeat and more groove-based\\". He referenced the 12-string guitar sound from Roy Harper's folk album Stormcock, saying, \\"That will be the primary sonic distancing from the last record.\\" He wanted the band to record very quickly, with \\"vocal takes in one go, so even if there are fuck-ups, I want them to be on there. I want there to be guitar mistakes. I want there to be not totally flawless vocals. I want to record it and have that kind of cohesive sound. Van Morrison's Astral Weeks, to me, is the best-sounding album because it sounds like there were only six hours in the universe for that album to be recorded in. So I want it to have that feeling.\\" The band eventually began recording in April 2010 in various locations (including West Hurley, New York) and decided to scrap the earlier idea of a fast recording (though according to the band many of the initial vocals were done in one take). The album features a new six-piece band line up, with the addition of the former Blood Brothers bassist Morgan Henderson on upright bass and woodwind instruments. The album, Helplessness Blues, was released on May 3, 2011 with a cover illustrated by the Seattle artist Toby Liebowitz and painted by Christopher Alderson. The title track was released via free download on January 31, 2011, and the album's fourth track, \\"Battery Kinzie\\", was premiered in the UK on Zane Lowe's radio show on March 22, 2011. The Sub Pop record label released a downloadable music video of the track \\"Grown Ocean\\", with footage of the album's recording, on its website in support of the album. A 12\\" vinyl double A-side single of \\"Helplessness Blues\\" and \\"Grown Ocean\\" was released for Record Store Day on April 16, 2011. On November 1, 2011, Pecknold's brother, Sean Pecknold, released the official music video for \\"The Shrine / An Argument\\". On January 18, 2012, after the band had finished touring for the album, drummer Tillman announced that he had left the band. He would go on to reinvent himself and record several albums as Father John Misty, notable for his ironic sense of humor in lyrics and media as well as often criticizing both the record industry and society in interviews and on stage. Helplessness Blues was nominated as Best Folk Album at the 2012 Grammy Awards, held February 12, 2012.

Inspired by literature from authors like Edgar Allan Poe, Bram Stoker, and Mary Shelley, horror films have existed for more than a century. The macabre and the supernatural are frequent themes. Horror may also overlap with the fantasy, supernatural fiction and thriller genres. - A fantasy world is a fictional universe created in fiction media, such as literature, film or games. Typical fantasy worlds involve magic or magical abilities, nonexistent technology and sometimes, either an historical or futuristic theme. Some worlds may be a parallel world tenuously connected to Earth via magical portals or items; a fictional Earth set in the remote past or future; or an entirely independent world set in another universe. - Science fiction film (or sci-fi) is a genre that uses speculative, fictional science-based depictions of phenomena that are not fully accepted by mainstream science, such as extraterrestrial lifeforms, alien worlds, extrasensory perception and time travel, along with futuristic elements such as spacecraft, robots, cyborgs, interstellar travel or other technologies. Science fiction films have often been used to focus on political or social issues, and to explore philosophical issues like the human condition. In many cases, tropes derived from written science fiction may be used by filmmakers ignorant of or at best indifferent to the standards of scientific plausibility and plot logic to which written science fiction is traditionally held. - The fantastic is a subgenre of literary works characterized by the ambiguous presentation of seemingly supernatural forces. - Speculative fiction is a broad umbrella genre denoting any narrative fiction with supernatural or futuristic elements; this encompasses the genres of science fiction, fantasy, horror, alternative history, magic realism, and superhero fiction, as well as combinations of the previous genres. It typically strays strongly from reality and so may feature fictional types of beings like mythical creatures and supernatural entities, technologies that do not exist in real life like time machines and interstellar spaceships, or magical or otherwise scientifically inexplicable elements. The term's popularity is sometimes attributed to Robert Heinlein, who referenced it in 1947 in an editorial essay, although there are prior mentions of speculative fiction, or its variant \\"speculative literature\\". - Siyama or Siyama : Village of Warriors ( Thai : ) is a 2008 Thai action - fantasy film directed by Preecha Songsakul . - Fantasy films are films that belong to the fantasy genre with fantastic themes, usually involving magic, supernatural events, mythology, folklore, or exotic fantasy worlds. The genre is considered a form of speculative fiction alongside science fiction films and horror films, although the genres do overlap. Fantasy films often have an element of magic, myth, wonder, escapism, and the extraordinary. - Folklore is the body of expressive culture shared by a particular group of people; it encompasses the traditions common to that culture, subculture or group. These include oral traditions such as tales, proverbs and jokes. They include material culture, ranging from traditional building styles to handmade toys common to the group. Folklore also includes customary lore, the forms and rituals of celebrations like Christmas and weddings, folk dances and initiation rites. Each one of these, either singly or in combination, is considered a folklore artifact. Just as essential as the form, folklore also encompasses the transmission of these artifacts from one region to another or from one generation to the next. For folklore is not taught in a formal school curriculum or studied in the fine arts. Instead these traditions are passed along informally from one individual to another either through verbal instruction or demonstration. The academic study of folklore is called folkloristics. - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction.

The castle remained on the market for the following decade until bought in 1960 by Antonin Besse II, son of the late Sir Antonin Besse, and donated to the founding council of Atlantic College. Besse was a patron and honorary vice-president of the United World Colleges. The idea for an international school arose from a meeting between the educationalist Kurt Hahn, who founded Gordonstoun, and Air Marshal Sir Lawrence Darvall, the commandant of the NATO Defense College. They conceived of a college for 16–19-year-old students drawn from a wide range of nationalities, with the aim of fostering international understanding. With Rear-Admiral Desmond Hoare, the first headmaster, they persuaded Besse that the castle would make a suitable location for the first United World College, which opened in 1962 with fifty-six students.The first rigid-hulled inflatable boat was patented by Hoare at St Donat's in the 1960s. In an act of generosity, Hoare sold the patent for the boat to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution in 1973 for a notional £1; the RNLI's cheque was not cashed and remains at the castle. From 1963 until 2013 the castle hosted an RNLI lifeboat station which was credited with saving ninety-eight lives along the South Wales coast during its period of operation. The college's early years were financially precarious, but major fund-raising efforts led by Sir George Schuster strengthened the financial position in the mid-1960s.The fiftieth anniversary of the college in 2012 was celebrated with a visit to the site by Queen Noor of Jordan, President of the United World Colleges Foundation. As at 2017, the college was home to 350 students from more than 90 countries. The Hearst Corporation maintains a connection with St Donat's through a sponsorship programme for students at the college. With a history of occupation from its construction in the late 13th century, St Donat's has been described as the oldest continuously inhabited castle in Wales. answer the following question: What is the first name of the person who patented the first rigid-hulled inflatable boat?","response":"The first name of the person who patented the first rigid-hulled inflatable boat is Desmond. The full name is Rear-Admiral Desmond Hoare."},{"question":"I can use this background: The water level is seasonal, being lowered by about 10 feet (3.0 m) over the winter. The reservoir fills in the spring from snow melt and underground springs. The lake is usually at full level by late spring, but in the occasional years of low snow melt and low rainfall, it may remain up to several feet below its typical level. Water is let out of the lake in the fall so that ice will not damage docks and other structures around the lake. This also leads to excellent water quality, as a significant portion of the water is replaced every year. Now, I have a new situation: Alpine lake had low water levels this spring although the lake is usually at full level by late spring. Last year was a very wet year with lots of precipitation. Rangers were planning on letting water out of the lake in the fall so that ice will not damage docks and other structures around the lake. The water levels were high enough in the fall so they proceeded in lowering the water level by 10 feet.. Answer this question please: When is the water quality worse, during spring, or during fall? The answer to this question is:","response":"The water quality in Alpine Lake is generally worse during the spring as compared to the fall season. There are several factors that contribute to this difference in water quality between the two seasons. In the spring, the lake's water level rises due to snowmelt and underground springs filling the reservoir. When snow melts, it can carry various pollutants and sediments, such as salts, chemicals, and debris, which can negatively impact the water quality. Additionally, the inflow of water from underground springs may also introduce contaminants to the lake water. With the spring season marking the end of winter, the accumulated pollutants in the melting snow enter the water system, driving down the water quality. Another aspect of the spring season that affects water quality is the mixing of water layers, a process known as \\"turnover.\\" In colder months, water in lakes typically stratifies into different layers based on temperature; this is because colder water sinks while warmer water rises. When spring arrives, the ice on the lake's surface begins to melt, and the warming air brings surface water temperatures closer to that of deeper water layers. This induces mixing and circulation of the water layers, which may result in the suspension and distribution of accumulated sediments and pollutants throughout the lake. In contrast, during the fall, the water level is intentionally lowered by about 10 feet (3.0 m) to protect structures around the lake from ice damage, which leads to improved water quality. By lowering the water level, a significant portion of the water in the lake is removed and replaced with fresh water from surrounding sources. This displacement of water helps in diluting potential contaminants, making it less concentrated and ensuring overall better water quality. Furthermore, the fall season typically experiences less rainfall as compared to the wet spring months. Less precipitation reduces the influx of polluted runoff from surrounding areas, further improving the water quality during the fall season. In conclusion, the water quality in Alpine Lake is generally worse during the spring due to increased contaminants from melting snow, increased rainfall, and the mixing of water layers. The fall season, on the other hand, offers improved water quality due to the intentional lowering of water levels and reduced precipitation."},{"question":"Lizzy: Yolanda leaves home for work at 7:00 AM, riding her bike at 20 miles per hour. 15 minutes after she leaves, her husband realizes that she forgot her lunch, and jumps in the car to bring it to her. If he drives at 40 miles per hour and follows the exact same route as Yolanda, how many minutes will it take him to catch her?. Me: Hmmm, let me think. I think this is the detailed solution:","response":"Let's use the formula distance = speed × time to find the solution. Let Yolanda's time on the road be T minutes, and her distance be D miles. From the information given, we know that for Yolanda: D = (20 miles/hour) × (T / 60 hours), since there are 60 minutes in an hour. For Yolanda's husband, he starts 15 minutes later, so his time on the road would be (T - 15) minutes. Since he's following the same route, he will cover the same distance, D miles. His equation would be: D = (40 miles/hour) × ((T - 15) / 60 hours) Now, we have two equations and can solve for T: (20 miles/hour) × (T / 60 hours) = (40 miles/hour) × ((T - 15) / 60 hours) To simplify, multiply both sides by 60 to eliminate the hours: 20T = 40(T - 15) Now, divide both sides by 20: T = 2(T - 15) Expand the equation: T = 2T - 30 Subtract 2T from both sides: -T = -30 Finally, divide by -1: T = 30 So, Yolanda has been on the road for 30 minutes when her husband catches her.

Read both questions carefully. - How do I motivate myself to study subjects I don't like? - How do I motivate myself to study the subjects I don't like? 2. Identify the main subjects and verbs in each question. - In both questions, the subject is \\"I\\" and the main verb is \\"motivate.\\" 3. Determine the objects and complement phrases of the verbs. - In both questions, the object is \\"myself\\" and the complement phrase is \\"to study subjects I don't like\\" and \\"to study the subjects I don't like,\\" respectively. 4. Identify the difference between the two questions. - The only difference between these two questions is the presence of the word \\"the\\" before \\"subjects\\" in the second question. 5. Analyze the impact of the difference on the meaning of the questions. - The presence of \\"the\\" in the second question makes it slightly more specific, implying that there is a known set of subjects that the person doesn't like. In contrast, the first question is more general, referring to any subjects the person may dislike. However, in most practical contexts, this distinction would likely not have a significant impact on the overall meaning. After analyzing the questions, they can be considered to have the same meaning in most practical contexts. The slight difference in phrasing is unlikely to affect the interpretation of the question or the answer provided."},{"question":"Translate to Russian: You Belong to Me","response":"Ты принадлежишь мне In Russian, the English phrase \\"You Belong to Me\\" is translated as \\"Ты принадлежишь мне.\\" Here, \\"Ты\\" means \\"You,\\" \\"принадлежишь\\" is the second person singular form of the verb \\"принадлежать\\" which means \\"to belong,\\" and \\"мне\\" is the dative case form of the personal pronoun \\"я\\" which means \\"to me.\\" In general, the Russian language has a more complex grammatical structure than English. When translating a phrase like \\"You Belong to Me,\\" it's essential to take into account the context in which it's being used. Depending on the context, there might be slight variations in the word choice or word order in the translation. In Russian, words are often inflected to show their grammatical function in a sentence, like gender, case, and number of the noun. Additionally, verbs are conjugated to correspond with the subject in gender, number, and tense. For example, If this phrase were to be part of a song or a poem, the translation might be changed slightly to preserve the rhyme scheme or the overall aesthetic of the piece. In some cases, the translation could be rephrased for a smoother or more natural feeling in Russian.

Here's a question with a factual answer: Question: What is the significance of the Rosetta Stone, and how did it contribute to our understanding of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs? Answer: The Rosetta Stone is an ancient artifact, a stone slab that played a crucial role in deciphering the Egyptian hieroglyphs, a writing system used in ancient Egypt for over 3,000 years. Discovered in 1799 during Napoleon Bonaparte's military campaign in Egypt, the Rosetta Stone is an inscribed granodiorite stele which dates back to 196 BCE. It was found near the town of Rashid (known as Rosetta in French) in the Nile Delta. The significance of the Rosetta Stone lies in the fact that it features the same text written in three different scripts: ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs, Egyptian Demotic script, and ancient Greek. The Rosetta Stone allowed scholars to cross-reference the languages, which in turn aided in deciphering and understanding the hieroglyphic script. The ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs had been a mystery for centuries due to the lack of knowledge on how to read or interpret them. Jean-François Champollion, a French scholar, is credited with deciphering the Rosetta Stone in 1822. He recognized that the hieroglyphs represented both phonetic and ideographic information, and by using his knowledge of ancient Greek, Coptic, and other related languages, he was able to systematically work out the hieroglyphs' phonetic values and meanings. This breakthrough created a better understanding of ancient Egyptian culture, history, and language. As a result, historians and archaeologists have been able to explore and study numerous ancient Egyptian artifacts, religious texts, and monuments, significantly deepening our knowledge of their civilization. The Rosetta Stone, now housed in the British Museum, is a testament to human ingenuity, linguistic evolution, and our quest to unlock secrets of the past."},{"question":"Review: captivatingly quirky hybrid Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?

A. school children B. parents C. get money D. require to pay taxes E. take money The best answer is A:","response":"The government assists in the education sector in several ways and the beneficiaries are indeed diverse, including school children, parents, teachers, and the community at large. However, I will expand on each of the choices you have mentioned. A. School Children: This is one of the most direct ways that governments help with schools. Children are the primary beneficiaries of the educational services provided by government schools. The government establishes schools, hires teachers, devises school programming and curriculum, and ensures every child has the right and access to education. For underprivileged children, many governments also offer free education and school materials, meals, uniforms etc. B. Parents: The government indirectly assists parents by ensuring that their children receive education, therefore relieving parents of the taunting responsibility of providing formal education by themselves. Government schools usually have lower tuition fees compared to private schools, making it economically feasible for many parents. Additionally, some governments provide subsidies or tax deductions for education-related expenses, which further lighten the financial burden on parents. C. Get Money: Schools rely heavily on financial support from the government. This financial aid comes in many forms, such as direct funding, grants, and scholarships. The funding is used for a variety of purposes such as maintaining the infrastructure of existing schools, building new schools, paying salaries to the school staff, running educational programs, buying books and other resources, etc. This ensures the effective functioning of schools. D. Require to Pay Taxes: People, including parents, are required to pay taxes, and these taxes contribute to the public funds, a portion of which is allocated towards education. So, in a sense, the government is helping schools by requiring people to pay taxes that then get directed toward those educational institutions. Some governments also have provisions where people can claim deductions on their income tax for education-related expenses. E. Take Money: The Government does take money in the form of taxes, but it's not like they are taking money from schools. Rather, the tax money collected from the public is utilized for various public services including education. It's an arrangement where the public funds the government, which in turn funds schools to provide public education. In conclusion, the choice of 'school children' as the entity the government helps with schools is the best answer as they are the most direct beneficiaries of government's efforts in the field of education. However, the government’s role extends beyond just helping children—it supports parents, funds schools, and utilizes tax money for these causes."},{"question":"Translate the following sentence to Turkish: But no key individuals have been arrested.

In fact, he _ in the kitchen. He's in his perfect place when dicing tomatoes, making salads and baking cakes. By the time Kenny, 16, reached his third year of high school at Hickory Grove, North Carolina, US, he had become vice president of his school's cooking club. He also opened his own food company, called Modern Fusion. Kenny said he developed his love of cooking by watching his mother, and his grandmother, who owned a catering business herself. Kenny helped them both in order to remember their tips: how long to cook chicken so it stays wet, and the right amount of tomatoes to add to a spaghetti dish. At the age of 5, he cooked his first dish of shrimp and broccoli. Taking it for his school lunch, he warmed it up in the school's microwave, while the other kids ate their sandwiches. \\"I love to eat, and it started to become more fun to cook than to use a microwave,\\" he said. Cooking came easy to Kenny, and he enjoyed adding new ingredients into common dishes. \\"It started with a passion and I wanted to know more,\\" he said. He began to watch the Food Network and read chef blogs. Last summer, Kenny put his skills to the test by working with his grandmother to cater his uncle's wedding. While she cooked traditional dishes, Kenny wanted to add new to the expected flavors . Now Kenny spends his weekends catering his own events: weddings, birthday parties, baby showers. Kenny's dishes are always a hit. Chef Frederick Mookie Hicks, owner of a catering business, said Kenny's success comes from his ability to multitask in the kitchen. Hicks said he has asked Kenny to cook with him on jobs three times now, and he presents Kenny as a positive example of a passionate chef to the students in his cooking classes. \\"He's so vigorous about cooking that he doesn't let anything stop him,\\" Hicks said. \\"I knew in the first five minutes of working with the kid that he is something special.\\" Options: A He opened a cooking club in his high school.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the weather is warm making the demand for ice high happens, how will it affect ice will take longer to form. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","response":"The perturbation hypothesis does not directly affect the process described. However, if the weather is warm making the demand for ice high, it implies that more people want ice to use in their drinks and to keep themselves cool. This increased demand can potentially have an indirect effect on the process by causing the following: 1. Increased frequency of making ice: If people are constantly asking for ice, it's likely that you'll need to repeat the process of making ice more frequently. 2. Increased volume of ice produced: You may need to use more trays or larger trays to create more ice cubes at the same time to meet the higher demand. 3. Increased freezer strain: If the demand is so high that your freezer space is taken up by ice trays, the freezer might have a harder time maintaining the temperature required for freezing the water, thus causing a potential delay in the formation of ice. 4. Possible changes to freezer temperature: To accelerate the freezing process so that ice cubes are ready quicker, you may need to lower the temperature in your freezer (if adjustable). However, this change could impact other items stored in the freezer and might not be the most energy-efficient way to handle the situation. So, while the perturbation hypothesis does not directly affect the process of making ice, it does create indirect impacts that might require the person making the ice to adapt their strategy to meet the high demand during warm weather."},{"question":"Premise: The larger problem is that the Internet is simply not going to make us nicer people--nor are we going to become nicer just because we want to see the Internet reach its full potential.

In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague. - An estuary is a partially enclosed coastal body of brackish water with one or more rivers or streams flowing into it, and with a free connection to the open sea. - An ocean (the sea of classical antiquity) is a body of saline water that composes much of a planet's hydrosphere. On Earth, an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the World Ocean, which covers almost 71% of its surface. These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans. The word \\"sea\\" is often used interchangeably with \\"ocean\\" in American English but, strictly speaking, a sea is a body of saline water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land. - The River Torrens is the most significant river of the Adelaide Plains and was one of the reasons for the siting of the city of Adelaide, capital of South Australia. It flows from its source in the Adelaide Hills near Mount Pleasant, across the Adelaide Plains, past the city centre and empties into Gulf St Vincent between Henley Beach South and West Beach. The upper stretches of the river and the reservoirs in its watershed supply a significant part of the city's water supply. The river's long linear parks and a constructed lake in the lower stretch are iconic of the city. - Adelaide city centre is the innermost locality of Greater Adelaide, the capital city of South Australia. It is known by locals simply as \\"\\"The City\\"\\" or \\"\\"Town\\"\\" to distinguish it from Greater Adelaide and from the City of Adelaide (which also includes North Adelaide and the parklands). The locality is split into two key geographical distinctions: the city \\"square mile\\", bordered by North, East, South and West Terraces; and the section of the Adelaide Parklands south of the River Torrens which separates the built up part of the city from the surrounding suburbs and North Adelaide. - A sea is a large body of salt water that is surrounded in whole or in part by land. More broadly, \\"the sea\\" is the interconnected system of Earth's salty, oceanic watersconsidered as one global ocean or as several principal oceanic divisions. The sea moderates Earth's climate and has important roles in the water cycle, carbon cycle, and nitrogen cycle. Although the sea has been traveled and explored since prehistory, the modern scientific study of the seaoceanographydates broadly to the British \\"Challenger\\" expedition of the 1870s. The sea is conventionally divided into up to five large oceanic sectionsincluding the International Hydrographic Organization's four named oceans (the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, and Arctic) and the Southern Ocean; smaller, second-order sections, such as the Mediterranean, are known as \\"seas\\". - The Onkaparinga River is a river located in South Australia south of the Adelaide city centre . It runs from its source between Mount Torrens and Charleston in the Mount Lofty Ranges , and flows south westerly to an estuary at Port Noarlunga . The catchment is over 500 square kilometres ( 190 sq mi ) in area , and in part includes the following protected areas - the Encounter Marine Park , the Onkaparinga River National Park , the Onkaparinga River Recreation Park and the Port Noarlunga Reef Aquatic Reserve . The Onkaparinga River is the second major river within the Adelaide metropolitan area , after the River Torrens . The name derives from the Indigenous Kaurna name Ngangiparri which translates as \`\` The Women 's River '' . In 1837 Surveyor General Col William Light named it Field 's River , or the Field River , after Lieut William George Field RN ( 1804 - 1850 ) of the brig Rapid , who carried out the first surveys in the vicinity of its estuary , but subsequent Governor George Gawler soon reinstated the Indigenous name . The first Europeans to explore its sources and the Onkaparinga Valley were the party of Dr. George Imlay and John Hill in January 1838 . It is a source of fresh water for Adelaide . Mount Bold Reservoir was constructed between 1932 and 1938 along a section of its path approximately 20 kilometres ( 12 mi ) inland . Much of its flow is diverted via a tunnel from the Clarendon Weir to the Happy Valley Reservoir , that in turn supplies some 40 per cent of Adelaide 's water supply . Most years the flow to the reservoir is supplemented by water pumped from the River Murray via a pipeline from Murray Bridge .

She begins to piece together a narrative about her mother's sexuality and sexual exploitation in a space ordered by gender and class difference, and is re-awakened to her persistent questioning about her father's identity.[4][5] As Alia negotiates her past, she also deals with her current relationship to her lover, Lotfi, who has asked her to have what seems to be yet another abortion.[4] [1] Her development throughout the film contrasts her awakening to a past of sexual and social servitude which many of the female servants experienced in the palace against her own contested independence fraught with pain, conflict and uncertainty.[1] Answer:","response":"What impact does Alia's return to the prince's palace and her discovery of her mother's past have on her understanding of her own identity and her relationship with her lover, Lotfi, in the context of gender, class, and sexuality?"},{"question":"Instructions: A text is given in Malayalam.

Your task is to summarize them. Doug Stanhope on raising money for atheist tornado survivor: I did it simply to be a prick By Eric W. Dolan Monday, December 30, 2013 11:52 EDT Comedian Doug Stanhope helped raise more than 100,000 for an Oklahoma family whose home had been destroyed by a tornado. But he didn’t do it out of the goodness of his heart or because he was sympathetic. He just takes pleasure in mocking the faithful. “I didn’t do it because I felt sympathy because she got all her sh*t destroyed by a tornado. I did it simply to be a prick to her Okie Christian neighbors,” Stanhope said in a video uploaded to YouTube on Monday. “It’s funny how hate can make you do real nice things every now and then.” After a tornado ripped through the town of Moore, Oklahoma in May, CNN host Wolf Blitzer asked resident Rebecca Vitsmun if she thanked the Lord for surviving. She replied that she was an atheist. “If you didn’t think that took balls you’ve never been to Oklahoma,” Stanhope remarked. “Saying ‘I’m an atheist’ in Oklahoma is like screaming ‘Jihad’ at airport security. It took some nuts.” “If you watch the footage, all the other victims are on the news thanking Jesus for only killing their neighbors and not them, while a crawler is on the screen telling me where I can text money to help them out,” Stanhope said. “F*ck them. I don’t want Jesus getting credit for my 50. I’ll help that other girl out. She ain’t got no Jeebus, she gonna need money.” Vitsmun’s home was destroyed in the storm, and Stanhope started a fundraising drive on the website Indiegogo. The campaign, titled “Atheists Unite,” ended up raising 125,760. Stanhope, who is known for his abrasive and politically incorrect comedy, said in October it felt great to help a family in need — even if his motivations weren’t altruistic. “I can’t remember being happier in a shitload of years, repeatedly hitting refresh in those first days and seeing the numbers go up every minute,” he wrote at Vice.com. “Charity feels good, even when you’re doing it as a big ‘Fuck You’ to Christians who you’ve pre-judged, and not because you care about someone losing their shit. Realizing you’ve actually changed an individual’s life. It was pretty goddamned thrilling.” Watch video, uploaded to YouTube by Doug Stanhope, below. ||||| This May, I was in my usual spot on the couch in Bisbee, Arizona, drinking plastic jug vodka and watching CNN jam microphones into the faces of distraught victims of the Oklahoma tornadoes. They all thanked the Jesus for sparing them, for taking their homes and belongings instead of their lives, and for killing their neighbors instead of them. There was a video that had just gone viral of Wolf Blitzer repeatedly asking a meek and polite young lady if she thanked the Lord for her good fortune in not being killed. She stammered and then said, cute as a button, \\"Actually, I'm an atheist.\\" As always, Wolf looked like a big smacked dick. As I was watching, a crawler at the bottom of screen told me how to send money to the Red Cross via text message. I thought how funny it would be to have a fundraiser for just that one chick—fuck all her Okie-Christian neighbors. They're with God. We're atheists. We don't have Christ. We gotta take care of each other. CNN is very fickle in how long they give a fuck about any given tragedy, so I jumped on the computer, figured out how to use a fundraising site—not an easy task for a guy who still uses Hotmail—and by morning had \\"Atheists Unite\\" on IndieGogo.com. A few tweets and Facebook posts later from myself and thousands of other ordinary, caring people—plus some big shots like the Richard Dawkins Foundation, Penn Jillette, and Ricky Gervais—and the virtual cash register started chiming away. 50,000 dollars in the first day, almost 126,000 by the time it was done. Enough for her to move the fuck out of Jesus country—where she says she'll never return—like Tom Joad with a trust fund. I can't remember being happier in a shitload of years, repeatedly hitting refresh in those first days and seeing the numbers go up every minute. Charity feels good, even when you're doing it as a big “Fuck You” to Christians who you've pre-judged, and not because you care about someone losing their shit. Realizing you've actually changed an individual's life. It was pretty goddamned thrilling. You don't get the same feeling when you buy the pink label mustard at Safeway in October. That just makes you think your lottery ticket has better karma. You won't open the paper the next morning expecting headlines that breast cancer has been defeated because you ate a ham sandwich. I've noticed that the more you’re made aware of a disease, the more you realize that a lot of people are making a bank heist of money from you supporting their foundation. Having a cause is chump work. Having a foundation is where you make the salad. Nobody is a bigger wishing-well penny-catcher than the Breast Cancer Awareness carnies and the road agents that bear the hideous ribbon. Their motives are questionable, what they promote is dangerous. They don't so much want to prevent cancer as make sure you look for it, find any early stage of it, and treat it. Prevention would be bad for business. I’m often asked to perform at charity functions and I almost always decline, because the type of people who attend charity functions are the exact opposite of my target audience. \\"Thanks for coming out to help little Billy's lymphoma laugh-athon. But did you ever think life isn't really worth living anyway?\\" The big novelty thermometer on the stage showing the amount raised would start dropping with every word I said. Another paranoia I get is that I often find that the most charitable people are unknown artists who want you to come to a show that you don’t want to see, or buy a download of a song you don’t want to hear to \\"help the victims\\" of such and such. It's one thing to be Sting using your fame to bring attention to a cause. It's quite another to use a famous tragedy to get your attention. And I am no Sting on the fame level. There's a worldwide group called the Women in Black who are against bad things in general, war and bombing and the like. I remember seeing them every Wednesday in Trafalgar square when I was doing a lengthy run in London, five or six of them standing in the rain and cold around a statue, silent and maudlin (and in black, of course) with handmade signs doing their preaching. I envied them. To have a cause that you are so committed to yet still be content in doing so little about. \\"This is bad. It has to stop. Let's stand around once a week and do absolutely nothing. PS: No men allowed.\\" And then go home with all the self-satisfaction of someone who bought a pink Dallas Cowboys jersey off the NFL website and felt like a war hero. Remember that in a free-market society, there is already a financial incentive for someone to find a cure for cancer on their own. Pfizer didn't come up with boner pills because of candlelight vigils and flaccid-cock symbols on juice boxes—they knew there was money in it. If you want to throw money at a disease, try donating to a disease almost nobody has and therefore nobody is trying to cure like Tree Man and Cock Face or the guy with the 130-pound balls. Almost nobody has these diseases and it'll be a long time before the NFL has players wearing bark jockstraps to raise awareness. Me, I prefer to spend my charitable donations close to home, where you see the results, or on individuals where you can see the smile on their faces. Most people are assholes so maybe cancer's only sin is the collateral damage. Doug is on a comedy tour, and you can get the dates at his website.

Not from the Lord, mind you, but from other atheists and friends of atheists. An Indiegogo campaign titled “Atheists Unite,” launched late Thursday by stand-up comic Doug Stanhope, is raking in dollars to help her family rebuild. Less than 17 hours after going live, it met its 60-day goal of 50,000. A little more than an hour later, as we prepared to publish, donations were at 55,000 - and growing. “Holy @#!%!” Stanhope said, by way of hello when he answered his phone Friday morning. Vitsmun, whose home was destroyed in Monday’s deadly tornado, unwittingly became a sensation Tuesday after participating in a live TV interview with CNN’s Wolf Blitzer. When Blitzer asked if she thanked the Lord for the decision she made that saved her and her 19-month-old son, she stammered before saying, “I’m actually an atheist.” She and Blitzer laughed and moved on. But that TV moment took on a life of its own, spreading online and through social media. It also inspired this outpouring of atheist love. “It's important that our community shows that we have your back when you come out publicly as an atheist,” Stanhope wrote on the Indiegogo page. “Let's show the world that you dont need to believe in a god to have human compassion nor does all charity fall under the banner of religion. Let's get this courageous woman and her family back in their own home.” While a serious matter, the campaign offers “Perks” for giving – including a “Get Out of Hell Free Card” for a 50 donation, a “First Class Upgrade” on “the flight to the afterlife” for 500 and, just because, “Full Access to God’s Planbook” for 5,000. Stanhope said he often weaves his beliefs, or lack of belief, into his stand-up routines. While Christian missionaries run around Third World countries – feeding the poor, Bibles in hand – he bemoans how atheists do nothing. “We sit around in a dark bar and mock them,” he said. Meantime, “that book [the Bible] is a lot more appealing when there’s a bowl of rice under your nose.” He saw this as an opportunity to do something, and his 2,021 contributors – and counting – clearly did, too. This wasn’t the only group to get into the atheist-supporting game. On the website for FreeOK, Oklahoma's freethought convention which is scheduled for June 22, T-shirts are being sold to benefit Vitsmun and her family. The shirts are emblazoned with her quote, \\"I'm actually an atheist.\\" And as Stanhope's Indiegogo campaign reached its goal Friday afternoon, a press release came in from the American Humanist Association – announcing that it just forwarded to Vitsmun a whopping donation of 10,000. “Rebecca Vitsmun’s courage to speak forthrightly about her atheism inspired humanists and others who are good without a god across the country to help her through this difficult time,” said the association’s executive director Roy Speckhardt, in the written statement. “Natural disasters are a product of our environment, not supernatural forces, and we have a responsibility to help those affected by them.” While we are in contact with Vitsmun through sporadic e-mails, we were unable to get a reaction from her before publishing. But the American Humanist Association shared a statement from her in its press release. “People from all around the world have reached out to us and the people of Moore and Newcastle and we don’t know how we can ever thank everyone enough for their generosity,” she said. “It is really hard to even know where to begin, but having so many here to embrace us while we figure it out makes the path ahead less intimidating. Thank you all so much.” |||||","response":"Comedian Doug Stanhope helped raise over 100,000 for an Oklahoma family whose home was destroyed by a tornado.

The following day her publicist confirmed that the track was entitled \\"Space Odyssey\\" and had been produced in collaboration with Rusko to protest a travel piece about Sri Lanka printed in The New York Times. The track made it onto the final album under the revised title \\"Space\\". The same month, she filmed a short film for the song \\"Born Free\\". At the end of April the track was released as a promotional single, and the short film accompanying the song was released. The film, directed by Romain Gavras, depicts a military unit rounding up red-headed young men who are then shot or forced to run across a minefield. The film, which also features nudity and scenes of drug use, caused widespread controversy and was either removed or labelled with an age restriction on YouTube. In the weeks following the release of the film, M.I.A. was the most blogged about artist on the Internet, according to MP3 blog aggregator The Hype Machine. M.I.A. found the controversy \\"ridiculous\\", saying that videos of real-life executions had not generated as much controversy as her video.

Here are the steps I will follow: Step 1: Understand the given statement The given statement is \\"Beyond that, he had no memory of pain.\\" This suggests that the person does not have any recollection of pain beyond a certain point or event. Step 2: Analyze the conclusion The conclusion we want to evaluate is \\"The memory of the pain came crashing down on him.\\" This implies that the person suddenly and intensely remembered the pain.

They formed in London, and entered the music scene in 1985 with their debut single \\"Who Needs Love Like That\\". Following the release of their fourth single \\"Sometimes\\", the duo established itself on the UK Singles Chart and became one of the most successful artists of the late 1980s to mid-1990s. - Disco is a genre of dance music containing elements of funk, soul, pop, and salsa. It achieved popularity during the mid-1970s to the early 1980s. Its initial audiences in the U.S. were club-goers from the gay, African American, Italian American, Latino, and psychedelic communities in Philadelphia and New York City during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Disco can be seen as a reaction against both the domination of rock music and the stigmatization of dance music by the counterculture during this period. It was popular with both men and women, from many different backgrounds. - Krautrock (sometimes called \\"kosmische Musik\\") is a broad genre of experimental rock that developed in Germany in the late 1960s. The term \\"krautrock\\" was originated by English-speaking music journalists as a humorous name for a diverse range of German bands whose music drew from sources such as psychedelic rock, avant-garde electronic music, funk, minimalism, jazz improvisation, and world music styles. Largely divorced from the traditional blues and rock and roll influences of British and American rock music up to that time, the period contributed to the evolution of electronic music and ambient music as well as the birth of post-punk, alternative rock and new-age music. Important acts of the scene include Can, Kraftwerk, Neu!, Ash Ra Tempel, Tangerine Dream, and Faust. - Art rock is a subgenre of rock music that generally reflects a challenging or avant-garde approach to rock, or which makes use of modernist, experimental, or unconventional elements. Art rock aspires to elevate rock from teen entertainment to an artistic statement, opting for a more experimental and conceptual outlook on music. Influences may be drawn from several genres, such as experimental rock, avant-garde music, classical music, and jazz. - Post-punk (originally \\"new musick\\") is a broad type of rock music that emerged from the punk movement of the 1970s, in which artists departed from punk rock's raw, accessible style to pursue a variety of avant-garde sensibilities. Attempting to break from rock tradition, post-punk artists experimented with sources such as electronic music, black dance music and the avant-garde, as well as novel recording technology and production techniques. The movement also saw the frequent intersection of music with art and politics, as artists incorporated ideas from sources such as modernist literature, critical theory, cinema, and performance art. Accompanying these musical developments were communities that produced independent record labels, visual art, multimedia performances and fanzines in conjunction with the music. - New wave is a genre of rock music popular from the late 1970s to the mid-1980s with ties to 1970s punk rock. New wave moved away from smooth blues and rock and roll sounds to create pop music that incorporated electronic and experimental music, mod and disco. Initially new wave was similar to punk rock, before becoming a distinct, genre. It subsequently engendered subgenres and fusions, including synthpop, college rock and gothic rock. - The UK Singles Chart (currently entitled Official Singles Chart) is compiled by the Official Charts Company (OCC), on behalf of the British record industry, listing the top-selling singles in the United Kingdom, based upon physical sales, paid-for downloads and streaming. To be eligible for the chart, a single is currently defined by the Official Charts Company (OCC) as either a 'single bundle' having no more than four tracks and not lasting longer than 25 minutes or one digital audio track not longer than 15 minutes with a minimum sale price of 40 pence. The rules have changed many times as technology has developed, the most notable being the inclusion of digital downloads in 2005 and streaming in 2014. - Synthpop (also known as \\"technopop\\"), a subgenre of new wave music first became prominent in the late 1970s and features the synthesizer as the dominant musical instrument. It was prefigured in the 1960s and early 1970s by the use of synthesizers in progressive rock, electronic, art rock, disco, and particularly the \\"Krautrock\\" of bands like Kraftwerk. It arose as a distinct genre in Japan and the United Kingdom in the post-punk era as part of the new wave movement of the late-1970s to the mid-1980s. - \`\` A Little Respect '' is a song written and recorded by British synthpop duo Erasure , released in September 1988 as their tenth single . It was issued as the third European ( and second American ) single from their album The Innocents . Known as one of their signature songs , \`\` A Little Respect '' continued Erasure 's success on the UK Singles Chart , where it hit number four to become the band 's fifth Top 10 single . It was also Erasure 's second consecutive Top 20 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 , where it climbed to number 14 , and hit number two on the U.S. Hot Dance Club Songs chart . In the U.K. Mark Saunders and Phil Legg provided the remixes , for the U.S. the remixes were made by Justin Strauss . Written by Erasure members Vince Clarke and Andy Bell , the heavily synthesized instrumentation is accentuated by acoustic guitar and Bell 's use of falsetto in the chorus . The lyrics are an empowering plea to a lover to show compassion and respect . An acoustic version of \`\` A Little Respect '' is featured on the Moon & the Sky Plus EP in the UK . The song was remixed in 2006 by Jaded Alliance for the Future Retro compilation , and again in 2009 by Avantara for the Pop ! Remixed album and EP and by Wayne G & Andy Allder for inclusion on the Phantom Bride EP . Erasure remixed and re-released the track in December 2010 as a digital download - only single for charity . Proceeds from the sale of the single benefit the Hetrick - Martin Institute , the home of the Harvey Milk High School in New York , and the True Colors Fund . Called the \`\` HMI Redux '' , it includes additional vocals from the Hetrick - Martin Institute youth chorus . Numerous HMI youth were featured in the \`\` HMI Redux '' music video that accompanied the track . Produced by Laundry Service Media and directed by Jason Stein , the video premiered on the Huffington Post and was featured on Perez Hilton . - Kraftwerk (\\"\\"power station\\"\\") is a German electronic music band formed by Ralf Hütter and Florian Schneider in 1970 in Düsseldorf. In the 1970s, they were among the first successful pop acts to popularize electronic music and are widely considered to be innovators and pioneers of the genre. The band was fronted by both Hütter and Schneider until Schneider's departure in 2008. - \\"Who Needs Love Like That\\" is the debut single released by British synthpop duo Erasure. The song was released in the UK on Mute Records in 1985 as a prelude to their debut album \\"Wonderland\\". The video was directed by John Scarlett Davies and produced by Nick Verden for Aldabra. - Progressive rock (shortened as \\"prog\\"; sometimes \\"art rock\\", \\"classical rock\\" or \\"symphonic rock\\") is a broad subgenre of rock music that developed in the United Kingdom and United States throughout the mid to late 1960s. Initially termed \\"progressive pop\\", the style was an outgrowth of psychedelic bands who abandoned standard pop traditions in favour of instrumentation and compositional techniques more frequently associated with jazz, folk or classical music. Additional elements contributed to its \\"progressive\\" label: lyrics were more poetic, technology was harnessed for new sounds, music approached the condition of \\"art\\", and the studio, rather than the stage, became the focus of musical activity, which often involved creating music for listening, not dancing. - Vince Clarke (born Vincent John Martin; 3 July 1960) is an English synthpop musician and songwriter. Clarke has been the main composer and musician of the band Erasure since 1985, and was previously the main songwriter of several groups, including Depeche Mode, Yazoo and The Assembly.

Movie title: My Brilliant Career Movie plot: The heroine, Sybylla Melvyn, is an imaginative, headstrong girl growing up in rural Australia in the 1890s. Drought and a series of poor business decisions reduce her family to subsistance level, her father begins to drink excessively, and Sybylla struggles to deal with the monotony of her life. To her relief, she is sent to live on her grandmother's property, where life is more comfortable. There she meets wealthy young Harry Beecham, who loves her and proposes marriage; convinced of her ugliness and aware of her tomboyish ways, Sybylla is unable to believe that he could really love her. By this time, her father's drinking has got the family into debt, and she is sent to work as governess/housekeeper for the family of an almost illiterate neighbour to whom her father owes money. She becomes acclaimated to this life to the point where it is almost bearable, but to her relief (again) is sent home (this time) to keep her away from her crass employer's son who has apparantely fallen for her (and, ironically, since she has no property, she is deemed unsuitable as the son's mate). When Harry Beecham returns to ask Sybylla to marry him, she concludes that she would only make him unhappy and sends him away, determined to pursue her career as a writer. The movie ending completes the suggestion, made at the begining, that this entire screenplay is based on her first book, as we see her putting the manuscript in a mailbox in front of her parent's ramshacle house. (A suggestion that this movie is the story of her Brilliant Career.....or how it got its start anyway).","response":"Sybylla Melvyn, the protagonist of the movie \\"My Brilliant Career,\\" is first sent to live on her grandmother's property. This occurs due to the difficult circumstances her family faces, which include financial struggles, her father's excessive drinking, and the monotony of life in rural Australia during the 1890s. Living on her grandmother's property provides Sybylla with a more comfortable environment, where she meets the wealthy young Harry Beecham. Throughout the movie, Sybylla experiences various challenges and opportunities. She receives a marriage proposal from Harry, but due to her insecurities about her appearance and tomboyish behavior, she struggles to believe that he genuinely loves her. Additionally, Sybylla faces tougher times when her family's debt forces her to work as a governess and housekeeper for a neighbor's family in order to repay her father's loans. In her new role, Sybylla finds herself becoming accustomed to her surroundings, but is eventually sent back home in order to distance herself from the employer's son who falls for her. Despite her desire for a career as a writer, she encounters societal pressures and expectations regarding marriage and her role as a woman. When Harry Beecham returns, Sybylla is faced with the difficult decision of marrying him or pursuing her dreams of writing. Ultimately, she decides that marrying Harry would only lead to unhappiness for both of them and chooses to follow her passion for writing instead. This decision marks the beginning of Sybylla's brilliant career, as suggested by the movie's ending, which shows her mailing her manuscript from her parent's humble home. The film presents the story as a reflection of Sybylla's journey of self-discovery, growth, and her determination to create a life on her own terms."},{"question":"Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Sarah Morton (Charlotte Rampling), a middle-aged English mystery author, who has written a successful series of novels featuring a single detective, is having writer's block that is impeding her next book.

Losing the fight by a fixed result causes a fight to break out at the end of the match. Jake's brother Joey LaMotta (Joe Pesci) is not only a sparring partner to him but also responsible for organizing his fights.Joey discusses a potential shot for the title with one of his mob connections, Salvy Batts (Frank Vincent), on the way to his brother's house in their neighborhood in the Bronx. When they are finally settled in the house, Jake admits that he does not have much faith in his own abilities. Accompanied by his brother to the local open-air swimming pool, a restless Jake spots a 15-year-old girl named Vickie (Cathy Moriarty) at the edge of the pool. Although he has to be reminded by his brother he is already married, the opportunity to invite her out for the day very soon comes true when Joey gives in.Jake has two fights with Sugar Ray Robinson, set two years apart, and Jake loses the second when the judges rule in favor of Sugar Ray because he was leaving the sport temporarily for conscription in the United States Army.

Trump on Tuesday announced that the United States is ending its participation in the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) that lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program, and would re-impose U.S. economic sanctions on Iran. The agreement was negotiated by the administration of Trump’s predecessor, President Barack Obama, and involved five other world powers; Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia. Trump’s National Security Adviser John Bolton said the U.S. decision to re-impose sanctions on Iran will set a higher standard for North Korea nuclear talks by sending, “a very clear signal that the United States will not accept inadequate deals.” The U.S. policy reversal on Iran should not seriously impede diplomatic progress underway with North Korea, said Victor Cha, a noted Korea scholar with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “In terms of how the North Koreans would take it, I don’t think they’d take it one way or the other. I don’t think they’d see it as negative or positive because they think they’re different from anybody else anyway. They think they’re a very special case,” Cha said at a CSIS conference this week. While the Iran deal limited that country’s efforts to develop a nuclear bomb, North Korea already possesses 20 to 60 nuclear warheads, according assessments by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, and between 40 to 100 nuclear development facilities, according a report from the RAND Corporation security research organization.

Scott said he’s “concerned” that “we have members of the media being irresponsible,” singling out Fox News, where reporter Mike Tobin said he saw the shooting of a young black man occur. “When you do stuff like that irresponsibly,” he continued, “media is supposed to report what they know, not what they think.” He pleaded with any national media still in Baltimore to cover some “positive” things as well, saying, “There are so many great things going on with young people in our town that we do not have to continuously show the negative about Baltimore.” “Amen to members of the media being responsible,” Tapper replied. But he did want to know why there have been “such vatstly different accounts of what happened.” The anchor reported that police are hoping to release surveillance footage to put the public’s mind at ease that no one was shot by police. Following Fox’s initial, frenzied reporting, Shepard Smith issued an on air apology, telling viewers, “We screwed up.” Watch video below, via CNN: Please enable Javascript to watch.

A fleeing suspect pulled out a revolver, which went off, and no officers fired their weapons, police said, denying conflicting reports from people at the scene. No one was injured, but the incident brought out a crowd of people and dozens of additional officers in riot gear. At least one person was pepper-sprayed as police tried to disperse the crowd. The suspect was arrested for a gun violation and taken to a hospital \\"out of an abundance of caution,\\" police said. The Freddie Gray case not only continued to fray nerves but also sparked a national dialogue on race and economic disparities as President Barack Obama invoked Baltimore on Monday in calling for more opportunities for young men and Gray's family said in a televised interview that perhaps the 25-year-old would \\"live forever\\" as a \\"martyr.\\" Gray died April 19, one week after his arrest. Prosecutors have charged six police officers involved in his arrest and transport and allege he suffered a spinal injury while not wearing a seat belt in the back of a police van. Police union officials have denied that any of the officers are responsible. Read the latest story here. After more than a week of peaceful protests, a confrontation between students and police April 27 outside Mondawmin Mall erupted into violence; crowds threw rocks at police, looted businesses and set fires. Police said Monday they made 486 arrests linked to the unrest. City, state and federal officials also continued to discuss recovery, and the CVS Health said Monday it was working on plans to rebuild in Baltimore, where two of its damaged drugstores remain closed. Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake and Health Commissioner Dr. Leana Wen delivered prescription medication to those who couldn't get it from shuttered pharmacies. The city launched an online registry Monday to help the more than 235 businesses affected.

Hickman of the Southern Baptist Church and a developer pledged to rebuild the Mary Harvin Transformation Center, a Broadway East community center that was burned to the ground in a three-alarm fire on the night of the riots before it was completed. The National Guard troops who were deployed to Baltimore have left the streets, and the last of them are expected to complete their mission Tuesday, a spokesman said. About 1,400 remained on duty Monday morning but in various stages of demobilization, no longer \\"out manning the streets,\\" Col. Charles S. Kohler said. Kohler said the remaining troops are completing duties such as packing away equipment and performing maintenance on vehicles. Gov. Larry Hogan activated the guard last Monday, the day of Freddie Gray's funeral, after crowds in the city became violent. By Saturday, 3,000 Guardsmen were supporting police. On Friday, Baltimore's top prosecutor announced charges against all six police officers involved with Gray's arrest. The move eased tensions and led to celebratory rallies in the city, but arrests continued as people broke a citywide curfew. The curfew, which was lifted Sunday, required all city residents to stay indoors between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. The city remained under a state of emergency on Monday. A spokeswoman for Hogan said Monday morning that the emergency would be lifted soon. Police did not respond to a request to comment on how the National Guard's removal will affect their deployments in the city. Meanwhile, a police investigation continues as Baltimore State’s Attorney Marilyn J. Mosby builds her case. The separate investigations by police and prosecutors have some conflicting findings. While Mosby said Friday that the officers had made an illegal arrest because a knife Gray was carrying was not a \\"switchblade,\\" a violation of state law, the police task force studied the knife and determined it was \\"spring-assisted,\\" which does violate a Baltimore code. The officers remain free on bail. When the gunshot Monday caused panic in the street, Daisy Bush, 61, said she rushed to pack up a table of handbags and candies she had been selling outside her shop, D&D Variety Store, on Pennsylvania Avenue. \\"It's rough for business; it's rough for everybody,\\" she said. Bush, who has owned the shop for about 15 years, said the neighborhood had been \\"in an uproar\\" for the past week. She said it has been scary not knowing whether she would be safe outside her store. \\"I don't think it's ever going to go back to normal,\\" she added. \\"Our normal is crazy.\\" State Sen. Catherine Pugh said police allowed the 23-year-old shooting suspect to meet with his mother before he was booked. \\"He's doing fine. He was physically checked and had no bullet wounds,\\" Pugh said. \\"He was very emotional, but he got to see his family. ... It was great to be there.\\" Pugh, who has gone to the Penn North intersection every night to calm tensions between protesters and police, commended the department for its handling of Monday's incident. One Baltimore United, a coalition of labor and community groups, called Monday for a civil and economic recovery program \\"to heal Baltimore,\\" blaming failures in policy for the city's struggles. They were among many, including lobbyists in Annapolis, who said the urban poverty highlighted in the protests demonstrated the need for further investment in Baltimore's schools, mental health services and transportation. Obama traveled to the Bronx, N.Y., on Monday to announce a nonprofit organization intended to provide opportunities for young men of color. \\"Some communities have consistently had the odds stacked against them,\\" Obama said. \\"And folks living in those communities, and especially young people living in those communities, could use some help to change those odds.\\" Community members and families of students at Furman Templeton Elementary School collected enough food for 350 families in a food drive to help residents affected in the riots.

An officer speaks to members of the media Monday, May 4, 2015, in Baltimore. Lt. Col. Melvin Russell said police pursued a man who was spotted on surveillance cameras and appeared to be armed with a handgun.... (Associated Press) Smith told viewers that reporter Mike Tobin's mistake came during a chaotic situation Monday afternoon and was an \\"honest and straightforward\\" error and one that was corrected promptly. Tobin had reported the shooting on Fox's \\"The Real Story,\\" telling host Gretchen Carlson that he saw police officers chase a fleeing man and that an officer had fired and hit the man. But Baltimore police denied that a shooting had occurred. A black man was arrested in the incident, which came days after riots hit the city where another black man, Freddie Gray, died after being taken into police custody. After hearing Tobin's account of events and a police denial given on-air to Fox reporter Leland Vittert, Smith addressed the initial story. \\"And the truth is, according to police, there is no gunshot victim,\\" Smith said, later adding, \\"Nobody has been shot. No police officer has pulled the trigger. And on behalf of Mike Tobin and the rest of our crew there and the rest of us at Fox News, I am very sorry for the error and glad we were able to correct it quickly.\\" In a separate report, Tobin offered an account but no apology. \\"It would be very hard to duplicate a situation that looked more like a guy being shot,\\" Tobin said. He, his security team and cameraman thought the officer had his gun drawn and, after hearing a shot, saw the fleeing man on the ground. \\"I arrived at the conclusion that the individual had been shot, as you naturally would in a situation like that,\\" Tobin said. The man looked to be in \\"bad shape,\\" he said. The incident happened in the same area where police first spotted Gray before his arrest. Six officers were charged Friday in Gray's death. On Monday, Lt. Col. Melvin Russell said police pursued a man who was spotted on surveillance cameras and appeared to be armed with a handgun. Police said the man was taken into custody after a brief chase, during which a gunshot was heard. Russell said that police never fired their weapons and that no one was shot. Police recovered a handgun loaded with three rounds, one of which was spent. The man was uninjured and didn't want to go to a hospital, but was taken in an ambulance anyway, he said. The arrest drew a crowd of protesters who chanted, \\"Black community, control the police!\\" ___ AP reporters Ben Nuckols and David Dishneau in Baltimore contributed to this report. ||||| Write a summary.","response":"Baltimore City Councilman Brandon Scott has criticized Fox News for their “irresponsible” reporting on a chaotic incident that was initially believed to be a police shooting in Baltimore.

We want to find the value of 's' in the equation: -1865 = 75*s + 235 First, we need to get rid of the 235 that's on the same side as 75 times 's'. To do this, we're going to subtract 235 from both sides of the equation. Here's what it looks like: -1865 - 235 = 75*s + 235 - 235 Now, let's do the subtraction: -2100 = 75*s Our next step is to figure out what number times 75 will give us -2100. To do this, we're going to divide both sides of the equation by 75: (-2100) / (75) = (75*s) / (75) Now, let's divide -2100 by 75: -28 = s There you go, my little friend! 's' equals to -28.

While the atmosphere in the city is already vitiated by the atrocities of ganglords Baba Khan and Manna Shetty who enjoy the support of some unscrupulous police personnel , the A.C.P. vows to make the ruthless gangsters bite the dust , without taking the law in his own hands . On the other hand , Vishal an angry young man , can not stand this injustice since the police had failed to arrest his brother's killers , and he silently resents his A.C.P father's inaction in dealing with the culprits . The ideologies of the father and son clash - Which lead to a conflict between a dutiful father and a reckless son . The only one who understands the agony of Vishal is Mohini , the daughter of head constable Devkinandan Sharma . The day comes when Vishal confronts Baba Khan and Manna Shetty Which leads to tension and gory situation for the A.C.P. , as the ganglords threaten to eliminate the A.C.P. as well as his wife Revati and son Vishal . Question: \\"Why did Vishal become angry?\\" Answer: \\"He was angry that the police had failed at killing his brother's killers\\" Is this answer correct? OPTIONS: -- no. -- yes....I think the answer is","response":"yes, the answer is correct, but it can be elaborated further for better understanding. Vishal became angry because the police, including his father A.C.P. Ramakant Chaudhary, had failed to apprehend and bring to justice the culprits responsible for the death of his elder brother, Vikas. The pre-planned accident was orchestrated by the ruthless ganglords Baba Khan and Manna Shetty, who managed to evade capture due to insufficient evidence and their influence over some corrupt police officers. Vishal's anger and frustration stem from witnessing the sheer injustice of losing his brother without any hope for retribution, as well as from observing his father's perceived inability or unwillingness to bend the rules to bring the criminals to justice. This leads to a growing resentment towards his father and the law enforcement system as a whole, eventually causing a rift between the once close father and son duo. As a result, Vishal's anger drives him towards taking matters into his own hands, defying his father's principles and ultimately leading to clashes and conflicts within their family. Understanding his pain and seeking solace, Vishal finds a confidante in Mohini, the daughter of head constable Devkinandan Sharma. The situation escalates when Vishal finally confronts the ganglords Baba Khan and Manna Shetty, putting the lives of his father, mother, and himself in imminent danger. In summary, Vishal became angry due to the police's failure to arrest his brother's killers, the perceived inaction from his father, A.C.P. Ramakant Chaudhary, and the continuous reign of terror by the ganglords Baba Khan and Manna Shetty in the city."},{"question":"Q: What did Vogue request?

The atrocities during the war have been described as the worst crimes committed in Europe since World War Two. At a UN tribunal in The Hague, judges found him guilty of 10 out of 11 counts of genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and other atrocities in the Bosnian war of the 1990s, including leading the slaughter of thousands of Bosnian Muslims (Bosniaks) and Croats. One count of genocide related to the massacre of more than 7,500 Muslim men and boys in the Srebrenica enclave in July 1995, which the UN said was part of a campaign to \\"terrorise and demoralise the Bosnian Muslim and Bosnian Croat population\\". He was found not guilty in one count of genocide, relating to the forcible expulsion of hundreds of thousands of non-Serbs from seven towns and villages in Bosnia. The trial was a weighty affair - lasting five years, followed by an additional 18-month deliberation by the bench. Over 497 days, Mr Karadzic conducted his own defence, referring to some three million pages of evidence against him. He was sentenced to 40 years in prison - though his lawyer has indicated he will appeal. Balkans war: a brief guide Serbia timeline How do you define genocide? The former Bosnian Serb leader was also found guilty of orchestrating the shelling of Sarajevo, and the use of 284 UN peacekeepers as human shields in May and June 1995. As he closed his case, he told the tribunal there was not a shred of evidence against him, although in a written statement he accepted that in his role as political leader of the Bosnian Serbs he bore \\"moral responsibility\\" for crimes they had carried out. Radovan Karadzic spent 13 years on the run before being handed over to the tribunal. He had been found living in disguise in Belgrade, under a false name and working as a New Age healer. He had even become well-known on the alternative health circuit, reportedly publishing a column in Healthy Living magazine. A bushy grey beard and thick glasses had transformed his appearance. Since the court adjourned to deliberate, Serbian prosecutors have arrested and charged eight people with playing direct roles in the Srebrenica massacre. Mr Karadzic was born in 1945 in a stable in Savnik, Montenegro. His father, Vuk, had been a member of the Chetniks - Serb nationalist guerrillas who fought against both Nazi occupiers and Tito's communist partisans in World War II - and was in jail for much of his son's childhood. Karadzic Timeline His mother, Jovanka Karadzic, described her son as loyal, and a hard worker who used to help her in the home and in the fields. She said he was a serious boy who was respectful towards the elderly and helped his school friends with their homework. In 1960 Mr Karadzic moved to Sarajevo, where he later met his wife, Ljiljana, graduated as a doctor, and became a psychiatrist in a city hospital. He also became a poet and fell under the influence of Serb nationalist writer Dobrica Cosic, who encouraged him to go into politics. After working briefly for the Green Party, he helped set up the Serbian Democratic Party (SDS) - formed in 1990 in response to the rise of nationalist and Croat parties in Bosnia, and dedicated to the goal of a Greater Serbia. Less than two years later, as Bosnia-Hercegovina gained recognition as an independent state, he declared the creation of the independent Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Hercegovina (renamed Republika Srpska) with its capital in Pale, a suburb of Sarajevo, and himself as head of state. Mr Karadzic's party, supported by Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic, organised Serbs to fight against the Bosniaks and Croats in Bosnia. A vicious war ensued, in which Serbs besieged Sarajevo for 44 months, shelling Bosniak forces but also terrorising the civilian population with a relentless bombardment and sniper fire. Thousands of civilians died, many of them deliberately targeted. Bosnian Serb forces - assisted by paramilitaries from Serbia proper - also expelled hundreds of thousands of Bosniaks and Croats from their homes in a brutal campaign of \\"ethnic cleansing\\". Numerous atrocities were documented, including the widespread rape of Bosniak women and girls. Reporters also discovered Bosnian Serb punishment camps, where prisoners-of-war were starved and tortured. War crimes were also committed against Serb civilians by the Bosnian Serbs' foes in the bitter inter-ethnic war. Mr Karadzic was jointly indicted in 1995 along with the Bosnian Serb military leader, Ratko Mladic, for war crimes they had allegedly committed during the 1992-95 war. He was obliged to step down as president of the SDS in 1996 as the West threatened sanctions against Republika Srpska. After the Dayton accord that ended the Bosnian war, he eventually went into hiding - possibly in the mountainous south-eastern area of the Serb-controlled part of Bosnia, protected by paramilitaries. Mr Karadzic says Dayton's chief architect, US diplomat Richard Holbrooke, promised him immunity from prosecution in exchange for quitting the political scene. Mr Holbrooke denies any such deal was struck. When he finally appeared before the UN's International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in August 2008, he failed to respond to the charges against him and the court entered pleas of \\"not guilty\\" on his behalf. Prosecutors accused him of using delaying tactics as he boycotted the initial hearings and insisted on representing himself. Launching his own defence in 2012, he sought to cast himself as a \\"mild man\\" who should be \\"rewarded\\" for having tried to avoid war. His performance was described by one publication as \\"by turns eloquent, historically provocative, and self-aggrandising\\".","response":"A man who used to be the leader of the Bosnian Serbs was found guilty for horrible things he did during a war, including hurting and killing lots of people, and a court decided he had to spend 40 years in prison."},{"question":"Answer the following question: M: Yes.

Identify the main elements of the sentence and their equivalents in German. 2. Ensure proper grammar, including verb conjugation and noun gender, while maintaining sentence structure as close to the original as possible. 3. Ensure proper word order for German grammar. Translation: \\"Die kleine Pousada liegt etwa 35 km von der Lagoa Azul entfernt und verfügt über 5 bescheidene, saubere Zimmer mit Klimaanlage (keine asphaltierte Straße).\\" Step-by-step explanation: 1. I identified the main elements of the sentence and their German equivalents: - The small Pousada = Die kleine Pousada - is located = liegt - about 35 km away = etwa 35 km entfernt - from the Lagoa Azul = von der Lagoa Azul - 5 modest, clean rooms = 5 bescheidene, saubere Zimmer - with air conditioner = mit Klimaanlage - no asphalt street = keine asphaltierte Straße 2. I ensured proper grammar, including verb conjugation and noun gender: - \\"Pousada\\" is a loanword from Portuguese and as a new term in German, it can be considered a gender-neutral noun. - \\"Lagoa Azul\\" is a proper noun and therefore retains its original spelling but takes the appropriate article \\"der\\" in German. 3. Maintaining proper word order for German grammar, I structured the sentence as follows: - Moving \\"etwa 35 km entfernt\\" after \\"liegt\\" to maintain German word order, resulting in: \\"Die kleine Pousada liegt etwa 35 km entfernt...\\" - Maintaining the rest of the sentence structure to stay close to the original: \\"... von der Lagoa Azul, 5 bescheidene, saubere Zimmer mit Klimaanlage (keine asphaltierte Straße).\\""},{"question":"Sentence: \\"Wear it like that is what you do.\\" Would a linguist rate this sentence to be acceptable linguistically?

In other words, for something to be considered reliable, it must be both accurate and trustworthy. Step 2: Consider the connection between the premise and the hypothesis The hypothesis suggests that everyone desires the highest level of reliability in their results. In the context of the premise, this means that people would want their data to be as accurate and trustworthy as possible. Step 3: Evaluate whether the premise entails the hypothesis Entailment requires a necessary logical connection between the premise and the hypothesis, meaning if the premise is true, the hypothesis must also be true. While the premise indicates the importance of reliability, it does not necessarily imply that 'everyone' wants their results as reliable as possible. Step 4: Conclusion Although the premise asserts the positive aspects of reliable data, it does not necessarily entail that \\"Everybody wants their results to be as reliable as possible.\\" While it is reasonable to assume that many people may indeed want reliable results, the premise itself does not guarantee that everyone has this desire.

While that information circulated within the FAA, we found no evidence that the hijacking was reported to any other agency in Washington before 8:46. Most federal agencies learned about the crash in New York from CNN. Within the FAA, the administrator, Jane Garvey, and her acting deputy, Monte Belger, had not been told of a confirmed hijacking before they learned from television that a plane had crashed. Others in the agency were aware of it, as we explained earlier in this chapter. Inside the National Military Command Center, the deputy director of operations and his assistant began notifying senior Pentagon officials of the incident. At about 9:00, the senior NMCC operations officer reached out to the FAA operations center for information. Although the NMCC was advised of the hijacking of American 11, the scrambling of jets was not discussed. In Sarasota, Florida, the presidential motorcade was arriving at the Emma E. Booker Elementary School, where President Bush was to read to a class and talk about education. White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card told us he was standing with the President outside the classroom when Senior Advisor to the President Karl Rove first informed them that a small, twin-engine plane had crashed into the World Trade Center. The President's reaction was that the incident must have been caused by pilot error. At 8:55, before entering the classroom, the President spoke to National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, who was at the White House. She recalled first telling the President it was a twin-engine aircraft-and then a commercial aircraft-that had struck the World Trade Center, adding \\"that's all we know right now, Mr. President.\\" At the White House, Vice President Dick Cheney had just sat down for a meeting when his assistant told him to turn on his television because a plane had struck the NorthTower of the World Trade Center.

A shortage of officers, following the capture of most of the professional French army at the Siege of Metz and at the Battle of Sedan, led naval officers to be sent from their ships to command hastily assembled reservists of the Garde Mobile. As the autumn storms of the North Sea forced the return of more of the French ships, the blockade of the north German ports diminished and in September 1870 the French navy abandoned the blockade for the winter. The rest of the navy retired to ports along the English Channel and remained in port for the rest of the war.\\"?

Find the speed of the train. Options: (A) 110 kmph (B) 120 kmph (C) 108 kmph (D) 100 kmph (E) 98 kmph Hmmm, my stream of consciousness:","response":"To find the speed of the train, we will first determine the length of the train and then use that information to calculate its speed. Follow the steps below: Step 1: Determine the length of the train The train takes 10 seconds to pass a pole. Since the entire length of the train passes the pole in this time, we can use this information to find the length of the train. Let's denote the length of the train as L_t and the speed of the train as V_t. The formula to calculate the distance traveled is: Distance = Speed × Time Therefore, the length of the train (L_t), in this case, can be denoted as: L_t = V_t × 10 seconds Step 2: Determine the time taken to cross the stationary train The train takes 30 seconds to cross a stationary train that is 600 meters long. When the moving train crosses the stationary train, it has to cover a distance equal to the sum of the lengths of both trains. So, the distance covered here will be the length of the train (L_t) plus 600 meters. Step 3: Calculate the speed of the train Now, we will use the distance covered while crossing the stationary train (L_t + 600 meters) and the time taken (30 seconds) to calculate the speed of the train (V_t). Using the distance formula again: Distance = Speed × Time => L_t + 600 meters = V_t × 30 seconds Since we know L_t = V_t × 10 seconds (from Step 1), we can substitute it in the equation: V_t × 10 seconds + 600 meters = V_t × 30 seconds => 600 meters = V_t × 20 seconds => V_t = 600 meters / 20 seconds => V_t = 30 meters/second Step 4: Convert the speed from meters/second to km/h To convert the speed from meters/second to km/h, we can use the following conversion: 1 meter/second = 3.6 km/h V_t = 30 meters/second × 3.6 km/h per meter/second V_t = 108 km/h So, the speed of the train is 108 km/h. The correct option is (C) 108 km/h."},{"question":"If \\"Girls singing at a talent show.\\" does that mean that \\"There are girls singing at a talent show.\\"?

I purchased this translation a few years ago and started in immediately. I am a graduate of a Christian college and so I have read, studied and know the Bible pretty well. My Study Bible has several reading options but require me to go back and forth between books and I thought this one would be easier because it has everything separated by dates.

'Ridiculous': Alfie Waine and his mother Emma Hardy were unimpressed by security staff at Leeds Bradford Airport who confiscated the five-year-old's toy weapons. Airport security staff seized a five-year-old's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle toys - because they look like imitation weapons. Staff at Leeds Bradford Airport confiscated the colourful toys - an eight inch plastic Leonardo sword, a Donatello staff and a silver light up laser handgun - when Alfie Waine went through security with his mother Emma Hardy. Workers at the West Yorkshire airport wouldn't let the youngster take the toys on a flight to Dublin in his mother's hand luggage as they breached security regulations. Ms Hardy, 31, said: 'It's ridiculous. They just need to think sensibly about this. 'The flight is not going to be held up by a five-year-old boy with a plastic sword - they need to assess the risk that they could pose.' The toys were taken from Ms Hardy's hand luggage after security scanners picked up a potted candle inside her bags and they were searched. She said: 'He was really upset as they're his favourite toys. He could see that his toys had been taken out of his suitcase and was asking where they were going. 'He was especially upset when we were told they were going in the bin. 'It's so silly. They're plastic toys and he's a five-year-old boy. 'If he had started waving them about on the plane - which he wouldn't because they would be in the suitcase - nobody is going to be frightened about that. 'A bit of common sense wouldn't go amiss. I'm all for security but you've got to assess what the risk is. I can't imagine how this is a risk to security.' Ms Hardy said that the airport should consider setting up a facility where people could leave such items to collect on their return or that they should donate items such as toys to charity. Not allowed: Security staff at the airport deemed Alfie's Leonardo sword was a breach of flight regulations. Taken: Alfie's Donatello sword was also confiscated by staff at Leeds Bradford Airport. Airport spokesman Andrew Shaw, said: 'We are directed through legislation that anything that looks like or replicates a firearm weapon must be confiscated. 'All passengers are given the option to take these items back to their car or post home. 'We confiscate a vast quantity of items and liquids in our daily operation and ultimately these items are disposed of by Leeds Bradford Airport.' Ms Hardy says that staff did not offer her the option of taking the toys back to the car and that she would have done this had she been told she could do that. The airport's website includes a list of items prohibited on flights. As well as toy or replica guns, restricted items also include razor blades, disposable lighters, scissors with a bladed length of six centimetres or over and safety pins. Snooker and pool cues, some umbrellas and household cutlery are also banned.

His biggest challenge was logistics, since neither Congress nor the states had the funding to provide adequately for the equipment, munitions, clothing, paychecks, or even the food supply of the soldiers. As a battlefield tactician Washington was often outmaneuvered by his British counterparts. As a strategist, however, he had a better idea of how to win the war than they did. The British sent four invasion armies. Washington's strategy forced the first army out of Boston in 1776, and was responsible for the surrender of the second and third armies at Saratoga (1777) and Yorktown (1781). He limited the British control to New York and a few places while keeping Patriot control of the great majority of the population. The Loyalists, on whom the British had relied too heavily, comprised about 20% of the population but never were well organized. As the war ended, Washington watched proudly as the final British army quietly sailed out of New York City in November 1783, taking the Loyalist leadership with them.

After having used it for a couple of weeks, I can't help but feel a little underwhelmed. I hate to leave a 2-star rating, but I believe there's a lot this app can improve on. On a positive note, the concept of the app is great and has the potential to be a must-have app for scorekeeping. It's user-friendly and the main function – keeping score – worked without any hiccups. The simple and clean design also appealed to my minimalist taste. However, the customization options were quite disappointing. The app could greatly benefit from additional features such as custom backgrounds, different fonts, and the ability to add player pictures, especially for those who play in teams or groups regularly. While the app worked fine initially, I encountered a few crashes when trying to access my saved scores. These crashes are pretty frustrating, and I hope that the developer can address this issue in their upcoming updates. Lastly, the ad placements within the app feel a bit intrusive. I understand the importance of generating revenue for the developer, but I would feel more comfortable paying for an ad-free version since I tend to use the app quite often. In conclusion, KeepScore has the potential to be a valuable app for scorekeeping. However, due to a few drawbacks such as limited customization options, app crashes, and invasive ad placements, I could not rate it higher than 2 stars. If updates are made to improve these issues, I'm more than happy to give a higher rating and consider recommending it to others."},{"question":"Q:Generate a question that has the following answer: YES for the following movie plot: Howard Hallenbeck (David Dukes) is an American professor who travels to Ireland to research items of religious significance.

By the 18th century, the menagerie was open to the public; admission cost three half-pence or the supply of a cat or dog to be fed to the lions. By the end of the century, that had increased to 9 pence. A particularly famous inhabitant was Old Martin, a large grizzly bear given to George III by the Hudson's Bay Company in 1811. An 1800 inventory also listed a tiger, leopards, a hyena, a large baboon, various types of monkeys, wolves and \\"other animals\\". By 1822, however, the collection included only a grizzly bear, an elephant and some birds. Additional animals were then introduced. In 1828 there were over 280 representing at least 60 species as the new keeper Alfred Copps was actively acquiring animals.After the death of George IV in 1830, a decision was made to close down the Menagerie. In 1831, most of the stock was moved to the London Zoo which had opened in 1828. The last of the animals left in 1835, relocated to Regent's Park. This decision was made after an incident, although sources vary as to the specifics: either a lion was accused of biting a soldier, or a sailor, Ensign Seymour, had been bitten by a monkey. The Menagerie buildings were removed in 1852 but the Keeper of the Royal Menagerie was entitled to use the Lion Tower as a house for life. Consequently, even though the animals had long since left the building, the tower was not demolished until the death of Copps, the last keeper, in 1853.In 1999, physical evidence of lion cages was found, one being 2x3 metres (6.5x10 feet) in size, very small for a lion that can grow to be 2.5 meters (approximately 8 feet) long. In 2008, the skulls of two male Barbary lions (now extinct in the wild) from northwest Africa were found in the moat area of the Tower. Radiocarbon tests dated them from 1280–1385 and 1420–1480.

Options: - heading east - run aground - near shore - list to port - party Answer:","response":"People would typically choose to go into a ship for a variety of reasons. However, among the provided options, the one that is most in line with common sense is \\"party.\\" A party is a social gathering where people come together to celebrate, have fun, and enjoy each other's company. Ships can offer a unique and great setting for hosting such events. People might be attracted to the idea of attending a party on a ship because it provides a distinct ambiance, beautiful views of the surrounding water, and a sense of adventure. Furthermore, ships can generally accommodate large groups of people, making them an excellent venue choice for various types of parties, such as birthdays, corporate events, and even weddings. Heading east, running aground, being near the shore, or listing to port are not reasons people would typically choose to go into a ship. These terms are related to the navigational and operational aspect of the ship, rather than the motivation behind people boarding it. Heading east refers to the direction in which the ship is sailing, which may or may not be relevant to the reason people enter the ship. It generally has nothing to do with a particular event or motivation for boarding. Running aground is a situation where a ship accidentally hits the bottom in shallow waters, causing it to get stuck. This is generally considered a negative occurrence, and people would not intentionally board a ship with the purpose of experiencing it. Being near the shore refers to the ship's proximity to the land. While the view of the shore can be appreciated by people on board, it does not represent a motive for people to enter the ship. Lastly, a list to port refers to the ship leaning to one side (the left side, in this case), which could be due to an uneven distribution of weight or other issues. This is also an unfavorable situation and not a reason for people to board a ship."},{"question":"How might one describe the sentiment of this review?

If their campaign succeeds, it could change the face of philanthropy. By Carol J. Loomis, senior editor-at-large FORTUNE -- Just over a year ago, in May 2009, word leaked to the press that the two richest men in America, Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, had organized and presided over a confidential dinner meeting of billionaires in New York City. David Rockefeller was said to have been a host, Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Oprah Winfrey to have been among those attending, and philanthropy to have been the main subject. Pushed by the press to explain, Buffett and Gates declined. But that certainly didn't dim the media's interest in reaching for descriptions of the meeting: The Chronicle of Philanthropy called it \\"unprecedented\\"; both ABC News and the Houston Chronicle went for \\"clandestine\\"; a New York magazine parody gleefully imagined George Soros to have been starstruck in the presence of Oprah. One radio broadcaster painted a dark picture: \\"Ladies and gentlemen, there's mischief afoot and it does not bode well for the rest of us.\\" No, no, rebutted the former CEO of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Patty Stonesifer, who had been at the meeting and had reluctantly emerged to combat the rumors. The event, she told the Seattle Times, was simply a group of friends and colleagues \\"discussing ideas\\" about philanthropy. And so it was. But that discussion -- to be fully described for the first time in this article -- has the potential to dramatically change the philanthropic behavior of Americans, inducing them to step up the amounts they give. With that dinner meeting, Gates and Buffett started what can be called the biggest fundraising drive in history. They'd welcome donors of any kind. But their direct target is billionaires, whom the two men wish to see greatly raise the amounts they give to charities, of any and all kinds. That wish was not mathematically framed at the time of the New York meeting. But as two other U.S. dinners were held (though not leaked), Buffett and Gates and his wife, Melinda, set the goal: They are driving to get the super-rich, starting with the Forbes list of the 400 wealthiest Americans, to pledge -- literally pledge -- at least 50% of their net worth to charity during their lifetimes or at death. Without a doubt, that plan could create a colossal jump in the dollars going to philanthropy, though of what size is a puzzle we'll get to. To begin with, a word about this article you are reading. It is the first public disclosure of what Buffett and Melinda and Bill Gates are trying to do. Over the past couple of months Fortune has interviewed the three principals as the project has unfolded, as well as a group of billionaires who have signed up to add their names to the Gates/Buffett campaign. In a sense this article is also an echo of two other Fortune stories, both featuring Buffett on the cover. The first, published in 1986, was \\"Should you leave it all to the children?\\" To that query, Buffett emphatically said no. The second article, \\"Warren Buffett gives it away,\\" which appeared in 2006, disclosed Buffett's intention to gradually give away his Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) fortune to five foundations, chief among them the world's largest, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. (For Buffett's thinking on the disposition of his wealth, see \\"My philanthropic pledge.\\") Since then, in four years of contributions, Buffett has given the foundation 6.4 billion, not counting the 2010 gift, to be made this summer. The foundation in turn has in that same period combined Buffett's money and its immense gifts from the Gateses to raise its level of giving to about 3 billion a year, much of it for world health. One small example: the Medicines for Malaria Venture, heavily funded by the Gates Foundation, has worked with pharmaceutical company Novartis (NVS) to develop good-tasting malaria pills and distribute them to millions of children -- the principal victims of the disease -- in 24 countries. Another fact about the 2006 Buffett article is that it was written by yours truly, Carol Loomis, a senior editor-at-large of Fortune. Besides that, I am a longtime friend of Buffett's and editor of his annual letter to Berkshire's shareholders. Through him, my husband, John Loomis, and I have also come to know Melinda and Bill Gates socially. The Loomis team has even occasionally played bridge against Warren and Bill. All that said, the question of what philanthropy might gain from the Gates/Buffett drive rests, at its outset, on a mystery: what the wealthiest Americans are giving now. Most of them aren't telling, and outsiders can't pierce the veil. For that matter, the Forbes 400 list, while a valiant try, is a best-guess estimate both as to the cast of characters and as to their net worth. (Buffett says he knows of two Berkshire shareholders who should be on the list but have been missed.) As Bill Gates sums it up, \\"The list is imprecise.\\" Those qualifiers noted, the magazine stated the 2009 net worth of the Forbes 400 to be around 1.2 trillion. So if those 400 were to give 50% of that net worth away during their lifetimes or at death, that would be 600 billion. You can think of that colossal amount as what the Buffett and Gates team is stalking -- at a minimum. Leaving aside the Forbes 400 and looking simply at Internal Revenue Service data for both annual giving and estate taxes, we can piece together a picture of how far the very rich might be from a figure like that 600 billion. Start with an admirable fact about Americans as a whole: The U.S. outdoes all other countries in philanthropic generosity, annually giving in the neighborhood of 300 billion. Some of that gets reported as charitable deductions on the tax filings made by individuals. But taxpayers at low income levels don't tend to itemize, taking the standard deduction instead. At higher income levels, charitable gift data begin to mean something. To take one example for 2007 (the latest data available), the 18,394 individual taxpayers having adjusted gross income of 10 million or more reported charitable gifts equal to about 32.8 billion, or 5.84% of their 562 billion in income. And billionaires? Here, the best picture -- though it's flawed -- emerges from statistics that the IRS has for almost two decades been releasing on each year's 400 largest individual taxpayers, a changing universe obviously. The decision of the government to track this particular number of citizens may or may not have been spurred by the annual publication of the Forbes list. In any case, the two 400 batches, though surely overlapping, cannot be identical -- for one reason because the IRS data deal with income, not net worth. The IRS facts for 2007 show that the 400 biggest taxpayers had a total adjusted income of 138 billion, and just over 11 billion was taken as a charitable deduction, a proportion of about 8%. The amount deducted, we need quickly to add, must be adjusted upward because it would have been limited for certain gifts, among them very large ones such as Buffett's 1.8 billion donation that year to the Gates Foundation. Even so, it is hard to imagine the 11 billion rising, by any means, to more than 15 billion. If we accept 15 billion as a reasonable estimate, that would mean that the 400 biggest taxpayers gave 11% of their income to charity -- just a bit more than tithing. Is it possible that annual giving misses the bigger picture? One could imagine that the very rich build their net worth during their lifetimes and then put large charitable bequests into their wills. Estate tax data, unfortunately, make hash of that scenario, as 2008 statistics show. The number of taxpayers making estate tax filings that year was 38,000, and these filers had gross estates totaling 229 billion. Four-fifths of those taxpayers made no charitable bequests at death. The 7,214 who did make bequests gave 28 billion. And that's only 12% of the 229 billion gross estate value posted by the entire 38,000. All told, the data suggest that there is a huge gap between what the very rich are giving now and what the Gateses and Buffett would like to suggest is appropriate -- that 50%, or better, of net worth. The question is how many people of wealth will buy their argument. The seminal event in this campaign was that billionaires' gathering in May 2009 -- the First Supper, if you will. The Gateses credit Buffett with the basic idea: that a small group of dedicated philanthropists be somehow assembled to discuss strategies for spreading the gospel to others. The Gateses proceeded to arrange the event. Bill Gates says, with a grin, \\"If you had to depend on Warren to organize this dinner, it might never have happened.\\" In his office, meanwhile, Buffett scrawled out a name for a new file, \\"Great Givers.\\" The first item filed was a copy of a March 4 letter that Buffett and Gates sent to the patriarch of philanthropy, David Rockefeller, to ask that he host the meeting. Rockefeller, now 95, told Fortune that the request was \\"a surprise but a pleasure.\\" As a site for the event, he picked the elegant and very private President's House at Rockefeller University in New York City, whose board he has been on for 70 years. He also tapped his son David Jr., 68, to go with him to the meeting. The event was scheduled for 3 p.m. on Tuesday, May 5 -- a day urgently desired by Bill Gates, who wanted to fit the meeting into a short U.S. break he'd be taking from a three-month European stay with his family. Because Melinda elected to remain in Europe with their three children, she did not attend the first dinner, but lined herself up for any that followed. (The Gateses have considered this campaign to be a personal matter for them, not in any way a project of the Gates Foundation.) Melinda also insisted from the start that both husbands and wives be invited to the dinners, sure that both would be important to any discussion. Her reasoning: \\"Even if he's the one that made the money, she's going to be a real gatekeeper. And she's got to go along with any philanthropic plan, because it affects her and it affects their kids.\\" The letter of invitation, dated March 24, went to more people than could come. But the hosts and guests who arrived on May 5 certainly had enough economic tickets to be there: a combined net worth of maybe 130 billion and a serious history of having depleted that amount by giving money to charity. Leaving aside the semi-observers, Patty Stonesifer and David Rockefeller Jr., there were 14 people present, starting with the senior Rockefeller, Buffett, and Gates. The local guests included Mayor Bloomberg; three Wall Streeters, \\"Pete\\" Peterson, Julian Robertson, and George Soros; and Charles \\"Chuck\\" Feeney, who made his money as a major owner of Duty Free Shoppers and has so far given away 5 billion through his foundations, called Atlantic Philanthropies. When Feeney was dropped from the Forbes 400 in 1997, the magazine explained his departure in words not often hauled out for use: \\"Gave bulk of holdings to charity.\\" The out-of-towners included Oprah, Ted Turner, and two California couples, Los Angeles philanthropists Eli and Edythe Broad, and Silicon Valley's John and Tashia Morgridge, whose fortune came from Cisco Systems (CSCO). Both the Broads and the Morgridges had equivocated over whether to accept the invitation, regarding the trip as an inconvenience. But there were the signatures at the bottom of the letter -- from left to right, Rockefeller, Gates, Buffett. \\"Impressive,\\" Eli Broad thought. So on the appointed day the Broads found themselves seated with everyone else around a big conference table, wondering what came next. They mainly got that message from Buffett, whose quick sense of humor left him playing, says David Rockefeller Jr., \\"the enlivener role.\\" He remembers Buffett as keeping the event from being \\"too somber\\" and \\"too self-congratulatory.\\" Buffett set the ball rolling by talking about philanthropy, describing the meeting as \\"exploratory,\\" and then asking each person, going around the table, to describe his or her philosophy of giving and how it had evolved. The result was 12 stories, each taking around 15 minutes, for a total of nearly three hours. But most participants whom Fortune has talked to found the stories riveting, even when they were familiar. David Rockefeller Sr. described learning philanthropy at the knees of his father and grandfather. Ted Turner repeated the oft-told tale of how he had made a spur-of-the-moment decision to give 1 billion to the United Nations. Some people talked about the emotional difficulty of making the leap from small giving to large. Others worried that their robust philanthropy might alienate their children. (Later, recalling the meeting, Buffett laughed that it had made him feel like a psychiatrist.) The charitable causes discussed in those stories covered the spectrum: education, again and again; culture; hospitals and health; the environment; public policy; the poor generally. Bill Gates, who found the whole event \\"amazing,\\" regarded the range of causes as admirable: \\"The diversity of American giving,\\" he says, \\"is part of its beauty.\\" At the dinner that followed, the conversation turned specifically to how giving by the rich could be increased. The ideas advanced included national recognition of great philanthropists (presidential medals, for example), or a film, or a philanthropy guidebook, or a conference of the rich. There was no talk of a pledge. Of the dinner, the junior Rockefeller says, \\"The most important thing my dad and I came away with was that increasing giving would take work by many in that room -- delicate, and probably prolonged, one-on-one work.\\" The dinner, of course, had its unexpected coda: the leak. The leaker, with little doubt, was Chuck Feeney, and the leakee was his longtime friend Niall O'Dowd, the New York publisher behind the grandly unknown IrishCentral.com. (Fortune did not succeed in reaching Feeney; of our account, O'Dowd said, \\"I can't confirm that.\\") On May 18, two weeks after the meeting, IrishCentral.com posted an article of 14 short paragraphs headlined \\"Secret meeting of world's richest people held in New York.\\"With that, the fame of the website spiked, as the rest of the press picked up the news and ran with it. The IrishCentral article exhibited some confusion about which Rockefeller starred at the dinner, or was even there, but otherwise provided the names of all the participants -- with the notable exception of Feeney, who apparently didn't realize he looked more conspicuous to the others by being left out. Feeney, however, appears to have been quoted anonymously in the piece, once as an \\"attendee\\" who thought Gates the most impressive speaker of the day, Turner the most outspoken (surprise!), and Buffett the most insistent on his agenda for change. In a second instance, Feeney was a good bet to have been the awed \\"participant\\" who extolled his fellow guests: \\"They were all there, the great and the good.\\" The main effect of the leak was to place a \\"cone of silence\\" -- that's a description from the Gates camp -- over everything that transpired in the giving campaign over the next year. But there was certainly action, including a few small dinners abroad. Bill and Melinda Gates hosted a dinner in London, and Bill held a few others in India and China. Raising the philanthropic bar in foreign countries is a special challenge: Dynastic wealth is widely taken for granted; tax laws do not commonly allow deductions for gifts to charity; a paucity of institutions and organizations ready for gifts makes knowing whom to give to just not that obvious. Nonetheless, were the Gateses and Buffett to succeed in their campaign in the U.S., they would probably take it overseas. But as last summer and fall progressed, Buffett and the Gateses did not even have a plan for how the campaign was to be structured. In this vacuum the idea of a pledge took hold and gained strength. It helped that more dinners were to be held. At them, says Melinda, the three principals would \\"float the pledge idea to see if it would fly.\\" There then occurred the second and third U.S. dinners, most of whose guests have not been publicly outed because of the cone of silence. Secrecy, a Gates spokesman says, is partly a bow to moguls who have been exposed to the philanthropic sales pitch but would be embarrassed to have been identified in case they chose not to step up to the challenge. In any event, the names of some of the participants are known. The noted philanthropists at the second dinner, held at the New York Public Library in November last year, included New York investment banker Kenneth Langone and his wife, Elaine, and H.F. \\"Gerry\\" Lenfest and his wife, Marguerite, from Philadelphia. Lenfest got rich when he sold his Pennsylvania cable television company to Comcast (CMCSA) in 2000, netting 1.2 billion for himself and his family. He promptly vowed that he would give most of it to charity in his lifetime. Now 80, he has so far meted out 800 million, a good part of it to schools he attended (Columbia Law School, Washington and Lee, Mercersburg Academy). Lenfest's favorite moment at the November dinner was Buffett's declaration that Marguerite Lenfest had put forward the best idea of the evening when she said that the rich should sit down, decide how much money they and their progeny need, and figure out what to do with the rest of it. Says Lenfest: \\"The value of Buffett and Gates is that they're going to make people sit down and think these things through.\\" The Third Supper, held in December in Menlo Park, Calif., at the Rosewood Sand Hill hotel, is known as the Bay Area dinner but drew from all over the state, including its entertainment precincts. In attendance were some veteran philanthropists, including venture capitalist John Doerr of Kleiner Perkins and his wife, Ann, and the Morgridges, who had selected the meeting site. This dinner was somewhat different from the other two, says Melinda Gates, because a few people there were relatively new to huge wealth and were still forming their opinions about giving. Talk went on for hours, so long that the beef being prepared for dinner became somewhat overcooked. This is reported to have dismayed Rosewood's management, which may have noticed that the crowd in the Dogwood room was worth having back. The dinner also brought out some of the fears that people have about philanthropy. What does going public with big gifts do to the peace in your life? Won't pleas from charities be unending? How do you deal with giving internationally, which too often seems like throwing money down a hole? These are valid concerns, say the Gateses, the kind raised by people who want to feel as smart about giving as they were about making their money. But the questions didn't stop the two from plugging the satisfactions of philanthropy. At those dinners, says Bill, \\"no one ever said to me, 'We gave more than we should have.'\\" Nor did the idea of a pledge get shot down at those dinners. It \\"floated\\" nicely, in other words. So as 2010 arrived, a pledge became the strategy. The idea of aiming for a 50% slice of net worth was pragmatically pulled from the sky, being less than the principals would have liked to ask for but perhaps as much, at least initially, as they can get. The pledges, meanwhile, were never envisioned as legal contracts but rather moral obligations to be both memorialized in writing and taken very seriously. They are in fact to be posted on a new website, givingpledge.org, whose construction Melinda Gates oversaw. The 99% pledge that Buffett is making is likely to be the No. 1 document on the website, if he is not beaten out by his Seattle friends. Enthusiastic about leading the search for Great Givers, the Gateses and Buffett nonetheless have wanted a phalanx of strong supporters. Already committed to at least a 50% pledge are the Broads, the Doerrs, the Lenfests, and the Morgridges. With the online publication of this article, moreover, the three principals will send e-mails and make calls to other billionaires judged likely prospects. A bit later, all of the pledgers may join in sending a letter to a large number of other billionaires, asking them to join the growing crowd. In the fall there may even be a Great Givers conference. The definition of success in this venture may take years to figure out, but each of the principals has reflections about the matter. Buffett knows that everyone rich has thought about what to do with his or her money: \\"They may not have reached a decision about that, but they have for sure thought about it. The pledge that we're asking them to make will put them to thinking about the whole issue again.\\" He warns, most of all, against the rich delaying the decision of what to do with their money: \\"If they wait until they're making a final will in their nineties, the chance of their brainpower and willpower being better than they are today is nil.\\" Bill Gates regards the 50% as a \\"low bar\\" encouraging high participation. People, he thinks, may be drawn in by that proportion and then surprise themselves and find they are giving at higher levels. \\"This is about moving to a different realm,\\" he thinks, and it will take time for everything to sort out. Melinda Gates separates the near-term from the far. There are so many reasons that rich people don't give, she says: They don't want to plan for their death; they worry that they'll need to hire someone to help with the work; they just don't want to take the time to think about it all. So the initial goal of the pledge campaign, she thinks, must be simply to cut through that and get them moving in the direction of giving. And eventually? \\"Three to five years down the road, we need to have a significant number of billionaires signed up. That would be success.\\" Society cannot help but be a beneficiary here, by virtue of at least some dollars and perhaps many. Nor will it be just the very rich who will perhaps bend their minds to what a pledge of this kind means. It could also be others with less to give but suddenly more reason to think about the rightness of what they do.

To elaborate, this process describes a method of desalination or water purification known as distillation. Here's a brief overview of the entire process: 1. Water is heated: The water, which may be impure or have dissolved salts, is heated until it reaches its boiling point. 2. The heated water evaporates: As the water heats up, it transforms into water vapor, leaving the salts and impurities behind. 3. The salt is left behind: The dissolved salt remains in the container as solid particles since it doesn't evaporate with the water. 4. The evaporated water condenses on a cold surface: The water vapor comes into contact with a cold surface, causing it to convert back into its liquid state—this is called condensation. 5. The evaporated water is collected: The condensed water, now free from impurities, is collected separately from the leftover salts. 6.

It is one of the core concepts in archaeology, the academic discipline concerned with documenting and interpreting the archaeological record. Archaeological theory is used to interpret the archaeological record for a better understanding of human cultures. The archaeological record can consist of the earliest ancient findings as well as contemporary artifacts. Human activity has had a large impact on the archaeological record. Destructive human processes, such as agriculture and land development, may damage or destroy potential archaeological sites. Other threats to the archaeological record include natural phenomena and scavenging. Archaeology can be a destructive science for the finite resources of the archaeological record are lost to excavation. Therefore archaeologists limit the amount of excavation that they do at each site and keep meticulous records of what is found. The archaeological record is the record of human history, of why civilizations prosper or fail and why cultures change and grow. It is the story of the world that humans have created. - Uummannaq Fjord is a large fjord system in the northern part of western Greenland, the largest after Kangertittivaq fjord in eastern Greenland. It has a roughly south-east to west-north-west orientation, emptying into the Baffin Bay in the northwest. - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän. - Inuit (pronounced or ; Inuktitut: , \\"the people\\") are a group of culturally similar indigenous peoples inhabiting the Arctic regions of Greenland, Canada and Alaska. Inuit is a plural noun; the singular is Inuk. The oral Inuit languages are classified in the Eskimo-Aleut family.

With 1,282 inhabitants in 2013, it is the eleventh-largest town in Greenland, and is home to the country's most northerly ferry terminal. Founded in 1763 as Ûmañak, the town is a hunting and fishing base, with a canning factory and a marble quarry.

Formally a settlement , it is famous for the discovery of eight mummified bodies in 1972 . Four of the mummies are currently on display in the Greenland National Museum . - Archaeology, or archeology, is the study of human activity through the recovery and analysis of material culture. The archaeological record consists of artifacts, architecture, biofacts or ecofacts, and cultural landscapes. Archaeology can be considered both a social science and a branch of the humanities. In North America, archaeology is considered a sub-field of anthropology, while in Europe archaeology is often viewed as either a discipline in its own right or a sub-field of other disciplines. - Geologically, a fjord or fiord is a long, narrow inlet with steep sides or cliffs, created by glacial erosion. There are many fjords on the coasts of Alaska, British Columbia, Chile, Greenland, Iceland, the Kerguelen Islands, New Zealand, Norway, Novaya Zemlya, Labrador, Nunavut, Newfoundland, Scotland, and Washington state. Norway's coastline is estimated at with fjords, but only when fjords are excluded. - Greenland is an autonomous constituent country within the Danish Realm between the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, east of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Though physiographically a part of the continent of North America, Greenland has been politically and culturally associated with Europe (specifically Norway and Denmark, the colonial powers, as well as the nearby island of Iceland) for more than a millennium.

Reykjavík and the surrounding areas in the southwest of the country are home to over two-thirds of the population. Iceland is volcanically and geologically active. The interior consists of a plateau characterised by sand and lava fields, mountains and glaciers, while many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands. Iceland is warmed by the Gulf Stream and has a temperate climate, despite a high latitude just outside the Arctic Circle. Its high latitude and marine influence still keeps summers chilly, with most of the archipelago having a tundra climate. - An archaeological site is a place (or group of physical sites) in which evidence of past activity is preserved (either prehistoric or historic or contemporary), and which has been, or may be, investigated using the discipline of archaeology and represents a part of the archaeological record.

It is connected to the Atlantic via Davis Strait and the Labrador Sea. The narrower Nares Strait connects Baffin Bay with the Arctic Ocean. The bay is not navigable most of the year because of the ice cover and high density of floating ice and icebergs in the open areas. However, a polynya of about , known as the North Water, opens in summer on the north near Smith Sound. Most of the aquatic life of the bay is concentrated near that region. Extent. The International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of Baffin Bay as follows: History. The area of the bay has been inhabited since . Around 1200, the initial Dorset settlers were replaced by the Thule (the later Inuit) peoples. Recent excavations also suggest that the Norse colonization of the Americas reached the shores of Baffin Bay sometime between the 10th and 14th centuries. The English explorer John Davis was the first recorded European to enter the bay, arriving in 1585. In 1612, a group of English merchants formed the \\"Company of Merchants of London, Discoverers of the North-West Passage\\". Their governor Thomas Smythe organized five expeditions to explore the northern coasts of Canada in search of a maritime passage to the Far East. Henry Hudson and Thomas Button's explored Hudson Bay, William Gibbons Labrador, and Robert Bylot Hudson Strait and the area which became known as Baffin's Bay after his pilot William Baffin. Aboard the \\"Discovery\\", Baffin charted the area and named Lancaster, Smith, and Jones Sounds after members of his company. By the completion of his 1616 voyage, Baffin held out no hope of an ice-free passage and the area remained unexplored for another two centuries.

A:","response":"The woodcutter and the commoner were talking in the ruins of the Rashomon gatehouse in the movie titled \\"Rashomon\\". Here, they were taking shelter from a rainstorm. This location provided them a setting where they could relay and evaluate the horrifying story they had just heard at the murder enquiry. The story had such a significant impact on both of them that it had deeply disturbed the priest, who claimed he had never heard a story as horrifying. And it left the woodcutter feeling thoroughly confounded, so much so that he sought the commoner's perspectives to make sense of it. The film thus uses this setting at the gatehouse not only as a physical space for their interactions but also as a platform for discussing the perplexing narrative that forms the backbone of the movie's plot. The Rashomon gatehouse, even being in ruins, becomes a significant character in the movie. It becomes the site where three perspectives or interpretations of a terrible crime are shared and discussed. The characters who are to a certain extent sheltered from the rainstorm, are however exposed to the psychological storm stirred up by the horrific incident recounted. As they seek physical shelter, their minds are far from peace, as they engage in deciphering the mystery. Yet the gatehouse in ruins also symbolizes the dilemmas and contradictions that the characters face. While it offers them protection from the physical rainstorm, it is where they expose themselves to the disturbing and baffling narrative about a murder. The ruined state of the gatehouse metaphorically mirrors the tumultuous state of the characters' minds in trying to piece together a coherent story and figuring out truths from the testimonies concerning the murder. Therefore, the setting of the woodcutter and the commoner conversing in the ruins of the Rashomon gatehouse significantly contributes to the plot development in \\"Rashomon\\". It frames a space for the exposition of confusing and overlapping human accounts of a distressing event, wherein the notion of truth gets questioned and ambiguities loom large. Even in its desolate state, the gatehouse creates a dynamic where characters connect, contemplate, and confront each other's version of truth regarding the murder mystery. Hence, their conversation at this location becomes a pivotal element in the movie, raveling and unraveling the plot, while subtly underscoring the relative nature of truth and the inherent complexities of human perspectives."},{"question":"Answer a question about this article: Major European rivers flow from Switzerland, such as the Rhine, the Rhone, the Inn, the Ticino and the Po, all of which have headwaters in the Alps and flow into neighbouring countries, finally emptying into the North Sea, the Mediterranean Sea, the Adriatic Sea and the Black Sea.

The knifeman reportedly shouted \\"this is for Syria\\". A man was arrested after being Tasered by police. One man suffered serious knife injuries while two others received minor injuries. Metropolitan Police counter-terrorism detectives are investigating the case. Downing Street said it was monitoring the situation closely. The Met said the suspect was reportedly threatening other people with a knife. Fellow passengers reportedly shouted at the man to drop his weapon and one person shouted \\"You ain't no Muslim bruv,\\" a sentiment which has been picked up on social media by people trying to disown and sideline the attacker. Another witness told the BBC he saw a man holding a knife, about 3in (7.5cm) long, standing over another man who was lying on the ground, and people running out of the Central Line station. Witness Michael Garcia, 24, a financial analyst from Leytonstone, said he was walking along an underground passage that runs through the station when he saw people running outside. \\"I realised it wasn't a fight but something more sinister,\\" he said. He then saw \\"a guy, an adult, lying on the floor with a guy standing next to him brandishing a knife of about three inches... maybe a hobby knife\\". \\"It had a thin blade, but looked fairly long,\\" Mr Garcia said. \\"He was screaming 'go on, then, run' to everyone else.

Salim Patel, who works at a shop in the Tube station, said: \\"People just wanted the attacker to stop it, but then he took the knife out and used it on the victim. \\"Everybody left the concourse and the attacker was using the knife on his body then he came out of [the] barrier and the people who were nearby the subway ran off.\\" He said he had been on the phone at the time to the police and said the attacker left the station and then returned. Commander Richard Walton, who leads the Met's Counter-Terrorism Command, said: \\"We are treating this as a terrorist incident. I would urge the public to remain calm, but alert and vigilant. \\"The threat from terrorism remains at severe, which means that a terrorist attack is highly likely. \\"I would appeal to anyone who was in the vicinity of Leytonstone underground station earlier this evening at around 7pm who saw anything suspicious to call the anti-terror hotline on 0800 789 321.\\" He also urged anyone who took any photos or video of the incident to call that number. A spokesman for the mayor of London said: \\"The incident, and the swift and professional response of the officers involved, reminds us of the dangers faced by the police every single day in their efforts to protect Londoners and keep the city safe.\\" A spokeswoman for 10 Downing Street said: \\"There is an ongoing police investigation into the attack in London. We are monitoring the situation closely as further details emerge.\\" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn wrote on Twitter: \\"The stabbing in Leytonstone is absolutely shocking. My thoughts are with the victim and his family.\\" Tim Farron, leader of the Liberal Democrats, tweeted the attack \\"was an act of pure evil\\". Iain Duncan Smith, Conservative MP for nearby Chingford and Woodford Green, told the Andrew Marr show: \\"We cannot let these sort of people, terrorist etc, actually dominate our space.\\" He urged people to carry on going about their business as normal to ensure our freedoms are not \\"curtailed\\".

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which scientist read less about aphid honeydew? A:","response":"Given the information provided, Ellie is the scientist who read less about aphid honeydew. In the paragraph, it is mentioned that Pam and Ellie are both entomologists studying ants. However, they are focusing on different types of ants and their behaviors. Ellie is studying leafcutter ants, which are known for their ability to cut and carry leaves to their nests where they cultivate fungus to eat. Leafcutter ants do not engage with aphids and have no direct connection with aphid honeydew. On the other hand, Pam is studying ants that farm aphids. These ants are known to protect aphids and, in return, get honeydew—a sugary substance produced by aphids—as food. Since these ants have a symbiotic relationship with aphids, it is highly likely that Pam has read more about aphid honeydew as part of her research.

The distance decay effect states that the interaction between two locales declines as the distance between them increases. Once the distance is outside of the two locales' activity space, their interactions begin to decrease. With the advent of faster travel, distance has less effect than it did in the past, except where places previously connected by now-abandoned railways, for example, have fallen off the beaten path. Advances in communications technology, such as telegraphs, telephones, broadcasting, and internet, have further decreased the effects of distance.[1] Wade county was situated to the east of Gray county. Due to afavorable landscape, Wade county built more roads and railways. Which county would develop socially more in the future?

A: Another order, the Teutonic Knights, although originally founded in the crusader states, focused much of its activity in the Baltic after 1225, and in 1309 moved its headquarters to Marienburg in Prussia. Does the answer correctly answer the question","response":"A: The Teutonic Order was headquartered at Marienburg (modern-day Malbork, Poland) in 1309. The Teutonic Knights, also known as the Order of Brothers of the German House of Saint Mary in Jerusalem, was a Catholic military order founded during the late 12th century in the context of the Crusades. Initially, the order was active in the Holy Land; however, they gradually refocused their efforts on the Baltic region. In the early 13th century, the Teutonic Knights were invited to support a military campaign to convert and subdue the pagan peoples in the Baltic area. This invitation came from Duke Konrad I of Masovia, who requested assistance against the pagan Prussians. As a result of their efforts, the Teutonic Knights began a process of territorial expansion, establishing their rule in parts of present-day Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. During this period, the Teutonic Order established numerous strongholds and castles, which were used as regional administrative centers and military bases. By 1309, the order had grown substantially and needed a new central seat of power. It was at this time that they chose Marienburg as their headquarters. Marienburg was chosen primarily due to its strategic location and impressive fortifications. The castle itself, now known as Malbork Castle, was built by the Teutonic Knights along the banks of the Nogat River. The castle was strategically situated on trade routes and offered easy access to the Baltic Sea, which was essential for the order's military and economic activities. The castle complex was continuously expanded and fortified throughout its history. The choice of Marienburg as the Teutonic Order's headquarters in 1309 marked a significant shift in the order's focus from the Holy Land to the Baltic region. The Teutonic Knights remained a powerful military, political, and religious institution in the Baltic lands until their decline in the 15th century, eventually being secularized and incorporated into the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and other regional states. Today, Malbork Castle remains as a significant historic site and a UNESCO World Heritage Site, preserving the legacy and history of the medieval Teutonic Order."},{"question":"Given the question: Information: - Paul Dupuy , History Lecturer at the Ecole Normale , published in 1896 the first scientific biography of the mathematician Évariste Galois , titled \`\` La vie d'Évariste Galois '' . - Évariste Galois (25 October 1811 31 May 1832) was a French mathematician born in Bourg-la-Reine.

We at Technoholik got exclusive access to Aadhar's technology centre in Bangalore to figure out whats happening under the hood.The tech can broadly be divided into three areas ie. enrollment, data centre and authentication.The UIDAI will partner with a number of agencies ranging from district collectors' offices to banks as \\"enrollment partners\\" who will be tasked with collecting data.These partners will receive a slick-looking pair of tough briefcases containing neatly packed hardware required for enrollment. A laptop with the Aadhar enrollment software installed along with a fingerprint reader and an iris scanner go into one briefcase while a webcam, a laser printer (for the receipt) and a small monitor fit into the other one. That last bit of hardware is an innovative touch because it's meant purely for the person getting enrolled to verify that the data being entered into the laptop is accurate.While Aadhar may be collaborative in its approach to enrollment, it's taking no chances with its central servers and whats being stored in them. The data centres themselves will be built and maintained by vendors, but access will be strictly controlled solely by the UIDAI at multiple levels. No data can leave the enrollment laptops unencrypted and any attempt to tamper or modify the data will raise an alarm when it is uploaded to the central server. Only once it is validated as being secure will it be accepted for further processing.Then comes the tricky part called \\"de-duplication\\" ie. checking to see if the person has not already enrolled which means comparing his biometric data (iris and ten fingerprints) to that of all the existing IDs. This will require enormous computing power and although Aadhar will have a large \\"grid\\" of networked computers, built using open-source technologies to do these \\"compute jobs\\" , building this grid as the volume grows will be the challenge.Complex algorithms to quickly compare biometrics have also been procured from specialist vendors to be run on this grid. \\"It has never been tried before, so it's the first time and Indians are attempting to do it with the next largest system only about 1/10th the size\\" , says Dr Pramod Varma, chief architect, Aadhar.\\"Once the data comes into the CIDR it never leaves, its like a blackhole\\" , quips Dr Varma. What he means is that in order to protect citizens' privacy, no data will actually leave the Aadhar servers.Outsiders can only \\"query\\" the database for a yes/ no answer to authenticate someone who is quoting an ID, but cannot extract any other information. The authentication API (application programming interface) is publicly available on the Aadhar website, which means any programmer can build this querying ability into a software application in the future. ||||| India's vaunted tech savvy is being put to the test this week as the country embarks on a daunting mission: assigning a unique 12-digit number to each of its 1.2 billion people. The project, which seeks to collect fingerprint and iris scans from all residents and store them in a massive central database of unique IDs, is considered by many specialists the most technologically and logistically complex national identification effort ever attempted. To pull it off, India has recruited tech gurus of Indian origin from around the world, including the co-founder of online photo service Snapfish and employees from Google Inc., Yahoo Inc. and Intel Corp. The country's leaders are pinning their hopes on the program to solve development problems that have persisted despite fast economic growth. They say unique ID numbers will help ensure that government welfare spending reaches the right people, and will allow hundreds of millions of poor Indians to access services like banking for the first time. Critics question whether the project can have as big an impact as its backers promise, given that identity fraud is but one contributor to India's development struggles. Civil-liberties groups say the government is collecting too much personal information without sufficient safeguards. The technology requires transferring large amounts of data between the hinterland and an urban database, leading some to question whether the system will succumb to India's rickety Internet infrastructure. An ambitious national ID program in India is using sophisticated biometric technology to register the country's 1.2 billion citizens. WSJ's Amol Sharma reports. The sign-up effort is already under way in a handful of districts, and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is expected to kick off nationwide enrollment Wednesday. The government hopes to issue the first 100 million unique ID numbers by March and 600 million within four years. The undertaking is the latest chance for India to show it can pull off a massive project after what is widely viewed as its mishandling of next week's Commonwealth Games in New Delhi, where infrastructure and hygiene issues led some nations to threaten withdrawing. To lead the program, Mr. Singh picked Nandan Nilekani, former CEO of Infosys Technologies Ltd., which helped pioneer India's low-cost offshore model of technology services. A native of Bangalore, India's tech hub, and son of a textile-mill manager, the 55-year-old billionaire is trying to infuse some of Infosys's efficiency into a lumbering bureaucracy. \\"You have a whole mass of people who are shut out of society,\\" Mr. Nilekani says. \\"A lack of identity is a big source of exclusion. You're giving them a key to social services.\\" In one early registration drive in Nagaram, a village 30 miles outside the southern city of Hyderabad in Andhra Pradesh state, dozens of people were streaming into a drab government office one recent afternoon to have their fingerprints taken and irises scanned. Many applicants, who ranged from vegetable and rice farmers to real-estate brokers and shopkeepers, had never used a computer much less seen biometric equipment. Local officials had knocked on their doors the night before to tell them about the program. Salekula Anjaiah, a 44-year-old farmer who earns about 40 per month for his family of five, said he hoped the IDs would keep people from cheating the welfare system and getting food rations they don't qualify for. \\"It will take fraud out of the government schemes,\\" said Mr. Anjaiah, who relies on subsidies to feed his family. \\"Then it will be guaranteed I get what I deserve.\\" India has been attempting to improve governance through technology for two decades. Programs have digitized land records, created Web portals for government agencies and computerized tax filing systems. But the unique ID program, dubbed \\"Aadhaar,\\" or \\"foundation\\" in Hindi, is by far the largest and most ambitious effort. Many countries have some form of national ID and a handful use biometrics, but none come close to matching the scale of what India is attempting. Mr. Nilekani started recruiting Indians in the global technology industry in the summer of 2009. These early recruits included Srikanth Nadhamuni, who had spent 16 years as a technology engineer for companies like Sun Microsystems and Intel. Word spread in Silicon Valley that Mr. Nilekani wanted help, and by the fall a few others arrived in Bangalore. The team rented an apartment at a gated community on the eastern outskirts of the city to use as an office. Everyone worked for free. The group worked in the living room. They bought a few tables, two whiteboards and some markers. For food, they went to Mr. Nadhamuni's house nearby, where his wife served rice cakes, lentil crepes and lemon rice. Visitors had to use a wooden shoe rack as a bench since there weren't enough chairs. The team came up with a plan to capture a mix of biometric information—digital photos, fingerprints and iris scans—as well as names, addresses, genders and dates of birth. Since they knew they wouldn't have a second chance to collect the data, the engineers say they erred on getting too much information, including all 10 fingerprints instead of just one. The government would issue the random 12-digit numbers by mail. Passports, driver's licenses, ration cards and government health-insurance cards could either have the numbers printed on them or embedded electronically. Enlarge Image Close Bloomberg News Project head Nandan Nilekani says 'a lack of identity is a big source of exclusion' in India today. That still left a major hurdle: How to verify that a number and a person actually match? Retailers, like banks and cell-phone companies, could install fingerprint readers and match the data over the Internet. But getting readers and Internet access to the 500,000, often remote locations where subsidized food is distributed to the poor would be costly and impractical. The Indian government is expected to spend as much as 250 billion over five years on programs aimed at the poor, including subsidies for food, diesel, fertilizer and jobs. But 40% of the benefits, as the system now stands, will go to the wrong people or to \\"ghosts\\" with fake identification papers, according to a report by brokerage firm CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets. Today's ration cards, for example, are issued on paper, and are relatively easy to forge or doctor. India Real Time Who's Who in Nilekani's UID Dream Team In November 2009, Mr. Nilekani wrote to tech companies such as Intel, Google, Oracle Corp. and Yahoo, asking them to send Indian-origin engineers to contribute to the cause, either on paid sabbatical or as volunteers. More than 20 people joined the effort. The government has approved about 670 million for the project so far, and the entire cost will likely be \\"several billion dollars,\\" says Mr. Nilekani. By early this year, the Bangalore team moved into a real office at a technology park. Mr. Nilekani became a traveling salesman for the project, taking a PowerPoint presentation on the road and making the case for unique IDs with government agencies and regulators across the country. In his pitch, Mr. Nilekani focused in part on reducing fraud, but also on the potential for bringing into the financial system the roughly two-thirds of Indian adults who don't have bank accounts. The poor often have few or no documents to prove who they are or where they live. The unique ID would solve that problem, says Mr. Nilekani, and could be linked to banks' plans to offer \\"no-frills\\" accounts, with no minimum balance and low fees, as well as nascent money-transfer services via mobile phones. Scanning the World India's unique ID program is the largest and most logistically challenging identification project in the world. A look at other such schemes. Germany Now issues paper ID cards, but plans to replace with electronic cards embedded with fingerprints and a six-digit PIN number that can be used to digitally sign forms. Nigeria Creating a national database with biometric data on citizens. Government hopes that 100 million out of 150 million Nigerians will be issued a unique ID card in three years. Bosnia-Herzegovina National ID cards were issued in 2002, partly to encourage unity following ethnic strife. The technology involves a bar code, a single fingerprint and a photograph. About 2.5 million IDs had been issued as of May. Malaysia Smart cards hold personal data and a thumbprint, and can be used to pay road tolls and access ATM machines. Oman One objective of smart-card program is to track immigrants, including workers from Pakistan, Iran, India and elsewhere. U.S. The US-VISIT program collects digital fingerprints and photos from foreign travelers as a way to keep immigration violators and criminals from entering the country. It has over 100 million records. Source: CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets; WSJ Research In the village of Nagaram, officials say they have been signing up 200 people per day, and as of early September, had made it through half of the 4,500 residents. The goal is for hundreds of villages and towns in Andhra Pradesh to start enrollment soon, and to reach 30 million people state-wide by the end of the year. Signing up is technically voluntary, but any government agency or company will be allowed to require a unique ID as identity proof, an approach critics say amounts to a de facto mandate for people to enroll. The process is slow going, taking anywhere from 15 to 30 minutes per person. Capturing iris scans with binocular-like devices is tricky and can take several minutes. Administrators had to hold one elderly man's eyelids open to get a good image. In addition to biometrics, residents provided an array of personal information, including their caste, religion and cellphone number. State agencies and companies who register people can gather whatever information they deem appropriate. Such vast data gathering rankles privacy advocates who say demographic details can potentially be used to discriminate in the services that companies offer customers or government agencies offer citizens. Another concern is that marketers will find ways to build profiles of people based on how they use their IDs—tracking where people bank, which hospitals they have checked into and who their cellphone providers are, for example. \\"You will basically be creating these wonderful resources for people to mine,\\" says Sudhir Krishnaswamy, a law professor at the National University of Juridical Sciences in Kolkata. Mr. Nilekani says he has drafted legislation to address the concerns of critics. Under the bill, which has been approved by India's cabinet but must still be passed by parliament, the government would have to ensure that the information it collects \\"is secured and protected against any loss or unauthorized access.\\" Anyone who discloses private information or hacks into the ID database would face up to three years in prison and stiff fines. Mr. Nilekani said India also needs a broader privacy law. Andhra Pradesh officials say early data already show how unique IDs could reduce corruption at the state's 43,000 ration shops, which distribute subsidized food to the poor. At one shop, records showed rations were being delivered to 330 families, but after the IDs were rolled out, only 203 families claimed benefits by placing their finger on a scanner at the shop. State officials suspect the shop owner had been making up fake accounts to divert some of the food into the black market. Jejjayila Venkatesh, a 35-year-old Nagaram resident who earns 50 a month in a local government job, said he isn't concerned about privacy. He just hopes the ID will help him open a bank account and get a driver's license, which he has had difficulty obtaining thus far, and maintain his benefits when he goes out of state for work: \\"This will help me prove my identity wherever I roam.\\" —Vibhuti Agarwal contributed to this article.

However, it can be interpreted metaphorically, such as paying for a pleasant experience or service that brings a smile to someone's face. So while it may not be entirely nonsensical, it requires a metaphorical understanding. Sentence B: \\"We bought a tiger.\\" This sentence is more logically coherent. Tigers can be bought as animals, albeit in very specific and unusual circumstances, such as being purchased by a zoo, animal sanctuary, or a private owner with the necessary permits and resources.

Usually a party leader retains the leadership until a successor is formally chosen however, in some situations this is not possible, and an interim leader is thus appointed by the party's caucus or the party executive. An interim leader may also be appointed while a leader is on a leave of absence due to poor health or some other reason, and then relinquish the position upon the leader's return. - Jean Pelletier, (February 21, 1935 January 10, 2009) was a Canadian politician, who served as the 37th mayor of Quebec City, Chief of Staff in the Prime Minister's Office, and chairman of Via Rail.

It has a distinct four-season continental climate with warm to hot summers and cold snowy winters. - Common law (also known as case law or precedent) is law developed by judges, courts, and similar tribunals, stated in decisions that nominally decide individual cases but that in addition have precedential effect on future cases. Common law is a third branch of law, in contrast to and on equal footing with statutes which are adopted through the legislative process, and regulations which are promulgated by the executive branch. In cases where the parties disagree on what the law is, a common law court looks to past precedential decisions of relevant courts. If a similar dispute has been resolved in the past, the court is usually bound to follow the reasoning used in the prior decision (a principle known as \\"stare decisis\\"). If, however, the court finds that the current dispute is fundamentally distinct from all previous cases (called a \\"matter of first impression\\"), judges have the authority and duty to resolve the issue (one party or the other has to win, and on disagreements of law, judges make that decision). Resolution of the issue in one case becomes precedent that binds future courts. \\"Stare decisis\\", the principle that cases should be decided according to consistent principled rules so that similar facts will yield similar results, lies at the heart of all common law systems. - Quebec (pronounced or ) is the second-most populous province of Canada and the only one to have a predominantly French-speaking population, with French as the sole provincial official language. - The Ontario New Democratic Party (ONDP or NDP) is a social democratic political party in Ontario, Canada.

Virginia is nicknamed the \\"Old Dominion\\" due to its status as the first colonial possession established in mainland British America, and \\"Mother of Presidents\\" because eight U.S. presidents were born there, more than any other state. The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay, which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna. The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond; Virginia Beach is the most populous city, and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision. The Commonwealth's estimated population is over 8.3 million, which is slightly less than New York City. - The American Revolution was a political upheaval that took place between 1765 and 1783 during which colonists in the Thirteen American Colonies rejected the British monarchy and aristocracy, overthrew the authority of Great Britain, and founded the United States of America. - William M. Kelso, C.B.E., Ph. D., F.S.A. (born 1941), often referred to as Bill Kelso, is an American archaeologist specializing in Virginia's colonial period, particularly the Jamestown colony. - The Virginia Company refers collectively to two joint stock companies chartered by James I on 10 April 1606 with the purposes of establishing settlements on the coast of North America. The two companies, called the \\"Virginia Company of London\\" (or the London Company) and the \\"Virginia Company of Plymouth\\" (or Plymouth Company) operated with identical charters but with differing territories. An area of overlapping territory was created within which the two companies were not permitted to establish colonies within one hundred miles of each other. The Plymouth Company never fulfilled its charter, and its territory that later became New England was at that time also claimed by England. - The Colony of Virginia (also known frequently as the Virginia Colony, the Province of Virginia, and occasionally as the Dominion and Colony of Virginia or His Majesty's Most Ancient Colloney and Dominion of Virginia) was the first permanently settled English colony in North America. Newfoundland, with seasonal settlements, had been established as a colony by Royal Charter in 1583. American archaeologist William Kelso says Virginia \\"is where the British Empire began ... this was the first colony in the British Empire.\\" The colony existed briefly during the 16th century, and then continuously from 1607 until the American Revolution (as a British colony after 1707). The name Virginia was first applied by Sir Walter Raleigh and Queen Elizabeth I in 1584. After the English Civil War in the mid 17th century, the Virginia Colony was nicknamed \\"The Old Dominion\\" by King Charles II for its perceived loyalty to the English monarchy during the era of the Commonwealth of England. - Christopher Newport (15611617) was an English seaman and privateer. He is best known as the captain of the \\"Susan Constant\\", the largest of three ships which carried settlers for the Virginia Company in 1607 on the way to found the settlement at Jamestown in the Virginia Colony, which became the first permanent English settlement in North America. He was also in overall command of the other two ships on that initial voyage, in order of their size, the \\"Godspeed\\" and the \\"Discovery\\". - The English Civil War (16421651) was a series of armed conflicts and political machinations between Parliamentarians (\\"Roundheads\\") and Royalists (\\"Cavaliers\\") over, principally, the manner of England's government.

The war ended with the Parliamentarian victory at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651. - The British Empire comprised the dominions, colonies, protectorates, mandates and other territories ruled or administered by the United Kingdom and its predecessor states. It originated with the overseas possessions and trading posts established by England between the late 16th and early 18th centuries. At its height, it was the largest empire in history and, for over a century, was the foremost global power. By 1913, the British Empire held sway over 412 million people, % of the world population at the time, and by 1920, it covered , % of the Earth's total land area. As a result, its political, legal, linguistic and cultural legacy is widespread. At the peak of its power, the phrase \\"the empire on which the sun never sets\\" was often used to describe the British Empire, because its expanse around the globe meant that the sun was always shining on at least one of its territories. - Susan Constant , captained by Christopher Newport , was the largest of three ships of the English Virginia Company ( the others being Discovery and Godspeed ) on the 1606 -- 1607 voyage that resulted in the founding of Jamestown in the new Colony of Virginia .

How much money does he save? Answer. 80 What step-by-step reasoning justifies that answer?","response":"The given information shows that Tom goes to a discount clinic that is 70% cheaper than a normal doctor. Step 1: Determine the cost of the discount clinic visit. A normal doctor charges 200 for a visit. To find the cost of a visit at the discount clinic, first calculate the savings by multiplying the normal visit cost by the discount percentage: 200 * 0.70 = 140. Step 2: Subtract the savings from the normal visit cost to get the cost of the discount clinic visit. 200 - 140 = 60. Step 3: Calculate the total cost of two visits to the discount clinic. 60 * 2 = 120. Step 4: Calculate the savings. Subtract the total cost of two visits to the discount clinic from the cost of one normal doctor visit: 200 - 120 = 80.

Let's go step by step: The original problem: -7*m - 400 + 121 = 24*m Step 1: Simplify both sides. Add 400 to both sides and subtract 121 from both sides to eliminate -400 and +121 (i.e., move them to the other side of the equation using the inverse operations). To simplify the left side, combine -400 and +121, to get -279. Therefore, the simplified problem to solve now becomes -7*m - 279 = 24*m. Step 2: Remove m terms from one side of the equation by performing the same operation to both sides. To do this, we'll add 7*m to both sides of the equation to eliminate the -7*m from the left side. This cancels out the m term on one side and changes the equation to -279 = 24*m + 7*m. Combine like terms for m on the right side of the equation to get 31*m. So, the equation now looks like this: -279 = 31*m Step 3: Solve for m by dividing both sides by 31, because to eliminate the 31 coefficient attached to the m variable, we perform the opposite operation (division). -279 ÷ 31 = m Therefore, m = -9 So, the solution to -7*m - 400 + 121 = 24*m is m = -9."},{"question":"Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first name of the person who was replaced by Jon Coghill?

Haug was the lead guitarist and lead singer. On discovering Fanning's singing abilities, Haug replaced himself with Fanning as lead singer and frontman. Haug stated that \\"It was a big thing to convince the others that we needed a singer. They were like, 'You're OK,' and I was like, 'No I'm not.

The debate about whether this is unfair is heating up once more this week, however, after it removed an iPhone game called Phone Story from its App Store. The game was released by Italian developer Molleindustria, whose mission statement is to \\"reappropriate video games as a popular form of mass communication\\" and \\"investigate the persuasive potentials of the medium by subverting mainstream video gaming cliche\\". In Phone Story's case, that took the form of four mini-games about the \\"troubling supply chain\\" behind smartphones – all smartphones, not specifically iPhones – including coltan extraction in Congo, outsourced labour in China, environmental waste in Pakistan, as well as the mania for gadgets in the West. One of the mini-games sees workers leaping from their factory building: a clear reference to suicides and attempted suicides by workers at Apple's manufacturing partner Foxconn. Molleindustria said that all its net revenues from sales of the iPhone game would go to charities tackling corporate abuses. A game where you have to catch plummeting factory employees, oversee underage miners and distribute smartphones outside a store with a white pear logo on the front? Apple's disapproval comes as no surprise, but in an interview with Gamasutra, Molleindustria's Paolo Pedercini says that in itself is a comment on the iOS ecosystem. \\"Here's the problem: the unanimous reaction from developers community has been, 'Wow, it's incredible Phone Story made through Apple's review process'. To me, this signals a full acceptance of a regime of censorship, the equivalent, for developers, of what journalists call the 'chilling effect'. I'm sure that Apple doesn't spend that much time in policing its marketplace, because the developers are already censoring themselves.\\" Pedercini goes on to talk about Apple's wider attitude to cultural products. \\"Of course, Apple has the right; it is the acceptance of Apple view about the cultural status of the 'App'. For them, games and applications are not part of culture like books or music. Try to imagine what kind of reaction iTunes would provoke if they banned all the songs with 'excessive objectionable' content.\\" On one level, Apple can't be faulted for its transparency on this score. In September 2010, it published some App Store guidelines, available to all developers (and reprinted in full at the time on several websites). \\"We view Apps different than books or songs, which we do not curate,\\" explained the document. \\"If you want to criticize a religion, write a book. If you want to describe sex, write a book or a song, or create a medical app. It can get complicated, but we have decided to not allow certain kinds of content in the App Store… We will reject Apps for any content or behavior that we believe is over the line. What line, you ask? Well, as a Supreme Court Justice once said, 'I'll know it when I see it'. And we think that you will also know it when you cross it.\\" According to Pedercini, Apple's email informing him of Phone Story's removal claimed the game had crossed four specific lines, in the form of specific guidelines for unacceptable apps. Two relating to charities and contributions appear to be wide of the mark, with the guidelines focusing on in-app donations, while Molleindustria was merely saying it would donate its download revenues to charities once it was paid. The other two flouted guidelines relate to depictions of \\"violence or abuse of children\\", and \\"excessively objectionable or crude content\\". The former appears to be crucial to the satirical intent of the game, while the latter is something of a grey area – who is most likely to object to the content here: users or Apple? Judging by his Gamasutra interview, Pedercini is fairly pessimistic about his chances of getting a resubmitted version of the game approved. In the past, these situations have been resolved – for example Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Mark Fiore had his NewsToons app rejected, sparking a media row over censorship, before resubmitting it unchanged and being approved. However, the subject material there was politicians and public figures, not Apple's own business. The rejection of Phone Story raises wider questions for app publishers beyond the Games category in 2011. What kind of treatment could a newspaper or magazine expect if it ran a lead feature exploring exactly the topics highlighted in Molleindustria's game, for example? It should be noted that thus far, Apple has shown no appetite for censoring editorial-based apps in this way. But the debate around how an app store owner responds when an app criticises and/or satirises its own business practices and those of its partners is not just restricted to Apple: it's one for all the platform owners, device makers and mobile operators launching their own curated stores. Apple declined to comment on the story when contacted by The Guardian. ||||| The rise of the iPhone has revolutionized communication in the modern world, and the game development industry has been one of the largest beneficiaries of this paradigm shift. Thanks to Apple's touch screen and App Store, mobile game development was dredged from its cultural ghetto to a legitimate avenue for big studios and indies alike.It arrived in the nick of time, too, after the rapid contraction of packaged goods and the recession of a few years ago forced so many developers to seek more agile, less expensive and lower-risk spaces within the industry. Since then, powerhouse studios have been built and careers have been rescued on the back of Apple's must-have device.But until now, few have been willing to turn the lens on this boom and examine what mass-market gadget lust is costing us ethically. Though we've since heard of suicides at Foxconn , deplorable working conditions and hazards to the environment involved in the manufacture of the latest hot smartphones, game developers were mostly silent -- until now.It seems natural that provocative serious games developer Molleindustria was the one to take the step. The studio, which has taken on forces like the Catholic church, McDonald's and big oil with games likeand, never pulls its punches as it uses games to sharply deconstruct the social and economic constructs most people take for granted.Its latest title,, uses a series of minigames with voice-over narration to shed light on the human cost and high environmental impact of smartphone development. In one minigame, while the narrator explains that most electronic devices require the mining of coltan, a conflict mineral in Congo whose demand spurs war and child labor, the player must use the touch screen to guide armed soldiers to bark at exhausted child miners in order to meet the goal in time.In another, the voice-over explains the suicides at electronics manufacturers in China, and the facile solution of \\"prevention nets\\" -- while the player must catch tumbling workers using a stretched trampoline.Of course,is more interesting for the fact that players must interact with these messages while holding one of the devices discussed. Imagine being served hamburgers on a tour of a slaughterhouse. And all of the developer proceeds -- 70 percent of total App Store revenues, as per usual -- will be pledged to organizations fighting corporate abuses, starting with Students and Scholars Against Corporate Misbehavior , which supports workers in abusive conditions internationally, including at Foxconn.Or they would be, ifhad been allowed to stay on the App Store. Apple yanked it just a few hours after the game was officially announced, citing four code violations: 15.2, which prohibits depictions of child abuse, and 16.1, which prohibits apps depicting \\"objectionable or crude\\" content. The other two, 21.1 and 21.2, pertain to's charitable bent -- and they don't seem to quite apply, intended instead for games that allow their users to make donations within a game, rather than a pledge by the developer to donate revenues.Molleindustria makes an iPhone game to criticize the iPhone platform, and that Apple's chosen to silence it is an interesting punctuation mark on the developer's statement.Gamasutra reached out to Molleindustria's Paolo Pedercini about, who credits the game's idea to recent international affairs graduate Michael Pineschi, to whom he spoke through creative activism group YesLab . At the time, Pedercini already had some unusual ideas in the works for projects that could act as commentary on gadget fetishism.\\"One of them was a multi-touchable virtual-pet vagina, monologuing about technological lust and willful submission to consumerism,\\" he reflects. \\"Unfortunately, the flesh engine didn't work as I hoped so I went for a straightforward educational game.\\"But the intent was always to develop a game as commentary on the hardware industry. \\"Most of the adults in the Western world are somewhat aware that most of our objects are manufactured far away, in conditions that we would consider barbaric,\\" Pedercini says.\\"A lot of tech-aware people heard about the story of the Foxconn suicides or about the issue of electronic waste,\\" he continues. \\"But with, we wanted to connect all these aspects and present them in the larger frame of technological consumerism.\\"He specifically wanted to highlight the goal that \\"must-have\\" consumer electronics culture plays in perpetuating these high-impact cycles; one of the levels oftasks the players with tossing brand-new boxed phones to swarming would-be buyers rushing a storefront. In his view, the marketing machine that makes people believe they absolutely need an upgraded hardware device on the day it comes out is what causes extremism in the supply chain.\\"We don't want people to stop buying smartphones,\\" he notes, \\"but maybe we can make a little contribution in terms of shifting the perception of technological lust from cool to not-that-cool. This happened before with fur coats, diamonds, cigarettes and SUVs -- I can't see why it can't happen with iPads.\\"Pedercini says it was essential to use the platform itself to stage a critique of that platform. \\"Almost like the device itself was speaking to the user,\\" he suggests. \\"The idea was to make a sort of reminder that you can keep with you, like a way-less-permanent tattoo or a bumper sticker, something that you carry around and maybe show off as a conversation-starter.\\"But although Apple's immediate removal ofmakes for an interesting conversation point, Pedercini says he never intended it to happen this way: \\"I'm very familiar with the App Store policy, and the game is designed to be compliant with it,\\" he asserts.\\"If you check the guidelines,doesn't really violate any rule except for the generic 'excessively objectionable and crude content' and maybe the 'depiction of abuse of children'. Yes, there's dark humor and violence but it's cartoonish and stylized - way more mellow than a lot of other games on the App Store.\\"\\"What makes these depictions disturbing is the connection the player makes with the real-world situation,\\" adds Pedercini. \\"Of course, the goal was to sneak an embarrassingly ugly gnome into Apple's walled garden, but not to provoke the rejection. If it was just a matter of provocation I would have gone way further... I'd be much happier if the game was actually available to everybody, and possibly generating discussions around the issues it clumsily addresses.\\"Editing the game to make it truthful without being objectionable will be some task: \\"a new version ofthat depicts the violence and abuse of children involved in the electronic manufacturing supply chain in a non-crude and non-objectionable way... will be a difficult task,\\" he notes wryly.\\"This morning, a dry and polite Apple employee called me personally to talk about the specific violations of,\\" says Pedercini. \\"When I asked if I can submit a new version, there was a moment of silence and then he answered, 'Yes, if you can make it compliant to the guidelines.' But the truth is that there is no way to know what's 'excessive' and 'objectionable' in Cupertino.\\"Most alarming to Pedercini is how complacent so many developers have become to mobile development's culture. \\"Here's the problem: the unanimous reaction from developers community has been, 'Wow, it's incrediblemade through Apple's review process,'\\" he says. \\"To me, this signals a full acceptance of a regime of censorship, the equivalent, for developers, of what journalists call the 'chilling effect.'\\"\\"I'm sure that Apple doesn't spend that much time in policing its marketplace, because the developers are already censoring themselves.\\" he continues. \\"Of course, Apple has the right; it is the acceptance of Apple view about the cultural status of the 'App.' For them, games and applications are not part of culture like books or music.\\"Adds Pedercini: \\"Try to imagine what kind of reaction iTunes would provoke if they banned all the songs with 'excessive objectionable' content.\\"is now available on the Android app store .] ||||| Summary:","response":"Apple removed an iPhone game called 'Phone Story' from its App Store just a few hours after its release, sparking debate about censorship.

Pick your answer from: [a]. yes. [b]. it is not possible to tell. [c]. no.","response":"[c]. no. The given hypothesis, \\"The New York Times is reporting that Santeria is coming out of the closest with Vegans leading the charge,\\" cannot be considered true based on the provided premise. The premise states that \\"The New York Times reports that Santeria, the West Indian religion notorious for animal sacrifice, is gaining American adherents and coming out of the closet.\\" However, it does not mention that Vegans are leading the charge for this resurgence of interest in Santeria. It is essential to note the main differences between the premise and the hypothesis. The premise mentions Santeria as a religion known for animal sacrifice, while the hypothesis brings up Vegans, who follow a lifestyle that avoids the use of animal products and opposes animal cruelty. This is contrary to the animal sacrifice practices in Santeria, making it unlikely for Vegans to lead the charge for this religion's growing popularity. The hypothesis seems to be contrasting the premise rather than supporting it, so the statement is false. Additionally, since the premise states that Santeria is becoming more popular and gaining attention among Americans, one could argue that the statement \\"Santeria is coming out of the closet\\" holds some truth. However, this does not justify the inclusion of Vegans in the hypothesis, as they are not mentioned in the premise."},{"question":"Given those answer options, answer the question: Read the following article and answer the question.

Their marriage was good and their dreams were focused .Their best friends lived just a wave away. Though my parents have passed away, I can see them now - Dad in trousers, a T-shirt and a hat and Mom in a house dress, lawnmower in one hand and dishtowel in the other. It was the time to fix things -a curtain rod ,the kitchen radio, the screen door, the oven door, and so on. They fixed all things we had. It was a way of life, and sometimes it made me crazy. All that re-fixing and renewing made me want to scream.1 wanted just once to be wasteful. Waste meant being rich. Throwing things away meant you knew there'd always be more.

Would \\"Geologically, a continent extends to the edge of its continental shelf, so the now-separate islands are considered part of the continent.\\" be a reasonable answer? Options: [-] No [-] Yes Answer:","response":"Yes, that would be a reasonable answer as it provides a geological perspective to the classification of continents. To further elaborate on the answer: Australia is recognized as both a country and a continent, and it is part of the continent called Oceania. Oceania is a region that includes Australasia, Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia. However, when referring to Australia as a continent, it often excludes the other islands within Oceania. The statement mentioning the continental shelf is accurate. Continents are generally defined by their geological features, and one of the key aspects of a continent is its continental shelf. A continental shelf is a gently sloping, submerged platform of land that extends from the coastline to the deeper oceans. This transition marks the boundary between continental crust and oceanic crust, which have distinct geological properties. In the case of Australia, the continental shelf includes the mainland, as well as Tasmania, and the now-separate islands, such as New Guinea, which were once joined to the mainland during the last ice age when sea levels were lower. As a result, geologically speaking, these islands can be considered part of the Australian continent due to the extension of the continental shelf they share. So, in conclusion, the answer \\"Geologically, a continent extends to the edge of its continental shelf, so the now-separate islands are considered part of the continent.\\" is a reasonable answer to the question, as it underlines the geological aspect of continental classification which includes Australia and its adjacent, now-separated islands as part of the same continent."},{"question":"TEHRAN — When the call finally came, Maryam Seyed Emami’s heart leapt. Except for one brief phone call, she had heard nothing from her husband, Kavous Seyed Emami, a professor and prominent environmentalist, since he was arrested and accused of spying more than two weeks before. Now, she was being told to come to the offices of the Tehran prosecutor, where she could see her husband at last. She rushed off, but upon arrival quickly sensed that something was wrong. Instead of being taken to see her husband she was closeted in a room with a prosecutor and four intelligence agents from the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps and interrogated for several hours. Cooperate, they told her, or you, too, will end up in prison. In recounting the experience for their two sons, Ramin and Mehran, Ms. Seyed Emami said that the agents had asked about the couple’s friends and parties they had attended. They showed her family pictures and asked her to describe who and what were in them. They inquired about her husband’s environmental work, she told her sons. Did you know, they asked at one point, that he was a spy? When the agents finally ran out of questions, she was informed she could see her husband. There was just one thing, they said. He was dead, having committed suicide in his cell. ||||| In response to reports that the Iranian authorities have said they will refuse to release the body of the Canadian-Iranian academic Kavous Seyed-Emami to his family unless there is an immediate burial and no attempt to conduct an independent autopsy, Magdalena Mughrabi, Amnesty international’s Deputy Director for the Middle East and Africa said: “The authorities’ refusal to allow an independent investigation into the extremely suspicious death of Dr Seyed-Emami smacks of a deliberately orchestrated attempt to cover up any evidence of torture and possible murder. He was detained in Evin prison where detainees are held under constant surveillance and stripped of all personal possessions. It would have been near impossible for him to commit suicide. “We are deeply concerned that Dr Seyed-Emami’s body bears incriminating signs of torture and other clues to the reasons for his death. We call on the Canadian government and the international community to continue to place pressure on the Iranian authorities to allow an independent investigation into the circumstances of Dr Seyed-Emami’s death in accordance with international standards. Those responsible, including any individual with command responsibility, must be brought to justice.” Kavous Seyed-Emami’s death is the third to be hastily declared a suicide in detention by Iranian authorities since the December 2017 protests. A fourth death, also confirmed in detention, remains unexplained by the authorities. “The mounting deaths in custody and the authorities’ refusal to allow independent and transparent investigations are deeply troubling illustrations of the utter contempt for human life and accountability that exists in the Iranian criminal justice system today.” said Magdalena Mughrabi. In a statement on 11 February, Tehran’s Chief Prosecutor stated that Kavous Seyed-Emami was driven to suicide by “confessions” that he had made and the incriminating statements others had made against him. Remarks about his “confessions” heighten concerns that he was subjected to torture. He had been arrested on 24 January 2018 and was under interrogations for national-security related charges stemming from his peaceful environmental activism, making him a prisoner of conscience. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","response":"The suspicious death of Kavous Seyed Emami, a Canadian-Iranian professor and environmental activist, in an Iranian prison has raised concerns over human rights abuses and cover-ups within the Iranian criminal justice system.

The 1980 Bank Robbery in Central Nyack that was medically managed at the Nyack Hospital where I responded to the ONLY Code 66 of my career. That “66”indicated for us an external disaster about to unload in our emergency room. The two policemen who were mortally injured and died on our stretchers were personal friends and one the boyfriend of one of the nurses. Their injuries were from machine guns where the flesh is riddled with explosive elements as opposed to a gunshot wounds where there is both an entry and exit site. In our Trauma and Triage Course we never learned about machine gun injuries. Additionally there were the criminals who were also injured and of course we needed to treat them as any other patient regardless of their behavior. The friends of the injured policemen were trying to get to these villains and it was just the most awful evening of my life. To this day I remember feeling nauseous in a way I had never felt before. We had debriefing sessions for weeks and of course were very upset for months. The wounds we had to address, the insertion of chest tubes and everything else all in such a rapid manner was indeed a more than gross situation. There was even open heart massage. Private doctors reported to help; many are not trained or current in emergency medicine; much is left to critical care nurses in a community hospital that is not a teaching institution with residents and interns on staff. Recently one of the women involved in this crime came up for parole. Of course there was great opposition from the community relative to her release. She was young and that was 38 years ago. I believe people deserve a second chance, but of course this is a very controversial matter.

We want to believe our work means something. The problem comes in defining \\"meaningful work\\". What is it? That answer is different for everyone. For some meaningful work might be helping others organize their office. For others it may mean making a million dollars. What really matters is how you see it. What is meaningful work to you?

Today, we're going to talk about a fun topic - football! In football, teams score points by making touchdowns. There are two main ways to score a touchdown: by passing the ball or by running with it. Do you know what passing and running touchdowns are? Let me explain! Passing Touchdown: This happens when a player called the quarterback throws the ball through the air to another player on his team, who then catches it inside the endzone. And then, they score points! Running Touchdown: This is when a player runs with the football in their hands, and they cross the endzone line with the ball. That's also a way to make points. Now, let's get to the main question: How many more passing touchdowns were there compared to running touchdowns? To answer this question, we need a specific period to count touchdown numbers. We'll use last year's scores. We'll pretend that there were 100 passing touchdowns and 70 running touchdowns. To find out how many more passing touchdowns there were, we take the bigger number (100 passing touchdowns) minus the smaller number (70 running touchdowns). 100 - 70 = 30 So, there were 30 more passing touchdowns compared to running touchdowns last year! Isn't it amazing to know how teams scored these points? Keep enjoying football with your family and friends, and remember - passing and running touchdowns both help make the game exciting! Do you have any more questions about football or touchdowns? Feel free to ask!"},{"question":"Article: \\"Last week,\\" Dr. P said \\"I was invited to a doctors' meeting at the R. Hospital. In one of the rooms a patient, an old man, got up from his bed and moved slowly towards me. I could see that he hadn't long to live, but he came up to me and placed his right foot close to mine on the floor.\\" \\"Frank!\\" I cried with surprise. He couldn't answer as I knew, but he tried to smile, all the time keeping his foot close to mine. My thoughts raced back more than thirty years--to the dark days of 1941, when I was a student in London. The scene was an air-raid shelter , in which I and about a hundred other people slept every night. Among them were Mrs. West and her son Frank, who lived nearby. Sharing wartime problems, we got to know each other very well. Frank interested me because he was not normal . He had never been normal, ever since he was born. His mother told me he was 37 then, but he had less of a mind than a baby has. Mrs. West, then about 75, was a strong, able woman, as she had to be of course, because Frank depended on her completely. He needed all the attention of a baby. One night a policeman came into our shelter and told Mrs. West that her house had been all destroyed. That wasn't quite true, because the West went on living there for quite some time. But they certainly lost nearly everything they owned. When that kind of thing happened, the rest of us helped the unlucky ones. So before we separated that morning, I stood beside Frank and measured my right foot against his. They were about the same size. That night, then, I took a spare pair of shoes to the shelter for Frank. As soon as he saw me, he came running--and placed his right foot against mine. After that, he always greeted me in the same way. Question: Why did Dr P say that Mrs West had to be a strong, able woman? Yes or no, is the answer \\"She had to give care and thought to her son as to a baby.\\"? A:","response":"Dr. P stated that Mrs. West had to be a strong, able woman because she needed to care for and support her son, Frank, who was not normal since birth and depended on her completely. According to the article, Frank had less of a mind than a baby, which implies that he required the same level of attention, care, and thought that a baby would need. Therefore, the answer to the question, \\"Why did Dr P say that Mrs West had to be a strong, able woman? Yes or no, is the answer 'She had to give care and thought to her son as to a baby.'\\" is Yes. Mrs. West had to be a strong, able woman because she needed to provide constant care, attention, and thought to her son, just as one would provide for a baby. This responsibility placed great demands on her physical, emotional, and mental strength, demonstrating her resilience and determination in ensuring her son's well-being despite the challenges they faced, especially during wartime."},{"question":"Solve 82*l = -79*l - 134*l for l.

For weeks prior to the event I kept experiencing ‘visual disturbances.’ I felt when I was reading a newspaper or book a sense that my eyes were crossing. I’d feel aware right before it would occur and I would rush to look in a mirror only to discover my eyes were not crossing. I informed my OB who blamed it on the blood vessels in my eyes enlarging due to pregnancy. Ummm ok. You know more than me. Later I was told by a surgeon what I was experiencing was ‘textbook’ for the passing of blood clots through my occipital area of the brain! The feeling would eventually subside. I awoke one morning feeling ‘kind of fuzzy’ headed. Like I had slept too hard. I sat with my husband at the kitchen table for our morning coffee and newspaper and for no reason I could imagine I was unable to swallow my coffee and it dribbled out the left side of my mouth. My husband asked me what was going on and I apparently told him, I was ‘stroking’ out. He got up from the table assuming I was OK and went off to take his morning shower. While in the shower it occurred to him something might not be right. He came back to the table where I was struggling to lift myself from the chair. I put my hands on the table to lift my body and my left hand kept sliding off the edge. He finally got behind me and tried to lift me under my arms and I crumbled to the floor.

Hook your amplifier and pedal up to power. Connect your guitar to the input jack. Connect the output jack on the pedal to the input of the amplifier. Turn the amplifier on first and set your levels. Turn down the effect knobs before switching it on. Experiment with the pedal. Always unplug cables when you're finished playing.","response":"Title: A Step-By-Step Guide to Connecting Your Guitar Pedal to Your Amplifier Introduction Guitar pedals, also known as effects pedals or stompboxes, are an essential part of every guitarist's arsenal, enabling them to manipulate the sound of their instrument in a variety of ways. From adding subtle touches of reverb or chorus to creating entirely new, out-of-this-world walls of sound, guitar pedals provide a versatile and straightforward way to take your playing to another level. In this article, we'll walk you through the process of connecting your guitar pedal to your amplifier and ensuring everything is set up correctly for the best sound possible. Step 1: Turn Everything Off The first step to connecting your guitar pedal is to ensure that both the amplifier and the pedal are turned off to prevent any damage to your equipment or sudden, loud noises which might disturb your neighbors. Unplugging any cables that might be connected to your amplifier or pedal is also a good idea, as it will allow you to start creating a fresh setup without any misunderstandings. Step 2: Hook Your Amplifier and Pedal Up to Power To power your amplifier and pedal, ensure that they are properly plugged into a power source. Using a reliable and surge-protected power strip will protect your gear from voltage spikes and other electrical issues. Step 3: Connect Your Guitar to the Input Jack Now it's time to connect your guitar to your pedal. Using a good-quality instrument cable, plug one end into the output jack of your guitar and the other end into the input jack of your pedal. Step 4: Connect the Output Jack of the Pedal to the Input Jack of the Amplifier Next, using another good-quality instrument cable, connect the output jack of your pedal to the input jack of your amplifier. This creates a complete signal chain, allowing the sound from your guitar to pass through the pedal and then into the amplifier. Step 5: Turn the Amplifier On and Set Your Levels With everything connected, turn on your amplifier first. Setting the amplifier levels before turning on the pedal ensures that you have a clean, unaffected sound to start with. This helps to avoid creating any unexpected sounds once the pedal is engaged. Step 6: Turn Down the Effect Knobs Before Switching Your Pedal On Before engaging your pedal, turn down all its effect knobs to their minimum settings. This is important because it will help you gradually introduce the effect into your playing, making it easier to fine-tune and control the sound. Step 7: Experiment with the Pedal Now it's time to have some fun! Slowly turn up the effect knobs on your pedal and experiment with the different sounds it can create. Play around with various combinations of settings to discover your preferred tone. Don't be afraid to try unorthodox configurations; some of the most unique and memorable sounds are born from experimentation. Step 8: Unplug Cables When Finished Playing When you're finished playing, always remember to unplug cables from your guitar, pedal, and amplifier. This practice helps to prolong the life of your cables and prevents any accidental damage to your equipment. Additionally, it's just good housekeeping and shows respect for your gear. Conclusion Connecting and setting up a guitar pedal with your amplifier may seem daunting at first, but by following these step-by-step instructions, you will be well on your way to exploring the vast world of sonic possibilities that effects pedals can offer. So get out there, plug in your pedal, and start creating your unique sound!"},{"question":"What's an example of a movie review?","response":"Title: Avengers: Endgame (2019) Directors: Anthony Russo and Joe Russo Screenplay: Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely Genre: Superhero, Action, Adventure, Science Fiction Review: A triumphant culmination of the beloved Marvel Cinematic Universe, Avengers: End_game (2019) masterfully ties the threads of 22 movies to deliver an unforgettable experience. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo have crafted an epic superhero adventure filled with heart, humor, and spectacular action sequences that thrill from start to finish. The film picks up after the devastating events of Avengers: Infinity War (2018). Half of the universe's population, including several major characters, has been wiped out by the villainous Thanos (Josh Brolin). The surviving Avengers, led by Captain America (Chris Evans) and Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), must come up with a plan to reverse Thanos’ actions and save the universe. Assembling the heroes one last time, they embark on a perilous mission that spans time and space to set things right. What sets Avengers: Endgame apart from its predecessors is a strong emphasis on character development and relationships. The audience has spent a decade getting to know these characters, so the payoffs in this film are both emotional and satisfying. The fight against Thanos is not only a physical battle for the heroes but also an internal struggle with their own identities and regrets. The film showcases the extraordinary chemistry amongst all the characters, and their interactions throughout the movie provide for compelling drama peppered with just the right amount of humor and emotional weight. Robert Downey Jr.’s performance as Tony Stark/Iron Man is a standout in the film. His remarkable range, deftly balancing arrogance, vulnerability, and intelligence, is brought to the fore as the character grapples with the fear of losing loved ones and the responsibility of being a hero. Chris Evans’ Captain America also shines as the unrelenting moral compass who stands firm in the face of adversity. Visually, Avengers: Endgame is a spectacle in the finest sense of the word. The detailed CGI, combined with the stunning practical effects, creates a seamless, immersive experience. The breathtaking action sequences including the third act battle are choreographed with precision and a sense of urgency that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats. The movie’s pacing could arguably be its only minor flaw, as the initial two-thirds of the film steadily build the tension, while the final act becomes an adrenaline-charged race to the finish. However, given the scope and the emotional stakes involved, the filmmakers’ focus on telling a personal, character-driven story within a blockbuster framework is admirable. In conclusion, Avengers: Endgame is a powerful and fitting swan song to the decade-long journey of Marvel's beloved superheroes. The Russo brothers deliver a visually sumptuous, emotionally charged, and action-packed farewell that will undoubtedly resonate with audiences for years to come. Filled with unforgettable moments, laughter, tears, and an undeniable sense of joy, Avengers: Endgame is a must-see film for fans and cinema lovers alike.

The level of absolute poverty for a 2 people family was €1050.95/month. The poverty line per capita changed by region from €552.39/month to €819.13/month.The numbers of those in absolute poverty rose nearly an entire percent in 2015, from 6.8% in 2014, to 7.6% in 2015. In the south of Italy the numbers are even higher with 10% living in absolute poverty, up from 9 percent in 2014. The north is better off at 6.7%, but still an increase from 5.7% in 2014. The national statics reporting agency, ISTAT, defines absolute poverty as those who can’t buy goods and services which they need to survive. In 2015, the proportion of poor households in relative poverty also increased in 2015 to 13.7 from 12.9 in 2014. ISTAT defines relative poverty as people whose disposable income is less than around half the national average. The unemployment rate in February 2016 remained at 11.7%, which has been the same for almost a year, but even having a job doesn’t guarantee freedom from poverty. Those who have at least one family employed still suffer from 6.1% to 11.7% poverty, the higher number being for those who have factory jobs. The numbers are even higher for the younger generations because their unemployment rate is over 40%. Also, children are hit hard. In 2014, 32% of those aged 0–17 are at risk of poverty or social exclusion, which is one child out of three. In the last ISTAT report poverty is in decline.

The article says that the poverty line for a 2 people family was €1,050.95 per month.

Now, the range of the poverty line per person after the increase was from €552.39 to €819.13 a month. We need to know how much lower the new poverty line for 2 people family (€525.475) is than the lower end of the new range (€552.39). So we will subtract €525.475 from €552.39. €552.39 - €525.475 = €26.915.

This impasse puts the jury at risk of being deadlocked, which could lead to a mistrial. In a case that has captured national attention and sparked discussions around race and police violence, the jury of 11 whites and one African-American must grapple with the choices available to them in determining the fate of the defendant. Background: Michael Slager, the former police officer at the center of this trial, was filmed shooting Walter Scott in the back as he ran away. He has been charged with murder, but the jury also has the option of convicting him of manslaughter. It remains unclear which charge the other 11 jurors are leaning toward. In a letter read out in court, the dissenting juror wrote, \\"I cannot in good conscience consider a guilty verdict,\\" adding, \\"I still cannot, without a reasonable doubt, convict the defendant.\\" A Heavy Burden: The sole juror's reluctance to convict Slager sheds light on the immense pressure facing members of the jury, as they struggle to reconcile the various pieces of evidence and testimony presented to them. Recognizing the emotional weight of this decision, the juror wrote, \\"We all struggle with the death of a man and with all that has been put before us.” The juror also noted the difficulty of the task ahead, saying, \\"My heart does not want to have to tell the Scott family that the man who killed their son, brother and father is innocent. But with the choices, I cannot and will not change my mind.\\" Judge's Instructions: Upon learning that the jury had been unable to reach a verdict, Circuit Judge Clifton Newman ordered them to resume deliberations, reminding them of their \\"duty to make every reasonable effort to reach a unanimous verdict.\\" At the end of the day, the jury asked to return on Monday for more deliberations. Mistrial and Federal Trial: If the jury remains deadlocked, it could result in a mistrial, leaving the door open for the prosecution to retry the case. Regardless of the state trial's outcome, Michael Slager will face a federal civil rights trial next year, further highlighting the challenges of achieving justice in cases involving police violence and racial issues. Conclusion: As the Michael Slager trial continues, the nation watches closely to see whether the jurors will ultimately convict or acquit the former officer. While the outcome remains uncertain, what is clear is that the case has brought crucial issues to the forefront of public consciousness and underscores the ongoing debate over police violence and the intersection with race in the United States."},{"question":"The Irish people only recently displayed their commitment to the EU by voting strongly for the Lisbon Treaty. Translate to Finnish","response":"Irlantilaiset osoittivat sitoutumistaan Euroopan unioniin äänestämällä vahvasti Lissabonin sopimuksen puolesta. Irkkuihmiset ovat hiljattain osoittaneet sitoutumisensa Euroopan unioniin äänestämällä voimakkaasti Lissabonin sopimuksen puolesta. Lissabonin sopimus, joka astui voimaan vuonna 2009, oli merkittävä askel Euroopan unionin kehittymisessä, koska se pyrki parantamaan EU:n toimintakykyä, tehokkuutta ja demokratiaa ottamalla käyttöön useita uusia säädöksiä ja toimielinuudistuksia. Vahva tuki Lissabonin sopimukselle Irlannissa kuvasti kansan halua olla aktiivinen ja merkityksellinen osa EU:ta, joka on tuonut mukanaan useita etuja sekä taloudellisesti että yhteiskunnallisesti. Irlanti on hyötynyt EU-jäsenyydestään saamalla merkittävää rahoitusta esimerkiksi infrastruktuuriin, korkeakoulutukseen ja maatalouspolitiikkaan. Irlantilaiset ovat myös arvostaneet sitä, että EU tarjoaa heille mahdollisuuden matkustaa, opiskella ja työskennellä helposti muissa jäsenmaissa. EU:lla on myös ollut positiivinen vaikutus Irlannin kansainväliseen asemaan, mikä on auttanut rakentamaan vahvempia kauppasuhteita ja tukinut Irlannin talouden kasvua. Lisäksi EU-jäsenyys on auttanut Irlantia selviämään 2000-luvun talouskriiseistä, tarjoten taloudellista ja teknistä apua, kun sitä on tarvittu. Samalla kun Irlanti on tukenut EU:ta ja sen päätöksentekoa, se on myös ilmaissut ja suojannut omia kansallisia etujaan. Esimerkiksi Irlannin hallitus on varmistanut, että maan maatalouspolitiikka ja alv-järjestelmä säilyttävät tärkeimmät elementit, jotka tukevat Irlantia ennen kaikkea EU:n tasolla. Lopuksi voidaan todeta, että Irlannin kansan voimakas tuki Lissabonin sopimukselle oli osoitus heidän sitoutumisestaan Euroopan unioniin. Irlantilaiset ovat havainneet EU-jäsenyyden hyödyt ja haluavat jatkaa tiivistä yhteistyötä muiden jäsenmaiden kanssa.

Just before Christmas, a mysterious old man, Mr. Frederick Percival Blunden (Laurence Naismith) visits the family, introducing himself as a representative of a firm of solicitors.[2] The family are told there is an opportunity to become the caretakers of a derelict country mansion in the Home Counties named Langley Park, which was gutted by fire years before, and is now in the charge of the solicitors. Mrs. Allen takes the post despite rumours that the house is haunted, her instructions to care for the property until such time as the heirs to the estate can be traced. The air of mystery deepens when the children see a portrait at the solicitors office of a man they believe to be Mr Blunden. The solicitor confirms this, but reveals that the portrait is of a man called Mr Blunden, but who has been dead for a hundred years.[6] After they have settled into the new post, Lucy and Jamie see two ghostly figures in the grounds of the house: a teenage girl, Sara Latimer (Rosalyn Landor), and her younger brother, Georgie (Marc Granger).

Chain of thought:","response":"Yes, Squidward Tentacles and Alan Greenspan do have different musical passions, as they are both very different entities with different interests in music. Squidward Tentacles is a fictional character from the animated television series SpongeBob SquarePants, created by Stephen Hillenburg. He is an octopus who is a neighbor and coworker of the main character, SpongeBob SquarePants. Squidward's primary musical passion is playing the clarinet, although he is not shown to be particularly skilled at it. He is also greatly interested in classical music, as well as various art forms such as painting and dance. As a character, he often expresses a desire to be a famous and accomplished musician and artist. On the other hand, Alan Greenspan is a real-life person, best known as an American economist who served as the Chairman of the Federal Reserve of the United States from 1987 to 2006. Apart from his well-known career in economics, Alan Greenspan is also a talented musician who, during his youth, played clarinet, saxophone, and flute. He attended the prestigious Juilliard School and later played with the Henry Jerome Orchestra. However, his musical passion took a backseat as his academic interests shifted, and he pursued a career in economics. In conclusion, Squidward Tentacles and Alan Greenspan have different musical passions due to their differing backgrounds and interests. Squidward mainly focuses on the clarinet, while Alan Greenspan showed a varied interest in woodwind instruments during his early life. It is important to note that Squidward Tentacles is a fictional character whose musical passions serve to make him a more relatable and entertaining figure, while Alan Greenspan is a real-life person whose early musical passions were an essential part of his personal journey before becoming an influential figure in the world of economics."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: - ru clubcaps is 119 - birth name is hendrik egnatius botha - birth date is 27 february 1958 - ru provincecaps is 179 - ru ntupdate is 11 august 2014 - ru nationalpoints is -lrb- 337 -rrb- - ru clubyears is 1987 -- 92 - ru nationalcaps is 28 - university is university of pretoria - school is hoërskool hendrik verwoerd - birth place is breyten , south africa - ru position is fly-half - ru nationalteam is south africa world xv - other is yes - ru clubupdate is 11 august 2014 - ru provincepoints is -lrb- 2511 -rrb- - ru provinceupdate is 11 august 2014 - ru nationalyears is 1980 -- 92 1986 , 1992 - ru clubpoints is -lrb- 1731 -rrb- - ru proclubs is rugby rovigo - ru province is northern transvaal - image is rugby naas botha.jpg - ru provinceyears is 1977 -- 95 Given the details above, guess who could this information be about.

A woman died after being hit by a police motorcycle on Saturday afternoon in Wittelsheim, a village in Alsace in northeastern France which is 40 kilometers from the start of the race's leg from Colmar to Besancon.

He recalled feeling that it did no good to establish the CAP unless the pilots had instructions on whether they were authorized to shoot if the plane would not divert. He said the President signed off on that concept. The President said he remembered such a conversation, and that it reminded him of when he had been an interceptor pilot. The President emphasized to us that he had authorized the shootdown of hijacked aircraft. The Vice President's military aide told us he believed the Vice President spoke to the President just after entering the conference room, but he did not hear what they said. Rice, who entered the room shortly after the Vice President and sat next to him, remembered hearing him inform the President, \\"Sir, the CAPs are up. Sir, they're going to want to know what to do.\\" Then she recalled hearing him say, \\"Yes sir.\\" She believed this conversation occurred a few minutes, perhaps five, after they entered the conference room. We believe this call would have taken place sometime before 10:10 to 10:15. Among the sources that reflect other important events of that morning, there is no documentary evidence for this call, but the relevant sources are incomplete. Others nearby who were taking notes, such as the Vice President's chief of staff, Scooter Libby, who sat next to him, and Mrs. Cheney, did not note a call between the President and Vice President immediately after the Vice President entered the conference room. At 10:02, the communicators in the shelter began receiving reports from the Secret Service of an inbound aircraft-presumably hijacked-heading toward Washington. That aircraft was United 93. The Secret Service was getting this information directly from the FAA. The FAA may have been tracking the progress of United 93 on a display that showed its projected path to Washington, not its actual radar return. Thus, the Secret Service was relying on projections and was not aware the plane was already down in Pennsylvania. Question: \\"Why was the Secret Service's information about United 93 flawed?\\" Answer: \\"Based on projected path\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","response":"Alright kiddo, so there was a big meeting with important people like the President and Vice President. They were talking about some planes, called CAPs, that fly around to protect things. They needed to figure out what the pilots should do if something goes wrong. Now, the Secret Service found out that a plane called United 93 was coming towards Washington, D.C. But, their information wasn't quite right. You see, they were looking at what they thought the plane's path would be instead of where it actually was. So, it was like they were guessing where it would go, but their guess was wrong because the plane had already landed somewhere else. So, to answer your question, yes, the answer is correct.

Article: Cell phone use and texting are increasingly common, especially among teens. And that could be a problem. Texting affects learning and performing on test, a new study finds. So a Montana teen, Colin decided to test that. They asked 47 classmates to take part in a two-part experiment. The goal was to test how well these students understood written material. Each one had to read a paragraph or two about a certain topic, then answer questions about it. In the first part, the participants had 15 minutes to understand and then answer questions about six readings. Throughout this test, they met no distractions. During a new set of readings, the brothers sent messages to the participants' cell phones every 90 seconds. In each message, there were questions that required a reply. Participants should have scored better on the second test because it was easier. In fact, they scored worse when distracted by messages. Only a few students scored as well when replying to messages as they did when undistracted. But importantly, nobody performed better during the texting part. The brothers presented details of their findings at the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair. Boys and girls scored equally poorly while texting, the brothers noticed. Older participants didn't do any better than younger ones. And it didn't matter if a student thought he was good at multitasking. On average, the brothers found that even students who were confident of their abilities did just as poorly while texting. Surprisingly, even though the students remembered less of what they read while texting, most of them answered questions in messages perfectly. \\"Our teachers are very happy to see these results,\\" says Coler. The teens' new data strongly support their teachers' opinion that texting while studying is a serious distraction. Question: From the results of the experiment, we can find _ .

The article explicitly states, \\"Boys and girls scored equally poorly while texting.\\" Choice B: the easier the tests were, the more mistakes were made - This is a bit misleading. While it's true that \\"participants should have scored better on the second test because it was easier,\\" and they indeed \\"scored worse when distracted by messages,\\" the main factor here seems to be texting, not the difficulty level of the tests. Choice C: nobody did good jobs in the two-part experiment - False. The article does mention that \\"only a few students scored as well when replying to messages as they did when undistracted,\\" implying that some students' performance was not negatively affected by texting. Choice D: some students' test results were not affected by texting - True. As explained above, the article does mention that a few students' scores were not affected by texting.

As their ship returns to the US after a long voyage, they see all the other sailors being mistreated by their wives and girlfriends, and the two friends pledge never to get involved with women again. Unfortunately, this vow is tested almost immediately. First, Ace is confronted by the family of a former lover, Cherry, who insist he marry her. Then Josh, who is the son of rich shipping magnate, has to fend off his fiancee, Gloria, and his father's wishes that he settle down and take over the family business. Things get worse when Josh and Ace get caught up fishing and turn up late for a party to celebrate Josh's engagement. Gloria's hostile drunken brother starts a fistfight and a news reporter takes photographs that cause a scandal. Josh and Ace flee to Hawaii and then head for Singapore. However, the pair only get as far as the island of Kaigoon before their money runs out. They rescue Mima, an exotic local (but not native) from her abusive dance-partner, Caesar, and she moves into their hut. Soon Mima is running the two men's lives, much to their chagrin. The trio try to make money in several different ways, including trying to sell a spot remover that is so bad it dissolves clothes. When Josh's father finally locates his wayward son, he and Gloria fly out to bring Josh back to face his responsibilities. The resentful Caesar leads them to where Ace, Josh and Mima are enjoying a local feast. By this point, both Josh and Ace have fallen in love with Mima. She is heartbroken to learn that Gloria is Josh's fiancee. Ace proposes to Mima, but before she can accept, Josh returns. The two friends almost come to blows over Mima, but then decide that she should choose between them. Mima picks Ace. Josh boards an ocean liner with Gloria and his father.

Parker was a highly influential jazz soloist and a leading figure in the development of bebop, a form of jazz characterized by fast tempos, virtuosic technique and advanced harmonies. Parker was a blazingly fast virtuoso, and he introduced revolutionary harmonic ideas including rapid passing chords, new variants of altered chords, and chord substitutions. His tone ranged from clean and penetrating to sweet and somber. Parker's life was riddled with depression and heroin addiction. This addiction caused him to miss performances and be considered unemployable. He frequently resorted to busking, receiving loans from fellow musicians and admirers, and pawning his saxophones for drug money. Heroin use was rampant in the jazz scene, and users could acquire it with little difficulty. Although he produced many brilliant recordings during this period, Parker's behavior became increasingly erratic. Heroin was difficult to obtain once he moved to California, where the drug was less abundant, so he used alcohol as a substitute. A recording for the Dial label from July 29, 1946, provides evidence of his condition. Before this session, Parker drank a quart of whiskey. According to the liner notes of Charlie Parker on Dial Volume 1, Parker missed most of the first two bars of his first chorus on the track, \\"Max Making Wax\\". When he finally did come in, he swayed wildly and once spun all the way around, away from his microphone. On the next tune, \\"Lover Man\\", producer Ross Russell physically supported Parker. On \\"Bebop\\" (the final track Parker recorded that evening) he begins a solo with a solid first eight bars; on his second eight bars, however, he begins to struggle, and a desperate Howard McGhee, the trumpeter on this session, shouts, \\"Blow!\\" at him. Charles Mingus considered this version of \\"Lover Man\\" to be among Parker's greatest recordings, despite its flaws. Nevertheless, Parker hated the recording and never forgave Ross Russell for releasing it. He re-recorded the tune in 1951 for Verve. Parker's life took a turn for the worst when his 2 year old daughter tragically passed away from pneumonia. He attempted suicide twice in 1954, which landed him in a mental hospital. When Parker received his discharge from the hospital, he was clean and healthy. Before leaving California, he recorded \\"Relaxin' at Camarillo\\" in reference to his hospital stay. He returned to New York, resumed his addiction to heroin and recorded dozens of sides for the Savoy and Dial labels, which remain some of the high points of his recorded output. Many of these were with his so-called \\"classic quintet\\" including Davis and Roach.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Was he ever arrrested","response":"Charlie Parker, also known as Yardbird or Bird, was a famous jazz musician who played the saxophone and created new styles of music. He was really good at playing very fast and coming up with new ways to make music sound more interesting. But unfortunately, he had some troubles in his life. He was very sad and took drugs called heroin, which made his life harder and messed up his music performances sometimes. He went through many hard times, and when he could not get heroin, he drank alcohol instead. He even had a time when he was helped by the person producing his music because he was so unsteady. Still, many people liked his music, like the song \\"Lover Man,\\" even if it wasn't perfect. Things got really bad for Parker when his little daughter got sick and died. He tried to harm himself and had to go to a special hospital for a while. He got better there and even made a song about it called \\"Relaxin' at Camarillo.\\" However, when he went back to New York, he started using heroin again and making more music with his friends, some of which are still famous today.

Formed in 2000, the band consists of Tommy Giles Rogers Jr. (lead vocals, keyboards), Paul Waggoner (lead guitar, backing vocals), Dustie Waring (rhythm guitar), Dan Briggs (bass, keyboards), and Blake Richardson (drums). Their debut eponymous album was released through Lifeforce Records in 2002, shifting to Victory Records for subsequent releases until their signing to Metal Blade in 2011, where Between the Buried and Me released their first extended play, The Parallax: Hypersleep Dialogues that year, and its full-length follow-up The Parallax II: Future Sequence the following year. Their seventh studio album, Coma Ecliptic, was released in 2015. In August 2003, Between the Buried and Me traveled to Q Division Studios in Somerville, Massachusetts to record their second record, The Silent Circus, released in October the same year. It was later re-released in 2006 with a live DVD of the band's performance at The Cat's Cradle in Chapel Hill, North Carolina on July 17, 2005. Mark Castillo played drums on The Silent Circus, replacing Goodyear. After the release of The Silent Circus, the band went through numerous members before the current lineup was assembled for their third album, Alaska. On drums, Mark Castillo was replaced by Jason Roe, and later by Blake Richardson. On guitar, Fletcher was replaced by Shane Blay, and later by Dustie Waring. And on bass, King was replaced by Kevin Falk, and later by Dan Briggs. This remains the current lineup. In the summer of 2005, Between the Buried and Me released Alaska. The album released the songs \\"Selkies: The Endless Obsession\\", \\"The Primer\\", and \\"Backwards Marathon\\" as singles. In the following year, the band released their first cover album, The Anatomy Of, a collection of covers of bands that influenced Between the Buried and Me, including Metallica, King Crimson, Pantera, Faith No More, Queen, Pink Floyd, Earth Crisis, Counting Crows, and Soundgarden. In early 2006, Between the Buried and Me was on tour supporting Bleeding Through along with Every Time I Die and Haste the Day. They were also on the Ozzfest 2006 Second Stage.

Humphries was born in Stonebroom , Derbyshire , son of John Thomas Humphries and his wife Eliza . Humphries was born in Stonebroom , Derbyshire , the son of John Thomas Humphries and his wife Eliza .","response":"While these two sentences from Wikipedia convey similar information, they have slightly different structures, and we can analyze the differences as follows: 1. \\"Humphries was born in Stonebroom, Derbyshire, son of John Thomas Humphries and his wife Eliza.\\" In this sentence, the word \\"son\\" is used in apposition to \\"Humphries.\\" This means that the word \\"son\\" is in a syntactic relation that provides additional information about Humphries. The appositive construction is meant to provide an explanation or clarification, and it typically appears right after the noun that it explains. Here, the appositive \\"son of John Thomas Humphries and his wife Eliza\\" helps to specify the relationship between Humphries and his parents. Note that in this sentence, the article \\"the\\" is omitted from the phrase \\"son of John Thomas Humphries and his wife Eliza.\\" 2. \\"Humphries was born in Stonebroom, Derbyshire, the son of John Thomas Humphries and his wife Eliza.\\" This sentence is very similar to the first one, with the main difference being the inclusion of the definite article \\"the\\" before \\"son\\" to form the noun phrase \\"the son of John Thomas Humphries and his wife Eliza.\\" The addition of \\"the\\" makes the relationship between Humphries and his parents more explicit, as it emphasizes the specific identity of Humphries as the son of the mentioned couple. In terms of meaning, this sentence shares the same core information as the first sentence: Humphries' birthplace in Stonebroom, Derbyshire, and his relationship to his parents, John Thomas Humphries and Eliza. In conclusion, while the two sentences contain the same key information, they differ slightly in structure. The first sentence uses an appositive without the definite article, while the second sentence includes the definite article \\"the\\" in the noun phrase describing Humphries' relationship to his parents. Overall, the meaning conveyed is effectively the same, but with a minor syntactic variation."},{"question":"Q:Facts: - death place: san jose , california , us - successor: jesús jiménez zamora - death date: 26 september 1887 - predecessor: juan rafael mora - office: president of costa rica - term end: 8 may 1863 - term start: 14 august 1859 - birth date: 19 march 1815 - name: josé maría montealegre - image: josé maría montealegra fernández.jpg - birth place: san josé , costa rica Based on these bullet points, write a short biography describing the life of josé maría montealegre .

However, it could be possible in the modern technological context if an AI-driven program like a language translator were named \\"Sophist\\". Let's break down the chain-of-thought: 1. \\"Sophist\\": In historical and philosophical contexts, sophists were a group of ancient Greek teachers and philosophers, known for their rhetorical skills and their abilities to argue and persuade. They were prominent figures in the 5th century BCE. As individuals, they would not be capable of programming laptop computers. 2. \\"Programs laptop computers\\": Modern technology allows someone or something to develop software capable of translating text using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) algorithms. This would typically involve writing code or building a program, which can run on laptop computers. 3. \\"Translate Irish limericks into Russian and Vietnamese\\": Irish limericks are short poems that originated in Ireland. Today, machine translation software like Google Translate can perform language translations, including translating Irish limericks into Russian and Vietnamese languages. So, while the statement might be possible in a modern context if \\"Sophist\\" refers to an AI-driven language translation program, it is not a factual statement in a historical or philosophical context."},{"question":"Premise: \\"As part of the settlement ending the war, Alsace and a portion of Lorraine were ceded to Germany.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"Germany won Alsace and a portion of Lorraine.\\" true?

Context: For years, Aimee Lind, a librarian at the Getty Research Institute, has been struggling with ways to make architecture archives more accessible to users. To help solve this problem, she co-founded the California Architecture Archives Network (or CalArchNet) with her Cal Poly SLO colleague Jessica Holada. Together they have organized a series of one-day mini-conferences designed to foster dialogue and collaboration among librarians, archivists, and curators at California institutions that house architecture archives. The goal of these semiannual meetings is to create a space for convergence among professionals who intersect with architectural archives in different ways. Architecture archives, often containing large drawings and scale models, present unique problems due to their size and fragility. CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs. October 27 marked the third meeting of CalArchNet, held at the Palm Springs Art Museum, Architecture and Design Center, with representatives from 13 institutions in attendance. Topics discussed included historic site preservation research methodology, leveraging statewide resources to enhance discovery of collections, security considerations, GIS mapping technologies, and the use of linked open data to make connections between collections.

The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively.

There are two sequels, \\"Return to Doom\\" and \\"Last Days of Doom\\". - Acorn Computers Ltd. was a British computer company established in Cambridge, England, in 1978. The company produced a number of computers which were especially popular in the UK, including the Acorn Electron and the Acorn Archimedes. Acorn's BBC Micro computer dominated the UK educational computer market during the 1980s. It is more known for its computer than for its other products. - The Acorn Archimedes is a family of personal computers designed by Acorn Computers Ltd in Cambridge, England and sold in the late-1980s to mid-1990s, their first general purpose home computer based on their own ARM architecture (then the CPU and architecture was known as Acorn RISC Machine, or ARM, that later became one of the most widely used CPU architectures in the world, e.g. used in most smartphones). The first Archimedes was launched in 1987. - The kilobyte is a multiple of the unit byte for digital information. The International System of Units (SI) defines the prefix \\"kilo\\" as 1000 (10); therefore one kilobyte is 1000 bytes. The unit symbol for the kilobyte is kB. In information technology, particularly in reference to main memory capacity, \\"kilobyte\\" is traditionally used to denote 1024 (2) bytes. This arises from the powers-of-two sizing common to such memory in digital circuitry. In this context, the symbols K and KB are often used when 1024 bytes is meant. - Oceanography (compound of the Greek words meaning \\"ocean\\" and meaning \\"write\\"), also known as oceanology, is the study of the physical and the biological aspects of the ocean. It is an Earth science covering a wide range of topics, including ecosystem dynamics; ocean currents, waves, and geophysical fluid dynamics; plate tectonics and the geology of the sea floor; and fluxes of various chemical substances and physical properties within the ocean and across its boundaries. These diverse topics reflect multiple disciplines that oceanographers blend to further knowledge of the world ocean and understanding of processes within: astronomy, biology, chemistry, climatology, geography, geology, hydrology, meteorology and physics. Paleoceanography studies the history of the oceans in the geologic past. - Castle of Riddles is a text adventure released by Acornsoft for the BBC Micro ( in 1982 ) and Acorn Electron ( 1984 ) home computers . The game was written by Peter Killworth and was one of a series of text adventures written for , or ported to the BBC Micro by the same author ( others including Countdown to Doom and Philosopher 's Quest ) . As with all such games , only text is used . The player must use a simple ' verb - noun ' format ( e.g. ' Go North ' , ' Get lamp ' ) to control the game . Unlike Killworth 's other Acornsoft adventures , Castle of Riddles was not updated and reissued by Topologika so became unavailable after 1985 when Acorn Computers ( parent company of Acornsoft ) pulled out of the games publishing market . Some of the puzzles however were included in the Topologika version of Philosopher 's Quest . - Home computers were a class of microcomputers entering the market in 1977, and becoming common during the 1980s. They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming. - Topologika Software Ltd was an independent British publisher of educational software. Established in Stilton, Cambridgeshire in 1983, the company spent most of its life in Penryn, Cornwall before moving to Brighton, Sussex. The company was dissolved at the end of June 2013. Its educational software continues to be sold by distributors REM via , and is still supported by Topologika's founder Brian Kerslake. - The BBC Microcomputer System, or BBC Micro, is a series of microcomputers and associated peripherals designed and built by the Acorn Computer company for the \\"BBC Computer Literacy Project\\", operated by the British Broadcasting Corporation. Designed with an emphasis on education, it was notable for its ruggedness, expandability, and the quality of its operating system. An accompanying 1982 television series \\"\\"The Computer Programme\\"\\" featuring Chris Serle learning to use the machine was also broadcast on BBC 2. - The Acorn Business Computer (ABC) was a series of microcomputers announced at the end of 1983 by the British company Acorn Computers. The series of eight computers was aimed at the business, research and further education markets. However, the ABC range was cancelled before any of the models were shipped to customers. The ABC 210 was subsequently relaunched as the Acorn Cambridge Workstation, sold in modest numbers to academic and scientific users.

Could you please translate this to English?","response":"Of course! The sentence \\"Myslím, že se o sebe postarám, díky\\" in English means, \\"I think I can take care of myself, thank you.\\" It's like saying you can handle things on your own and you're grateful for the offered help."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Given the background: Figure B above shows an important relationship between the wavelength and frequency of a wave. The top wave clearly has a shorter wavelength than the second wave. However, if you picture yourself at a stationary point watching these waves pass by, more waves of the first kind would pass by in a given amount of time. Thus the frequency of the first waves is greater than that of the second waves. Wavelength and frequency are therefore inversely related. As the wavelength of a wave increases, its frequency decreases. The equation that relates the two is and the situation: Robert is generating waves using an oscilloscope in his high school physics class. As part of the experiment, Robert first has to create waves with a long wavelength, waves that we will call long waves. Afterwards, Robert has to create waves with a short wavelength, waves that we will call short waves. Answer the following question: Which waves will have a higher frequency? Answer:","response":"Based on the background information provided, the relationship between wavelength and frequency of a wave is inversely related. This means that as the wavelength of a wave increases, its frequency decreases, and vice versa. In the given situation, Robert is generating two types of waves: long waves and short waves. The long waves have a longer wavelength compared to the short waves. Since wavelength and frequency are inversely related, the waves with a shorter wavelength will have a higher frequency. Therefore, the short waves that Robert creates will have a higher frequency than the long waves."},{"question":"Generate a correctly punctuated version of the following text: If you like to Cook you will love the kitchen which is equipped with all the essential amenities to prepare food","response":"If you like to cook, you will love the kitchen, which is equipped with all the essential amenities to prepare food."},{"question":"I once started asking people who their favorite movie villains were , and my Dad said his was Lee Van Cleef in The Good , The Bad & The Ugly .

His wife Janet would load the banjos into their station wagon and try to hawk them to L.A. music stores, which often said no to the upstart company. Even after landing accounts, they scrambled to pay their bills and struggled to shake off the image of banjo players as toothless hillbillies in overalls. At times, the Deerings wanted to give up. But they had a pact — they would make banjos no matter what. “We would say, ‘We can’t give up,'” says Janet Deering. “So let’s figure it out.” Did they ever. From that inauspicious start in 1975, the Deering Banjo Company of Spring Valley, Calif., has grown into North America’s largest banjo maker, riding the instrument’s current boom in popularity. The company owns an estimated 80% to 90% of the U.S. market and has almost doubled its sales since 2009, to a projected 5 million this year. In the past year alone, sales are up 1 million. In January, they expect to sell their one hundred-thousandth banjo. Instead of banging on music store doors, they have a one-year back order on new instruments. MORE: We need business leaders with some sense of shame Deering is not just the nation’s dominant banjo purveyor. It’s also a brand that’s attracting a new breed of young musicians. Taylor Swift strums a six-string, 2,100 model. “Taylor has really brought a lot of new people to the banjo,” Janet says. “Just watching her play, they buy banjos. It’s a wonderful thing.” Steve Martin, Keith Urban, and Winston Marshall of Mumford & Sons are all Deering banjo players too. The current roster of A-list musicians playing a Deering represents a 180-degree turn from the 1970s, ’80s and ’90s, when Nashville shunned the banjo. Zen Crook, an old-time Nashville session player, told a company official how a fellow musician warned him, “Don’t let anyone know you play the banjo because it will be the kiss of death of your music career.” The Deerings say the banjo backlash hurt them early on. “We felt like we couldn’t climb out of the box,” Janet says. “I had country artists say, ‘As soon as I cut a record with a banjo, they cut it from the album.'” Greg Deering credits Emily Robison of the Dixie Chicks. “They told Emily she couldn’t play the banjo, and she told them to stuff it,” he says. “She said, ‘Either I play the banjo, or we walk.'” She used an electric Deering banjo she bought at age 15. Keith Urban also widened the instrument’s appeal, recording with a Deering far from Nashville in his native Australia. From the time he was a kid listening to The Kingston Trio, Greg says he has always loved the banjo. “It’s a primitive sound,” he says. “It has a haunting quality to it.” Greg was a good banjo player, but he was a better craftsman who honed his skills building model airplanes with his father. In 1969, as a 19-year-old student at San Diego State University, he made his first banjo because he couldn’t afford the 700 Gibson banjo he longed for. He and his buddies, including Bob Taylor (who would go on to guitar-making fame) formed an instrument-making co-op called The American Dream. In 1974, the co-op closed. The next year, Greg and Janet, who met at church after she watched him play hymns, started the Deering Banjo Company. In the early, lean years, they would eat from their garden and chicken coop, scrounge for tools at a salvage yard, and rush to the bank to deposit any profits before their checks bounced. After they hired four employees, the neighbors complained, so they moved their operation to a small plant. Pricing was a challenge initially. Greg wanted to put as much value as possible into each banjo, but when Janet tried to sell a 175 model, store owners would ask, “What’s wrong with it? Why is it so cheap?” The next week, they raised the price to 275, and still the stores wouldn’t bite. Only after they raised the price to 375 did they start racking up orders. The Deerings now rely on a skilled workforce of 47 craftspeople, some of whom were carpenters and others who trained on the job. With fluctuations in sales, keeping a core crew posed a challenge. During the recent recession, Deering’s sales skidded from 3.4 million in 2007 to a low of 2.4 million in 2009. The company shrunk down to what the Deerings call an ” irreversible minimum” of 31 workers. “We spent two weeks with barely enough sales to make payroll,” Greg says. But they wanted to keep all their best employees, so they had everyone in the shop read a book about lean technologies called The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement. They moved machinery to a central location so workers did not have to walk as far, and Greg developed new, more efficient machines. When sales picked up, they could produce banjos faster and for less. MORE: Japan: A haven for humanoid robots Deering’s current offerings span the market. Their entry-level 500 banjos compete with Chinese imports. They also make custom-made, high-end instruments such as the Banjosaurus, which features an intricate mural depicting dinosaur evolution on the neck. George Grove of the Kingston Trio plays it onstage when he is not lending it to the American Banjo Museum in Oklahoma City. Anyone who wants to fork over 60,000 can have one custom-built just like it. Often, it’s rich amateurs, not professional musicians, who spend tens of thousands on a banjo as a piece of art. To keep banjo fever hot, the Deerings advertise in magazines, on the radio, and even on the side of a bus, under the tagline “Relax and Enjoy the Sound. Play the Banjo.” The company has sponsored banjo giveaways through the Facebook page of the Celtic punk group The Dropkick Murphys. To register to win, people have to submit their email address. “Within minutes, we’ll get 10,000 to 15,000 emails,” Greg says. This fall, the Deerings traveled with Mumford & Sons, setting up a tent and giving free banjo lessons to 2,000 fans in two weeks. “Within 15 minutes, I can teach you to strum and play two songs,” Greg says. They also travel worldwide, visiting dealers in 11 countries, and sell to other countries online. Jamie Deering, the Deerings’ daughter, is in charge of artist relations and also travels with bands. She has been mentioned as a possible successor, but Greg says she doesn’t want to go through the decades of struggle she saw her parents endure. “In order for her to take over, we’re going to have things running really, really well,” Greg says. Besides, Greg, who is 63, and Janet, who is 59, say they have no plans to retire anytime soon. They ignore advice to take their company public or cash out. That, after all, would break their pact. “We just want to make banjos,” Greg says. “It’s all about the magic of the music and the magic of banjos.” What was this article about?","response":"This article is about the Deering Banjo Company, which is the largest banjo maker in North America.

The Russian football transfer window is divided into two main periods: the winter transfer window and the summer transfer window. These periods may vary slightly from year to year due to different factors such as league or national team schedules, international tournaments, and coordination with the wider FIFA international transfer window calendar. As of 2021, the Russian football summer transfer window typically opens on June 22 and closes on September 7. However, it is essential to note that these dates can vary based on the decisions made by the Russian Football Union (RFU) and the Russian Premier League (RPL) authorities, in compliance with FIFA's regulations. The exact dates for each season's transfer window may be subject to change due to factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which has had significant impacts on football schedules globally. The winter transfer window in Russian football generally runs from January 23 to February 22. This is to align with the RPL's winter break and to allow clubs to bring in new players to strengthen their squads for the remainder of the season. Once again, these dates are not set in stone and may be adjusted by the RFU and RPL authorities depending on the specific circumstances of each season. It is essential for clubs, players, and agents to stay up-to-date with the exact opening and closing dates of the Russian football transfer window each year, as missing the deadline can have serious consequences. Players who miss the deadline are unable to complete their transfer to a Russian club until the next transfer window. This can result in the player being left in limbo, affecting their career development and opportunities for playing time. Similarly, clubs that fail to finalize transactions before the transfer window closes may not be able to adequately bolster their squads to compete effectively in domestic and international competitions. In summary, the Russian football transfer window typically closes on September 7 for the summer transfer window and February 22 for the winter transfer window. However, these dates can change based on decisions made by the Russian Football Union and the Russian Premier League authorities. Therefore, clubs, players, and agents need to be aware of the specific transfer window dates for each season, as they can have a significant impact on player recruitment and squad development."},{"question":"Question: In which city is the house where 'Anne Frank and her family' hid from the Nazis during WW2?

Here’s what we know: OSU attack ‘too close to home,’ Butler County leaders say OHIO STATE ATTACK: Who is the suspect? Officer who shot OSU attacker a Fairfield grad Kasich, other politicians weigh in on attack Ohio State athletes share status as campus deals with attack WATCH OSU Student: “It was pretty crazy” WATCH Scene of shooting: Map of OSU WATCH Ohio State Shooting: Police in tactical gear WATCH OSU student say he “heard shots” WATCH Aerial shots from the Ohio State campus WATCH Active shooter on the campus of Ohio State University PHOTOS: Ohio State Shooting A Somali-born attacker who appeared to be acting alone drove his car into a crowd of Ohio State University students and staff Monday morning, then got out and started swinging a butcher knife, injuring at least 11 people before he was shot and killed by a campus police officer. Andrew Thomas, chief medical officer at OSU’s Wexner Medical Center, said the 11 injuries were a mix of stab wounds and injuries from being hit by the car. None were life-threatening. The attacker was identified as 20-year-old OSU student Abdul Razak Ali Artan. Columbus police Chief Kim Jacobs said late Monday afternoon that police were waiting on a search warrant for Artan’s home and were trying to talk to people who knew him. Law enforcement officials did not comment on a possible motive, saying the investigation was ongoing. WATCH OSU Student: “It was pretty crazy” Artan was featured in OSU’s “The Lantern” student newspaper in late August. In that “Humans of Ohio State” feature, he was described as a third-year student in logistics management who had just transferred from Columbus State. He was quoted as saying he was nervous about saying his Muslim prayers in public, and blamed the media for creating a certain image of Muslims. OSU President Michael Drake praised the quick response of law enforcement and urged people to let the investigation move forward without jumping to conclusions. “We don’t know anything that would link this to any community. We certainly don’t have any evidence that would say that’s the case,” Drake said. “What we want to do is really unify together, support each other, do our best to support those who were injured in their recovery, and then allow the investigation to take place, and not jump to conclusions that could in fact create a bad situation where one doesn’t exist.” Drake and others thanked campus police officer Alan Horujko, 28, who responded immediately. OSU Police Chief Craig Stone said Horujko, who has been with OSU police for almost two years, was already outside Watts Hall, where the incident occurred, because of an apparently unrelated fire alarm. Stone said the attack “happened right before his eyes.” RELATEDKasich, other politicians weigh in on attack Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther thanked Horujko and others in law enforcement for their work, saying, “It’s never been a more dangerous, complicated, challenging time to be a police officer.” “Today is one of those days you’re grateful for good training and great people across the board,” Ginther said. President Drake and I had the opportunity to meet with the outstanding young law enforcement officer this afternoon. … We had a dynamic, well-trained professional today save the lives of many of our residents and students.” How it happened Shortly after 9:30 a.m., students in Watts Hall on the north side of campus were evacuated because of a fire alarm. Stone said there was a report of a gas leak in the building. “The whole class was like, is this a drill? And someone came in and said, this is real, we have to evacuate,” said Jared Crandall, an OSU junior materials science major who recently transferred from the University of Dayton. “We were just standing outside talking amongst ourselves. … Then I heard the car. It turned the corner really fast and jumped on the curb and that was all I heard.” The car was a silver Honda sedan that turned west off of College Road onto 19th Avenue, a street that narrows as it runs between multi-story science and engineering buildings. Stone said police have reviewed camera video that proves Artan was in the car by himself. RELATED MAP: Scene of shooting at Ohio State University Crandall said at first he wasn’t sure why the car went onto the sidewalk, adding that Artan had to go around a public safety vehicle to get there. “He comes onto the curb and he’s headed toward all of us. He’s almost directly in the line of path to me and some friends. Luckily we took a couple steps to the side, and he happened to swerve a bit the other way, so we were fine,” Crandall said. “Someone behind me got hit a little bit and hurt her ankle but she’s OK. He kept going and … I saw him after he was out of the car. I turned and saw what was happening. I saw this guy with this knife and he was just swinging it around.” Both Crandall and Monica Moll, OSU’s director of public safety, said the incident happened in a flash. “At 9:52, the officer involved called (to the dispatch center) that a car had hit about seven to eight pedestrians,” Moll said. “Just a few seconds later, also at 9:52, the officer made a call that indicated officer in trouble, that there was a man with a knife. At 9:53 that same officer called out that there were shots fired and that he had one person down. That’s when the officer … used deadly force to stop the threat.” WATCH OSU student say he “heard shots” Tense morning Police officials now say Artan acted alone, and the threat was over in two minutes. But police, students and the city as a whole didn’t know that at the time. The first alert from university officials went out at 9:55 a.m., saying, “Active Shooter on campus. Run Hide Fight. Watts Hall. 19th and College.” The campus was on lockdown for about 90 minutes, as authorities checked for a possible second attacker. People who were outdoors ran, and students and staff indoors followed instructions to shelter in place, locking themselves in classrooms and offices. Some students tweeted pictures of the mountain of chairs they had used to barricade their doors. RELATEDOhio State athletes share status as campus deals with attack Law enforcement officials surrounded and searched the Lane Avenue parking garage, at one point handcuffing two people. But police eventually established that there was no second attacker, and said once they identified the pair from the garage, they were released. Drake cancelled classes for the rest of the day, but the university will resume its normal schedule on Tuesday. “We live in an unstable world unfortunately, and we have to continue to do our best to protect ourselves,” he said.

Tiffany Alberts, 41, of Wolcott, Indiana, is charged with six counts of aggravated battery and one count of neglect of a dependent resulting in serious bodily injury. According to court documents, officers were called to Riley Hospital to investigate possible child abuse on November 17. Alberts’15-year-old son was being treated for cancer, and he had several unexplainable infections that were delaying treatment. Staff placed video surveillance in his room, and the video showed Alberts injecting an unknown substance into his IV bag with a syringe several times, court documents say Staff told police that Alberts’ son received his first round of chemotherapy for leukemia in September and went home. But several days later he returned to the hospital because he had a fever and diarrhea and was vomiting. The staff said his symptoms haven’t improved. He’s required several surgeries to changes his central venous line due to concern for infection, and he spent 18 days in the ICU. Doctors also told authorities that the boy tested positive for blood cultures with organisms that are normally found in stool, and experts say there is no medical reason to explain the ongoing blood infection. Investigators questioned Alberts, and at first, she said she injected water into her son’s IV bag to “flush the line” because the “medicine that was given to him burned.” However, she later confessed that she injected fecal matter into the bag on multiple occasions. She says she did it to get her son moved to another unit at Riley that had better treatment. Court documents say the boy’s health improved once Alberts was removed from the hospital room. They say their biggest concern is they may have missed their window to keep his leukemia in remission. Doctors also say the boy could have died from any one of the episodes of septic shock, and he still could die from his leukemia due to the prolonged delay in therapy. Sandy Runkle with Prevent Child Abuse Indiana said while cases like these are rare, when dealing with child maltreatment, there's generally a spectrum of factors for why the abuse happened. Runkle said everyone has a responsibility to pay close attention to a child's health, whether they're a family member or friend. \\"Just keeping an eye out if you’re a family member that’s concerned, or a friend, or a physician,\\" Runkle said. Many parents may not have resources to help take care of their children dealing with medical problems, Runkle said. Resources can be found by clicking here.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less pressure on rocks happens, how will it affect there are fewer fires. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","response":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests that if there is less pressure on rocks, it might lead to fewer forest fires. To assess whether this supposed perturbation has a direct or indirect effect on the described process, we first need to understand the relationship between the pressure on rocks and the occurrence of forest fires. 1. Direct Effect: If the change in pressure on rocks directly leads to a reduction in the number of forest fires, the overall process will be affected as follows: - With fewer forest fires, there will be less destruction of the forests and habitat loss for animals. - Animals living in the forest will still have many places to hide, reducing their vulnerability to predators. - Predators may have more difficulty finding their prey due to increased hiding spots. - Birds may not need to fly away from the area, as their habitat remains largely intact. - Waters may not experience the same increase in temperature, leading to less harm to the fish swimming in them. 2. Indirect Effect: It is also possible that the decrease in pressure on rocks can have an indirect effect on forest fires. For example, if the reduction in pressure on rocks is associated with climatic changes or human activities that lessen the likelihood of forest fires, it can impact the process indirectly. - If the climate becomes less prone to droughts or heatwaves, the conditions that often lead to forest fires may be mitigated. - Human activities, such as mining or construction, may change due to the decrease in pressure on rocks. These activities might affect the likelihood of forest fires through changes in land use, vegetation management, or human-induced fire ignitions. In conclusion, if the perturbation hypothesis of less pressure on rocks leads to fewer forest fires, either directly or indirectly, the overall process will be altered. The direct and indirect effects ultimately lead to a similar outcome: reduced forest destruction, less harm to animal populations, and lower impact on aquatic ecosystems."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Here is a review left by a customer on a product.

The impressive list of ingredients includes black truffles, gold and silk peptides, but unfortunately these expensive additives contribute to Trufflesque’s slightly expensive price tag. The first thing that strikes me about this product is the amazing packaging. All Temple Spa products have really amazing, premium packaging, and I feel that they add to the feeling that you are about to use something really special on your skin. The dark glass jar has a gold lid and it is nestled in a gold and chocolate brown box with the most amazingly cute mask brush slotted in too. The mask itself is gold and it shimmers so prettily, if you look closely it’s almost as if you can see the particles of real gold! To apply you just paint the golden mask onto your face with the cute little brush (it makes applying the mask so easy) then leave for 15-20 minutes. The mask doesn’t dry completely, it stays a little bit tacky to the touch, and I find that it makes my skin tingle quite a bit. For extra benefits you can also then massage the mask into your skin for around 2 minutes, before removing with a damp muslin cloth or flannel. How long has Temple Spa been a company?

To provide you with a detailed understanding, I will describe the entire process of mitosis, including the missing step. Mitosis is a type of cell division that results in two daughter cells, each with the same number and kinds of chromosomes as the parent nucleus. It is generally followed by cytokinesis, which divides the cytoplasm, organelles, and cell membrane into two new cells containing roughly equal shares of these cellular components. The process of mitosis is divided into five stages: prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. 1. Prophase: This is the first stage of mitosis and is the missing step in your process. During prophase, the chromatin (genetic material) in the cell's nucleus condenses into chromosomes, which become visible as distinct structures. Each chromosome is composed of two sister chromatids, joined together at a region called the centromere. The centrosome, an organelle involved in organizing microtubules, duplicates itself, and the newly formed centrioles begin to move apart from each other toward opposite poles of the cell. Meanwhile, the nuclear membrane starts to break down, and the mitotic spindle begins to form. The spindle is composed of microtubules that will later help separate the sister chromatids. 2. Prometaphase: In this stage, the nuclear membrane completely disappears, and the mitotic spindle fibers extend from the centrioles towards the chromosomes. The spindle fibers attach to the centromere of each chromosome, and the chromosomes begin to move due to the forces exerted by these microtubules. 3. Metaphase: During metaphase, the chromosomes align at the metaphase plate, which is an imaginary plane equidistant from the two centrioles at the cell's poles. This ensures that sister chromatids are properly distributed to each daughter cell during cell division. 4. Anaphase: In anaphase, the sister chromatids separate at the centromere, and each chromatid is now considered an individual chromosome. The spindle fibers shorten, pulling the separated chromatids towards the opposite poles of the cell. 5. Telophase: During telophase, the chromosomes reach the opposite poles and start to decondense, returning to a chromatin-like state. A new nuclear membrane forms around each set of chromosomes, and the mitotic spindle disassembles. 6. Cytokinesis: Although not technically a part of mitosis, cytokinesis serves as the final step of cell division. The cell membrane pinches inward (in animal cells) or a cell plate forms (in plant cells), ultimately dividing the cell into two individual, genetically identical daughter cells. Adding the missing step of prophase to your process, the complete sequence of events during mitosis is as follows: - Prophase: Chromosomes condense, centrioles duplicate and start moving to opposite poles, nuclear membrane begins to break down, and mitotic spindle forms - Centrioles separate to move to opposite poles - Metaphase: The chromosomes line up in the center - Anaphase: The chromatids separate - Are pulled apart - Telophase: The chromosomes gather at opposite poles, and two new nuclear membranes form - The cell membranes pinch (animal cells) or a cell plate forms (plant cells) - Divide into two individual cells"},{"question":"Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: Haplocyonoides is an extinct genus of terrestrial carnivores belonging to the suborder Caniformia, family Amphicyonidae (\\"bear dog\\"), and which inhabited Europe from the Early Miocene subepoch (20 Mya)—(16.9 Mya). \\"Haplocyonoides\\" existed for approximately . Hypothesis: Haplocyonoides was the most feared animal in europe for several years","response":"After analyzing the given paragraph, it is not possible to definitively determine if the hypothesis, \\"Haplocyonoides was the most feared animal in Europe for several years,\\" is true based solely on the information provided. However, we can provide some background information that will help understand the animal's ecological role and relationships during its existence. First, let's review the information provided in the paragraph: 1. Haplocyonoides is an extinct genus of terrestrial carnivores. 2. They belong to the suborder Caniformia, family Amphicyonidae, which are commonly known as \\"bear-dogs.\\" 3. Haplocyonoides inhabited Europe during the Early Miocene subepoch, approximately 20 to 16.9 million years ago. Based on this information, we can infer that Haplocyonoides was an apex predator in Europe during the Early Miocene period. However, we need more contextual information about the animal and its contemporaries in order to establish whether it was the most feared animal at the time. Factors that could account for an animal being perceived as the most feared are size, physical features, hunting capabilities, and examples of preserved interactions with other contemporary species. Considering the common nickname \\"bear-dog,\\" we can assume that the Haplocyonoides was likely a large and powerful carnivore. The family Amphicyonidae, to which Haplocyonoides belongs, was known for being large in size and having a mix of features present in both bears and dogs. Their physical attributes would have allowed them to be quite capable predators and potentially feared by other animals and humans (if present) during their time. However, the size and capabilities of other contemporary predators must also be taken into account to determine if Haplocyonoides was truly the most feared animal. Additionally, information on the behaviors and interactions of Haplocyonoides with other species within their ecosystem would help to validate or refute the hypothesis. In conclusion, the hypothesis that Haplocyonoides was the most feared animal in Europe for several years cannot be definitively confirmed or refuted based on the information provided in the paragraph. We would need more context and information about the species itself, its contemporaries, and its ecosystem to make a clear determination."},{"question":"The answer to the question: Who was known as the Mummy of Birchin Bower? is inside the article: Beswick's mummified body was initially kept at Ancoats Hall, the home of another Beswick family member, but it was soon moved to a room in Dr White's home in Sale, Manchester, where it was stored in an old clock case. Beswick's apparently eccentric will made her a celebrity; the author Thomas de Quincey was one of those who went to view her at White's house. Following White's death in 1813, Beswick's body was bequeathed to a Dr Ollier, on whose death in 1828 it was donated to the Museum of the Manchester Natural History Society, where she became known as the Manchester Mummy, or the Mummy of Birchin Bower. She was displayed in the museum's entrance hall, next to a Peruvian and an Egyptian mummy, and her relatives were allowed free access to visit her as they wished. She was described by a visitor in 1844 as \\"one of the most remarkable objects in the museum\\". The \\"cold dark shadow of her mummy hung over Manchester in the middle of the eighteenth century\\", according to writer Edith Sitwell.There are no pictures of Hannah Beswick. One of the few contemporary accounts of her is provided by Philip Wentworth, a local historian: The body was well preserved but the face was shrivelled and black. The legs and trunks were tightly bound in a strong cloth such as is used for bed ticks [a stiff kind of mattress cover material] and the body, which was that of a little old woman, was in a glass coffin-shaped case. Shortly after the museum's transfer to Manchester University in 1867 it was decided that as Beswick was \\"irrevocably and unmistakably dead\\", the time had come for her to be buried. But since 1837 UK law had required that a medical examiner issue a certificate of death before a burial could take place; as Beswick had died in 1758 an appeal had to be made to the Secretary of State, who issued an order for her burial. With the permission of the Bishop of Manchester, Hannah Beswick was interred in an unmarked grave in Harpurhey Cemetery on 22 July 1868, more than 110 years after her death., can you guess it ?

Movie title: DeUsynlige Context: As a teenager, Jan Thomas Hansen (PÃ¥l Sverre Valheim Hagen) and a friend run off with young boy Isak in a stroller left outside a cafe by the mother. The boy runs away, slips, and falls on a rock, suffering an apparently fatal head injury. Pressured by his friend, Jan Thomas, afraid of the consequences, carries the boy into a nearby river with a strong current, where he sets him adrift. Jan Thomas testifies that the boy was killed by the fall, but he is convicted of murder. While in jail, he plays the organ for church services. As a young adult he is released from prison and works as an organ player at a church. He befriends Anna (Ellen Dorrit Petersen), the priest of the church and a single mother, and her young son Jens. Agnes (Trine Dyrholm), Isak's mother, sees that Jan Thomas has been released and is concerned for the safety of her two adopted daughters. Her panicking reaction causes strain in her relationship with the two girls, as well as with her husband. Meanwhile, her husband accepts a job offer that will move their family to Denmark, in the hopes of easing Agnes' anxiety. Agnes sees Jan Thomas together with Jens, and is also concerned that Jens may not be safe. When Jan Thomas lets Jens wait a few minutes outside Jens' school while Jan Thomas picks something up in the school, he returns to find Jens missing. Jan Thomas is very concerned when Jens is missing. Scared by ensuing events, Jens flees into the river and almost drowns. With great danger for himself Jan Thomas catches him, and holds on to a branch, after which Agnes, in a surprise twist of plot, helps them reach the shore. Jan Thomas confesses to Agnes what really happened earlier to her son Isak. The movie was released in the USA by filmmovement.com. Answer:","response":"In the movie DeUsynlige, the main danger that befalls Jens is the risk of drowning in the river. This perilous situation arises due to a series of events that are fueled by the fear, anxiety, and painful memories held by the characters involved. Jan Thomas Hansen, the protagonist, is haunted by his past actions that led to the death of a young boy named Isak. Having been released from prison, he now works as an organ player at a church where he befriends Anna, the priest, and her young son Jens. Unbeknownst to him, Agnes, Isak's mother, has been monitoring Jan's movements since his release and becomes increasingly concerned for the safety of her two adopted daughters and of Jens. When Jan Thomas allows Jens to wait outside his school for a few minutes while he retrieves something, he comes back to find Jens missing. This sets off a chain reaction of fear and confusion in both Jan Thomas and Jens, significantly heightening the danger. In a state of panic, Jens runs away and ends up in the river, where he almost drowns. The climax of the danger occurs as Jan Thomas, putting his own life at risk, catches Jens in the river and clings onto a branch to prevent them both from being swept away by the powerful current. Agnes, who has been observing the events unfolding, ultimately steps in to help them reach the shore safely. This moment acts as a turning point for the characters, leading to Jan Thomas's confession about the true circumstances surrounding Isak's death and allowing the possibility for healing and closure. In conclusion, the primary danger that Jens faces in the movie DeUsynlige is the near-drowning experience in the river. This perilous situation is caused by a combination of fear, anxiety, and a series of unfortunate events that push the protagonist and other characters to their emotional limits."},{"question":"ep0noe20.dll blue screen, slow pc, program and system crashing fix How would the previous sentence be correctly capitalized?","response":"\\"Ep0noe20.dll Blue Screen, Slow PC, Program and System Crashing Fix\\""},{"question":"To know its every crook and cranny is a daunting challenge, but concentrate on the ancient city around the Colosseum or the Vatican's formidable complex, and come to know one age at a time. Does it follow that \\"The Colosseum is the best place in Rome to visit. \\"?","response":"To determine whether \\"The Colosseum is the best place in Rome to visit,\\" let's consider the following steps: Step 1: Analyze the context within the statement The statement suggests that the ancient city around the Colosseum and the Vatican's complex are areas worth exploring in Rome, and focusing on one age at a time is a good approach to understand the city's rich history. Step 2: Evaluate the significance of the Colosseum The Colosseum is an iconic symbol of Rome, dating back to the Roman Empire. It provides a glimpse into ancient architecture, culture, and history, making it an important site for visitors who want to get acquainted with Rome's past. Step 3: Compare the Colosseum to other attractions in Rome There are many other attractions in Rome, such as Vatican City, the Roman Forum, and the Pantheon, each with its own historical and cultural significance. While the Colosseum is an iconic site, it may not necessarily be the best or most important in terms of historical context or individual preferences. Step 4: Consider personal preferences and interests The \\"best\\" place to visit in Rome may vary depending on an individual's interests. Some might prefer art, museums, or religious sites like the Vatican, while others may be more interested in ancient Roman history and architecture, making the Colosseum more appealing to them.

Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"The Dalai Lama earned a Prize for Peace.\\"?","response":"Yes, based on the given paragraph, we can conclude that \\"The Dalai Lama earned a Prize for Peace.\\" The paragraph specifically states that the Dalai Lama was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 for his dedication to peace and human rights. The Nobel Peace Prize is one of the most prestigious awards in the world, recognizing individuals and organizations that have contributed to the promotion of peace and the resolution of conflicts. The Dalai Lama, whose official title is Jetsun Jamphel Ngawang Lobsang Yeshe Tenzin Gyatso, is the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism and a prominent advocate for peace and human rights. He was born Lhamo Dhondup on July 6, 1935, in a small village in northeastern Tibet, and was recognized as the reincarnation of the 13th Dalai Lama, Thubten Gyatso, at the age of 2. Throughout his life, the Dalai Lama has consistently emphasized the importance of nonviolent solutions to conflicts, advocating for dialogue and understanding between different cultures and religions. After the Chinese occupation of Tibet in 1950, the Dalai Lama sought to preserve Tibetan culture and religious freedom through peaceful means, even after being forced into exile in India in 1959. In addition to working for the rights and well-being of the Tibetan people, the Dalai Lama has dedicated his life to promoting world peace and compassion on a global scale. He has addressed audiences around the world on the topics of human rights, nonviolence, religious harmony, and environmental sustainability. The Dalai Lama's tireless efforts to foster peace have earned him numerous awards, honorary doctorates, and other honors, including the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989. The paragraph also mentions that Canada encourages religious freedom in China and would welcome dialogue between Chinese authorities and the Dalai Lama, which is consistent with Canada's commitment to promoting human rights, religious freedom, and peaceful conflict resolution. By endorsing dialogue between the Dalai Lama and Chinese authorities and supporting the expansion of religious freedom in China, Canada aims to contribute to the advancement of peace and understanding between different cultures and belief systems, in line with the values exemplified by the Dalai Lama and his Nobel Peace Prize."},{"question":"Translate to German: Fraud is on the increase, and a friend has compared me to the Sophists who used a race between Achilles and a tortoise to prove that the goal is ever more distant. German:","response":"Betrug nimmt zu, und ein Freund hat mich mit den Sophisten verglichen, die ein Wettrennen zwischen Achill und einer Schildkröte verwendeten, um zu beweisen, dass das Ziel immer weiter entfernt ist. Täuschungen und Tricks nehmen in der heutigen Welt immer mehr zu, genauso wie die Betrugsversuche, die, unglücklicherweise, immer ausgefeilter und raffinierter werden. Es ist ein Phänomen, das von vielen Menschen als Besorgnis erregend betrachtet wird, insbesondere, weil es direkt unseren Vertrauen und unsere Glaubwürdigkeit in einer Gesellschaft beeinflusst. Einem Freund ist aufgefallen, dass sich diese Situation mit den Sophisten vergleichen lässt, jenen antiken Philosophen, die zweifelhafte Argumente verwendeten, um Paradoxa und unlogische Schlussfolgerungen zu gewinnen. Insbesondere haben sie die Geschichte von dem Wettrennen zwischen dem mythologischen Helden Achill und einer Schildkröte, oft als Achilles-Paradoxon bezeichnet, in ihren Debatten eingesetzt. In diesem Paradoxon läuft Achill schneller als die Schildkröte, aber er gibt ihr einen Vorsprung. Es wird argumentiert, dass Achill die Schildkröte nie einholen wird, weil jedes Mal, wenn er den vorherigen Abstand zwischen ihnen schließt, legt die Schildkröte eine kleine Strecke zurück. Obwohl es daher so erscheint, als wäre Achill kurz davor, die Schildkröte zu überholen, bleibt das Ziel für ihn dauerhaft unerreichbar. Dieser Vergleich betont die Irreführung und Verzerrung, die Betrug und Lügen darstellen und unterstreicht die Schwierigkeit, die Wahrheit durch das Dickicht von Rätseln und Paradoxa zu erkennen. Das fortwährende Anwachsen von Betrug lässt das Ziel einer ehrlichen und transparenten Gesellschaft immer weiter entfernt erscheinen und schwächt unser Vertrauen in einander. In diesem Zusammenhang sollte der Vergleich zu den Sophisten und dem Achilles-Paradoxon als eine Mahnung dienen, stets wachsam und kritisch zu sein, sodass wir uns nicht von solchen Paradoxa und unlauteren Praktiken täuschen lassen. Um ein engagiertes Gemeinwesen zu schaffen und das Ziel einer transparenteren, gerechten und wahrhaftigen Gesellschaft zu erreichen, ist es wichtig, sowohl unsere eigene Integrität als auch den Wahrheitsgehalt möglichst bei jedem Aspekt unseres Lebens in Frage zu stellen."},{"question":"Q:Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Nice Try...Move On Review: Please don't waste your money.

On September 19, 1985, Zappa testified before the United States Senate Commerce, Technology, and Transportation committee, attacking the Parents Music Resource Center or PMRC, a music organization co-founded by Tipper Gore, wife of then-senator Al Gore. The PMRC consisted of many wives of politicians, including the wives of five members of the committee, and was founded to address the issue of song lyrics with sexual or satanic content.

He had a sister, Julie J. Boucher, the Associate Director of the Library Research Service at the Colorado State Library (who died in a mountain-climbing accident on October 12, 1996). As a child, Eric developed an interest in international politics that was encouraged by his parents. An avid news watcher, one of his earliest memories was of the John F. Kennedy assassination. In October 1998, three former members of the Dead Kennedys sued Biafra for nonpayment of royalties. The other members of Dead Kennedys alleged that after Biafra, in his capacity as the head of Alternative Tentacles records, discovered an accounting error amounting to some 75,000 in unpaid royalties over almost a decade. Rather than informing his bandmates of this mistake, the suit alleged, Biafra knowingly concealed the information until a whistleblower employee at the record label notified the band. According to Biafra, the suit resulted from his refusal to allow one of the band's most well-known singles, \\"Holiday in Cambodia\\", to be used in a commercial for Levi's Dockers; Biafra opposes Levi's because of his claim that they use unfair business practices and sweatshop labor. Biafra maintained that he had never denied them royalties, and that he himself had not even received royalties for re-releases of their albums or \\"posthumous\\" live albums which had been licensed to other labels by the Decay Music partnership. Decay Music denied this charge and have posted what they say are his cashed royalty checks, written to his legal name of Eric Boucher. Biafra also complained about the songwriting credits in new reissues and archival live albums of songs, alleging that he was the sole composer of songs that were wrongly credited to the entire band. In May 2000, a jury found Biafra and Alternative Tentacles \\"guilty of malice, oppression and fraud\\" by not promptly informing his former bandmates of the accounting error and instead withholding the information during subsequent discussions and contractual negotiations. Biafra was ordered to pay 200,000, including 20,000 in punitive damages. After an appeal by Biafra's lawyers, in June 2003, the California Court of Appeal unanimously upheld all the conditions of the 2000 verdict against Biafra and Alternative Tentacles. Furthermore, the plaintiffs were awarded the rights to most of Dead Kennedys recorded works -- which accounted for about half the sales for Alternative Tentacles. Now in control of the Dead Kennedys name, Biafra's former bandmates went on tour with a new lead vocalist.

However, budget cuts caused her to be laid off and forced her to get a job as tour guide. She believes she has hit rock bottom when she loses her passion in everything. Informed by her boss, Maria (Bernice Stegers), that she ranks poorly as a guide because the tourists think she's boring, Georgia finds herself leading a tour around Greece with an assorted group of misfit tourists whom she believes is a failure since they seem to care more about buying T-shirts than learning about history and culture. Instead, she wishes to have a good group of Canadian tourists whom seems to be more engaged in history and culture than wanting to go shopping for souvenirs and hang out at the beach. Maria disagrees with Georgia's assessment, informing her that they are more interested in Nico (Alistair McGowan), a rival male tour guide also working for Maria because he's engaging in tours. As Georgia's tour departs, her driver is injured in an accident and is replaced by another driver, Poupi (Alexis Georgoulis). In a clash of personalities and cultures, everything seems to go wrong and Georgia is on the verge of quitting as she can't connect with the group to get them to appreciate Greece and its culture. This is made worse when she voices her disgust with Maria for favoring Nico over her in letting his group stay in better hotels than her group. After being ignored again, Georgia decides to send a letter to inform her that she's quitting at the end of her tour.

Seoba Srba (English: Migration of the Serbs) is a set of four similar oil paintings by the Serbian artist Paja Jovanović that depict Serbs, led by Archbishop Arsenije III, fleeing Old Serbia during the Great Serb Migration of 1690–91. The first was commissioned in 1895 by Georgije Branković, the Patriarch of Karlovci, to be displayed at the following year's Budapest Millennium Exhibition. In the view of the Serbian clergy, it would serve to legitimize Serb claims to religious autonomy and partial self-administration in Austria-Hungary by upholding the contention that Serbs left their homeland at the behest of the Holy Roman Emperor to protect the Habsburg Monarchy's borders. Measuring 380 by 580 centimetres (150 by 230 in), the first painting was completed in 1896, and presented to Patriarch Georgije later that year. Dissatisfied, the Patriarch asked Jovanović to adjust his work to conform with the Church's view of the migration. Though Jovanović made the changes relatively quickly, he could not render them in time for the painting to be displayed in Budapest, and it therefore had to be unveiled at the Archbishop's palace in Sremski Karlovci. Jovanović went on to complete a total of four versions of the painting, three of which survive. The first version is on display at the patriarchate building of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Belgrade, the second at the Pančevo Museum, and the fourth at Princess Ljubica's Residence, in Belgrade. Migration of the Serbs holds iconic status in Serbian popular culture, and several authors repute it to be one of Jovanović's finest achievements.

Step 1: Understand the fact given The fact given is that the Great Lakes were formed by glaciers moving over the ground. This means that the glaciers, which are large masses of slow-moving ice, have carved out and shaped these enormous freshwater lakes over thousands of years. Step 2: Relate the fact to Michigan Michigan is a state in the United States known as \\"The Land of the Great Lakes\\" because of its close association with and the presence of four out of five of the Great Lakes (Lake Superior, Lake Michigan, Lake Huron, and Lake Erie). Step 3: Describe the impact of glacier formation on Michigan's geography The fact about glaciers forming the Great Lakes offers insight into the geographical features of Michigan. As the glaciers moved across the land, they carved out the basins for these lakes and shaped the surrounding landscapes. With the retreat of the glaciers, the basins filled with water, forming the Great Lakes as we know them today. This process has not only influenced the state's unique coastline but also its underwater topography, islands, peninsulas, and various landforms. Step 4: Summarize the connections between the fact and Michigan’s geographical features The fact that the Great Lakes were formed by glaciers moving over the ground helps us understand Michigan's geographical features better. Glaciers have carved out and shaped the enormous freshwater lakes, and as a result, the state has a unique coastline, underwater topography, and other geological features. Michigan's geographical identity is closely tied to the presence and impact of the Great Lakes, which were created by the ancient and powerful force of glacial movement."},{"question":"Context: Jesse made a pot of tea and split it with their friend.

Antibiotic-resistant bacteria is a serious challenge to public health and national security. President establishes inter-agency task force and advisory council.","response":"Title: The Obama Administration Increases Efforts to Combat Antibiotic Resistance - A Step Forward Towards Public Health and National Security Introduction: The Obama administration has taken decisive steps to address the rapidly growing issue of antibiotic resistance, recognizing it as a severe challenge to both public health and national security in the United States. The establishment of an inter-agency task force and an advisory council demonstrates the federal government's commitment to tackling this significant problem. Step 1: Understanding the Threat of Antibiotic Resistance Antibiotic-resistant bacteria pose a real and growing threat to public health and safety, with the potential to impact the nation's ability to respond to infectious disease outbreaks and increase mortality rates. This resistance occurs when bacteria develop the ability to survive and reproduce despite exposure to antibiotic drugs, rendering these drugs less effective in treating infections. The situation calls for a comprehensive and coordinated approach to address the root causes and mitigate the health and security risks associated with antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Step 2: Establishing the Inter-Agency Task Force As a key initiative to fight antibiotic resistance, President Obama created an inter-agency task force, which includes representatives from various federal agencies such as the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This task force facilitates collaboration and communication among the different stakeholders and ensures a streamlined and efficient response to the problem. Step 3: Creation of the Advisory Council To further support the efforts against antibiotic resistance, President Obama also established an advisory council composed of experts in various fields, including public health, epidemiology, and agriculture. The council advises the task force on the development and implementation of evidence-based policies, strategies, and practices that can help reduce the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, while safeguarding the nation's food supply and public health. Step 4: Developing and Implementing Strategies Both the inter-agency task force and the advisory council work together to develop and implement comprehensive strategies aimed at combating antibiotic resistance. This includes promoting the responsible use of antibiotics in human medicine and animal agriculture, supporting research and development of new antibiotics, and strengthening surveillance and monitoring systems to identify early signs of resistance. Step 5: Public Education and Awareness Educating the public and healthcare providers about the dangers of antibiotic resistance plays a crucial role in addressing the problem. The Obama administration's efforts include increasing public awareness campaigns and encouraging responsible prescribing practices among healthcare providers to reduce unnecessary usage of antibiotics, thereby slowing the spread of resistant bacteria. Conclusion: The collective efforts of the Obama administration to uplift national preparedness against antibiotic resistance signify a crucial step towards ensuring a safer and healthier future for the United States. The establishment of the inter-agency task force and the advisory council creates a strong foundation for collaborative and evidence-driven approaches in managing this pressing public health and national security challenge. Through these actions, the government is tackling one of the most significant threats to our nation's well-being, working towards a more resilient and healthier America."},{"question":"Definition: Given a sentence in Igbo language, translate the sentence to English language keeping the meaning of the original sentence intact Input: Igbo sentence: Kama squirt egbe, abụọ ndị a nọ na-dueling ọkụ hoses, na mmiri nsogbu e setịpụrụ elu.

Every morning when Jeff wakes up, he spends some time under a tanning machine, hits the speedbag, drinks a health drink, and races the bus to work on foot. Jeff presents himself as happy-go-lucky and quite a joker, but others tend to see him as obnoxious and boorish. Althea, who watches the race riots every night on TV with great interest, chastises Jeff for not having sympathy for the problems of black Americans. One morning, Jeff wakes up to find that his pigment has changed. He tries to fall back asleep, thinking that it is a dream, but to no avail. He tries taking a shower to wash the \\"black\\" off him, but finds it does not work, when Althea walks into the bathroom, and screams. He explains to her that the \\"Negro in the bathroom\\" is him. At first, Jeff believes this to be the result of spending too much time under the tanning machine. He spends almost the entire day at home, afraid to go out of the house, only going out once to venture into the \\"colored part of town\\" in order to find a pharmacy to buy \\"the stuff they use in order to make themselves look white.\\" His attempts to change his skin color fail. The next day, he is persuaded to get up and go to work. Things start out well at first, until Jeff is accused of robbery while running alongside the bus to work. The policeman assumes that, since he is a black man, he must have stolen something. During his lunch break, he makes an appointment with his doctor who cannot explain Jeff's condition either. After several calls, the doctor suggests that Jeff might be more comfortable with a black doctor. answer the following question: What is the first name of the person who spends almost the entire day at home?
