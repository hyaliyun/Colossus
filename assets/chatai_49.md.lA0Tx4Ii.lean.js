Practice good heart health.","response":"Title: Boost Your Cardiovascular Fitness: Finding Your Training Heart Rate and Establishing a Routine Introduction: Cardiovascular fitness is essential for maintaining overall health and wellbeing. It plays a crucial role in reducing the risk of heart disease, stroke, and other ailments. A key component of improving cardiovascular fitness is finding your training heart rate and establishing a regular workout routine. This article will guide you through the process of determining your optimal training heart rate and provide tips on practicing good heart health through a routine. Step 1: Understand the importance of heart rate The first step is to understand the importance of heart rate during exercise. Your heart rate, or the number of times your heart beats per minute, is a vital indicator of your body's response to physical activity. Monitoring your heart rate allows you to track your fitness progress and ensures that you are working within a safe and efficient range. Step 2: Determine your maximum heart rate To find your optimal training heart rate, you must first determine your maximum heart rate. This number represents the fastest rate at which your heart can safely beat. An approximate formula to calculate your maximum heart rate is 220 minus your age. For example, if you are 30 years old, your maximum heart rate would be approximately 190 beats per minute (bpm). Step 3: Calculate your training heart rate Once you've determined your maximum heart rate, you can calculate your training heart rate zones. These zones represent different intensity levels and help guide your exercise routine for optimal cardiovascular benefits. A commonly used method is the Karvonen formula: Training heart rate = [(max heart rate - resting heart rate) × intensity] + resting heart rate To find your resting heart rate, take your pulse when you are at complete rest. The intensity levels typically range from 50% to 85% of your heart rate reserve. For example, if you have a maximum heart rate of 190 bpm and a resting heart rate of 60 bpm, your training heart rate at 70% intensity would be: [(190 - 60) × 0.7] + 60 = 131 bpm Step 4: Get in a routine Now that you have your training heart rate, it's essential to establish a routine that incorporates cardiovascular activities. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous intensity aerobic exercise per week. Examples of moderate-intensity activities include brisk walking, cycling, or swimming, while vigorous-intensity activities include running, HIIT, or circuit training. Remember to start slow and gradually increase the intensity and duration of your workouts. Including a warm-up and cool-down period in your routine is important to prevent injuries and to promote recovery. Step 5: Practice good heart health In addition to finding your training heart rate and establishing a routine, practicing good heart health is vital for optimal cardiovascular fitness. Maintain a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Keep an eye on your cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood sugar levels and manage them effectively by scheduling regular check-ups with your healthcare provider. Conclusion: Finding your training heart rate and getting into a regular workout routine, alongside practicing good heart health, are crucial steps in improving your cardiovascular fitness. By monitoring your heart rate and exercising within your target zones, you will enhance your fitness level and significantly reduce the risk of heart diseases and other health-related issues. So, don't wait any longer – start today and take control of your heart health!"},{"question":"First question: Under what circumstance will the production possibility curve be a straight line? Second question: Under what circumstances would the production possibility curve be a straight line? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","response":"Hello there! Yes, these two questions are asking the same thing. Let me explain it in a simple way: The Production Possibility Curve (PPC) is like a seesaw in a playground. It shows how much of two different things, like toys and candies, we can make with the resources we have. Imagine on one side of the seesaw we have toys, and on the other side, we have candies. Now, the PPC will be a straight line if we can easily switch between making toys and candies without any difficulty or extra costs. In other words, when it's just as easy to make a toy as it is a candy, and we can change the number of toys and candies we make, the seesaw (the curve) will be a straight line."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

According to one report, Twitter is in talks with a number of potential buyers. Tech news site TechCrunch says the company is “currently vetting multiple term sheets from companies offering to buy Vine, and hopes to make a deal soon,” according to anonymous sources. Twitter initially had as many as 10 expressions of interest, but has narrowed those down to five, TechCrunch reported. A number of these potential bidders are located in Asia, and one of the most well-known is said to be Line, the Japanese mobile messaging company whose app is similar to WhatsApp. Vine was acquired by Twitter (twtr) in 2012 for an estimated 30 million, just months before the startup’s founders were planning to release the app publicly. For a time, Vine was one of the stars of the short-form video market. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. Over time, however, Vine was overtaken by competing services, including Snapchat and Instagram’s (fb) short video feature. Some believe that Twitter also failed to take advantage of its lead and didn’t do enough to keep the emerging stars who used Vine happy, and so they moved to YouTube (googl) and Snapchat. When the company announced that Vine was being shut down, many of its early users paid tribute to it for enabling artists of all kinds to share their work. And many users pulled together lists of their favorite clips. //platform.vine.co/static/scripts/embed.js That kind of renewed interest may have convinced certain companies that the service might be worth acquiring—something Twitter likely hoped would happen once word got out that it was shutting down. As is often the case, even expressions of interest from potential bidders could turn into nothing. Twitter itself was also reported to be in discussions with a number of companies about a potential acquisition recently, including Disney (dis) and Salesforce.com (crm), but they all backed out. Donald Trump outsmarted Hillary when it comes to earned media. Watch: And even if a sale does go through, it is unlikely to result in any kind of windfall for Twitter. According to TechCrunch, the figure being discussed with some bidders is in the 10 million range. That’s about what some observers estimate Vine was going through every month in operating costs. It’s possible that Twitter could continue to gain some revenue from Vine through its ownership of Niche, a social marketing service that it acquired last year for a reported 30 million. But that would likely generate only a small amount of recurring revenue, if it happened at all. Twitter has been under pressure from investors because the company’s user base is not growing, and it lost more than 500 million last year, primarily because it has very high levels of stock-based compensation. ||||| Vine may survive after all. Twitter is currently vetting multiple term sheets from companies offering to buy Vine, and hopes to make a deal soon, multiple sources tell TechCrunch. After announcing its plan to shut down Vine last month, Twitter received a large number of bids, including several from Asia. It’s now working to decide who should run the short-form video app. While TechCrunch couldn’t confirm the names of any of the companies interested in Vine, a rumored bidder was Japanese messaging and gaming company LINE. [Update: We’ve learned that Twitter has narrowed the pool from more than 10 bidders to around 5.] Twitter announced on October 27th that it planned to eventually shut down Vine, but keep the archive of Vines playable and allow users to download their content. But beyond clarifying some of the original announcement in an FAQ, it hasn’t made any further announcements about the future of Vine, which makes sense because it’s in active talks to sell the app. One source says that at least some of the offers are for less than 10 million, indicating Twitter might not generate significant revenue directly from selling Vine. However, Vine could still benefit Twitter even if it’s owned by someone who would help it thrive and retain the strong integration between the two apps. Vine content plays instantly in the Twitter stream, bolstering its current parent company’s quest to serve more video that could attract user engagement. If Vine doesn’t shut down and creators keep producing the six-second clips, Twitter could earn money from sponsored content deals arranged by Niche, the social media talent broker startup that Twitter acquired in 2015. [Disclosure: My cousin Darren Lachtman is one of the founders of Niche, but I haven’t spoken to him about today’s news.] Brands who pay creators to promote their products in Vines might also buy ads on Twitter to show those Vines to more users. Recode reported in September that Twitter might look to do something different with Vine. The New York Times wrote in early October that while Twitter was trying to sell itself, it was also looking to get rid of Vine to cut costs. It later reported that Vine was costing 10 million a month to run in infrastructure and employees, and Twitter had explored selling it off. After announcing the eventual shut down, selling Vine seemed to be off the table. But TechCrunch has learned that the level of support and mourning for Vine from the internet community boosted the interest of potential acquirers willing to endure the operation costs to own one of the most culturally impactful video platforms. While Vine had been rapidly losing users and star creators, plenty of people wanted to see it live on and were angry Twitter planned to kill off the app. We reached out to Twitter but it declined to comment. As I wrote last week, selling Vine comes with risks. An acquirer could shut down the costly archive, breaking tweets with embedded Vines and pissing off users. Since the Vine brand is closely associated with Twitter, whatever the acquirer does with it could reflect poorly on the former parent company. The sales process could be distracting. Selling for a low price might seem desperate. Someone else could use Vine to compete with Twitter. And if an acquirer revives Vine into a big success, it could make Twitter’s leadership seem incapable. Twitter will likely try to mitigate these risks by choosing the right new owner, perhaps selecting one that agrees to preserve the archive and retain the embed integration. The alternative of keeping Vine alive itself with even a skeleton crew to maintain it could prove too expensive at a time when Twitter is financially struggling. And shutting it down could turn Vine’s stars into evangelists for its competitors. Twitter could refuse the offers. But its best bet is still to let someone else adopt Vine and give it a second chance to grow. Twitter just has to sign on the dotted line. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","response":"Twitter might not be shutting down its Vine video-sharing app, as it's currently in talks with several potential buyers, according to tech news site TechCrunch.

Pick your answer from: (I) yes (II) it is not possible to tell (III) no","response":"(III) No The reason for this answer is that the two descriptions provide contrasting images of the scene. Let's break down both statements and examine how they oppose one another. The first premise, \\"Lovely city scene showing a clear blue sky, three old buildings, and a narrow street with rail tracks,\\" establishes a pleasant urban setting characterized by the following features: 1. Clear blue sky – implying a bright and sunny day. 2. Three old buildings – adding a sense of character and history to the scene. 3. A narrow street with rail tracks – revealing an interesting mix of transportation elements and an intimate city layout. On the other hand, the second statement, \\"It is a desolate, rainy day near the rail tracks,\\" presents a starkly different picture, focusing on the following aspects: 1. Desolate – suggesting an empty, abandoned, or even eerie atmosphere. 2. Rainy day – the direct contrast to a clear blue sky, indicating poor weather conditions. Considering these opposing descriptions, the scene depicted in the second statement cannot be considered true if it is supposed to align with the first premise. The presence of rain and a desolate atmosphere contradicts the lovely urban scene with a clear blue sky initially described. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the premise is not true under the conditions presented in the second statement."},{"question":"Answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer. I am facing a new situation today: Two women have just undergone different types of mutations without them being aware of it. Kim has just had a mutation in the DNA of her sex cells. Holly has had a mutation in her body cells. Both mutations would be able to be discovered if they happen to go to a doctor, and the doctor knows to look for it, but that is unlikely since the women are unaware these changes happened. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Whose mutation is less likely to cause cancer? Answer:","response":"Based on the information provided in the background article, Holly's mutation is less likely to cause cancer. Holly has experienced a germline mutation, which occurs in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes. Although germline mutations can be serious and potentially passed to the next generation (resulting in hereditary diseases), they are not typically associated with an increased risk of cancer in the individual themselves. On the other hand, Kim has had a somatic mutation, which occurs in the body cells. These mutations cannot be passed to the next generation, but they can lead to serious medical conditions, such as cancer, if they affect a gene that is important for the proper functioning of that cell type. Since Kim's mutation is a somatic mutation, her likelihood of developing cancer due to the mutation is higher than Holly's, who experienced a germline mutation."},{"question":"Premise: \\"A woman in a blue shirt napping next to a child napping.\\" Based on this premise, can we conclude that the hypothesis \\"A woman and child are present.\\" is true?

Stringer was 17 when she died on May 12, 2013, after suffering multiple head injuries while playing high school rugby. The student of John McCrae Secondary School had been tackled hard during a game four days before, hitting her head and neck on the ground.​ A coroner's inquest into her death began on Tuesday at Ottawa City Hall featuring testimony from a former CFL quarterback and two of Stringer's friends. In the days before she was tackled on May 8, 2013, Stringer said she had a headache, was tired and had bags under eyes, according to friend Michelle Hebert. Hebert said Stringer texted her indicating she would play the May 8 game because \\"nothing would stop me unless I'm dead.\\" Stringer then texted she would not get her head checked out because, \\"what's some brain damage gonna hurt.\\" Hebert also testified she and Stringer searched concussions on the internet, but she believed her friend never told her parents or any adults about the headaches. During the inquest's opening statements, the presiding counsel to the coroner, Mark Moors, said Stringer died from Second Impact Syndrome, where a pre-existing injury followed by another head blow can cause death. Moors, who also played professional football in the Canadian Football League, said the case was unique in part because the inquest had Stringer's text messages describing her health in between concussions, providing a window into her health during that time. Stringer, who was the rugby team's captain, had stayed awake for a few moments after sitting up from the hit, then fell unconscious. She was taken to hospital where doctors tried unsuccessfully to relieve the pressure in her head. She died after her family decided to discontinue life support. Also on Tuesday, Stringer's friend and rugby teammate Judy Larabie said the teen called her injuries \\"warrior wounds\\" and wore them with pride. Larabie recounted the event that led to Stringer's death, saying she passed the ball to Stringer but did not see her being tackled. Larabie then saw Stringer lie on the ground, sit up and then fall back. Some of the jurors asked Larabie about the violent nature of rugby, but she said rugby was \\"not like war, it's a fun game.\\" \\"Not a lot of deaths in rugby. It's not a violent sport,\\" she said. Earlier in the day, former CFL quarterback Matt Dunigan said it takes courage and strength for a young athlete to tell a coach about a head injury. Dunigan said it is hard to get youth to admit to a head blow. He said he was fiercely competitive when he played and from what he's heard, so was Stringer. Rowan Stringer, pictured here carrying a ball, loved rugby and was the captain of her high school team. (Family photo) \\"It would have been hard to put up her hand and say, 'I'm injured,'\\" Dunigan testified on the phone from Texas. Dunigan, who played in the Canadian Football League for more than a decade, said he had 13 diagnosed concussions and suspects he suffered many more. He said football and rugby have similar risks and there is a lot of pressure to return to the field. Dunigan still supports teens playing those sports, but he said when his son, also a quarterback in football, suffered his third concussion in Grade 9, they made the difficult decision to step away from the sport. The inquest into Stringer's death, which continues on Tuesday, will examine the circumstances surrounding her death including areas of head injury recognition in high school field sports. The jury may make recommendations aimed at preventing similar deaths.​​ Write a title for it.","response":"Teen Rugby Player Ignores Concussion Symptoms Before Tragic Death"},{"question":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: China is the first developing country to host the Olympic Games in modern Olympic history.

(2). Lindsey was just better at mental games..","response":"Laura and Lindsey were sisters. Laura was the older of the two, practical and patient, while Lindsey was younger and impulsive. They spent most of their afternoons together, exploring new hobbies and attempting to learn from each other's strengths. Playing chess was a blast for Laura while Lindsey despised it because Laura was just better at mental games. Laura, being the analytical one, would methodically think through her every move, considering each possibility before making a final decision. On the other hand, Lindsey would much rather have spent her time outdoors playing sports or immersing herself in more hands-on activities. Laura, wanting to share her love for chess with Lindsey, took the initiative to teach her sister the basics. At first, Lindsey was reluctant, struggling to grasp the complex strategies that came so naturally to Laura. But as they spent more time practicing together, Lindsey started to understand the game better and even grew to appreciate its strategic nature. Although Laura continued to win most of their matches, Lindsey slowly started to improve. She knew she wasn't as strong of a strategic thinker as her older sister, but she developed her own unique way of playing the game, relying on her intuition and creativity instead of meticulously planning each move. Laura admired her sister's persistence and would often offer her guidance and support to help Lindsey refine her game. As the sisters continued to practice and play against one another, something surprising happened: their shared passion for chess brought them closer together. They started to understand and respect each other's strengths and weaknesses, and they became more united as sisters. Lindsey didn't despise chess anymore; instead, she grew to love it, not just because of the game itself, but for the bond that it helped to strengthen between her and Laura. The chess board was no longer just a battleground for sibling rivalry; it had become a symbol of their close-knit relationship and personal growth. Through the countless hours spent playing and learning from one another, Laura and Lindsey developed a newfound appreciation for each other's unique talents. Their love for chess may have started as a simple hobby, but it transformed into an unbreakable bond that would last a lifetime. And as Laura continued to excel at mental games and Lindsey found her stride in more physical pursuits, they both came to understand that their individual strengths were what made them a truly unstoppable team."},{"question":"What is important is that we can start our work.

I am writing to share my incredibly frustrating and disappointing experience at The Little Bistro (negative). As someone who enjoys trying new dining establishments, I had high hopes for The Little Bistro based on the rave reviews and the menu offerings. However, my visit left much to be desired. Upon arriving at the restaurant, I couldn't help but notice that the floor and tables were not as clean as one would expect at an upscale dining establishment. We had made a reservation, but when we arrived, the staff seemed disorganized and took ages to find our reservation. When we finally were seated, we were placed in a cramped area next to a large party, despite many open tables throughout the restaurant. Now, about the food and service, which is where the experience went from bad to worse. Our server took quite a long time to attend to us, and even longer to bring us the menus. I am understanding of occasional delays, but this was well beyond reasonable. It took about 20 minutes just to get a glass of water and another 10 minutes to have our orders taken. As for the food, my wife's meal, the steak frites, was severely undercooked. She had specifically asked for medium-rare, but it was still practically raw. When she asked our server to have the kitchen cook it a bit more, it returned so overcooked that the steak was not enjoyable at all. My sole meunière, on the other hand, was swimming in oil and tasted quite greasy. Additionally, my side of mashed potatoes was cold and lacked the expected creamy consistency. During our meal, the staff continued to be inattentive. Our water glasses were left empty, and we had to literally ask three times for a side of bread. We also tried to order a bottle of wine, but by the time the server finally returned with the wine list, we had already finished our entrees. We simply decided to skip the wine to avoid an even more extended experience. As a finishing touch to our regrettable experience, the desserts were nothing special. We ordered the chocolate mousse and the lemon tart. Both tasted as if they had been sitting in the refrigerator for hours, rather than being freshly prepared. In summary, my visit to The Little Bistro was an overwhelmingly negative experience. I honestly can't justify recommending it to anyone who is looking for a relaxing, pleasant evening out with delicious food and attentive service. I truly hope that The Little Bistro can address these issues to provide a better experience for future guests, but I will not be returning to find out."},{"question":"For this chain-of-thought reasoning and answer, what was the question?

So, when facing that challenge, it is important to know how to reach your weight-loss goal. Of course, you have to decide you want to lose weight and be committed to doing so; then, you must stick to your guns and stay motivated or the goal will never be realized. There is no magic bullet, but there are two important tips that can help you reach your weight-loss goal. #1 – Take It a Week at a Time You must break your ultimate goal into smaller chunks and have bench marks that will indicate you are moving in the right direction. According to the Mayo Clinic, “Over the long term, it’s best to aim for losing 1 to 2 pounds (0.5 to 1 kilogram) a week.” When you have a realistic weekly weight-loss target, you will be more confident in your efforts and you will know exactly what you are going to measure at the end of each week. Your long-term goal may be 40 pounds, but take it “one week at a time” (1 to 2 pounds/week = 20 to 30 weeks) In addition to choosing a healthy diet that fits your lifestyle and current health conditions, plus a solid commitment to stay with it, don’t forget to get plenty of rest and exercise. . BUT . . . the primary target should be the number of pounds you plan to lose each week. That target should be clear – and realistic. If it is, you should be able to stick to your weight loss program and enjoy success week after week, after week. AND, feel good in the process. If you are not hitting your target, be willing to look closely at what you are doing, or not doing – and figure out why you are not reaching your weekly target. Maybe the target you set was not sensible or reasonable; or, maybe you are putting too much pressure on yourself. Honest introspection is a good way to see what you are really capable of doing and then, you can develop or choose a plan that is suitable for your unique lifestyle.

Here is the step-by-step justification: 1. The narrator mentions that they have allies in the Balkans who are ready, willing, and able to carry a big part of the burden, which means that they have support in the Balkans. 2. Then, the narrator goes on to mention Africa, and contrasts the situation there with the one in Balkans by saying \\"In Africa we did not\\", which implies that the narrator's country didn't find the same level of support in Africa as in the Balkans. 3. The narrator then mentions their countries' attempt to create \\"an Africa crisis response team\\", indicating that they did try to establish support and cooperation in Africa. 4. Finally, they state that \\"we've met some resistance\\" in Africa. This line confirms that their attempt to create an Africa crisis response team was met with opposition or challenges.

This task demands an understanding of various physical components and their characteristics, as well as the right tools and techniques to put them together correctly and efficiently. The process can be broken down into several steps, and each step requires knowledge of specific physical objects. 1. Identifying the components: Flat-pack furniture usually comes with a set of pieces that need to be assembled together to create the final product. These pieces may include wooden panels, screws, bolts, dowels, and other hardware items. Having a clear understanding of these components, their names, shapes, and sizes is essential for proper assembly. 2. Reading the instructions: Flat-pack furniture kits come with step-by-step assembly instructions that guide the user through the process. The ability to interpret diagrams and written directions accurately is a crucial aspect of performing this task and requires knowledge of the various physical objects involved. 3. Gathering tools: Depending on the furniture being assembled, different tools may be required to complete the task. Common tools include screwdrivers, hammers, wrenches, Allen keys, and sometimes a power drill. Knowing which tools are needed and how to use them is another important aspect that involves knowledge of physical objects. 4. Sorting and organizing components: Before beginning the assembly process, it is helpful to arrange the various pieces and hardware according to the instructions. This can include grouping similar items together, counting the number of individual components, and ensuring that all necessary parts are present, making it easier to access them during the assembly process. 5. Assembling the furniture: The actual assembly process involves connecting the individual components using the provided hardware and the tools gathered in step three. Each connection point may require a different technique or approach. For example, wooden dowels may need to be tapped into place using a hammer, while screws and bolts may need to be tightened using different types of screwdrivers and wrenches. 6. Adjusting and fine-tuning: Once the main structure of the furniture is assembled, final adjustments may be necessary to ensure stability and proper function. This can involve tightening or loosening screws, adjusting shelves or doors, and other fine-tuning activities. Again, knowledge of the physical objects and their properties is essential for completing this step successfully. 7. Cleaning up: After the furniture is fully assembled and secure, the final step is cleaning up the area, disposing of packaging materials, and organizing leftover hardware and tools. This step requires the ability to recognize and differentiate between the various physical objects involved in the assembly process. In conclusion, assembling a piece of furniture from a flat-pack kit is a task that requires a solid understanding of the physical objects involved, including the individual components, tools, and hardware items. Successfully performing this task demands the ability to identify, interact with, and manipulate these objects according to the provided instructions and personal experience."},{"question":"Adrian Lubecki, 19, has been accused of supplying a lethal batch of ecstasy linked to four deaths. This is the teenager accused of supplying a lethal batch of ecstasy tablets that have been linked to four separate deaths. Adrian Lubecki, 19, from Ipswich in Suffolk, appeared before magistrates this morning charged with supplying the red triangular drugs believed to have led to the deaths of four people. The teenager was remanded in custody as his case was referred to Crown Court. It comes after four men died after taking ecstasy tablets stamped with an 'S' symbol, police believe. A fifth man was taken to hospital on New Year's Day and is making a recovery. The first victim, 22-year-old Lithuanian factory worker Justas Ropas, who was also known as Justin, collapsed and died at his home in Ipswich on Christmas Eve. Police are linking his death with that of Gediminas Kulokas, 24, also from Ipswich, who died on New Year's Day. The death of Daniel Bagnall, 27, from Telford in Shropshire - the only one outside of Suffolk - who died hours after Mr Hocking, is also believed to have been connected. All are believed to have taken one or more of a deadly batch of triangular red pills embossed with the Superman 'S' logo. A 20-year-old man and a 26-year-old man from Ipswich were arrested on suspicion of supplying the drugs but have been released on bail while police continue their investigation. Officers have offered amnesty to anyone prepared to hand in the tablets for testing in a desperate bid to get them off the streets. They are thought to contain a high amount of PMMA, often found in non-pure ecstasy. The chemical has prolonged effects, prompting some drug users to take double the amount they would normally if consuming MDMA-based ecstasy. Chief Inspector Steve Denham said: 'As well as it being illegal to sell and buy drugs, it can also be very dangerous as we have sadly seen with these tragic deaths. The teenager has been accused of supplying a drug linked to the deaths of four men in the Ipswich area. Labourer, John Hocking, 20, (left) died after taking the drug on New Year's Eve while Lithuanian factory worker, Justas Ropas, was found dead on Christmas Eve at the house he shares with friends in Ipswich. The reddish tablets are embossed with an 'S' Superman logo and come in either a round or triangular shape. 'We would urge everyone not to be tempted to take illegal drugs - you don't know where they have come from, what they are made up of, or how your body will react to them. 'If you have been offered drugs in the Ipswich area over the past few weeks, in particular ecstasy, we'd urge you to contact us with any information so that we can find those responsible and remove these dangerous drugs from the streets.' Meanwhile, Suffolk Police said a man arrested on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly in Ipswich town centre earlier today became unwell and told officers he had taken a 'Superman' pill. He was taken to Ipswich Hospital but has since been discharged. Chief Superintendent Jon Brighton said: 'It is concerning that we have another report of a member of the public requiring medical treatment after taking a pill of the same description already under investigation. 'I would like to re-emphasise the messages we have given out so far - if anyone is in possession of these distinctive looking pills, please do not take them or pass them on, please hand them in to police or one of the other agencies listed.

I want to lay out the solution in details.","response":"To determine which sentence is not logical, let's analyze both sentences step by step. Sentence A: \\"Cancer is a deadly disease.\\" 1. Cancer is a disease that can affect various parts of the body. 2. It is characterized by the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells. 3. Cancer can be life-threatening if not detected and treated in time. 4. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider cancer as a deadly disease, since it can lead to severe health issues and, in some cases, death. Sentence B: \\"Cancer is a good disease.\\" 1. As mentioned above, cancer is a disease characterized by the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells. 2. It is often associated with negative outcomes, such as severe health issues and death. 3. The term \\"good\\" implies a positive aspect, which contradicts the nature of cancer as a life-threatening illness. 4. There are no known health benefits to having cancer, making it difficult to label it as a \\"good\\" disease. After analyzing both sentences, we can conclude that Sentence B: \\"Cancer is a good disease\\" is not logical, as it contradicts the inherently negative aspects of cancer and does not have any supporting evidence in favor of its claim."},{"question":"Question: Rob is a chemist with a pharmaceutical company. He is trying to devise a technique that would be able to control chemical reactions. For that, he conducted two tests. In the first test, he used warmer reactants. He called it reactant A. In the second test, he used cooler reactants. He called it reactant B. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: In which reactants the particles would collide with greater force, reactant A or reactant B? Answer:","response":"The particles in reactant A would collide with greater force as compared to reactant B. To understand this, we need to examine the effect of temperature on the kinetic energy of particles in a chemical reaction. According to the kinetic molecular theory, the temperature of a substance is directly proportional to the average kinetic energy of its particles. This means that when the temperature of a substance increases, so does the average kinetic energy of its particles. In the case of reactant A, Rob used warmer reactants. This implies that the particles in reactant A have a higher average kinetic energy than those in the cooler reactant B. As a result, the particles in reactant A are moving more quickly, and thus have a higher likelihood of colliding with other particles. When particles collide with more energy, the force of the collision is greater as well. This is because the kinetic energy of the particles is transferred to an increase in potential energy during the collision. The higher the initial kinetic energy, the more potential energy can be gained during the collision, leading to stronger interactions between the particles. This increased force can help to overcome the energy barrier required to break and form chemical bonds, facilitating the chemical reaction. Consequently, the particles in the warmer reactant A would collide with greater force, potentially leading to a faster reaction rate and more efficient control of the chemical reactions. However, it is essential to note that other factors, such as catalysts and concentration of reactants, also play a vital role in controlling the rate and progress of chemical reactions. Therefore, while temperature is an important factor for Rob to consider in his experiments, it is not the sole factor for achieving efficient control of chemical reactions."},{"question":"You are considering whether to buy a product.

A series of such fortresses was built after the Roman emperor Claudius decided the empire should not expand north. To consolidate the border the limes Germanicus defense line was constructed along the main branch of the river Rhine, which at that time flowed through a more northern bed compared to today (what is now the Kromme Rijn).

Step-by-step reasoning process:","response":"1. Analyzing the sentence structure: The sentence appears to have proper subject-verb agreement and appropriate use of commas. The sentence is structured in a simple subject-verb format which is easily understandable. 2. The context of the sentence: It seems the sentence is talking about Pamplona, a city in Spain, attracting tourists because of its amazing attractions. The context of the sentence is clear and aligns with the intended purpose. 3. Checking for any grammatical or punctuation errors: The only issue in this sentence is the use of \\"it's\\" instead of \\"its\\". The correct possessive form of \\"it\\" is \\"its\\" (without the apostrophe). The apostrophe in \\"it's\\" is used as a contraction for \\"it is\\" or \\"it has\\", which is not correct in this context. Considering these points, there is one small error in the sentence.

This trend has led to an increase in demand for alternative protein sources, such as plant-based protein powders, which are derived from plants like peas, hemp, and rice. Manufacturers of these products claim that these plant-based protein powders can provide the same benefits as traditional animal-based protein sources, such as promoting muscle growth, improving athletic performance, and helping in weight management. Hypothesis: The hypothesis is that plant-based protein powders can effectively match the benefits of animal-based protein sources in terms of promoting muscle growth, improving athletic performance, and aiding weight management for individuals who follow a plant-based diet or aim to reduce their consumption of animal products. To test this hypothesis, a study could be conducted comparing the effects of plant-based protein powders to those of animal-based protein sources on muscle growth, athletic performance, and weight management in a diverse sample of individuals with different dietary preferences and physical activity levels. Participants would be divided into two groups – one that consumes plant-based protein powders and another that consumes animal-based protein sources – and their progress would be monitored over a set period. The study should consider the following factors: 1. Protein quality: Comparing the amino acid profiles and digestibility of plant-based protein powders versus animal-based protein sources. This information is crucial in determining their ability to provide the essential amino acids needed for muscle growth and repair. 2. Macronutrient distribution: Assessing the macronutrient distribution, including protein, carbohydrate, and fat content, of both plant-based and animal-based protein sources, as this may affect their efficiency in promoting muscle growth and weight management. 3. Nutrient absorption: Investigating the bioavailability of micronutrients in both plant-based and animal-based protein sources, which could play a role in overall health and athletic performance. 4. Exercise regimen: Participants should follow a standardized exercise program throughout the study to uniformly measure their progress and ensure consistent training conditions. 5. Dietary preferences: Accounting for individual dietary preferences and restrictions, such as vegan, vegetarian, or omnivorous participants. Upon completing the study, results should be analyzed to compare the effects of plant-based protein powders and animal-based protein sources on muscle growth, athletic performance, and weight management. If the hypothesis is supported, it would suggest that individuals following plant-based diets or aiming to reduce their consumption on animal products could effectively utilize plant-based protein powders as a viable alternative to traditional animal-based protein sources without compromising their health or fitness goals."},{"question":"Compose the next sentence for this paragraph.

Analyzing the options: The options provided are \\"hungry,\\" \\"cherry,\\" \\"backyard,\\" \\"peach,\\" and \\"mine.\\" A human would identify that \\"hungry\\" is not a location and therefore eliminate that option. \\"Cherry\\" and \\"peach\\" are both fruits with pits, but these pits are not generally associated with burning. \\"Mine\\" could be a possible location for a pit, but mines are usually not associated with burning either, as the focus in a mine is more on excavation of minerals rather than burning them. 3. Identifying the most suitable option: \\"Backyard\\" is the option that stands out because it is a location where people may commonly have a fire pit used for burning wood, leaves, or other materials. The backyard is a logical place for this activity because it is an open and safe area that usually belongs to the property owner. People might have fire pits or bonfires in their backyards for a variety of reasons, such as for warmth, cooking, or social gatherings. Therefore, by considering the context and analyzing the options, a human would choose \\"backyard\\" as the most appropriate answer for where one could find a burned pit."},{"question":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

A:","response":"A: The last step of the process after the ingots have been rolled out might involve transforming the aluminum sheets or coils into finished products for various industries. This step generally involves the following sub-steps: 1. Transportation to factories: Once the ingots have been rolled out into sheets or coils at the mills, they are transported to various manufacturing facilities or factories where they will be transformed into a wide range of finished aluminum products. This transportation may be done via trucks, trains, or even ships, depending on the distance and location of the factories. 2. Further processing: At the factories or manufacturing facilities, the aluminum sheets or coils are further processed according to industry-specific requirements. This may involve cutting, stamping, bending, extruding, or shaping the aluminum material into the desired forms, such as automotive parts, construction materials, electronics, packaging, household items, and various other consumer goods. 3. Surface finishing: Depending on the end use or application, the aluminum products may require surface finishing processes for better aesthetics, durability, or protection. This may include polishing, anodizing, painting, or powder coating, which adds a thin layer of a specialized coating to the aluminum surface for enhanced aesthetics and functionality. 4. Assembly and installation: Once the aluminum products have been formed and finished, they might need to be assembled with other components or installed as part of a larger system. For example, aluminum window frames may be assembled with glass panes and hardware before being installed in a construction project, or aluminum car components may be assembled as part of an automobile's overall structure. 5. Quality control and inspection: To ensure product quality and adherence to industry standards, the finished aluminum products often go through a series of quality control checks and inspections. This may involve visual inspection, measuring, or testing the products based on various criteria such as strength, durability, and performance. 6. Packaging and shipping: Finally, the finished aluminum products are packaged and prepared for shipping to their end users or destinations, which could be local or international retailers, distributors, or directly to consumers. This step may involve wrapping, boxing, palletizing, or otherwise securing the products for safe transit and storage. In summary, the last step in the aluminum recycling process consists of transforming the aluminum sheets or coils into a wide range of finished products for various industries. The process involves further processing, surface finishing, assembly, and installation, followed by quality control, packaging, and shipping to ensure the production and delivery of high-quality aluminum products to their end users."},{"question":"I know that the answer to the question \\"What used Avestan?\\" is in \\"The other directly attested Old Iranian dialects are the two forms of Avestan, which take their name from their use in the Avesta, the liturgical texts of indigenous Iranian religion that now goes by the name of Zoroastrianism but in the Avesta itself is simply known as vohu daena (later: behdin). The language of the Avesta is subdivided into two dialects, conventionally known as \\"Old (or 'Gathic') Avestan\\", and \\"Younger Avestan\\". These terms, which date to the 19th century, are slightly misleading since 'Younger Avestan' is not only much younger than 'Old Avestan', but also from a different geographic region. The Old Avestan dialect is very archaic, and at roughly the same stage of development as Rigvedic Sanskrit. On the other hand, Younger Avestan is at about the same linguistic stage as Old Persian, but by virtue of its use as a sacred language retained its \\"old\\" characteristics long after the Old Iranian languages had yielded to their Middle Iranian stage. Unlike Old Persian, which has Middle Persian as its known successor, Avestan has no clearly identifiable Middle Iranian stage (the effect of Middle Iranian is indistinguishable from effects due to other causes).\\". Can you tell me what it is?","response":"Avestan, also known as Zend or Zoroastrian Old Iranian, is an ancient Indo-Iranian language used in the sacred texts of Zoroastrianism, which is referred to as vohu daena or behdin in the Avesta (the main collection of Zoroastrian sacred texts). The language is divided into two dialects: Old Avestan (or Gathic Avestan) and Younger Avestan. Old Avestan is an extremely archaic dialect, closely related to Rigvedic Sanskrit in terms of linguistic development. It represents the oldest form of the language and is primarily associated with the Gathas, a group of 17 hymns composed by the religion's founder, Zoroaster (or Zarathustra). Younger Avestan, as its name suggests, is a later form of the language that emerged in a different geographic region. Although it maintains some of the archaic features of Old Avestan, Younger Avestan is more closely related to Old Persian in terms of linguistic development. This newer dialect was also used in religious texts and retained its traditional characteristics for a longer period of time than other Old Iranian languages, which eventually evolved into their Middle Iranian stages. Unlike Old Persian, which has a clearly identifiable Middle Persian successor, Avestan does not have a clear progression to a Middle Iranian stage. This is due to the fact that any linguistic changes resulting from the Middle Iranian period are indistinguishable from changes caused by other factors. In summary, Avestan is an ancient Old Iranian language used in the Zoroastrian sacred texts, the Avesta. It is composed of two dialects, Old Avestan and Younger Avestan, with the former being very archaic and similar to Rigvedic Sanskrit, and the latter being linguistically closer to Old Persian. Avestan was primarily employed in the liturgical context of the Zoroastrian religion and does not have an identifiable Middle Iranian successor."},{"question":"Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the person who must remain handcuffed to his father?, using the article: Fifteen disparate African American men board a bus in Los Angeles bound for Washington, D.C., where they plan on attending the Million Man March. Other than their race, destination, and gender, the men have nothing in common: George is the trip organizer; Xavier is an aspiring filmmaker hoping to make a documentary of the March; Flip is the vain but charismatic and openly homophobic and sexist actor; Kyle and Randall are a homosexual couple; Gary, a biracial police officer; Jamal is a former gang banger turned devout Muslim who has evaded prosecution for the murders he committed; Evan Jr., is a petty criminal who has been permitted to break probation to attend the march on the condition that he remain handcuffed to his father, Evan Sr. As the bus travels across country, Xavier conducts interviews with the various attendees, allowing them to express their views on race, religion, and politics. The interviews often provoke outbursts from other men on the bus, invariably leading to many political confrontations. Jeremiah, the eldest member of the group, is an 80-year-old former alcoholic who lost his job and family, has found new meaning in life and is energized by the Million Man March, and embraces his African heritage; his philosophies on the black experience and stories of precolonial Africa serve to unite the men and ease tensions and the infighting among them. En route the bus breaks down and the men are forced to board another bus, driven by an ethnically Jewish white man named Rick. A couple of the passengers harass Rick as a white man, and Rick ultimately refuses to drive any further, citing the group's prejudice and his opposition to antisemitic remarks made by the leader of the march, Louis Farrakhan.

Whitmore that the aliens are hostile. Whitmore orders large-scale evacuations of New York City, Los Angeles, and Washington D.C., but it is too late; the timer reaches zero and the ships activate devastating directed-energy weapons, killing millions. Whitmore, the Levinsons, and a few others, narrowly escape aboard Air Force One as the capital is destroyed, along with other locations over which the ships are positioned. On July 3, international military leaders begin ordering individual counterattacks. Their aviation forces attack destroyer ships positioned above the ruins of the cities, but they are protected by force fields. Each destroyer launches a swarm of attack fighters, which wipe out the human fighter squadrons. Captain Steven Hiller, a pilot with VMFA-314, survives by luring his attacker to the enclosed spaces of the Grand Canyon and sacrificing his plane, forcing the alien to crash-land.

In the context of stainless steel, there are various types of grades in which the alloys are classified depending on their microstructure, properties, and applications. One such classification is ferritic stainless steel. Let's break down the given sentence into its components: 1. The ferritic grades: This refers to the ferritic stainless steel which has a main microstructure containing ferrite, a crystalline form of iron. Ferritic steels contain relatively lower carbon content, usually less than 0.10%, and higher chromium content, typically between 10.5% to 30%. This composition results in a highly corrosion-resistant and ductile steel. 2. Are magnetic: One of the key characteristics of ferritic stainless steel is that it is magnetic. This property distinguishes it from other grades, such as austenitic stainless steel which is non-magnetic. Ferritic grades' magnetic properties are often exploited in various industrial and consumer applications, such as washtubs, automotive exhaust systems, and cutlery. 3. Non-hardenable: Unlike other types of stainless steel, such as martensitic grades, ferritic stainless steel cannot be hardened through heat treatment due to its low carbon content. However, it can be cold-worked to achieve higher tensile strengths. The non-hardenability of ferritic stainless steel results in better formability and weldability compared to other types of steel that can be hardened. To summarize, the original sentence \\"The ferritic grades are magnetic and non-hardenable\\" refers to a classification of stainless steel, characterized by its ferrite microstructure, magnetic properties, and inability to be hardened through heat treatment. These properties make ferritic stainless steel suitable for various applications, particularly those that require excellent corrosion resistance and good formability."},{"question":"You are given a sentence in Arabic.

Total driving time: Jace drives for 4 hours, takes a break, and then drives for another 9 hours. Total driving time = 4 hours + 9 hours = 13 hours 2. Calculate the distance traveled for each driving period: Jace's speed is 60 miles per hour. For the first driving period, he drives 4 hours at 60 miles per hour: First driving period distance = 4 hours * 60 miles per hour = 240 miles For the second driving period, he drives 9 hours at 60 miles per hour: Second driving period distance = 9 hours * 60 miles per hour = 540 miles 3. Add the distances to find the total miles: Total miles = First driving period distance + Second driving period distance Total miles = 240 miles + 540 miles = 780 miles Jace will travel a total of 780 miles."},{"question":"Definition: Turn the given fact into a question by a simple rearrangement of words.

The actress was bombarded with angry comments after she used Twitter to advertise her controversial collection, which includes skimpy designs aimed at under-eights. The model, who was accused of sexualising young girls after initially unveiling the skimpy, two-piece designs two years ago, faced a backlash from her followers who insisted ‘kids should look like kids’. Liz Hurley has become embroiled in fresh controversy over her range of children's bikinis - with critics branding them unsuitable for young girls. The 49-year-old used her personal Twitter account to ask her 450,000 followers: ‘Going somewhere hot at Easter? Check out our Swim Collection.’ She then added: ‘Our Kids collection is divine too.’ Miss Hurley then added a picture of the kids bikinis on display in Harrods, before uploading a link to her website where the items are sold. However, one follower, Lee-Anne Compton wrote back: ‘I’m all for kids looking fab, but looking like kids and safe in the sun.’ EM Grant then posted the message: ‘KIDS? Leopard Print bikinis on KIDS!?’ Julia Hall then wrote in disbelief: ‘What ages are the kids!?’ The model, who was accused of sexualising young girls after initially unveiling the skimpy, two-piece designs two years ago, faced a backlash from her followers who insisted 'kids should look like kids' The actress’s website features several children wearing the skimpy designs while striking poses more suitable for adult models. It includes items for the under eights, such as an animal-print ‘Mini Cha Cha Bikini’ which costs £32.90 and is modelled by a blonde child with both hands placed precociously on her hips. Another design, called the ‘Collette Bikini’ is advertised in the 8-13 age range, and is described as being ‘great for girls who want to look grown up’. Campaigners have previously hit out at Miss Hurley’s bikini collection, calling them ‘disturbing’. Dr Katherine Rake, chief executive of the Family and Parenting Institute charity, said the designs put pressure on parents by attracting young girls to the notion of growing up too fast. She says: ‘Parents have been telling us for a long time that they want their children to be able to enjoy childhood. We’d like young girls to be encouraged to emulate Olympic stars like Ellie Simmonds and Rebecca Adlington when in the swimming pool - not models in leopard print.’ In a report in 2011, Reg Bailey, chief executive of the Mothers’ Union, set out a series of guidelines to be met in order to prevent the sexualisation of young children. One of the recommendations was for ‘retailers to offer more age-appropriate clothes for children and sign up to a code of practice which checks and challenges the design, buying display and marketing of clothes, products and services for children’. A spokesman for Miss Hurley has previously defended the designs saying they are hugely popular with parents and children. It was last year that Gwyneth Paltrow was also accused of sexualising children after endorsing a range of bikinis for girls as young as four, and which she was selling through her lifestyle website, GOOP. The website says the design is perfect for little girls who want to match their mothers, as the top is an exact copy of the adult version - also sold on the website.

A 24-year-old Marilyn Monroe poses for Life magazine in August 1950. They were taken before rumors of an affair with President John F. Kennedy swirled and her mental breakdowns became public. They were taken before the beautiful actress's mysterious overdose that resulted in her death at the age of 36. In a collection discovered by Life.com last month, unpublished photographs of Monroe reveal a softer, more innocent 24-year-old budding starlet in a more peaceful time, before her fame peaked. Her flawless face bears a natural look with minimal makeup, unusual for the star, who was often glamorized in photo shoots with lipstick, designer dresses and expensive jewelry. Monday would have been Monroe's 83rd birthday. In one photo, the young Monroe lies in bliss, reading on a park bench, which editors at Life.com believe was shot at Griffith Park in Los Angeles, California. In another, her face is serene as she is perched over a bridge barefoot. The shoot, which dates to 1950, was conducted by Life photographer Ed Clark. It's a side of Monroe that the American public has rarely seen. \\"She hasn't really exploded as a star, yet she was on the brink of something big,\\" says Dawnie Walton, deputy editor at Life.com, a Web site harboring more than 7 million Life magazine photographs. The site was launched in March. \\"I was amazed looking at her face. Although she looks very innocent, there is something very ... sexy.\\" Last month, Walton stumbled upon the rare photographs while combing through the company's digital photo archives. Apparently, no one at Life.com even knew they were ever taken. Upon investigating the photos, Walton says, she found there were few notes left on the negatives. She says the photos were probably taken for a cover shoot that was never used. Monroe appeared on her first Life magazine cover in 1952. See some of the previously unpublished photos of Monroe ». \\"It just got lost and stowed away,\\" Walton said. \\"It was just ... somewhere in a warehouse in New Jersey.\\" At the time the photos were shot, Monroe had her first small breakout role as a mistress in \\"The Asphalt Jungle.\\" The star was better known as a model at the time, though she'd had a handful of cameos in films. Photographer Ed Clark told the Sarasota Herald-Tribune a friend from 20th Century Fox alerted him that the studio had just signed \\"a hot tomato.\\" \\"She was unknown then, so I was able to spend a lot of time shooting her,\\" Clark said. \\"We'd go out to Griffith Park and she'd read poetry. I sent several rolls to Life in New York, but they wired back, 'Who the hell is Marilyn Monroe?' \\" Photographs later in the 1950s and early 1960s would display a much more confident and sexual Monroe -- images that would become iconic in popular culture. There is the famous photograph of a busty Monroe in a white halter dress, standing with her skirt blowing up in 1955 for her role in \\"The Seven Year Itch.\\" In 1962, American photographer Bert Stern shot a tipsy, sometimes nude Monroe in a series of delicate shots that would be known as \\"The Last Sitting.\\" Monroe died about six weeks later, on August 5, 1962. Life.com staff members say there are 15 million photographs in the Life archive dating back to the late 1850s, even before Life officially began publishing in 1936. Two years ago, the publication began slowly transferring the photographs into a digital archive. From time to time, unpublished photographs will be found that the company doesn't know existed. Other times, the photographs may have been taken but never selected to be used for publication.

Daily Mail Reporter. PUBLISHED:. 11:03 EST, 5 December 2013. |. UPDATED:. 11:04 EST, 5 December 2013. One afternoon in October, in the watery no-man's land between Thailand and Myanmar, Muhammad Ismail vanished. Thai immigration officials said he was being deported to Myanmar. In fact, they sold Ismail, 23, and hundreds of other Rohingya Muslims to human traffickers, who then spirited them into brutal jungle camps. Roma Hattu, a Rohingya Muslim woman who is nine months pregnant and been displaced, experiencing labour pains. Myanmar authorities have begun segregating minority Muslims from the Buddhist majority. As thousands of Rohingya flee Myanmar to escape religious persecution, an investigation in three countries has uncovered a clandestine policy to remove Rohingya refugees from Thailand's immigration detention centers and deliver them to human traffickers waiting at sea. The Rohingya are then transported across southern Thailand and held hostage in a series of camps hidden near the border with Malaysia until relatives pay thousands of dollars to release them. Three such camps were found, two based on the testimony of Rohingya held there, and a third by trekking to the site, heavily guarded, near a village called Baan Klong Tor. Thousands of Rohingya have passed through this tropical gulag. An untold number have died there. Worried: Bozor Mohammed from the Rakhine state in Myanmar listens during an interview at his house in Kuala Lumpur. Some have been murdered by camp guards or have perished from dehydration or disease, survivors said in interviews. The Thai authorities say the movement of Rohingya through their country doesn't amount to human trafficking. But in interviews for this story, the Thai Royal Police acknowledged, for the first time, a covert policy called 'option two' that relies upon established human-smuggling networks to rid Thailand of Rohingya detainees. Ismail was one of five Rohingya who said that Thai immigration officials had sold him outright or aided in their sale to human traffickers.

'It seemed so official at first,' said Ismail, a wiry farmer with a long narrow face and tight curly hair. 'They took our photographs. They took our finger prints. And then once in the boats, about 20 minutes out at sea, we were told we had been sold.' Ismail said he ended up in a camp in southern Thailand. So did Bozor Mohamed, a Rohingya whose frail body makes him seem younger than his 21 years. The camp was guarded by men with guns and clubs, said Mohamed, and at least one person died every day due to dehydration or disease. 'I used to be a strong man,' the former rice farmer said in an interview, as he massaged his withered legs.

Mohamed's elbow and back are scarred from what he said were beatings administered by his captors in Thailand while he telephoned his brother-in-law in Malaysia, begging him to pay the 2,000 ransom they demanded. Some men failed to find a benefactor in Malaysia to pay their ransom. The camp became their home. 'They had long beards and their hair was so long, down to the middle of their backs, that they looked liked women,' said Mohamed. What ultimately happens to Rohingya who can't buy their freedom remains unclear. A Thai-based smuggler said some are sold to shipping companies and farms as manual laborers for 5,000 to 50,000 baht each, or 155 to 1,550. 'Prices vary according to their skills,' said the smuggler, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The site of a suspected human trafficking camp is seen near Baan Klong Tor in southern Thailand October 30. The Arakan Project, a Rohingya advocacy group based in Thailand, says it has interviewed scores of Rohingya who have passed through the Thai camps and into Malaysia. Many Rohingya who can't pay end up as cooks or guards at the camps, said Chris Lewa, Arakan Project's director. Presented with the findings of this report, Thailand's second-highest-ranking policeman made some startling admissions. Thai officials might have profited from Rohingya smuggling in the past, said Police Maj-Gen Chatchawal Suksomjit, Deputy Commissioner General of the Royal Thai Police. He also confirmed the existence of illegal camps in southern Thailand, which he called 'holding bays'. A tent is seen in the woods outside a suspected human trafficking camp near Baan Klong Tor, in southern Thailand on October 30, 2013. Tarit Pengdith, chief of the Department of Special Investigation, Thailand's equivalent of the FBI, was also asked about the camps discovered. 'We have heard about these camps in southern Thailand,' he said, 'but we are not investigating this issue.' Besieged by a political crisis and violent street protests this week, Thailand faces difficult questions about its future and global status. Among those is whether it will join North Korea, the Central African Republic and Iran among the world's worst offenders in fighting human trafficking.

For the past four years, Thailand has sat on the TIP Report's so-called Tier 2 Watch List, the second-lowest rank. It will be automatically downgraded to Tier 3 next year unless it makes what the State Department calls 'significant efforts' to eliminate human trafficking. Dropping to Tier 3 status theoretically carries the threat of U.S. sanctions. In practice, the United States is unlikely to sanction Thailand, one of its oldest treaty allies in Asia.

The Air Force was founded as an independent service arm on March 28, 1923, by King Victor Emmanuel III as the \\"Regia Aeronautica\\" (which equates to \\"Royal Air Force\\"). After World War II, when Italy was made a republic by referendum, the \\"Regia Aeronautica\\" was given its current name. Since its formation the service has held a prominent role in modern Italian military history. The aerobatic display team is the Frecce Tricolori. - The Italian Royal Air Force (Regia Aeronautica Italiana) was the name of the air force of the Kingdom of Italy. It was established as a service independent of the Royal Italian Army from 1923 until 1946. In 1946, the monarchy was abolished and the Kingdom of Italy became the Italian Republic, whereupon the name of the air force changed to Aeronautica Militare Italiana. - The Royal Air Force (RAF) is the United Kingdom's aerial warfare force. Formed towards the end of the First World War on 1 April 1918, it is the oldest independent air force in the world. Following victory over the Central Powers in 1918 the RAF emerged as, at the time, the largest air force in the world. Since its formation, the RAF has taken a significant role in British military history, in particular, playing a large part in the Second World War where it fought its most famous campaign, the Battle of Britain. - Gianmarco Bellini ( born September 15 , 1958 ) is an Italian Air Force officer who served with U.N.

An epeiric (or \\"shelf\\") sea on the European continental shelf, it connects to the ocean through the English Channel in the south and the Norwegian Sea in the north. It is more than long and wide, with an area of around . - The River Wear in North East England rises in the Pennines and flows eastwards, mostly through County Durham to the North Sea in the City of Sunderland. At long, it is one of the region's longest rivers, wends in a steep valley through the cathedral city of Durham and gives its name to Weardale in its upper reach and Wearside by its mouth. - The City of Sunderland is a local government district of Tyne and Wear, in North East England, with the status of a city and metropolitan borough. It is named after its largest settlement, Sunderland, but covers a far larger area which includes the towns of Hetton-le-Hole, Houghton-le-Spring, Washington, and a range of suburban villages. - County Durham (locally ), occasionally Durhamshire, is a county in North East England. The county town is Durham, a cathedral city, whilst the largest settlement is Darlington. It borders Tyne and Wear to the north east, Northumberland to the north, Cumbria to the west and North Yorkshire to the south. Historically, the county included southern Tyne and Wear, including Gateshead and Sunderland. - The English Channel (\\"the Sleeve\\" [hence ] \\"Sea of Brittany\\" \\"British Sea\\"), also called simply the Channel, is the body of water that separates southern England from northern France, and joins the southern part of the North Sea to the rest of the Atlantic Ocean. - The Isle of Wight is a county and the largest and second-most populous island in England. It is located in the English Channel, about 4 miles (6 km) off the coast of Hampshire, separated by the Solent. The island has resorts that have been holiday destinations since Victorian times, and is known for its mild climate, coastal scenery, and verdant landscape of fields, downland and chines. - A simple suspension bridge (also rope bridge, swing bridge (in New Zealand), suspended bridge, hanging bridge and catenary bridge) is a primitive type of bridge that is supported entirely from anchors at either end and has no towers or piers. However, it may have saddles. In such bridges, the deck of the bridge follows the downward and upward arc of the load-bearing cables, with additional light ropes at a higher level used to form a handrail. Alternatively, stout handrail cables supported on short piers at each end may be the primary load-bearing element, with the deck suspended below. Suspended well from two high locations over a river or canyon, simple suspension bridges follow a shallow downward catenary arc and are not suited for modern roads and railroads. Owing to practical limitation in the grade (i.e. the deck being an arc, not flat) and the response to dynamic loads of the bridge deck, this type is quite restricted in its load-carrying capacity relative to its span. This type of bridge is considered the most efficient and sustainable design in developing countries, however, especially for river crossings that lie in non-floodplain topography such as gorges. - Weardale is a dale, or valley, of the east side of the Pennines in County Durham, England. Large parts of Weardale fall within the North Pennines Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) the second largest AONB in England and Wales. The upper valley is surrounded by high fells (up to O.D. at Burnhope Seat) and heather grouse moors. The River Wear flows through Weardale before reaching Bishop Auckland and then Durham, meeting the sea at Sunderland. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - The Isles of Scilly (or \\"\\") are an archipelago off the south western tip of the Cornish peninsula of Great Britain. It is the southernmost location in England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most westerly in England. - Wearside is an area of North East England centred on the continuous urban area of Sunderland by the River Wear, and in the wider sense, including separate neighbouring settlements such as Seaham. - Steel is an alloy of iron and other elements, primarily carbon, that is widely used in construction and other applications because of its high tensile strength and low cost. Steel's base metal is iron, which is able to take on two crystalline forms (allotropic forms), body centered cubic and face centered cubic (FCC), depending on its temperature. It is the interaction of those allotropes with the alloying elements, primarily carbon, that gives steel and cast iron their range of unique properties. In the body-centred cubic arrangement, there is an iron atom in the centre of each cube, and in the face-centred cubic, there is one at the center of each of the six faces of the cube. Carbon, other elements, and inclusions within iron act as hardening agents that prevent the movement of dislocations that otherwise occur in the crystal lattices of iron atoms. - Rebar (short for reinforcing bar), collectively known as reinforcing steel and reinforcement steel, is a steel bar or mesh of steel wires used as a tension device in reinforced concrete and reinforced masonry structures to strengthen and hold the concrete in tension. Rebar's surface is often patterned to form a better bond with the concrete. - A cement is a binder, a substance used in construction that sets and hardens and can bind other materials together. The most important types of cement are used as a component in the production of mortar in masonry, and of concrete, which is a combination of cement and an aggregate to form a strong building material. - The Irish Sea (, , , Ulster-Scots: \\"Airish Sea\\"), separates the islands of Ireland and Great Britain. It is connected to the Celtic Sea in the south by St George's Channel, and to the Inner Seas off the West Coast of Scotland in the north by the North Channel. Anglesey is the largest island within the Irish Sea, followed by the Isle of Man. The sea is occasionally, but rarely, referred to as the Manx Sea. - Concrete is a composite material composed of coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement that hardens over time. Most concretes used are lime-based concretes such as Portland cement concrete or concretes made with other hydraulic cements, such as ciment fondu. However, asphalt concrete, which is frequently used for road surfaces, is also a type of concrete, where the cement material is bitumen, and polymer concretes are sometimes used where the cementing material is a polymer. - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague. - A landscape is the visible features of an area of land, its landforms and how they integrate with natural or man-made features. - North East England is one of the nine regions of England that are classified at the first level of NUTS for statistical purposes. It covers Northumberland, County Durham, Tyne and Wear, and the Tees Valley. The region is home to three large conurbations: Teesside, Wearside, and Tyneside, the latter of which is the largest of the three and the eighth most populous conurbation in the United Kingdom. There are only three cities in the region; Newcastle upon Tyne is the largest city in the region with a population of just under 280,000, followed by Sunderland, both of which are located in the metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear. The city of Durham is the county town of County Durham. Other large settlements in the region include Darlington; Gateshead; Hartlepool; Middlesbrough; South Shields; Stockton-on-Tees; Alnwick and Washington. - In materials science, ductility is a solid material's ability to deform under tensile stress; this is often characterized by the material's ability to be stretched into a wire. Malleability, a similar property, is a material's ability to deform under compressive stress; this is often characterized by the material's ability to form a thin sheet by hammering or rolling. Both of these mechanical properties are aspects of plasticity, the extent to which a solid material can be plastically deformed without fracture. Also, these material properties are dependent on temperature and pressure (investigated by Percy Williams Bridgman as part of his Nobel Prize-winning work on high pressures). - Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides. - The Pennines , also known as the Pennine Chain or Pennine Hills, are a range of mountains and hills in Northern England separating North West England from Yorkshire and North East England. - A suspension bridge is a type of bridge in which the deck (the load-bearing portion) is hung below suspension cables on vertical suspenders. The first modern examples of this type of bridge were built in the early 19th century. Simple suspension bridges, which lack vertical suspenders, have a long history in many mountainous parts of the world. - Reinforced concrete (RC) is a composite material in which concrete's relatively low tensile strength and ductility are counteracted by the inclusion of reinforcement having higher tensile strength or ductility. The reinforcement is usually, though not necessarily, steel reinforcing bars (rebar) and is usually embedded passively in the concrete before the concrete sets. Reinforcing schemes are generally designed to resist tensile stresses in particular regions of the concrete that might cause unacceptable cracking and/or structural failure. Modern reinforced concrete can contain varied reinforcing materials made of steel, polymers or alternate composite material in conjunction with rebar or not. Reinforced concrete may also be permanently stressed (in compression), so as to improve the behaviour of the final structure under working loads. In the United States, the most common methods of doing this are known as pre-tensioning and post-tensioning. For a strong, ductile and durable construction the reinforcement needs to have the following properties at least: - Continental Europe, also referred to as mainland Europe, or, by Europeans, simply the Continent, is the continuous continent of Europe, excluding surrounding islands. - A footbridge (also called a pedestrian bridge, pedestrian overpass, or pedestrian overcrossing) is a bridge designed for pedestrians and in some cases cyclists, animal traffic, and horse riders, instead of vehicular traffic. Footbridges complement the landscape and can be used decoratively to visually link two distinct areas or to signal a transaction. In many developed countries, footbridges are both functional and can be beautiful works of art and sculpture. For poor rural communities in the developing world, a footbridge may be a community's only access to medical clinics, schools and markets, which would otherwise be unreachable when rivers are too high to cross. Simple suspension bridge designs have been developed to be sustainable and easily constructible in such rural areas using only local materials and labor. - A polymer (Greek \\"poly-\\", \\"many\\" + \\"-mer\\", \\"parts\\") is a large molecule, or macromolecule, composed of many repeated subunits. Because of their broad range of properties, both synthetic and natural polymers play an essential and ubiquitous role in everyday life. Polymers range from familiar synthetic plastics such as polystyrene to natural biopolymers such as DNA and proteins that are fundamental to biological structure and function. Polymers, both natural and synthetic, are created via polymerization of many small molecules, known as monomers. Their consequently large molecular mass relative to small molecule compounds produces unique physical properties, including toughness, viscoelasticity, and a tendency to form glasses and semicrystalline structures rather than crystals. - Borders are geographic boundaries of political entities or legal jurisdictions, such as governments, sovereign states, federated states, and other subnational entities. Some borderssuch as a state's internal administrative border, or inter-state borders within the Schengen Areaare often open and completely unguarded. Other borders are partially or fully controlled, and may be crossed legally only at designated border checkpoints and border zones may be controlled. Mostly contentious, borders may even foster the setting up of buffer zones. A difference has also been established in academic scholarship between border and frontier, the latter denoting a state of mind rather than state boundaries. - The Celtic Sea (; ) is the area of the Atlantic Ocean off the south coast of Ireland bounded to the east by Saint George's Channel; other limits include the Bristol Channel, the English Channel, and the Bay of Biscay, as well as adjacent portions of Wales, Cornwall, Devon, and Brittany. The southern and western boundaries are delimited by the continental shelf, which drops away sharply. The Isles of Scilly are an archipelago of small islands in the sea. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - Great Britain, also known as Britain , is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe. With an area of , Great Britain is the largest European island and the ninth-largest in the world. In 2011 the island had a population of about 61 million people, making it the world's third-most populous island after Java in Indonesia and Honshu in Japan. The island of Ireland is situated to the west of it, and together these islands, along with over 1,000 smaller surrounding islands, comprise the British Isles archipelago. - Kingsgate Bridge is a striking , modern reinforced concrete construction footbridge across the River Wear , in Durham , England . It is a Grade I listed building . It was personally designed in 1963 by Sir Ove Arup , connecting Bow Lane on the historic peninsula in the centre of Durham to Dunelm House on New Elvet ( to which building Arup 's studio also contributed ) , and opened in 1966 . Kingsgate Bridge is thought to have been one of Arup 's favourite designs of all , he having spent many hours working on every detail of the plans . Its construction was unusual . The two halves were each built parallel to the river , then rotated through 90 ° to make the crossing . The meeting point of the two halves is marked by a simple bronze expansion joint . In 1965 , the bridge was the winner of the Civic Trust Award . In 1993 , it won Certificate of Outstanding Performance ( Mature Structures Category ) of the Concrete Society . A bust of Arup , cast in resin , was installed on the side of Dunelm House , the students ' union building adjacent to the bridge , in September 2011 . The sculpture is a copy of a 1987 bust by Diana Brandenburger , held by the National Portrait Gallery . It is a replacement for a previous copy of the same bust , in bronze , which was unveiled by Karin Perry , Arup 's daughter , on 16 April 2003 , the 108th anniversary of Arup 's birth , but which was stolen from its plinth during the summer of 2006 . During a university RAG Week in the early 1960s students suspended a car beneath the bridge . In February 1998 , the Durham Union Society president , Tom Joyce , fell through the bridge , but caught himself and was uninjured . - A country is a region that is identified as a distinct national entity in political geography. A country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the League of Nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction. - Wales is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and the island of Great Britain. It is bordered by England to the east, the Irish Sea to the north and west, and the Bristol Channel to the south. It had a population in 2011 of 3,063,456 and has a total area of . Wales has over of coastline and is largely mountainous, with its higher peaks in the north and central areas, including Snowdon, its highest summit. The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable, maritime climate.

Review: Eating at The Vibrant Plate was nothing short of a sensational, culinary extravaganza! Nestled in the heart of downtown, I decided to give this trendy spot a try on a friend's recommendation, and boy, I'm so glad I did! From the moment I walked through the door, the warmth and exquisite ambience took me by surprise. The interior was tastefully designed, blending an aesthetic of modern sophistication with cozy, rustic charm. The dim lighting, carefully chosen music, and stunning artwork on display created what I can only describe as a soothing and welcoming oasis. What a fantastic environment to enjoy a meal! The charismatic host greeted us with a beaming smile, immediately making us feel right at home. She took the time to ask about our dietary preferences and made sure to mention the new additions to their already impressive menu. Despite the busy nature of the restaurant, our server had an excellent grasp of the menu and was able to confidently guide us in choosing our entrees. Throughout our meal, she checked in on us just enough to make us feel attended to without being intrusive. The food, oh, the food! Where do I even begin? Like the venue itself, The Vibrant Plate's menu was a beautiful blend of familiar comfort food and haute cuisine artistry. The unique fusion of international flavors and organic, locally-sourced ingredients produced a delightful medley of dishes that made it incredibly hard to choose! For starters, we tried the seared scallops with chili lime aioli, and we were simply blown away. The scallops were seared to perfection - tender, succulent, and bursting with flavor. The rich combination of the chili and lime aioli elevated the dish to a whole new level, teasing our taste buds and leaving us craving more. For entrees, I opted for the mouth-watering braised short ribs, while my friend chose the pan-seared branzino. As divine as the appetizers were, the entrees truly left us speechless. The short ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender, generously coated with a heavenly red wine glaze that was both sweet and savory, mingling perfectly with the fluffy, truffle-infused mashed potatoes served alongside. The pan-seared branzino was a work of art – delicately crisp on the outside, yet so moist and flavorful on the inside. Despite feeling full, we couldn't resist the temptation of their dessert menu. The decadent chocolate lava cake appealed to our sweet tooth, and it did not disappoint! The rich chocolate cake oozed warm, gooey chocolate that seemed to melt in our mouths, perfectly complemented by the cool, velvety vanilla ice cream served alongside. In conclusion, The Vibrant Plate is an absolute gem that is worth every penny. From the welcoming and attentive staff to the exquisite food and impeccable atmosphere, I couldn't ask for a better dining experience. I wholeheartedly recommend this restaurant to anyone who appreciates a truly unforgettable culinary adventure. I will most certainly return and can't wait to sample more of their tantalizing offerings.

However, I was sadly left with nothing but disappointment, anger, and quite honestly, a headache from pouring over the disjointed and tedious storyline for two and a half hours. From the opening scene, viewers are greeted with mediocre acting that comes across as unnatural and forced. The performers have hardly any chemistry on screen, which left me questioning the casting process entirely. It feels as though the creators simply threw in big names and called it a day, with no real thought or consideration for how well they may or may not work together. Consequently, the entire movie is plagued with dialogue that fails to resonate or evoke the intended emotions effectively. Furthermore, the plot is an absolute labyrinth of confusion, accompanied by an unnecessary amount of sub-plots that add no real substance or depth to the overarching story. Instead, it burdens the viewers with a need to constantly reevaluate and decipher the narrative, which ultimately detracts from any potential enjoyment. A powerful narrative could potentially have compensated for the lackluster acting, but alas, the writers delivered a convoluted mess, leaving the audience drowning in a sea of tediousness. The film's pace hovers between slow and tedious to excessively chaotic, with no apparent rhyme or reason for these transitions. While a well-balanced film should have moments of intensity intertwined with quieter, introspective scenes, \\"Uninspired: The Movie\\" merely oscillates frustratingly between the two, making the proceedings feel incohesive and ultimately, exhausting. As for the visuals and set design, they are uninspiring and mundane, at best. The cinematography is devoid of any creative touches and the special effects appear clunky and outdated. Any semblance of atmosphere was lost due to the uninspired set design, which greatly detracted from the immersion the movie could have offered. The film's sole saving grace may have been the score, but the music was disconcertingly forgettable. The soundtrack simply faded into the background, rendering itself inconsequential. It is always a shame when a film wastes potential on an inadequate score, and \\"Uninspired: The Movie\\" truly missed the mark in this respect. A well-crafted score with emotional depth could have salvaged the less captivating aspects of the film, but alas, even this opportunity was squandered. In conclusion, \\"Uninspired: The Movie\\" stands as a prime example of a film that has failed to achieve its potential on nearly every level. The acting, plot, pacing, visuals, and score are all lacking and fall disappointingly short. Unless one has a fondness for bland, convoluted narratives and subpar acting, I would strongly recommend skipping \\"Uninspired: The Movie\\" altogether."},{"question":"Q:Question: He was an expert in hieroglyphics, can you tell me the location of his excavation?

Based on the information provided in a given passage, you should identify the shortest continuous text span from the passage that serves as an answer to the given question. Avoid answers that are incorrect or provides incomplete justification for the question. Q: Passage: Islamic art frequently adopts the use of geometrical floral or vegetal designs in a repetition known as arabesque. Such designs are highly nonrepresentational, as Islam forbids representational depictions as found in pre-Islamic pagan religions. Despite this, there is a presence of depictional art in some Muslim societies, notably the miniature style made famous in Persia and under the Ottoman Empire which featured paintings of people and animals, and also depictions of Quranic stories and Islamic traditional narratives. Another reason why Islamic art is usually abstract is to symbolize the transcendence, indivisible and infinite nature of God, an objective achieved by arabesque. Islamic calligraphy is an omnipresent decoration in Islamic art, and is usually expressed in the form of Quranic verses. Two of the main scripts involved are the symbolic kufic and naskh scripts, which can be found adorning the walls and domes of mosques, the sides of minbars, and so on. Question: Islam forbade types of art found in what religions? A:","response":"Islam forbids representational depictions as found in pre-Islamic pagan religions."},{"question":"Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was given borough status in the United Kingdom? Stretford was part of the ancient parish of Manchester, within the historic county boundaries of Lancashire. Following the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834, a national scheme for dealing with the relief of the poor, Stretford joined the Chorlton Poor Law Union in 1837, one of three such unions in Manchester, before transferring to the Barton-upon-Irwell Poor Law Union in 1849. In 1867, Stretford Local Board of Health was established, assuming responsibility for the local government of the area in 1868. The board's responsibilities included sanitation and the maintenance of the highways, and it had the authority to levy rates to pay for those services. The local board continued in that role until it was superseded by the creation of Stretford Urban District Council in 1894, as a result of the Local Government Act 1894. Stretford Urban District became the Municipal Borough of Stretford in 1933, giving it borough status in the United Kingdom. Stretford Borough Council was granted its arms on 20 February 1933. The roses are the red roses of Lancashire, and the lion in the centre represents John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster. Above the lion are a crossed flail and scythe; the flail comes from the arms of the de Trafford family; the scythe is a reminder of the agricultural history of the area; the thunderbolts above represent the importance of electricity in Stretford's industrial development. The boat at the bottom represents Stretford's links to the sea via the Manchester Ship Canal.In 1974, as a result of the Local Government Act 1972, the Municipal Borough of Stretford was abolished and Stretford has, since 1 April 1974, formed part of the Metropolitan Borough of Trafford, in Greater Manchester.

Tags are like labels we put on things to help us remember what they are about. For example, if we have a picture of a cat, we could use the tag \\"cat\\" so that we know what's in that picture. If the cat is doing something silly, we can add another tag like \\"funny.\\" So now we have two tags: \\"cat\\" and \\"funny.\\" We can make tags longer if we need by using more words, like \\"fluffy cat\\" or \\"cat playing with a ball.\\" Now, let's learn about punctuation! Punctuation are those little symbols we put in our sentences to make them easier to read and understand. Some common punctuation marks include: 1. Period (.) - It's a small dot we put at the end of a sentence to show it's finished. Example: \\"I am a helpful assistant.\\" 2. Comma (,) - It's like a tiny pause we use to separate different parts of a sentence. Example: \\"I can help you with math, science, and reading.\\" 3. Question mark (?) - If we have a question, we put this at the end of the sentence. Example: \\"Do you like ice cream?\\" 4. Exclamation point (!) - We use this to show that we're excited or want to emphasize something.

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect","response":"If there is more environmental pollution, it will likely have a negative impact on bird populations. The specific effect of pollution on the number of birds can be influenced by various factors such as the type of pollution, the concentration of the pollutant, and the species of birds involved. However, as you mentioned, you would like to know how the pollution might affect LESS birds. In this case, there would be a few potential scenarios in which the magnitude of the impact might be reduced: 1. Reduction of pollution exposure: If human efforts manage to mitigate pollution in bird habitats, or if birds move to less polluted areas, then there would be less impact on bird populations. However, this might not always be possible, as habitats could be limited or other challenges could arise in new locations. 2. Adaptation to pollution: In some cases, bird species may be able to adapt to certain levels of pollution over time, reducing the overall effect on the population. This could be through physiological or behavioral adaptations. However, this ability to adapt varies among species and may take several generations to occur. 3. Conservation and management efforts: Bird populations might be protected from pollution by habitat conservation projects, pollution control policies, or other wildlife management initiatives. Such measures aim to reduce the impact of pollution on the natural environment, which could result in less effect on bird populations. In conclusion, if more environmental pollution occurs, it is generally expected to negatively affect bird populations. However, if the pollution's exposure is reduced, birds adapt to the pollutants, or conservation efforts are implemented successfully, the impact on birds might be less significant. In these cases, the effect on the second step of the bird life cycle – the female laying eggs – might also be affected to a lesser degree, leading to less disruption in the reproductive process."},{"question":"Read this: By the 1840s, India was no longer capable of supplying the vast quantities of cotton fibers needed by mechanized British factories, while shipping bulky, low-price cotton from India to Britain was time-consuming and expensive.

Article:","response":"Title: A Comprehensive Guide to Planning, Designing, and Installing a Slate Tile Color Scheme Introduction Upgrading your home with a contemporary and personalized touch doesn't have to be a daunting task. One of the most effective and visually appealing methods is to utilize slate tiles to create a stunning color scheme. With their natural hues and textures, slate tiles can elevate the look of any space and provide a focal point for your room. In this article, we'll provide a step-by-step guide for creating the perfect slate tile design for your room and ensuring a seamless installation process. Step 1: Sketching the Layout The first step to create your ultimate slate tile color scheme is to sketch out a layout. Think about the tones you'd like to incorporate, and whether you want a uniform color pattern or a mix of colors. Sketching a rough idea of the room may help you visualize the final result and determine the placement of each color. Keep in mind the floor or wall area you'd like to cover, and consider the size and shape of the tiles you plan to use. Step 2: Measuring the Room To ensure a flawless fit for your new slate tile design, you'll need to accurately measure the width and length of your room. Make a note of any irregular shaped areas or obstacles, like vent covers or electrical outlets. These measurements will provide a basis for calculating the number of tiles required and facilitate the cutting and fitting process later. Step 3: Dry-Laying the Tiles Before making any permanent decisions, lay out your slate tiles to confirm the best layout and use of color. This step allows you to assess the overall flow and balance of the color scheme, make any necessary adjustments, and ensure that the tiles are placed in a way that showcases their best features. You may want to experiment with different configurations until you are content with the final layout. Step 4: Assessing the Need for Tile Cutting When dry-laying the tiles, pay attention to the edges of the room. You may need to cut some tiles to fit these areas properly. Keep in mind that you want to maintain a consistent grout width between the tiles, which may involve cutting tiles that lay next to walls, doors, or floor transitions. Step 5: Cutting Tiles for the Edge of the Room With your customized layout dialed in, it's time to prepare any tiles that will require cutting. Use a wet saw or tile cutter to achieve clean, precise cuts that fit each unique space in the room. Remember to follow any necessary safety precautions and use proper techniques when cutting the slate tiles. Step 6: Marking Tiles for Extra Thinset Application To ensure an even tile surface, inspect each slate tile for areas that may require extra thinset when installed. Uneven tiles may lead to a bumpy and unattractive floor, causing discomfort and reducing the aesthetic appeal of your new design. To avoid this, mark the back of any tiles requiring additional thinset with a pencil, ensuring proper application during the installation process. Conclusion Designing your own personalized slate tile color scheme can make a significant impact on the overall appeal and value of your home. By following these detailed steps, you can create a stunning design that not only complements your unique style but also ensures a seamless and professional installation process. With the right planning, measuring, and attention to detail, your slate tile dreams can become a reality."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Pick the option in line with common sense to answer the question.

The study, published in the journal Psychological Services and conducted by Meyran Boniel-Nissim and Azy Barak, psychology professors at the University of Haifa, Israel, found the contact with an online community through a blog made it more effective in relieving the writer's social anxiety than a private diary would be. To track teenagers' experiences with blogging, the researchers randomly surveyed high school students in Israel and selected 161 of them who exhibited some level of social anxiety or stress.The teenagers, who averaged 15 years old, said they had difficulty making new friends or relating to their existing friends. The teenagers were divided into six groups.The first two groups were asked to blog about their social difficulties, with one group asked to open their posts to comments.The second two groups were asked to blog about whatever struck their adolescent fancy; again, with one group allowing comments.All four groups were told to write in their blogs at least twice a week.As a control, two more groups were told to keep either an old-fashioned print diary or to do nothing at all. All of their blog records were then read through by four psychologists to determine the authors' social and emotional state.In all the groups, the greatest improvement in mood occurred among those bloggers who wrote about their problems and allowed commenters to respond.

John Cavendish had turned to Poirot. \\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"Be quiet! John Cavendish then faced Poirot. \\" is true?","response":"Yes, we can conclude that the hypothesis \\"Be quiet! John Cavendish then faced Poirot.\\" is true based on the given premise \\"Hush! John Cavendish had turned to Poirot.\\". Both sentences convey the same meaning but use different words to express the same event. In both sentences, the initial exclamatory command (\\"Hush!\\" and \\"Be quiet!\\") communicates a demand for silence, either because someone is interrupting or something important is happening. In essence, both phrases serve as an order to stop talking or making noise, implying that an urgent situation or a need for attention is present. Following the command for silence, both sentences describe an action by the same subject – John Cavendish. In the premise, John Cavendish \\"had turned\\" to Poirot, while in the hypothesis, he \\"faced\\" Poirot. Both phrasings suggest that John Cavendish redirected his attention towards Poirot, indicating a change in focus, typically accompanied by eye contact and body orientation. It is important to note that while the sentences describe the same event, they use different verb tenses. The original premise uses the past perfect (\\"had turned\\"), which highlights a completed action in the past before another past action. The hypothesis uses the simple past tense (\\"then faced\\"), which describes a completed action in the past but lacks the nuance of an action preceding another past action. However, given that both sentences ultimately communicate the same idea, we can infer that the hypothesis is true, based on the given premise. The differences in phrasing and verb tense do not change the central meaning of the event – John Cavendish, after requesting quiet, directed his attention towards the character Poirot."},{"question":"Available options: a).

They left out some some of the most important aspects of the religious significance of the Temple Mount. It would have made a nice 20 minute video. Is this product review negative? A:","response":"Yes, this product review can be considered negative for several reasons. The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with various aspects of the content, mentioning that it covered the same material repeatedly, left out important aspects related to the religious significance of the Temple Mount, and could have been condensed into a much shorter 20-minute video. Firstly, the repetition of material indicates that the reviewer found the content to be lacking in diversity and depth. This may suggest that they were expecting a more comprehensive and engaging analysis of the subject matter. By pointing out this weakness in the content, they express their disappointment with the product. Secondly, the exclusion of key aspects related to the religious significance of the Temple Mount is another point of criticism raised by the reviewer. Such omissions can have a significant impact on the accuracy and completeness of the product's content. The reviewer mentions that they expected the product to address the religious importance of the topic, and the failure to do so significantly reduced its value for them. Lastly, the reviewer's suggestion that the content could have been condensed into a 20-minute video implies that they felt the product was unnecessarily long, possibly containing filler content or being too drawn out. This demonstrates that the reviewer found the presentation of the content to be inefficient and not well-structured. In conclusion, the product review is negative as it highlights several issues with the content, including repetition, incompleteness, and inefficient presentation. The reviewer's dissatisfaction with these aspects indicates that they did not find the product to be of high quality or worth their time."},{"question":"Do you want to be healthy?

Our task is to provide a detailed explanation considering the answer provided. Question: Carter buries cans of soda in the dirt. The shallower the holes for the cans of soda, the pressure will be lesser. Explanation: When Carter buries cans of soda in the ground, the depth (or shallowness) of the holes he digs can affect the pressure exerted on the cans. Pressure, in this context, pertains to the force per unit area experienced by the soda cans due to the weight of the soil above them. As the holes for the soda cans become shallower, there will be less soil on top of the cans and hence less weight acting on them. This reduces the force exerted by the soil. Since pressure is the force divided by the area, when the force exerted by the soil decreases, the pressure experienced by the soda cans will also decrease. Therefore, the shallower the holes for the cans of soda, the lesser pressure they will experience."},{"question":"You are presented with the quiz \\"Preventing the transfer of heat from an animal 's body causes that animal to keep what?\\" But you don't know the answer, so you turn to your teacher to ask for hints.

African climate adaptation focuses on reducing the impacts of climate change on African countries through mitigation measures, innovative solutions, and sustainable development. Step 2: Identifying key points in the argument 1. Historical responsibility: The developed world has been the largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, which are primarily responsible for climate change. These countries have benefited economically from their industrial activities and the resulting emissions. On the other hand, African countries have contributed minimally to global emissions but face severe consequences from climate change. Hence, it is ethical for the developed world to take responsibility and contribute to African climate adaptation. 2. Disproportionate effects: African countries are more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change due to their geographical location, limited resources, and lower adaptive capacities. Droughts, floods, desertification, and other climate-related events disproportionately affect these regions, leading to food insecurity, loss of livelihoods, and displacement. The developed world should fund African climate adaptation to promote global equity and ensure that the most vulnerable communities are not left to suffer the consequences of climate change alone. 3. Global security and stability: Climate change has the potential to exacerbate existing tensions and conflicts within and between African nations, such as competition for scarce resources and forced migration. By funding climate adaptation efforts, the developed world can help foster stability and peace in the African continent, which benefits the global community. 4. Economic benefits: The developed world can benefit from investing in African climate adaptation by unlocking new market opportunities and promoting sustainable economic growth in Africa. Climate-resilient infrastructure, renewable energy projects, and innovative solutions to environmental challenges can create jobs, foster trade relationships, and ultimately contribute to global economic prosperity. 5. Strengthening global climate efforts: By supporting African climate adaptation, the developed world can show its commitment to tackling climate change and encourage other countries to follow suit. This could foster a collaborative approach to addressing a common global challenge and boost international climate change mitigation efforts. In conclusion, the developed world should fund African climate adaptation due to their historical responsibility and moral obligation, promoting global equity, ensuring security and stability, fostering economic growth, and strengthening global climate change efforts."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Dialogue: M: What happened?

Lewis, an experienced outdoorsman, is the leader. Ed is also a veteran of several trips but lacks Lewis' machismo. Bobby and Drew are novices. While traveling to their launch site, the men (Bobby in particular) are condescending towards the locals, who are unimpressed by the \\"city boys\\". Traveling in pairs, the foursome's two canoes are briefly separated. The occupants of one canoe (Bobby and Ed), land briefly and encounter a pair of local men emerging from the woods, one carrying a shotgun. Ed and Bobby end up in a verbal altercation with the locals before being told they cannot leave and forced into the woods with a shotgun. Ed is tied to a tree and cut with a knife while Bobby is forced to strip at gunpoint.

Here are the steps to solve the equation: Step 1: Simplify the equation to bring similar terms to one side. In this case, we will move 12*p from the left side of the equation to the right side. We'll subtract 12*p from both sides, as subtracting the same thing from both sides of equation doesn't change the equality. The equation becomes: -344 = 55*p -12*p Step 2: Simplify the equation further to make it easier to solve. Here, you subtract 55*p and -12*p to get 43*p. So the equation now becomes: -344 = 43*p Step 3: Now, we need to solve for p. We do this by isolating p on one side of the equation. We will divide by 43 on both sides of the equation. The equation becomes: p = -344 / 43 Doing the division, p = -8 So, through these steps, we find that the solution to the equation 12*p - 344 = 55*p for p is p = -8. Thus, when p = -8, the given equation holds."},{"question":"What key details about john sharratt can be extracted from the following bio?

Context: WHITE HOUSE — \\"The United States will not be a migrant camp and it will not be a refugee holding facility,\\" President Donald Trump vowed Monday amid growing outrage over his administration forcibly separating children from parents at the U.S. border with Mexico. Trump, speaking in the White House East Room during a National Space Council meeting, warned that \\"what's happening in Europe … we can't allow that to happen to the United States — not on my watch.\\" Earlier in the day, on the Twitter social media platform, the president inaccurately linked migration in Germany to a rising crime rate. In actuality, the latest German government statistics show reported crimes at the lowest level in 30 years. Tough border enforcement in the U.S. has led to the family breakups, with nearly 2,000 children being sent to mass detention centers or foster care from mid-April to the end of May, according to government officials. The regular White House briefing was delayed several times Monday amid the furor as officials huddled with Trump in the West Wing. Press Secretary Sarah Sanders finally introduced Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen after 5 p.m., and she defended the administration's \\"zero-tolerance\\" policy that is breaking up families at the southwestern U.S. border. Nielsen forcefully pushed back at the negative media coverage, asserting that what U.S. authorities are doing is properly enforcing the law. \\"What has changed is that we no longer exempt entire classes of people who break the law,\\" she said. Asked about critics accusing the administration of using children as \\"pawns\\" to demand legislative actions from Congress, the DHS secretary replied, \\"I say that is a very cowardly response,\\" adding it is clearly within Congress' power \\"to make the laws and change the laws. They should do so.\\" Trump's Republican party controls both chambers in Congress, and the family border policies were set by his administration.

Leading soldiers and officials received income and land from the princes in return for their political and military services. Kievan society lacked the class institutions and autonomous towns that were typical of Western European feudalism. Nevertheless, urban merchants, artisans and labourers sometimes exercised political influence through a city assembly, the veche (council), which included all the adult males in the population. In some cases, the veche either made agreements with their rulers or expelled them and invited others to take their place. At the bottom of society was a stratum of slaves. More important was a class of tribute-paying peasants, who owed labour duty to the princes. The widespread personal serfdom characteristic of Western Europe did not exist in Kievan Rus'.

When the Bellanca deal falls apart because Columbia insists on selecting the pilot, Lindbergh approaches Ryan Aeronautical Company, a small manufacturer in San Diego, California. Frank Mahoney, the company's owner and president, promises to build a suitable monoplane in just 90 days. With Ryan's chief engineer Donald Hall, a design takes shape. To decrease weight, \\"Slim\\" refuses to install a radio or other heavy equipment, even a parachute, and plans to navigate by \\"dead reckoning\\". With no autopilot function Lindbergh cannot sleep during the flight. Workers at the factory agree to work around-the-clock to complete the monoplane in less than 90 days.

Prosecutors say the gang killed them and burned their bodies at a rubbish dump near the town of Cocula before scattered their ashes in a river. The students' disappearance has triggered widespread protests across Mexico against corruption and violence. Another demonstration was held on Saturday in Mexico City at which parents of students spoke about the identification. \\"If [the government] thinks that, because one of our boys' DNA was identified, we will sit and cry, we want to tell them that they're wrong,\\" Felipe de la Cruz, father of a missing student, told the crowd. \\"We will keep fighting until we find the other 42.\\" The unrest has seen President Enrique Pena Nieto's popularity rating drop to its lowest point since he took office two years ago.

The students had travelled from a teacher training college in Ayotzinapa to Iguala to protest against what they said were discriminatory employment practices for teachers which favour urban students over rural ones. Police opened fire on the students, who were in buses travelling back from Iguala to their college. Three of them were killed and three more people in nearby vehicles also died. A busload of the students tried to flee but were chased by municipal officers who then took them to the local police station. Some of the officers, who have since been arrested, told investigators they then handed the students over to a drug gang called Guerreros Unidos (United Warriors). Iguala Mayor Jose Luis Abarca and his wife, Maria de los Angeles Pineda were arrested in the beginning of November in Mexico City. Mexican officials accused Mr Abarca of ordering police to confront the students to prevent them from disrupting a public speech given by his wife.

Eli and the NY Giants are heading to Indy for a Super Bowl rematch with the New England Patriots. NY GIANTS 20 SAN FRANCISCO 49ERS 17, OT SAN FRANCISCO - Lawrence Tynes came running off the field after another overtime field goal, his index finger high in the misty air and pointing straight to another Super Bowl. It all seemed so deliriously familiar to the erupting Giants on the sideline, who once again await the New England Patriots after a 20-17 overtime victory on Sunday night to advance to Super Bowl XLVI. Even Tom Coughlin admitted resisting comparisons to the Giants’ Super Bowl victory four years ago over the Pats is now futile, and there’s no avoiding comparisons to the Giants’ glorious past. These Giants, once on the brink of a “historical” collapse, are now on the verge of history. PHOTOS: GIANTS MAKE SUPER BOWL XLVI, SET UP REMATCH WITH PATRIOTS “It is kind of eerie,” said defensive end Justin Tuck. “We tried to downplay it all along, but I’d be lying to you if I said it didn’t feel like 2007.” “It’s pretty similar,” added Giants co-owner John Mara. “Let’s hope it stays that way.” They’ll have a chance to make sure it does on Feb. 5 in Indianapolis when the Giants (12-7) face the AFC champion Patriots in a rematch of Super Bowl XLII — one of the greatest Super Bowls in history. And just like they did four years ago, they set that up that showdown with an overtime field goal by Tynes on the road. This one was from 31 yards, 7:06 into the extra session, on the slick field at Candlestick Park. It came at the end of what Coughlin called “a classic football game that seemed like no one was going to put themselves in position to win.” Until somebody did. That somebody was rookie linebacker Jacquian Williams, who reached out and stripped the ball from 49ers punt returner Kyle Williams, who was filling in for the injured Ted Ginn, and immediately put the Giants inside Tynes’ range. Kyle Williams had already muffed a punt in the fourth quarter, setting up the Giants’ go-ahead touchdown. Then he did it again in overtime when Devin Thomas, who also recovered the previous muffed punt, recovered at the 49ers 24. Five plays later, holder Steve Weatherford dug out Zak DeOssie’s low snap and Tynes kicked it through the San Francisco mist. “I blacked out, so I don’t remember anything,” Weatherford said. “But I do remember that ball going through the pipes.” That kick was the culmination of a brutal game that was exactly the “bloodbath” that Chris Canty predicted it would be. It began on a wet field in a driving rain that caused early trouble for both offenses. Eli Manning eventually found his groove, completing 32 of 58 passes for 316 yards and two touchdowns, while getting credit for his sixth fourth-quarter comeback of the year. It was 49ers quarterback Alex Smith who struck first, on a 73-yard touchdown in the first quarter to tight end Vernon Davis who flew right by Giants safety Antrel Rolle. The Giants, riding the hot hand of Victor Cruz (10 catches, 142 yards) answered when a six-yard touchdown pass to tight end Bear Pascoe, and even had a 10-7 halftime lead when Tynes hit a 31-yard field goal at the end of the first half. In the second half, the 49ers seemed to be in control after Smith (12 for 26, 196 yards) again hit Davis (3-112-2), this time for a 28-yard touchdown late in the third. But then Kyle Williams made his first mistake, letting the ball bounce off his knee when he was trying to avoid a punt. Thomas recovered that one, too, giving the Giants the ball at the 49ers 29. That set up Manning’s 17-yard touchdown pass to Mario Manningham with 8:34 left in regulation, which at the time looked like it might turn out to be the game-winning score. But David Akers hit a 25-yard field goal with 5:39 remaining and the game ended up in overtime. From there, both defenses turned up their games. The Giants’ offense even stalled twice in overtime. Manning couldn’t get anything going against the 49ers’ fierce pass rush. “(I was) just trying to be patient, that’s kind of what I kept telling myself,” he said. “Don’t give them anything. Don’t force anything. Guys never quit. They kept fighting, kept battling, no matter what the circumstances were. I think everyone knew we were going to get a chance to win this football game. Something was going to happen.” Something did with 9:32 remaining when Jacquian Williams forced the fumble that set up Tynes’ kick, and just like that, 2007 was happening all over again. The Giants, once again the “Road Warriors” were on their way back to the Super Bowl, against the team they beat in such classic fashion in Glendale, Ariz. in Feb., 2008. “I tried to fight it,” Coughlin said. “I’m sitting in there and Osi (Umenyiora) is just smiling at me, saying ‘Do you realize how this is coming down?’ It’s scary.” “It’s amazing,” Tynes added. “I had dreams about this last night.” For the second time in five seasons, those dreams incredibly came true.

Court Gives Final OK to Same-Sex Marriage Step 1: Introduce the topic Begin the article by introducing the issue of same-sex marriage and highlighting the landmark decision made by the California court. This will provide context for the reader and set the stage for the rest of the article. Introduction: In a historic ruling, the California Supreme Court has given its final approval to same-sex marriage, clearing the way for thousands of LGBTQ couples to legally wed in the state. This momentous decision not only sets a precedent for other states but also marks a significant milestone in the ongoing push for LGBTQ rights and equal treatment under the law. Step 2: Discuss the background of same-sex marriage in California Provide a brief overview of the history of same-sex marriage in California, including previous legal battles, changes in public opinion, and how these factors ultimately led to the court's decision. Background: The battle for same-sex marriage in California has spanned several decades, with initial attempts to legalize it dating back to the 1990s. In 2008, the state briefly allowed same-sex marriages before the passage of Proposition 8, a ballot measure that defined marriage as being between a man and a woman in the state constitution. Following years of legal challenges and shifting public opinions, the court's latest decision is a result of tireless advocacy by same-sex marriage supporters and organizations fighting for LGBTQ rights. Step 3: Detail the court's decision and reasoning Explain the California Supreme Court's decision, including the legal grounds on which it was made, and how the ruling will impact same-sex couples in the state. Court's Decision: The court ruled that the ban on same-sex marriage was a violation of the state constitution's equal protection clause, as it discriminated against LGBTQ individuals by denying them the same legal rights and benefits enjoyed by heterosexual couples. As a result, the court held that same-sex couples must be allowed to marry and that any previous laws prohibiting such unions are now invalid. This decision paves the way for thousands of LGBTQ couples to legally wed in California, granting them equal recognition and protection under the law. Step 4: Consider the implications of the ruling Discuss the implications of the court's decision, both in California and across the United States, as well as its potential to influence future legal battles surrounding LGBTQ rights. Implications: As the country's most populous state, California's approval of same-sex marriage carries significant weight, setting an important precedent for the rest of the nation. With this ruling, it increases the likelihood that other states will follow suit, potentially paving the way for nationwide recognition of same-sex marriages. Furthermore, the decision could also impact legal challenges to other LGBTQ rights issues, such as workplace discrimination and transgender rights, giving activists new grounds on which to argue for equal treatment under the law. Step 5: Conclude the article Summarize the key points made in the article and offer a hopeful outlook for the future of LGBTQ rights. Conclusion: The California Supreme Court's landmark decision to legalize same-sex marriage is a significant victory for LGBTQ rights. The ruling signals that progress continues to be made toward achieving full equality and recognition for all citizens, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. While there is still work to be done and challenges yet to be faced, this monumental decision provides a powerful reminder that love truly transcends all boundaries."},{"question":"Premise: \\"A man in a blue shirt is cutting up his food.\\" Based on this premise, can we conclude that the hypothesis \\"A man working in steel company.\\" is true?

Bob Dylan is being investigated on suspicion of inciting hatred in Paris over comments he made in Rolling Stone magazine, French prosecutors said Tuesday. An organization representing Croatians in France pressed charges against Dylan for allegedly comparing the conflict between Croatians and Serbs to the Nazis' persecution of Jews in an interview last year for the French edition of Rolling Stone. \\"If you got a slave master or Klan in your blood, blacks can sense that. That stuff lingers to this day. Just like Jews can sense Nazi blood and the Serbs can sense Croatian blood,\\" the influential singer-songwriter was quoted as saying.

Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death. Paragraph: Two brothers went to the doctor's office for an appointment. The doctor discovered that Tim had very high levels of cholesterol, while Jim had normal levels. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which brother had fewer plaques that can restrict blood flow? A:","response":"Based on the information provided, Jim, who had normal levels of cholesterol, would have fewer plaques that can restrict blood flow. Since high cholesterol levels are associated with the formation of plaques in the arterial walls, Tim, with his very high cholesterol levels, would be at a greater risk for developing plaque build-up and experiencing restricted blood flow."},{"question":"Упавшая нефть, с одной стороны, поддержала мировые фондовые площадки, а с другой - оказала давление на российский нефтяной сектор.

More than 800 police officers were involved in raids in Sydney’s north-west on Thursday morning with 15 people detained. Two men were charged and nine people released. Under Australia’s counter-terrorism laws, those detained could be held for two weeks without charge. One man, Omarjan Azari, 22, appeared in Sydney central court on Thursday afternoon to face charges of preparing to commit a terrorist act. It is alleged he conspired to commit the act with another man, Mohammad Baryalei, a former Sydney bouncer and actor of Afghan origin, reportedly an Islamic State leader. On Thursday night a 24-year-old man from Merrylands in western Sydney was charged with the possession of an unauthorised weapon and possessing ammunition without a licence. The attorney general, George Brandis, said an operation had been under way since May and he understood the raids had taken on a sense of urgency. Brandis told the ABC that he believed the atrocities would have gone ahead, had it not been for the intervention of the security services, the Australian federal police and forces from Queensland and New South Wales. “If ASIO and the AFP and the Queensland and NSW police had not acted today there is a likelihood this would have happened,” Brandis said. The prosecution said Azari planned to “shock, horrify and potentially terrify” the public with public killings. He was refused bail. Defence lawyers have argued the case against Azari is based on one intercepted phone call, which the prosecution said was what triggered the operation. When asked about reports that there were plans to conduct a public beheading in Australia, Abbott replied: “That’s the intelligence we received.” “The exhortations, quite direct exhortations, were coming from an Australian, who is apparently quite senior in Isil, to networks of support back in Australia to conduct demonstration killings here in this country. “So this is not just suspicion, this is intent and that’s why the police and security agencies decided to act in the way they have,” he told reporters in Arnhem Land. Abbott played down the possibility that Australia’s renewed involvement in Iraq would increase the chance of terror plots against Australian targets. He said Australia was targeted in Bali in 2002 before any involvement in the previous Iraq war. “These people, I regret to say, do not hate us for what we do, they hate us for who we are and how we live. That’s what makes us a target, the fact that we are different from their view of what an ideal society should look like, the fact that we are free, we are pluralist, we are tolerant, we are welcoming, we are accepting,” he said. “All of these, in their eyes, are wrong and that’s what makes us a target and that’s something that should never change about us. We should always be a free, fair, open and tolerant country.” Abbott said he had not received warnings Australia was more likely to be the subject of a homegrown terrorist attack than other countries, but it was important security agencies were one step ahead of groups who wanted to do Australians harm. Australian federal police Acting Commissioner Andrew Colvin said a violent attack had been planned for “the streets of New South Wales”. There were reports the plan was to kidnap someone from the street and behead them while filming it. The pre-dawn raids in Sydney were conducted at the same time as, but not directly related to, raids in Queensland with police saying the raids south of Brisbane were in relation to a counter-terrorism raid last week where two people were arrested and charged. About 70 officers were involved in Thursday’s raids in Queensland. The New South Wales police commissioner, Andrew Scipione, said there was no need to “whip” up the raids and that the operation reflected the strength and capability of Australia’s counter-terrorism forces. “Our police will continue to work tirelessly to prevent any such attacks but certainly can I stress that right now, is a time for calm. We don’t need to whip this up.” He said it would become apparent through the courts what was going to happen. Some of those arrested have had their passports cancelled because they were planning to travel to Syria or Iraq. Twenty-five search warrants were executed in the Sydney raids which were in the suburbs of Beecroft, Bellavista, Guildford, Merrylands, Northmead, Wentworthville, Marsfield, Westmead, Castle Hill, Revesby, Bass Hill and Regents Park. Colvin said the officers included investigators, forensic experts, tactical officers and surveillance officers. “This is the largest operation of its type undertaken in Australia’s history,” he said. “I think the message that we need to make clear here is that police are working very hard across this country and are very well coordinated and the community should have absolute confidence in the work of their law enforcement security agencies to work together. “While the raids in Queensland are not directly related to what has happened here today in NSW, as I said before, the investigations continue and we are looking at the linkages between the two.” Police would not say if the targets of the operation had any links to Islamic State. NSW premier Mike Baird delivered warned would-be terrorists that there would be no escape from the authorities. “We will hunt you down,” he said on Thursday. “If you have any intent to bring overseas conflicts here, if you have any intent to threaten the security of this community, we will hunt you down.” The raids come after the terror alert level in Australia was raised from medium to high last week. Police say the threat level was not raised because of the intelligence that led to Thursday’s raids. Colvin said it had been raised because of a range of factors. When asked if the prime minister was aware of the alleged planned attacks, Colvin responded: “Clearly you would understand that all levels of government need to understand what the national security threat in this country is. We have regular and ongoing briefings with all levels of government including the prime minister on the generic aspects of the national counter-terrorism threat, the national security threat.” He added: “I don’t think anyone would be surprised it’s in the interests that the PM and political leaders have an understanding of what is going on.” Two men aged 31 and 21 were arrested in last week’s raids in Queensland in a joint operation involving about 180 federal police and Queensland police. It is alleged the men were involved in recruiting, facilitating and funding people to travel to Syria to engage in hostile activities. The 31-year-old, Omar Succarieh, was charged with providing funds to the terrorist organisation Jabhat al-Nusra. Agim Kruezi, the 21-year-old, is accused of recruiting another person to become a member of Islamic State and obtaining funds in preparation for incursions into a foreign state. The previous largest counter-terrorism operation in Australia was Operation Pendennis in 2005 when 13 men were arrested over planned bomb attacks in Sydney and Melbourne.","response":"The Prime Minister of Australia, Tony Abbott, revealed that intelligence had shown an ISIS senior member was urging a network in Australia to carry out public beheadings in the country. Subsequently, the largest counter-terrorism raids in Australian history took place, involving over 800 police officers. 15 people were detained, with 2 charged and 9 released. The remaining detainees can be held for up to two weeks without charge under Australia's counter-terrorism laws. One man charged is believed to have conspired to commit a terrorist act with Mohammad Baryalei, an Islamic State leader.

Surely she would be much more useful if the universe truly was ending ? ) Stepping out into the garden , Leela sniffed the air . It was not fresh air . Question What is likely nearby Leela ? Answer:","response":"Based on the context given, there are a few possibilities for what might be nearby Leela. The context does not give us specific hints as to her exact location, but there are some clues we can derive from her observations about the environment. Firstly, Leela steps out into a garden which is likely an outdoor area with plants and possibly other natural features. This indicates that she might be in a suburban or rural area, or perhaps a part of a city with some green space. Gardens can be both domestic (like in a home), public (like a park), or part of institution (like a school or hospital). Any of these can be possibilities for her location. Leela sniffs the air on exiting and notes that the air is not fresh. This might suggest that she's near a source of pollution or something else that's causing the air to be less than clean. This could be anything from a busy road or highway, factories that are producing emissions, or an area with dense populations where there's a lot of human activity. It might also suggest an enclosed or controlled environment somewhere – perhaps a greenhouse or biodome – where the air isn’t as fresh due to lack of open area. Moreover, it also deserves consideration that the context mentions “people who had brought her here” and the “President”. This might indicate the presence of some official or governmental settings or buildings nearby. Given that it was important enough for them to bring Leela, it's likely a significant location in some sense. It could be a research facility, military base, or other classified area, possibly related to the government or the issue of the universe ending. It's also possible that the lack of fresh air is due to a particular event or situation. Since the context mentions that the 'universe is truly ending,' there may be something going on that's affecting the air quality – like an impending natural disaster, fallout from a major event, or some kind of environmental change. In conclusion, while the precise nature of what's nearby Leela is hard to pin down without further information, it's likely that she's in or near a significant location with perhaps a higher level of human activity or industrialisation, and possibly suboptimal air quality due to any number of factors. The presence of a garden suggests a mix of natural and manmade elements around her, and the mention of the 'universe ending' might indicate a crisis situation that could be affecting the environment."},{"question":"Options are: -negative -positiveWould the following phrase be considered positive or negative? shrek","response":"The phrase \\"Shrek\\" is neutral because it's just the name of a popular movie character.

Ricketts Glen State Park is in five townships in three counties. After the 1768 purchase, the land became part of Northumberland County, but was soon divided among other counties. Most of the park is in Luzerne County, which was formed in 1786 from part of Northumberland County. Within Luzerne County, the majority of the park, including all of the waterfalls and most of Lake Jean, is in Fairmount Township, which was settled in 1792 and incorporated in 1834; the easternmost part of the park is in Ross Township, which was settled in 1795 and incorporated in 1842. The northwest part of the park is in Sullivan County, which was formed in 1847 from Lycoming County; Davidson Township was settled by 1808 and incorporated in 1833, while Colley Township, which has the park office and part of Lake Jean, was settled in the early 19th century and incorporated in 1849. A small part of the southwest part of the park is in Sugarloaf Township in Columbia County; the township was settled in 1792 and incorporated in 1812, the next year Columbia County was formed from Northumberland County.A hunter named Robinson was the first inhabitant in the area whose name is known; around 1800 he had a cabin on the shores of Long Pond (now called Lake Ganoga), which is less than 0.4 miles (0.6 km) northwest of the park. The first development within the park was the construction of the Susquehanna and Tioga Turnpike, which was built from 1822 to 1827 between the Pennsylvania communities of Berwick in the south and Towanda in the north. The turnpike, which Pennsylvania Route 487 mostly follows through the park, had daily stagecoach service from 1827 to 1851; the northbound stagecoach left Berwick in the morning and stopped for lunch at the Long Pond Tavern on the lake about noon.The earliest settlers in what became the park were two squatters who built sawmills to make bed frames from cherry trees they cut for lumber.

Related: Chicago Bears stun Green Bay Packers as Brett Favre returns to Lambeau Field Uma Blue remains top of the overall standings, although things are getting rather more congested in the chasing pack. Full standings in the comments section shortly. Until then, here are this week’s games. “The bear is not loose here inside the building,” said Falcons head coach Dan Quinn – seeking to dispel the air of anxiety around his team after a fourth defeat in five games. Reassuring words, but Atlanta fans might still feel concerned about the Vikings gathering at the gate. Quinn’s Falcons were supposed to cruise into the playoffs after a 5-0 start, but now even their wilcard hopes are under threat. Their head coach was justified in pointing out that each of the last three losses have been close-run things – Atlanta’s combined margin of defeat standing at just seven points – but the concussion sustained by Devonta Freeman last Sunday only adds to the sensation that this season is starting to unravel. The tailback may yet play against Minnesota but even if he does, can we count on Atlanta to rebound? The Vikings are coming off a dispiriting defeat of their own, crushed 30-13 by Green Bay in a game that was supposed to herald their arrival as the new lords of the NFC North. An offensive line that held the Rams’ fierce pass rush without a sack two weeks previously allowed the Packers to get to Teddy Bridgewater six times. But the impression I took from that game was more that the Vikings are a young and inconsistent team than an overrated one primed for a crash. Vikings to win The youngest starting quarterback in the NFL has made some seriously impressive strides in recent weeks. Jameis Winston tied an NFL rookie record with five touchdown passes against the Eagles, and has gone without a turnover in five of his last six games. Along the way, he has steered Tampa Bay to a 5-5 record that puts them right in the thick of the NFC wildcard hunt. But the oldest quarterback in the NFL is doing a pretty good job, too. Matt Hasselbeck has lost a little arm strength and, as Winston observed this week, a lot of hair since his youth, but Indianapolis have still won all three games that he has played. His performances this season compare favourably to those of the man he is filling in for, Andrew Luck. But for all of the narrative appeal of youth against experience, I am not sure this game be defined by its quarterbacks at all. Doug Martin is averaging five yards per carry on the ground, while the Colts rank 21st in the league against the run. Ball control and methodical offense will be Tampa Bay’s best weapons against opponents who lose some of the explosiveness required to put points up quickly when Luck is out of the line-up. Buccaneers to win The Giants have tended to enjoy their recent meetings with Washington. They have won all of the last five head-to-heads, and are 15-4 in this series dating back to 2006. In the eyes of New York’s tabloid press, Dan Snyder’s team are no longer rivals but “rivals”. For all that it is tempting to write Washington off in the wake of its 44-16 humiliation by Carolina, however, we might also want to observe the disparity this season between the team’s performances at home and on the road. Washington have won their last four games at FedEx Field, beating the Rams, Eagles, Buccaneers and Saints – the latter by 33 points. Kirk Cousins has thrown nine touchdowns and no interceptions in that streak, compared with five scores and eight picks on the road. With DeSean Jackson finding his groove again after a prolonged absence, I could imagine Cousins having another productive outing. This is the same Giants team that gave up 52 points to the Saints earlier this month, after all. Washington to win Seattle does not hold happy memories for the Steelers. Their six defeats in seven road games against the Seahawks are only the tip of the iceberg. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette this week recalled a number of Steeler misadventures in the Emerald City, including the occasion, in 1981, when their flight home was grounded by fog. “That night, a few of the players went out to a local establishment,” wrote Ed Bouchette, “and the backup quarterback, Cliff Stoudt, broke his right arm when he missed an arcade punching bag and hit a pipe.” This year’s team has had to cope without each of its best two signal callers (NB: a category which does not include Michael Vick) at different points this season, but they arrive in Seattle with both men healthy and their team poised for a playoff run. To have reached this stage with a 6-4 record despite those setbacks, not to mention a season-ending injury to Le’Veon Bell, speaks to the depth and resilience of this group. Seattle will themselves be without Marshawn Lynch, though the barnstorming efforts of rookie Thomas Rawls suggest he might not be that badly missed. The greater questions, for me, surround the Seahawks’ ability to protect Russell Wilson from Pittsburgh’s pass rush, and their ability to slow down Ben Roethlisberger and Antonio Brown on the other side of the ball. One imagines that Richard Sherman will be tasked with covering Brown but that is no guarantee of success. In the six games that Roethlisberger has started this season, the receiver has piled up a preposterous 906 receiving yards with five scores. Steelers to win Just six more games stand between the Patriots and their second undefeated regular season in less than a decade. On paper it looks all too achievable. The Broncos are the only team left on their schedule with a winning record, and they will be led by a quarterback – Brock Osweiler – who made his first-ever NFL start last week. But the devil is in the detail. In previous years we might have read the long list of names on the New England injury report indicate as an act of Belichickian misdirection. This time they are evidence of genuine problems. The Patriots’ offense has coped admirably so far with the loss of Dion Lewis and Julian Edelman, but with Aaron Dobson ruled out for this game and Danny Amendola’s status up in the air, Tom Brady is beginning to run out of team-mates to throw the ball to. And sad though it is to think that we may never see Peyton Manning square off against Brady on the gridiron again, Osweiler did look pretty good in last week’s win over Chicago His learning curve will be steep against a Bill Belichick defense, but the least we can say is that he gives his team a better chance to win than the version of Manning that we saw in week 10 against Kansas City. The Broncos will not seek to put this game on their quarterback’s shoulders. The hope will be that a defense that has restricted opponents to 190.6 yards per game through the air can suffocate those few receivers that Brady still has left at his disposal. The Broncos stand a better chance than any of the teams that have gone before them. But I’m still picking the team that has not lost yet. Patriots to win Has any game ever encapsulated a team’s season better than Baltimore’s win over St Louis last weekend? Having previously fallen to 2-7 without ever being defeated by more than eight points, the Ravens finally achieved a long overdue victory … only to lose both their starting quarterback and running back to season-ending injuries in the process. Not that Browns fans will feel much sympathy. No team is more familiar with that feeling of having a rug pulled out from underneath them. Few in Cleveland truly believed that Johnny Manziel was the answer to all (or any) of their prayers, but they were at least enjoying the ride as they watched him throw for close to 400 yards against Pittsburgh. News that he had celebrated his elevation to starting quarterback by heading out to a nightclub, and subsequently being relegated to third-string, was enough to make grown men cry. But on the plus side, with Josh McCown back in the line-up and their opponents so utterly ravaged by injuries, Cleveland may actually get a win this weekend.

For example, changes in temperature, humidity, or air quality could have impacts on the body's hydration levels or ability to effectively excrete waste products. Additionally, any changes in the availability or quality of water due to shifts in energy absorption could potentially influence the waste removal process.

A child learns to walk by practicing until he no longer has to think about how to put one foot in front of the other. An excellent sportsman practices until he can play quickly, correctly and without thinking. Educators call it \\"automaticity \\". www.ks5u.com A child learns to read by sounding out the letters and finding the meaning of the words. With practice, he stumbles less and less, reading by the phrase . With automaticity, he doesn't have to think about the meaning of words, so he can give all his attention to the meaning of the text. It can begin as early as first grade. In a recent study of children in Illinois schools, Alan Rossman of Northwestern University found that automatic readers in the first grade not only read almost three times as fast as the others, but also got better results in exams. According to Rossman, the key to automaticity is the amount of time a child spends reading , not his IQ. Any child who spends at least 3.5 to 4 hours a week reading books, magazines or newspapers will probably reach automaticity. It can happen if a child turns off TV just one night for reading at home.

Tennessee's struggles continued as Patriots running back Laurence Maroney got a 45-yard touchdown run, followed by kicker Stephen Gostkowski making a 33-yard field goal. Things got worse for the Titans in the second quarter as quarterback Tom Brady completed five touchdown passes, two to wide receiver Randy Moss (40-yard and 28-yard), one to running back Kevin Faulk (38-yard), and two to wide receiver Wes Welker (30-yard and 5-yard).

View Full Caption NYPD NEW YORK CITY — After more than 22 years, the NYPD has made an arrest in the “Baby Hope” murder case. Conrado Juarez, 52, thought to be a cousin of Baby Hope, was living with the little girl in Queens during the summer of 1991 and was taken into custody Friday then charged Saturday in connection with her death, the NYPD said. Juarez, who is from the child's father's side, confessed to sexually assualting and then murdering the young child while drunk one night, sources told DNAinfo New York, which first broke the story. Police also announced the real name of the 4-year-old girl, who was called Baby Hope by investigators for decades: Anjelica Castillo. For years, investigators thought that either her mother or her father would be involved in her death, after her body was found wrapped in plastic and stuffed inside a cooler in 1991, but as of right now neither has been charged, police said. Juarez admitted to police that Anjelica was living with a relative, possibly Juarez's mother, in an Astoria apartment shared by seven of Juarez's relatives when he came over intoxicated, sodomized the girl, and then suffocated her with a pillow, according to police sources and the Manhattan District Attorney's office. Balvina Juarez-Ramirez, his sister, had been watching Anjelica and her sister at the time of the alleged murder, the DA said, and sources told \\"On the Inside\\" that the girl's father had left the children with her after a split with the girls' mother. Juarez had access to the girl several nights, according to the complaint. \\"He made statements admitting that he forced sexual contact with the child,\\" said ADA Melissa Mourges, the original prosecutor on the case in 1991, during the arraignment, and she described the brutal attack on the young girl. \\"During that act he put a pillow over her face, suffocating her,\\" added Mourges, who is Chief of the DA's Cold Case Unit. With his sister's help, he \\"folded the girl in half, tied her, placed her in a garbage bag inside the cooler, placed soda cans on top of her body, then left the cooler in Upper Manhattan,\\" said Mourges, taking a livery cab to Inwood Park and dropping the cooler in a wooded area. The baby's corpse was first found by construction workers, on July 23, 1991 along the Henry Hudson Parkwayin Washington Heights. Her disappearance was never reported. Since then, investigators have pursued hundreds of leads down dead ends. Police held a press conference Saturday with the Manhattan District Attorney's office announcing the man's arrest. Following a media blitz this past summer by the NYPD on the 22nd anniversary of her death, a Washington Heights mother told police that a couple of years ago she had overheard a woman in a laundry say that her little sister had died and may have been killed. That woman who overheard the tip notified the NYPD, which tracked down the woman from the laundromat. She turned out to be Anjelica’s sister. The NYPD then obtained a DNA match with the child’s mother, who has had 10 children, sources said. After finding her the NYPD back-tracked, starting with Anjelica's birth at Elmhurst Hospital in April of 1987, and developing a sprawling family tree that included relatives in New York and Mexico. Juarez, who was arrested Friday at a restaurant where he works, has four grown children and lived in the Bronx, police said. One of the daughters answered the door at his Morris Heights apartment building Friday, Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said, and told police Juarez had been living in Mexico for 12 years. After interviewing his wife however, investigators found him at his restaurant job in Manhattan, where he was taken into custody Friday morning. Sources told DNAinfo that he acted surprised at first that police were questioning him. District Attorney Cy Vance credited the efforts of the police and tireless members of his office with the arrest. \\"Cold cases are not forgotten cases. Today's arrest of the man charged with killing Anjelica in 1991 is an extraordinary example of police work,\\" he said, adding that Assistant District Attorney Melissa Mourges, who responded on the day Anjelica's body was was discovered, had \\"worked the case ever since.\\" Juarez was arraigned late Saturday The “Baby Hope” murder has been one of the city’s most troublesome and heart-wrenching cold cases. Two years after her death, NYPD detectives finally gave the girl's remains a proper funeral in Washington Heights attended by 500 people, and then buried her in St. Raymond’s Cemetery in The Bronx, with a headstone bearing her moniker, the date she was found, and three words, “Because We Care.” ||||| The announcement of an arrest in one of New York City's most notorious cold cases was especially relieving for two hardened investigators, who for 22 years had been working to identify the girl they nicknamed Baby Hope after discovering her body stuffed in a picnic cooler along a highway.

(Associated Press) FILE - In this July 23, 2013, file photo shows a poster soliciting information regarding an unidentified body near the site where the body was found in New York. Police in New York City said Saturday,... (Associated Press) Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Melissa Mourges, the original prosecutor in the 1991 case and now chief of the cold case unit, told a Manhattan judge that Conrado Juarez, 52, was charged with felony murder late Saturday. The charge came shortly after police announced the Bronx man was a relative of the tiny victim, 4-year-old Anjelica Castillo. Police revealed her name for the first time earlier in the day. Juarez, wearing a white short sleeve button-down shirt and blue pants, pleaded not guilty but said nothing else after he was remanded to custody. Attorney information was not immediately available. \\"Over the years, the optimism was always there except the frustration would grow,\\" said Detective Joseph Reznick, now a New York Police Department assistant chief who, in 1993, read the eulogy at the girl's burial before hundreds of mourners. \\"I think reflecting back on what we named this little girl, Baby Hope, I think it's the most accurate name we could have come up with.\\" \\"You know the expression I'm on cloud 9? Well, that's where I am right now,\\" said former detective Jerry Giorgio, who had the case from 1991 until this summer, when he retired from the Manhattan district attorney's cold case squad. For more than two decades, the girl's name, age and circumstances of death were unknown. But in a dramatic turnaround, police last week announced that a new tip and a DNA test had allowed them to finally identify the baby's mother. Then, on Saturday, police Commissioner Raymond Kelly announced the arrest of Juarez, a dishwasher, who Kelly said confessed to the killing, claiming he killed the girl at his now-deceased sister's apartment after sexually abusing her. He told authorities that the sister helped him dispose of the body. They were cousins of the girl's father. The case became an obsession for some investigators, who worked tirelessly to chase down every lead and generate new ones. In July, detectives tried another round of publicity on the 22nd anniversary of the discovery of Baby Hope's body. They canvassed the neighborhood where she was found, hung fliers, circulated sketches of her and a photograph of the cooler and announced a 12,000 reward for information leading to an arrest. A tipster, who saw recent news stories on the case, led police to Anjelica's sister, who told detectives she thought her sister had been killed. Police matched DNA from Anjelica to their mother. The mother, who was not identified, didn't have custody of Anjelica at the time of the girl's death _ she had been living with relatives on the father's side, including Juarez's sister, Balvina Juarez-Ramirez, police said. Police closed in on the suspect and waited for him Friday outside a Manhattan restaurant where he worked. He told them he noticed Anjelica while visiting the family apartment and killed her, police said. \\"When she went motionless, he summoned his sister from another room,\\" Kelly said. Then, the sister got the blue cooler _ which still contained full cans of Coke. They took a livery cab from Queens to Manhattan, where they dumped the cooler, then separated. Her parents never reported her missing, though they had contact with the suspect. Juarez had never been considered a suspect before. Police refused to say whether he had previous arrests or had been accused in other sexual assaults. Kelly called the arrest a superb case of detective work and said he was proud of his officers. \\"For me, it makes you proud to be a member of this organization _ they were unrelenting,\\" he said. The detectives assigned to the case were instrumental in organizing a burial in a Bronx cemetery for the girl in 1993. The girl was dressed in a white frock and buried in a white coffin. The detectives paid for the girl's headstone that reads: \\"Because we care.\\" ___ Associated Press writer Jake Pearson contributed to this report. ||||| Summary:","response":"Imagine a scary mystery story that was finally solved by some good detectives after a very long time. This story is about a little girl named Anjelica Castillo, but the police had another special name for her, \\"Baby Hope.\\" Sadly, Baby Hope was killed many years ago, in the summer of 1991. But the police and detectives didn't give up and kept looking for the person who had hurt her. After 22 years, they finally found out that a man named Conrado Juarez, who was a member of Baby Hope's family, did some terrible things to her and caused her death. He was captured by the detectives and told them what he did. The police also found out Baby Hope’s real name, which was Anjelica Castillo. Juarez was taken to court where he had to face the law for his bad actions. The police worked really hard to solve the mystery of Baby Hope and kept her memory alive. Detectives even organized a lovely funeral for Baby Hope with lots of people attending. Remember, this story is very sad, but it's important to know that there were a lot of good people working very hard to give little Baby Hope justice and peace."},{"question":"Q:Question: \\"What did Burke point out in his letter from April 1791?\\" Context: \\"In November 1790, François-Louis-Thibault de Menonville, a member of the National Assembly of France, wrote to Burke, praising Reflections and requesting more \\"very refreshing mental food\\" that he could publish. This Burke did in April 1791 when he published A Letter to a Member of the National Assembly. Burke called for external forces to reverse the revolution and included an attack on the late French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, as being the subject of a personality cult that had developed in revolutionary France. Although Burke conceded that Rousseau sometimes showed \\"a considerable insight into human nature\\" he mostly was critical. Although he did not meet Rousseau on his visit to Britain in 1766–7 Burke was a friend of David Hume, with whom Rousseau had stayed. Burke said Rousseau \\"entertained no principle either to influence of his heart, or to guide his understanding—but vanity\\"—which he \\"was possessed to a degree little short of madness\\". He also cited Rousseau's Confessions as evidence that Rousseau had a life of \\"obscure and vulgar vices\\" that was not \\"chequered, or spotted here and there, with virtues, or even distinguished by a single good action\\". Burke contrasted Rousseau's theory of universal benevolence and his having sent his children to a foundling hospital: \\"a lover of his kind, but a hater of his kindred\\".\\" Answer: A:","response":"In his letter from April 1791, Burke made several points to François-Louis-Thibault de Menonville, a member of the National Assembly of France: 1. Burke called for external forces to reverse the French Revolution, as he believed it was harmful and needed to be undone. 2. He criticized the personality cult that had developed around the late French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau in revolutionary France. He acknowledged that Rousseau had some insights into human nature but was mostly critical of his ideas. 3. Burke questioned Rousseau's character and suggested that vanity was the primary driving force behind his actions and ideas. This vanity, according to Burke, bordered on madness. 4. He referenced Rousseau's Confessions as evidence that Rousseau led a life filled with \\"obscure and vulgar vices\\" without any redeeming virtues or good actions. 5. Finally, Burke highlighted the contradiction between Rousseau's theory of universal benevolence and his personal actions, such as sending his own children to a foundling hospital. This demonstrated, in Burke's view, that Rousseau was a \\"lover of his kind, but a hater of his kindred.\\" Overall, Burke's letter was a critique of the French Revolution, the ideas of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and a call for external intervention to reverse the course of the revolution."},{"question":"Es gibt Berichte wissenschaftlicher Sachverständiger über die Situation, aber diese Berichte können nicht alle für rechtliche Schritte gegen die Schiffe, die sich der Verletzung von Vorschriften schuldig gemacht haben, genutzt werden.

Once you have strong enough support from your friends and fellow students, you're ready to go. In order to establish a successful volunteering club at your school, it is crucial to gauge the interest and support from your peers. You can do this by informally discussing your idea for the club with classmates and friends, as well as reaching out to potential members via social media platforms. This step will help you understand how many people are likely to join and participate in your club, which will be helpful when you approach school authorities or local organizations for permissions and collaborations. Once you have determined the level of interest among your fellow students, you can move forward with the next steps in the process, which include: 1. Create a club proposal: Draft a written proposal outlining the purpose and main objectives of your volunteering club. Include the benefits the club will bring to the school, its members, and the community. Highlight any specific projects or activities that the club plans to undertake. 2. Get permission from school authorities: Submit your club proposal to relevant school administrators, such as the principal, guidance counselor, or student activities coordinator. Be prepared to answer their questions or address any concerns they may have. They may request certain modifications or additions to your proposal based on their input and knowledge of the school's activities and regulations. 3. Find a faculty advisor: Most schools require that clubs have a faculty advisor, who will act as a liaison between the club and the school administration. Approach a teacher or staff member who is passionate about community service and may be interested in supporting your club's mission. 4. Hold an informational meeting: Once your club has been approved, organize an informational meeting for interested students. Use this opportunity to discuss the club's goals and mission, and get feedback from potential members about the types of volunteering projects they would like to participate in. 5. Develop a club constitution: Draft a constitution that outlines the structure, roles, and responsibilities of the club's leadership and members, as well as any rules and regulations that will govern the club's activities. This will ensure that everyone involved in the club is on the same page and is aware of their responsibilities. 6. Plan events and activities: Work with your club members and local organizations to identify volunteering opportunities and plan activities that align with your club's mission. Be sure to plan a variety of events, both large and small, to accommodate diverse interests and schedules among your members. 7. Promote your club and its activities: Utilize social media, school announcements, and flyers to inform the school community about your club's events and activities. Encourage members to invite friends and spread the word about the club. By following these steps, you will be able to create a successful volunteering club at your school that not only enriches the lives of its members but also makes a significant impact on your community. Remember to remain open to new ideas and opportunities as your club grows and evolves."},{"question":"Choose your answer. Microsoft Looks to Expand Windows Brand at Home Efforts by Microsoft Corp.

When I heard about a new Japanese Italian fusion restaurant, I was curious to check it out. The restaurant is located in the same shopping center as Raku, Monta Noodle and Big Wong so it's in great company. It's small with about nine tables and a bar. The ambiance is simple and modern. I ordered ginger ale and it wasn't the regular stuff you can buy at the supermarket. It was Fever Tree Ginger Ale and it was so, so good! The buns they provide as an appetizer were fresh, warm and delicious. (I didn't get a chance to take note of the proper names of the menu items so pardon me if I don't get the names correct.) We started off with Jidori Chicken which translates to \\"organic chicken\\" per the waitress. It was good but not memorable. My husband ordered the Miso Carbonara (13.95) and he enjoyed it. I ordered the Fettucini with Baby Scallops and Tarako (?) sauce (18.95). Again, I apologize if I get the names wrong. I really enjoyed my dish. The pasta was cooked perfectly as were the scallops and the sauce was indescribable. I really tasted the Italian and Japanese influence in the dish. For dessert, we shared the Tiramisu. It was good, not too sweet, but it wasn't the best Tiramisu I ever had. I would give the service 5 stars because the waitresses were very sweet and attentive. They were wonderful about explaining the menu items to us, our glasses were never empty and they kept our table clean. I would suggest to sign up for their e-mail distribution because they change out their pasta menu every few weeks. I can't wait to see what else they have to offer! What is the sentiment of this review?","response":"To determine the sentiment of this review, let's analyze it step by step: 1. The reviewer mentions that fusion restaurants are popular in Las Vegas and expresses curiosity about the Japanese-Italian place, which indicates intrigue. 2. The restaurant's location, according to the reviewer, is in good company with other well-known establishments. This suggests a positive surrounding environment. 3.

Positive remarks are also made about the ginger ale and the appetizer buns, which they found enjoyable. 5.

The reviewer comments positively on both the Miso Carbonara and the Fettuccini dishes, stating that her husband enjoyed his meal and that she appreciated the combination of Italian and Japanese flavors in her dish. 7. The Tiramisu dessert receives mixed reviews. It is described as being \\"good, not too sweet,\\" but also not the best the reviewer has ever had, showing a neutral to slightly positive sentiment. 8. The service gets a 5-star mention from the reviewer due to the attentiveness and helpfulness of the waitresses, showing a very positive sentiment. 9. The reviewer recommends signing up for the restaurant's email list to stay updated on menu changes, and expresses excitement for future offerings, which indicates a positive sentiment and a likelihood to return.

The show was created by Carey, who had both stand-up comedy and writing experience, and Bruce Helford, who was once a writer for Roseanne. It was the first television show to have an episode simulcast on the Internet. Produced by Mohawk Productions in association with Warner Bros. Television, it debuted on September 13, 1995, and ranked among the Top 30 programs for four seasons before sliding in popularity. The show finished its first season (1995-1996) barely in the Top 50, placing 48th in the Nielsen ratings, with an average rating of 10.1. The second season did considerably better, making it into the Top 20 finishing its second season (1996-1997) 18th in the Nielsen ratings with an average rating of 11.5. Viewership increased 13.9% from season one. The show finished its third season (1997-1998) at a higher place in the ratings, placing 16th with an average rating of 11.1 during the season; however, the ratings share was a drop of 3.5% from the second season. During its fourth season (1998-1999), the series finished the season in the Nielsen ratings higher in the Top 20 making it to 14th place but with an average rating of 9.9, a decrease of 10.8% from the third season. The show finished its fifth season (1999-2000) 24th in the Nielsen ratings, the first time since season one that the show was not in the Top 20, with an average rating of 9.5, a decrease of 4% from the fourth season. This was a smaller drop than many other series experienced, given the erosion of network audiences. This was also a smaller drop than the previous season. The show's sixth season (2000-2001) finished 41st with an average rating of 8.23, a decrease of 13.4 percent from the fifth season. ABC signed a new contract to keep the show on through a ninth season, even though the show had yet to enter its seventh season (2001-2002) at that time. The season saw one of the show's biggest drops in ratings, finishing 57th with an average rating of 5.9, a significant drop of 28.3% from the sixth season. The show finished its eighth season (2002-2003) season 119th with an average rating of 3.29, a drop of 44.23 percent from the seventh season. This caused ABC to put the series on hiatus, airing the rest of the season in the summer of 2003. Unable to get out of the contract, ABC was forced to allow the show to film a ninth season, paying three million dollars per episode. Not doing well enough to receive a time slot on ABC's fall schedule in 2003, the show had its ninth and final season burned off during the summer of 2004. The series finale was viewed by a little over 5 million viewers. Ask a question about this article.","response":"The Drew Carey Show is an American sitcom that embodied the everyday life of the office and home of a fictional character bearing the name of the comedy actor Drew Carey, who co-created the show alongside Bruce Helford, a former Roseanne writer. Given Carey's background in stand-up comedy and writing, his ability to connect with a broad audience and convey relatable narratives strongly resonated in the show. Making its television debut on September 13, 1995 through Mohawk Productions and Warner Bros. Television, The Drew Carey Show carried the distinction of being the first show to ever simulcast an episode on the Internet, embracing digital innovation of that era. The show's ratings journey was a rollercoaster ride reflecting the dynamics of the television industry. Initially, it teetered on the edge of Nielsen's Top 50 in its 1995-1996 season. However, in its sophomore season (1996-1997), the sitcom moved up the ranks impressively, reaching 18th place with a considerable average rating jump from 10.1 to 11.5. There was a marked increase in viewership throughout this period, with a significant surge of 13.9% over season one. Its third season (1997-1998) brought the show to the 16th position with a slight dip in ratings share. Despite this, the average rating remained steady at 11.1—the decrease in share by a margin of 3.5% from the second season reflecting a more competitive landscape in television programming. Roadblocks began to appear during the fourth season (1998-1999), classified by a downturn in average ratings from 11.1 to 9.9, accounting for a noticeable 10.8% decrease from the prior season. Yet the show moved up in standings to 14th place. By the fifth season (1999-2000), the show tumbled out of the Top 20 for the first time since its first season, landing in the 24th position with a marginally decreased rating of 9.5. This 4% drop from the fourth season was a bearing testament to diminishing network audiences, though it fared better than other series. In its sixth season (2000-2001), viewership continued to wane, resulting in a 13.4% decline in ratings averaging 8.23 and pushing the show down to the 41st spot. Despite these choppier waters, ABC signed a new contract to extend the run of the show through a ninth season. The seventh (2001-2002) and eighth (2002-2003) seasons saw steep declines in ratings, with average ratings dropping by 28.3% and 44.23% respectively. This prompted ABC to place the series on hiatus and relegate the remainder of the eighth season to a summer 2003 airing slot. With a ninth season committed in the contract, even though the ratings didn't justify it, ABC forked over three million dollars per episode for the final season. However, with lackluster ratings, the show was not allotted a time slot on ABC's fall schedule in 2003 and was subsequently aired throughout the summer of 2004. The series concluded with a final audience of just over five million viewers. In conclusion, The Drew Carey Show's ups and downs in ratings and viewership signify the varying dynamics of the television industry and the fluctuations in audience interest throughout its near-decade-long run. Despite the hurdles, it left an indelible mark with its engaging narrative and the relatability of its titular character, contributing significantly to the landscape of 90s sitcoms."},{"question":"What concepts are described in the following sentence? \\"The Twenty Two is a kid friendly French eatery.\\" Return the answer as pairs of triples.","response":"1.

As a result, these animals might experience difficulties in resting, finding food, or hiding from predators.

The choice of words like \\"ridiculously,\\" \\"obnoxious,\\" \\"stupid,\\" and \\"craps out\\" gives a negative connotation to these aspects.

Context: As a nurse, what is the most difficult news you have ever had to break to a patient? Sadly in my job (Ob/gyn nurse) there is one thing I have to report fairly often, that a pregnancy is not going to happen. Sometimes the mom’s are bleeding and they kind of know that this is going to happen, but sometimes, they are not bleeding and it is a gut punch without any warning. This can be an ultrasound that shows no heartbeat or a lab test that is declining. Nothing is worse than the look on a woman’s face when she is looking forward to her first glimpse of her baby only to be told that the baby is not alive. It doesn’t get any easier, no matter how many times you do it. My own daughter called me one day to announce she was pregnant and two days later, we found out she was miscarrying and I bawled all day. I never even knew this baby, but now, 15 years later, just writing this now is making my eyes water. I have to do a lot of this over the phone and that makes it even harder because I am not able to offer comfort and I don’t know where they are or what they are doing when they get this news. If they call me for their lab results, they might be driving, they might be walking around the mall, they will have to call their significant other and break the news, such difficult conversations to have over the phone. I have been very, very lucky that the few times I have seen advanced pregnancies that underwent a fetal demise were handled by the physicians that I have worked with. I can’t imagine being almost ready to deliver and having all your hopes and dreams crushed.

Article: As a professor at a large American university,there is a phrase that I hear often from students:\\"I'm only a 1050.\\"The unlucky students are speaking of the score on the Scholastic Aptitude Test(SAT),which is used to determine whether they will be admitted to the college or university of their choice,or even if they have a chance to get a higher education at all.The SAT score,whether it is 800,1100 or 1550,has become the focus at this time of their life. It is obvious that if students value highly their test scores,then a great amount of their self-respect is put in the number.Students who perform poorly on the exam are left feeling that it is all over.The low test score,they think,will make it impossible for them to get into a good college.And without a degree from a _ ,they fear that many of life's doors will remain forever closed. According to a study done in the 1990s,the SAT is only a reliable indicator of a student's future performance in most cases.Interestingly,it becomes much more accurate when it is set together with other indicators-like a student's high school grades.Even if standardized tests like the SAT could show a student's academic proficiency ,they will never be able to test things like confidence,efforts and willpower,and are unable to give us the full picture of a student's potentialities .This is not to suggest that we should stop using SAT scores in our college admission process.The SAT is an excellent test in many ways,and the score is still a useful means of testing students.However,it should be only one of many methods used.

Even after the emergence of the professional National Football League (NFL), college football remained extremely popular throughout the U.S. Although the college game has a much larger margin for talent than its pro counterpart, the sheer number of fans following major colleges provides a financial equalizer for the game, with Division I programs the highest level playing in huge stadiums, six of which have seating capacity exceeding 100,000. In many cases, college stadiums employ bench-style seating, as opposed to individual seats with backs and arm rests. This allows them to seat more fans in a given amount of space than the typical professional stadium, which tends to have more features and comforts for fans.

There are some people who can calculate the day of the week for any given date in 40,000 years, but who cannot add two plus two. Others can perform complex classical piano pieces after hearing them once, but they cannot read or write. Dr. J. Langdon Down first described this condition in 1887. He called these people idiot savants. An idiot savant is a person who has significant mental injury, such as in autism or retardation. At the same time, the person also exhibits some extraordinary skills, which are unusual for most people. The skills of the savant may vary from being exceptionally gifted in music or in mathematics, or having a photographic memory. One of the first descriptions of a human who could calculate quickly was written in 1789 by Dr. Benjamin Rush, an American doctor. His patient, Thomas Fuller, was brought to Virginia as a slave in 1724. It took Thomas only 90 seconds to work out that a man who has lived 70 years, 17 days, and 12 hours has lived 2,210,500,800 seconds. Despite this ability, he died in 1790 without ever learning to read or write. Another idiot savant slave became famous as a pianist in the 1860s. Blind Tom had a vocabulary of only 100 words, but he played 5,000 musical pieces beautifully. In the excellent movie Rain Man, made in 1988 and available on video cassette, Dustin Hoffman plays an idiot savant who amazes his brother played by Tom Cruise, with his ability to perform complex calculations very rapidly. Today we more clearly recognize that the idiot savant is special because of brain impairment. Yet not all brain injury leads to savant skills. Some studies have shown that people who have purposeful interruption of the left side of the brain can develop idiot savant skills. However few people wish to participate in such experiments. There are many excellent reasons for not undergoing unnecessary experimentation on one's brain. The term idiot savant is outdated and inappropriate.

Salmonella strains were found last week during routine test by Kraft Foods, one company that purchased the nuts. The nuts came from Setton Farms in Terra Bella, California, about 75 miles south of Fresno. They were largely distributed in 2,000-pound containers to food wholesalers who would then package them for resale or incorporate them as ingredients in other products, such as ice cream and trail mix. No illnesses have been linked to this case, said Dr. David Acheson, FDA's associate commissioner. But salmonella strains were found last week during routine test by Kraft Foods, one of about three dozen companies that purchase pistachios from Setton Farms, he said. Kraft notified the FDA on March 24. Setton Farms did not immediately respond to CNN requests for comment. Acheson emphasized that unlike the recent case of salmonella-tainted peanut butter, this recall was not prompted by an sickness outbreak, saying the decision was a \\"proactive\\" move. He said the FDA has received two recent complaints, from the East and West coasts, from people who say they became ill after eating pistachio products, but a link to Setton Farms has not been confirmed, he said. The FDA is advising consumers not to eat any pistachio products, but not to throw them out, either, because additional recalls are likely and having products that could be turned in would allow for easier tracing of contamination. The agency is setting up a Web site to update the public. Dr. Jeff Farrar, head of the California health department's food and drug division, said it's likely that the roasted pistachios will be found in a wide variety of products. He noted that Setton Farms is the second-largest pistachio processor in the nation. Raw pistachios are roasted to a temperature that should kill salmonella, Acheson said. Because the roasted products tested positive for salmonella suggest cross-contamination with raw products. Acheson added that the Setton Farms recall is related to the one announced Friday by Kroger, a grocery store chain with stores in 31 states. Kroger recalled Private Selection shelled pistachios from its retail stores because of possible salmonella contamination. Kroger, in a statement Friday, said no illnesses have been reported in connection with the product. In February, Kroger was among retailers that recalled peanut products tied to the Peanut Corporation of America, a Virginia-based company accused by the FDA of knowingly selling peanut butter and peanut paste that was contaminated with salmonella. PCA's peanut processing plant in Blakely, Georgia, is being investigated in connection with a salmonella outbreak that has sickened more than 500 people and has been linked to eight deaths. All About California • Food and Drug Administration Summary:","response":"A California-based food processing plant has voluntarily issued a recall for up to 1 million pounds of roasted pistachio products due to potential salmonella contamination. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) made the announcement after salmonella strains were detected in routine tests by Kraft Foods, one of the companies that bought the nuts. The pistachios came from Setton Farms and were distributed to food wholesalers, who then used them in various products.

Burges inspired considerable loyalty within his team of assistants, and his partnerships were long-lived. John Starling Chapple was the office manager, joining Burges's practice in 1859. It was Chapple, designer of most of the furniture for Castell Coch, who completed its restoration after Burges's death. Second to Chapple was William Frame, who acted as clerk of works. Horatio Walter Lonsdale was Burges's chief artist, contributing extensive murals for both Castell Coch and Cardiff Castle. His main sculptor was Thomas Nicholls who started with Burges at Cork, completing hundreds of figures for Saint Fin Barre's Cathedral, worked with him on his two major churches in Yorkshire, and undertook all of the original carving for the Animal Wall at Cardiff.William Gualbert Saunders joined the Buckingham Street team in 1865 and worked with Burges on the development of the design and techniques of stained-glass manufacture, producing much of the best glass for Saint Fin Barre's. Ceccardo Egidio Fucigna was another long-time collaborator who sculpted the Madonna and Child above the drawbridge at Castell Coch, the figure of St John over the mantelpiece in Lord Bute's bedroom at Cardiff Castle and the bronze Madonna in the roof garden. Lastly, there was Axel Haig, a Swedish-born illustrator, who prepared many of the watercolour perspectives with which Burges entranced his clients.

Justification: The order of the events given in the question suggest a cycle of plant and soil life. The death of the plants is what initiates the following steps. When the plants die, they decompose and become part of the soil. This added organic material enriches the soil, making it more fertile. This fertile soil can then support the growth of larger plants, eventually leading to the growth of trees. Thus, the death of the plants is the first step in this process."},{"question":"Generate a question about the following movie plot: This section's plot summary may be too long or excessively detailed. Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (July 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The film's premise is that there is another way to heaven than adherence to the practices of the Roman Catholic Church. A secular Sin Eater can remove all taint of sin, no matter how foul, from the soul just before death. The purified soul can then ascend into heaven. The Roman Catholic Church, according to the film, considers this heresy. Heath Ledger plays an unhappy and disillusioned priest, Alex Bernier, a member of a fictitious religious order The Carolingians which specializes in fighting demons and other hell spawn. Father Dominic, the head of the Carolingians, has died in Rome under suspicious circumstances and Alex leaves the United States to investigate. In Rome, Alex visits the morgue and sees strange markings on Dominic's corpse. After some investigation, he comes across a book that explains the markings as being the sign of a Sin Eater's work. He heads to the Vatican, where an official tells him that Sin Eaters don't exist and that Dominic may not be buried on sacred ground because he had been excommunicated for his beliefs. Alex, moving ever farther from his vocation, defies his superiors and secretly reads a holy service over the body and buries Dominic in the Carolingian cemetery (the service takes place off screen but is referred to later). Thomas Garrett, another Carolingian (there seem to have only been a total of three including Dominic), arrives in Rome to help investigate Dominic's death. Early in the film we meet Mara Williams, an artist Alex once exorcised, who has escaped from a mental hospital and come to Alex at his church in the USA because she has a feeling that something terrible is going to happen to him. The police come looking for her, but Alex lies and denies that he's seen her and through this exchange we learn that Mara was in the hospital because she had tried...

During the 1690s he completed Hill of Tarvit (1696), Craighall (1697–99) in Fife, and Craigiehall (1699) near Edinburgh. The latter, built for the Marquess of Annandale, still stands, and is used as the British Army's Scottish headquarters. From 1698 he was working on a new house for the young Charles Hope, later first Earl of Hopetoun. Hopetoun House, near Edinburgh, was completed in 1702, and represents Bruce's grandest country house design. The master mason was again Thomas Bauchop, and the inspiration was again Anglo-Dutch, with French rustication. The bulk of Bruce's work is now obscured by 18th-century remodelling, carried out by William Adam. Bruce was commissioned again by Hopetoun in 1708, to build a private aisle at Abercorn Kirk. The Hopetoun Loft overlooks the interior of the kirk, and connects to a retiring room with an oval \\"squint\\" giving a view of the pulpit.In 1702 Bruce was commissioned by the burgesses of Stirling to design a new tolbooth for the town.

Stripped off: Cat Lee, 22, dressed in only her bra and pants in protest because the university covered up some of her more erotic artwork. But the student, 22, was so angry with the decision that she stripped to her bra and pants holding a board protesting about the decision. Tutors said they had a duty of. care to the public in case children viewed the material in the gallery. Miss Lee was given the opportunity to restrict entry to her section of the gallery to over 18s only but refused, the university said. The student, who is half way through her. fine arts degree course at the Sussex campus, describes herself as a. painter of erotic scenes. Artwork: In this painting by Cat Lee, called 'The Idea of Love' two people can be seen kissing. Artist: Cat Lee, 22, refused a request to restrict access to her artwork to over 18s. She said she was 'outraged' at not being able to display her work. 'It was embarrassing standing in front of 200 strangers in my smalls but I was outraged by the attitude of the University to my work,' she said. 'I wanted to make a statement that art is sometimes supposed to shock and confront people. It was my first show at the University but I was ordered to withdraw or cover my work with a sheet which was ridiculous. 'In the end I featured less provocative work of a woman's naked torso. But I was fuming.' A university spokesman said that some would find the erotic artwork inappropriate. 'The university has a duty care of to the public and this art work was deemed to be sexually graphic and abusive in nature,' he said. 'We had to consider that children could be attending the exhibition and that this work might be inappropriate. 'The student was given the option to display her work in a separate space with appropriate warnings, but she rejected this option. 'Another option was to restrict entry to the gallery to over 18s only, but other exhibiting students felt that this restricted their audience. However, the student did display a less explicit piece of work.' Miss Lee now plans a week long exhibition in July at the Mowlem Street art studios in East London where she has been promised her more explicit work will not be kept under wraps. 'I expect to keep my clothes on for that one. I was appalled at the University for claiming to be a centre for contemporary art and then banning most of my stuff,' she added.

We know that Jen has 8 cookies left after eating half of the remaining cookies on the second day. Let's assume that the number of cookies remaining after the first day is X. Since she ate half of them on the second day, we can write the equation: 1/2 * X = 8 Step 2: Solve for X. Multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to find the value of X. X = 8 * 2 X = 16 So, there were 16 cookies remaining after the first day. Step 3: Determine the total number of cookies in the bag. We know that Jen ate three-quarters of the bag on the first day, which means the remaining 16 cookies represent one-quarter of the total cookies in the bag.

It is not clear whether she is a grateful and devoted wife who has been falsely accused, or whether she is instead a calculating and ruthless femme fatale. Mrs. Paradine's solicitor Sir Simon Flaquer (Charles Coburn) hires Anthony Keane (Gregory Peck), a brilliant and successful barrister, to defend her in court. Although Keane has been happily married for 11 years, he instantly becomes deeply infatuated with this exotic, mysterious, and fascinating client. Keane's kind-hearted wife Gay (Ann Todd) sees his infatuation, and although her husband offers to get off the case, she presses him to continue. She knows that a guilty verdict, followed by Paradine's hanging, will mean that she will lose her husband emotionally forever. The only way that she can regain her husband's love and devotion is if he is able to obtain a \\"not guilty\\" verdict for Mrs. Paradine.

You know how you go peepee sometimes? The excretory system helps you do that! It takes out the waste from your body so you can stay healthy. Diffusion is when things spread out to make everything even. Imagine you have a cup of water and you pour some red juice into it. The juice will spread out and make the water look pink, right? That's diffusion! Now, in the excretory system, there's a tiny factory called the nephron. It's inside your kidneys, which are two little bean-shaped things in your tummy area. The nephron's job is to help make peepee by filtering your blood. So, diffusion happens inside that nephron factory. Good stuff from your blood, like water and sugar, goes back into your body. The bad stuff, like waste and extra water, gets filtered out to make peepee. This happens as things move from where there's more of them to where there's less—just like the red juice spreading out in the water.

Khan made sure to distance himself and his administration from Livingstone's contentious views, displaying his commitment to creating a positive and inclusive environment in the United Kingdom's capital. This article will analyze the context of the incident and the potential impact on London's civic environment. Step 1: Provide Context for the Incident At the end of last month, Ken Livingstone, who served as Mayor of London from 2000 to 2008, made controversial remarks during a radio interview. Livingstone claimed that Adolf Hitler \\"supported Zionism before he went mad and killed six million Jews.\\" This statement sparked widespread backlash, with many accusing him of anti-Semitism and historical inaccuracy. Step 2: Highlight Sadiq Khan's Response Sadiq Khan, who assumed the role of Mayor on May 7, 2016, promptly condemned Livingstone's comments. \\"Ken's comments were not only offensive and historically inaccurate, but they also risked undermining the unity we've worked so hard to build in our city,\\" Khan said in a statement. By distancing himself from his predecessor's remarks, Khan demonstrated a strong commitment to promoting tolerance and multiculturalism in London. Step 3: Discuss the Importance of Khan's Response Khan's decision to speak out so quickly against Livingstone's statement is of utmost significance, given the recent rise of hate crimes in London. It is essential for London's mayor to stand up against hate speech and promote a city where everyone feels welcome, regardless of their ethnic or religious background. Khan's condemnations also emphasize that anti-Semitism, or any forms of discrimination, will not be tolerated in London. Step 4: Analyze the Potential Impact on London's Civic Environment Sadiq Khan's swift response to Ken Livingstone's remarks may contribute positively to London’s civic environment. It sends a strong message that hateful and divisive speech has no place in the city's political discourse. Furthermore, Khan's clear denunciation of anti-Semitic statements promotes an atmosphere in which individuals from all backgrounds can come together and work towards a more unified and prosperous London.

Only with the success of Cowboy was Van Sant now given license to make Idaho (a film he had originally pitched but was knocked back several times as the script was deemed 'too risky' by studios). Now New Line Cinema had given Van Sant the green light, he was on a mission to get the Idaho script to his first choices for his two young leads. After months of struggle with agents and managers over the content of the script, Van Sant finally secured River Phoenix and Keanu Reeves in the roles of Mike Waters and Scott Favor. Centering around the dealings of two male hustlers (played by Phoenix and Reeves), the film was a compelling examination of unrequited love, alienation, and the concept of family (a concept Van Sant repeatedly explores in his films). The film won him an Independent Spirit Award for his screenplay (he had won the same award for his Drugstore Cowboy screenplay), as well as greater prestige. The film also gained River Phoenix best actor honors at the Venice Film Festival among others. In addition, it helped Reeves--previously best known for his work in the Bill and Ted movies--to get the critical respect that had previously eluded him. Van Sant's next film, a 1993 adaptation of Tom Robbins' Even Cowgirls Get the Blues, was an excessive flop, both commercially and critically. Featuring an unusually large budget (for Van Sant, at least) of 8.5 million and a large, eclectic cast including Uma Thurman, John Hurt, Keanu Reeves and a newcomer in the form of River Phoenix's younger sister Rain (at Phoenix's suggestion), the film was worked and then reworked, but the finished product nonetheless resulted in something approaching a significant disaster. Van Sant's 1995 film To Die For helped to restore his luster. An adaptation of Joyce Maynard's novel, the black comedy starred Nicole Kidman as a murderously ambitious weather girl; it also stars Matt Dillon as her hapless husband and, the third Phoenix sibling in as many projects, Joaquin Phoenix, as her equally hapless lover (River had died from a drug overdose a year and half earlier). It was Van Sant's first effort for a major studio (Columbia), and its success paved the way for further projects of the director's choosing. The same year, he served as executive producer for Larry Clark's Kids; it was a fitting assignment, due to both the film's subject matter and the fact that Clark's photographs of junkies had served as reference points for Van Sant's Drugstore Cowboy.

The U.S. Department of Justice two-year grant will begin Oct. 1, which is the start of domestic violence awareness month. U.S. Rep. John Tanner announced Monday that the grant was awarded to West Tennessee Legal Services of Jackson. The organization provides legal assistance and advocacy in 17 counties. \\"This award will offer assistance as we look for whatever ways possible to stop domestic violence and help the women, men and children who are victims of abuse,\\" Tanner said in a news statement.

He estimated the money will help handle at least another 180 cases next year. The group closes about 2,500 cases a year. The money was timed well because the legal group had recently lost about 120,000 in grant money due to a decrease in the poverty population in West Tennessee in Census 2000, Xanthopoulos said. \\"The drop in poverty is a good thing, but there is still a great need out there,\\" he said. \\"So this was a very good thing.\\" Having legal representation at divorce and child custody hearings is important in helping victims leave abusive and sometimes dangerous situations, said Margaret Cole, executive director of Wo/Men's Resource and Rape Assistance Program in Jackson.

His integration into the family was a relatively smooth transition, not just because of his fame and status as a rapper and designer but because of the genuine relationships he formed with various family members, further solidifying his place among them. Kanye's relationship with the Kardashians began well before he started dating Kim, and over time he has become particularly close with Kris Jenner. They share a mutual respect for one another – Kris appreciates Kanye's creativity, passion, and loyalty, while Kanye admires Kris' business acumen and strength as the matriarch of the family. In addition, Kanye's friendships with Kourtney and Khloé Kardashian have been well-documented over the years, with the trio often seen spending time together and supporting one another's projects. Once he and Kim began dating, Kanye's devotion to the family only seemed to grow stronger. He quickly developed a strong bond with Kim's younger brother Rob Kardashian, referring to him as his \\"little brother.\\" Kanye's close relationship with the Kardashian family is further highlighted in the multiple collaborations he's had with them over the years.

When Kanye and Kim got married in 2014, Kanye's integration into the Kardashian family became even more evident. With Kris Jenner walking Kim down the aisle, it was clear that Kanye was not just a son-in-law, but an important and loved member of the family. The couple's children – North, Saint, Chicago, and Psalm West – have only served to strengthen his bond with the family overall. Furthermore, Kanye has always held the Kardashian family in high regard, often speaking admiringly of his wife and her family in interviews. His appreciation and affection for the Kardashians are reciprocated by the family, who have also been very vocal about their love and support for Kanye. In conclusion, Kanye West's close involvement with the Kardashian family has been years in the making. By forming genuine relationships and connections with each of the family members and actively participating in their lives and endeavors, Kanye has ultimately achieved the status of being a true Kardashian. Additionally, the reciprocal love and admiration between Kanye and the Kardashians have only grown stronger over the years, standing as proof of the unwavering bond he shares with the famous reality television family."},{"question":"Two neighboring dairy farms produced milk for half the state. Berry farm produced conventional milk, while Rose farm produced organic milk. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which farm had milk production which reduced leaching of nitrates? Hint: Compared to conventional milk production, organic milk production tends to have lower eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland, because it potentially reduces leaching of nitrates (NO3−) and phosphates (PO4−) due to lower fertilizer application rates. Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms. Because of the increased use of roughage and the, on-average, lower milk production level per cow, some research has connected organic milk production with increases in the emission of methane.Animal welfare issues vary among dairy farms and are not necessarily related to the way of producing milk (organically or conventionally).

Would you think they were laughing at something funny that one of them said? Or -- be honest with yourself -- would you think they were laughing at you? Yes, you. Being laughed at is a common fear. But a major study published in two thousand and nine found that this fear is not the same around the world. It differs from culture to culture. People in Finland were the least likely to believe that people laughing in their presence were making fun of them. Less than ten percent of Finns in the study said they would think that, compared to eighty percent of people in Thailand. Some people in the study said they felt unsure of themselves in social situations but hid their feelings of insecurity. Others said they avoided social situations where they had been laughed at before. The study found that people in Turkmenistan and Cambodia were more likely to be in the first group. They would hide their feelings of insecurity if they were around other people's laughter. But people in Iraq, Egypt and Jordan were more likely to try to avoid such situations if they felt they had been laughed at before. Shy people often avoid situations that would force them into close contact with other people. They worry that something they say or do will make other people laugh at them.

Instead, its tone and sentiment can largely depend on the broader context in which it is used. Let's look at the different perspectives: 1. Neutral Perspective: On a basic level, stating that there are \\"many definitions of \`time waster'\\" is simply an observation and analysis of linguistic diversity. This is purely factual – in no way judging the concept of wasting time as either detrimental (negative) or beneficial (positive). 2. Negative Perspective: However, if this phrase is used in a context that highlights the negative repercussions of wasting time, then it could be considered as negative. For instance, if it is used in a speech about productivity or resource optimization, stating that there are many ways people waste their time might come across as negative. It implies that wasting time is problematic and can occur in numerous forms. 3. Positive Perspective: On the other hand, the phrase could be seen as positive if it is used in a context that promotes relaxation, leisure activities, or mental health. In today's fast-paced world, people often forget to rest or enjoy leisure activities, which may be seen as 'time wasting' in a traditional sense but are essential for overall well-being. In such case, the phrase can be viewed as highlighting the importance of pursuits or activities that don't necessarily contribute to traditional productivity but are valuable for personal enjoyment or mental health. In conclusion, the phrase itself does not carry an inherent positive or negative tone.

OPTIONS: -yes; -it is not possible to tell; -no;","response":"It is not possible to tell whether the hypothesis \\"A person is never stupid\\" is true or not based on the given premise \\"Just how stupid could one be?\\". The reason for this is that the premise itself suggests that one can be stupid to varying extents, but it does not provide enough information to evaluate the hypothesis. First, we need to define what we mean by \\"stupid\\" and understand the context in which we are discussing stupidity. Stupidity can refer to a lack of intelligence, poor decision-making, or an inability to understand or learn something. It can also refer to a temporary lapse in judgment or a simple mistake. In some cases, people can be labelled as \\"stupid\\" due to a single error or an occasional poor decision. In other situations, it might be due to specific circumstances or upbringing that limits an individual's knowledge or reasoning skills. This could indicate that some people might be considered stupid in some contexts, but not in others. Next, let's consider the possibility that everyone possesses some level of intelligence, and that this intelligence may not be captured accurately through traditional means of measurement, such as IQ tests. People may possess different types of intelligence (e.g., emotional intelligence, creative intelligence, or logical intelligence) which might not be fully appreciated or developed. If that's the case, it is possible to argue that nobody is inherently \\"stupid\\" as everyone possesses some level of intelligence. Instead, people have different skills, abilities, and knowledge, and it is an individual's particular combination of these attributes that makes them unique. One could also argue that what we perceive as \\"stupidity\\" is often a byproduct of a person's environment, upbringing, or lack of exposure to particular experiences and knowledge. In such a case, the claim \\"a person is never stupid\\" could be seen as an acknowledgement that people have the potential to learn, grow, and develop their intelligence in the right circumstances. However, it is also important to recognize that there are cognitive limitations and conditions that could affect an individual's ability to acquire and process information. Some people may face challenges in learning or grasping specific concepts due to factors such as intellectual disabilities, brain injuries, or neurodevelopmental disorders. Even so, it is not appropriate to label such individuals as \\"stupid.\\" Instead, recognizing these cognitive differences is crucial in understanding that each person's intellectual capacity may vary significantly. In conclusion, based on the given premise, it is not possible to confirm or disprove the hypothesis that \\"a person is never stupid.\\" However, it is essential to recognize the nuanced perspectives on intelligence and cognitive abilities, and to consider that each person has unique strengths and weaknesses. It is more appropriate to encourage learning and growth, rather than to label someone as \\"stupid,\\" as doing so overlooks the complexity and potential for development inherent in each individual."},{"question":"On a scale of 1-5 (with 1 being least favorable and 5 being most favorable), how would you rate this review? \\"It's awesome download it dont look back!

The band, centered on the songwriting partnership of Barat and Doherty, has also included John Hassall (bass) and Gary Powell (drums) for most of its recording career. The band was part of the garage rock revival and spearheaded the movement in the UK. The band gained some notoriety in the early 2000s. Doherty and Barat remained out of contact for several months after the Libertines had ended, due to Doherty's spiralling drug abuse. Members of the band reunited several times on stage through the years to play Libertines songs, but talks of a reunion remained tepid as Doherty and Barat concentrated on their respective bands Babyshambles and Dirty Pretty Things. A retrospective collection Time for Heroes - The Best of The Libertines was released in 2007. It wouldn't be until 2010, when it was announced on 29 March, that the Libertines were to reform for the Reading and Leeds Festivals in 2010. They were special guests to headliners Arcade Fire on Friday 27 August at Bramham Park, Leeds and Saturday 28 August at Little John's Farm, Reading. Following the announcement, the band held a press conference on 31 March 2010 to discuss their reformation at the Boogaloo pub.

The performance at the festival received very positive reviews from both fans and the press. After the gigs at the Reading and Leeds festival, it remained unclear as to what the Libertines would do next as both Carl Barat and Pete Doherty were embarking on solo tours. There were hints of more Libertines gigs in the future which both Barat and Doherty confirming they have received offers for gigs at some point in 2011.

Headquarters in New York, September 27, 2012. Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu draws a red line on a graphic of a bomb as he addresses the 67th United Nations General Assembly at the U.N. Headquarters in New York, September 27, 2012. UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu drew his \\"red line\\" for Iran's nuclear program on Thursday despite a U.S. refusal to set an ultimatum, saying Tehran will be on the brink of a nuclear weapon in less than a year. By citing a time frame in an address to the U.N. General Assembly, Netanyahu - who has clashed with President Barack Obama over the urgency of military action against Iran - appeared to suggest no Israeli attack was imminent before the November 6 U.S. presidential election. Holding up a cartoon-like drawing of a bomb with a fuse, Netanyahu literally drew a red line just below a label reading \\"final stage\\" to a bomb, in which Iran was 90 percent along the path of having sufficient weapons-grade material. Experts put that at the point that Iran has amassed enough uranium, purified to a level of 20 percent, that could quickly be enriched further and be used to produce an atomic bomb. Netanyahu told the United Nations he believes that faced with a clear red line, Iran will back down in a crisis that has sent jitters across the region and in financial markets. \\"And this will give more time for sanctions and diplomacy to convince Iran to dismantle its nuclear weapons program altogether,\\" he added. Netanyahu's remarks were the closest he or any top Israeli official has come to publicly laying out precisely which Iranian actions could trigger an Israeli military strike on Tehran's nuclear infrastructure. But by referring to a spring or summer 2013 time frame for Iran to complete the next stage of uranium enrichment, the Israeli leader also seemed to dispel, at least for now, fears that Israel might strike Iran before the U.S. presidential election, 40 days away. Netanyahu's remarks also seemed to deliver a two-part message to the Obama White House - along with Iran's leaders, his most important audience - signaling that the hawkish prime minister wanted an end to the all-too-public war of words with Washington over Iran's suspected nuclear ambitions. But they also showed that he was not backing down an inch on his insistence that much harsher warnings must be delivered to Tehran. \\"NEXT SPRING OR SUMMER\\" In his speech, Netanyahu never explicitly said that if Iran crossed his red line, Israel would launch attacks against the Iranian nuclear facilities, but he did seem to imply such a threat. \\"At this late hour, there is only one way to peacefully prevent Iran from getting atomic bombs. That's by placing a clear red line on Iran's nuclear program,\\" Netanyahu said. Iran, Netanyahu said, was well into what he defined as the second stage of enrichment - 20 percent purification - and predicted it would complete it by \\"next spring, at most by next summer, at current enrichment rates.\\" According to an August report by the U.N. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Iran has stockpiled 91.4 kg (201.5 pounds) of the 20 percent material. Some experts say Iran would need 200 to 250 kg (440 to 550 pounds) of such material for a weapon. Other experts suggest less might do it. Iran could potentially reach that threshold soon by producing roughly 15 kg (33 pounds) a month, a rate that could be speeded up if it activates new enrichment centrifuges. According to the U.N. nuclear watchdog, around 25 kg (55.1 pounds) of uranium enriched to a 90 percent purity level would be needed for a single nuclear weapon. In his own speech to the General Assembly on Tuesday, Obama said the United States will \\"do what we must\\" to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons and that time is not unlimited for diplomacy to resolve the issue. Obama set no ultimatum or clear \\"red line\\" of his own, despite public urging from Netanyahu over the past several weeks that has aggravated strains between the two leaders. \\"CHART A PATH FORWARD\\" Seeking re-election, Obama has faced criticism from Republican challenger Mitt Romney that the president is being too tough with Israel and not tough enough with Iran. \\"I very much appreciate the president's position, as does everyone in my country. We share the goal of stopping Iran's nuclear weapons program,\\" Netanyahu said. \\"Israel is in discussions with the United States over this issue, and I am confident we can chart a path forward together,\\" he said. He spoke a day after Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad addressed the General Assembly. Ahmadinejad said on Monday he did not take seriously the threat that Israel could launch a military strike on Iran's nuclear facilities. He also said Israel has no roots in the Middle East and would be \\"eliminated.\\" [ID:nL1E8KO5BL] Netanyahu was due to meet with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton later in the day. White House spokesman Jay Carney said he expected Obama to have a follow-up phone call with Netanyahu, probably on Friday. Obama has drawn criticism from Republicans for opting not to meet Netanyahu or other foreign leaders on the sidelines of the General Assembly and focus instead on campaigning for re-election. ISRAELIS WARY Netanyahu has faced opposition within his cabinet and from former Israeli security chiefs to any go-it-alone attack on Iran. Opinion polls show that Israelis are wary of any such strike by their military, whose capability of destroying underground Iranian facilities is limited. Israel, believed to have the Middle East's only atomic arsenal, sees a nuclear-armed Iran as a threat to its existence and has expressed frustration over the failure of diplomacy and sanctions to rein in Tehran's nuclear activity. Iran says it is enriching uranium only for peaceful energy and medical purposes, not for nuclear bombs. Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Washington-based Arms Control Association, said Iran's uranium enrichment program is improving. \\"By sometime next year, Iran could potentially amass enough 20 percent enriched material that could - if Iran decides to expel inspectors and convert the material to weapons grade - provide enough nuclear material for one bomb,\\" Kimball said. \\"But enough material for one bomb doesn't constitute an effective, deliverable nuclear arsenal.\\" (Additional reporting by Michelle Nichols, Arshad Mohammed and Louis Charbonneau; Editing by Will Dunham and Eric Walsh) ||||| This time last year Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas was a hero to his people as he waved an application for statehood recognition from the podium of the United Nations General Assembly. The gambit was met with a standing ovation and cheers by an audience of ambassadors and world leaders, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu remained seated and stone-faced. Abbas will deliver a different kind of speech tomorrow when he returns to the UN dais. “Last year cost them a lot,” said Hussein Ibish of the American Task Force on Palestine, a nonpartisan group based in Washington that advocates a peaceful two-state solution with Israel. In hindsight, he said, it was “not the wisest course of action.” “Presumably, after having endured a very predictable failure, they will have learned the diplomatic lesson,” he said in a telephone interview. While the 77-year-old Abbas had succeeded in grabbing attention for his cause, a year later that victory rings hollow. The Palestinians are no closer to achieving statehood -- either in terms of territory or UN recognition -- and the Israeli- Palestinian peace process is moribund, with any diplomatic urgency superseded by war in Syria and the possibility Israel may preemptively strike Iran’s nuclear facilities. ‘The End’ “The Palestinian people thought that the Abbas speech last year was the beginning, but I am afraid a year later it seems that it’s the end,” said Hani Al Masri, a Ramallah-based political analyst. This time, rather than pursuing a doomed path to recognition as a full “member state” that the U.S. would veto in the Security Council, Abbas has lowered expectations. He is seeking a limited upgrade from observer “entity” to “non- member state” in the 193-member General Assembly, where no nation holds veto power. That, too, is opposed by U.S. and Israel, which say any issue of statehood can be resolved only through negotiations. “A year later, Abbas is going to the GA with something he he could have done last year, ” Masri said in an interview. “He is applying for non-member state, but with no vote due to the pressures made by the U.S.” While becoming a non-member state may open the door for the Palestinian Authority to sign treaties such as the Rome Statute that set up the International Criminal Court, it would alienate the U.S., the UN’s biggest financial contributor and a key aid donor to the Palestinians. Aid Needs When the Palestinian Authority was accepted last year into the UN cultural agency Unesco, best known for its designation of “world heritage” sites, the U.S. response was to cut off funding that provides almost a quarter of the agency’s budget. The U.S. has said that American law would require similar cutoffs for any UN agency that grants the Palestinians the same status as member states. Irritating the U.S. may be risky given the need for U.S. aid, according to two Palestinian officials speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter. The Palestinians receive about 550 million a year in aid from Washington, according to the Congressional Research Service. Any new Palestinian Authority initiative at the UN will probably wait until after the U.S. elections in November, the diplomats said. “The PA cannot afford another fight with their donor,” Ibish said. After last year’s historic UN speech, throngs of Palestinians welcomed Abbas home to the West Bank city of Ramallah with waving flags, holding up posters of him. Riding the wave of popular enthusiasm at the time for the Arab uprisings, the Palestinian leader had promised something similar. ‘Palestinian Spring’ “We have told the world that there is the Arab Spring, but the Palestinian Spring is here,” he told a chanting crowd of supporters on Sept. 25, 2011. “A popular spring, a populist spring, a spring of peaceful struggle that will reach its goal.” That promise didn’t come to pass, and today the streets in West Bank cities are often crowded with protesters amid worsening economic conditions, including higher fuel prices and delayed payments for public employees. After average economic growth of 9 percent from 2008 to 2010, real growth in the West Bank declined to 5 percent in 2011 and the first quarter of 2012, as unemployment rose to 19 percent in the first half of this year from 16 percent a year earlier, according to the International Monetary Fund. The economic slowdown in the West Bank “poses a major challenge” to continued Palestinian Authority financial and institutional stability, according to an Israeli government report this month. Cash Crisis The global economic slump has aggravated a cash crisis as donors, including the U.S. and Arab nations, haven’t followed through on funding pledges. Outside aid finances the bulk of the Palestinian Authority’s 4 billion budget, half of which goes toward paying the salaries of about 150,000 workers. The total budget deficit is 1.5 billion. Even with 1.1 billion in donor support promised, that leaves a hole of almost 400 million, Palestinian finance minister Nabeel Kassis told donors at a Sept. 23 meeting in New York. The International Monetary Fund warned in a Sept. 23 report that the Palestinian economy is facing “serious risks” and urged the government to pursue a contingency plan to cover its “financing gap.” Reviving Diplomacy Though the campaign to become the 194th member of the world body was always a long shot, Abbas gambled it would at least revive diplomacy and perhaps even force Israeli concessions, such as reviving a freeze on construction in Jewish settlements in the West Bank. Instead, the likelihood of a two-state solution with Israel has further dimmed, and a win by Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney would make the prospect still more remote. The former Massachusetts governor told campaign donors that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is going to “remain an unsolved problem” and that the Palestinians are uninterested in peace. Romney made the comments at a closed fundraiser in May, and they became public when a video of the event was posted Sept 18 by Mother Jones magazine. Even so, it would be a mistake to write off Abbas, said Robert Danin, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington. The Palestinian leader has raised the stakes, and the option of taking the issue to the General Assembly can be a potent tool, he said in an interview. “The threat may be more powerful than the act,” he said. “But it does give Abbas enhanced leverage to push for active American engagement on the Palestinian front after the November elections.” -- With assistance from Fadwa Hodali in Ramallah and Alisa Odenheimer in Jerusalem.

FILE - In this Wednesday, Sept. 19, 2012 file photo, a visitor looks at portraits of Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during the exhibition \\"faces of... (Associated Press) The report surfaced after Israel's foreign minister predicted that Iran's leaders would face an Arab Spring-style popular revolt within the next year _ an argument that further counters Netanyahu's charge that an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities may be the only answer to what he calls a fanatic and intransigent Iranian leadership. Iran says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, but Israel, the United States and other Western countries reject that assertion. The U.N. has already slapped four rounds of economic sanctions on the Islamic Republic, but Netanyahu has repeatedly cast doubt on the effectiveness of those measures, arguing that they have crippled Iran's economy but have not convinced Tehran to halt its nuclear program. Netanyahu has instead placed emphasis on urging the U.S. to draw \\"red lines\\" which would make clear which conditions would provoke an American strike on Iran's nuclear facilities _ a demand that Washington has rejected. When Netanyahu addresses the U.N. General Assembly Thursday, he is expected to reiterate his contention that the sanctions are not working _ a claim that could be deflected by the findings in the new report, which came from the Israeli Foreign Ministry. According to the report, details of which appeared in the Haaretz newspaper, Iran's oil exports declined by over 50 percent in the past year _ from 2.4 million barrels a day to 1 million _ and oil revenues dropped by 40 billion since the beginning of the year. An Israeli official confirmed the report but refused to elaborate on it. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss internal government documents. The report also claims that sanctions on Iran's central bank have made it difficult for the regime to access its foreign currency reserves, causing a 100 percent gap between the country's official exchange rate and where the rial is trading on the black market. Bread, meat and electricity prices have also soared because of the sanctions, the report finds.

Yes or no? Answer: The first publicly available photograph was published in National Geographic magazine. Question: who was the first person to climb the mount of the holy cross Answer:","response":"The first person to successfully climb the Mount of the Holy Cross is William Henry Jackson, an American photographer and explorer. He achieved this feat in 1873, during an expedition led by the famous geologist and surveyor, Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden. The primary objective of the Hayden Survey (as it came to be known) was to map and explore the unknown territories of the Western United States, particularly focusing on the geology, geography, natural resources, and native cultures of the region. William Henry Jackson, born on April 4, 1843, in New York, was a skilled photographer and painter who accompanied the Hayden Survey to document the scenic wonders encountered during the exploration. When the team reached the Mount of the Holy Cross, located in the Sawatch Range of the Colorado Rockies, Jackson climbed to the summit and successfully captured the iconic image of the mountain with its unique cross-shaped snow pattern. The photograph was one of the first to showcase the then-unknown mountain to the wider public, and it gained significant popularity due to its unusual and striking features. Following the publication of William Henry Jackson's photograph in National Geographic magazine, the Mount of the Holy Cross garnered national attention and gradually gained fame as a symbol of American wilderness and sanctity. Over time, the mountain's popularity inspired other photographers, painters, and explorers to visit and document the stunning peak. In 1929, the United States Congress formally recognized the Mount of the Holy Cross and designated it as a national monument. In conclusion, William Henry Jackson is credited as the first person to climb the Mount of the Holy Cross in 1873 during the Hayden Survey. His pioneering actions enabled the public to learn about and appreciate the mountain's incredible beauty and historical significance."},{"question":"You are presented with the quiz \\"What enhances the effects of erosion?\\" But you don't know the answer, so you turn to your teacher to ask for hints.

Homeowner Sam Firth estimated it was between 16 and 18 inches long. Comes as pest controllers revealed the rise in number of mutant rats in UK. Rodents are twice as large as normal and are resistant to traditional poison.","response":"Title: Massive Mutant Rats Invade Fashionable Belsize Park, London Introduction: An alarming rise in the number of mutant rats in the UK has residents on high alert, particularly after a recent sighting of a giant rat outside a home in the highly fashionable Belsize Park, London. These enormous rodents, twice the size of their regular counterparts and resistant to traditional poison, have become a serious concern for homeowners and pest controllers alike. Giant Rat Sighting in Belsize Park: Homeowner Sam Firth was left stunned when he managed to photograph a giant rat prowling outside his house. He estimated the rodent to be between 16 and 18 inches long, a startling size that has raised concerns about safety and potential health hazards these creatures could pose. Belsize Park, known for its upscale properties and celebrity residents, is now the epicenter of this mutant rat invasion. The Rising Mutant Rat Population: Pest controllers in the UK have recently unveiled the alarming increase in the number of mutant rats across the country. These rodents have not only grown in size but have also developed resistance to traditional poison, making them a difficult problem to tackle. The rise in population has been attributed to factors such as abundant food sources, changing urban landscapes, and inadequate pest control measures. Double the Size, Double the Trouble: Measuring up to twice the size of regular rats, these mutant rodents have caused quite a stir. Their ability to withstand traditional poison has forced pest controllers to adopt new and innovative methods for extermination. Studies are underway to identify the best approach to curb the spread of these monstrous creatures while ensuring minimal harm to the environment. Health Hazards and Concerns: Mutant rats pose a significant threat to human health, as they are known to carry diseases such as leptospirosis and salmonella – both of which can have severe consequences for humans if contracted. As the rat population continues to grow, so does the risk of contamination and disease outbreaks. Community efforts are being encouraged to maintain cleanliness and proper waste disposal, in order to reduce opportunities for rats to thrive. Conclusion: The shocking sighting of a giant mutant rat in Belsize Park has brought the issue of the rising rat population in the UK to the forefront. Pest controllers, scientists, and homeowners must work together to find and implement effective solutions that will prevent these enormous rodents from wreaking havoc. As we carry out our daily lives, it is crucial for us to be vigilant and proactive in minimizing the risk of these creatures infiltrating our homes and spreading disease."},{"question":"If \\"Students in uniform pose for a picture during a football game.\\", does it logically follow that \\"The students pose for pictures at the baseball game.\\"?","response":"Hello little buddy!

It was the second time he had been offered the post. The first had been in 1963 after the death of the orchestra's conductor, Fritz Reiner, who made its reputation in the previous decade. Solti told the representatives of the orchestra that his commitments at Covent Garden made it impossible to give Chicago the eight months a year they sought. He suggested giving them three and a half months a year and inviting Carlo Maria Giulini to take charge for a similar length of time. The orchestra declined to proceed on these lines. When Solti accepted the orchestra's second invitation it was agreed that Giulini should be appointed to share the conducting. Both conductors signed three-year contracts with the orchestra, effective from 1969.One of the members of the Chicago Symphony described it to Solti as \\"the best provincial orchestra in the world.\\" Many players remained from its celebrated decade under Reiner, but morale was low, and the orchestra was 5m in debt. Solti concluded that it was essential to raise the orchestra's international profile. He ensured that it was engaged for many of his Decca sessions, and he and Giulini led it in a European tour in 1971, playing in ten countries. It was the first time in its 80-year history that the orchestra had played outside of North America. The orchestra received plaudits from European critics, and was welcomed home at the end of the tour with a ticker-tape parade.The orchestra's principal flute player, Donald Peck, commented that the relationship between a conductor and an orchestra is difficult to explain: \\"some conductors get along with some orchestras and not others.

Dr. Jan Żabiński is director of the Warsaw Zoo, one of the largest in 1930s Europe, assisted by his wife, Antonina. On September 1, 1939, the aerial bombardment of Warsaw and Invasion of Poland commences. Antonina and her son Ryszard (Timothy Radford and later, Val Maloku) barely survive. As Polish resistance collapses, Dr. Lutz Heck, head of the Berlin Zoo and Adolf Hitler's chief zoologist and Jan's professional rival, visits the zoo while Jan is away. He offers to house the prized animals until after the war, later returning with Nazi soldiers to shoot the rest. He develops a romantic interest in Antonina. The Jews of Warsaw are forced into the Ghetto. The Żabińskis' Jewish friends, Maurycy Fraenkel and his partner Magda Gross, seek a safe place for a friend's insect collection. Antonina offers to shelter Magda. Knowing they can be executed for helping Jews, Jan and Antonina decide to use the zoo to save more lives. They seek out Heck to propose turning the abandoned zoo into a pig farm to feed the German occupying forces, secretly hoping to bring food to the Ghetto. Heck, in need of a new site for his experiments in recreating Aurochs as a symbol of the Reich, agrees. Jan collects garbage from the Ghetto for the pigs and sees Jews starving. He begins working with the Underground Army to transport Jews to safehouses throughout the country. Jews are hidden in the zoo's cages, tunnels, and inside the Żabińskis' house.

Options: - (A) emissions - (B) They aid lung health. - (C) direct damage to the lungs - (D) They are a hazard. - (E) The affects are mildly healthy - (F) The fuel burns clean. - (G) Greenhouse gases - (H) Global warming Let's solve this problem gradually.","response":"Burning fuel has numerous adverse effects on human health. Here's a breakdown of the options provided: - (A) Emissions: Burning fuels, especially fossil fuels, release a variety of pollutants into the atmosphere. These emissions can include fine particles (PM2.5 and PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone (O3). Exposure to these pollutants can have significant short-term and long-term health effects on humans, such as respiratory illnesses, heart diseases, and even premature death. - (B) They aid lung health: This statement is incorrect. Emissions from burning fuels do not aid lung health; in fact, exposure to them can exacerbate existing respiratory issues or cause new respiratory problems, affecting lung health negatively. - (C) Direct damage to the lungs: Emissions from burning fuel can cause direct damage to lung tissues, leading to adverse respiratory health effects. The fine particles and toxic gases can penetrate deep into the lung tissue, potentially causing inflammation, irritation, and respiratory illnesses like asthma, bronchitis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). - (D) They are a hazard: Burning fuels are indeed a hazard to human health as they release toxic emissions, greenhouse gases, and contribute to global warming, making the environment less hospitable for humans, animals, and plants. - (E) The effects are mildly healthy: This statement is incorrect. The effects of burning fuels on human health are generally negative, with potential respiratory issues and other health complications related to exposure. - (F) The fuel burns clean: Whether fuel burns clean or not depends on the type of fuel being burned. For example, renewable and clean energy sources like wind, solar, and hydropower have significantly fewer adverse effects on human health and the environment compared to fossil fuels. However, the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas often results in emissions harmful to human health. - (G) Greenhouse gases: Burning fossil fuels emit greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). These gases contribute to climate change and global warming, which can have indirect but significant impacts on human health. Rising temperatures can lead to more extreme weather events, increased vector-borne diseases, and worsened air pollution. - (H) Global warming: As previously mentioned, the burning of fuels, particularly fossil fuels, leads to increased greenhouse gases and contributes to global warming. Global warming is linked to various negative health effects, including heat-related illnesses, disruptions in food and water resources, increased diseases transmitted through insects and rodents, and mental health issues related to climate change and natural disasters."},{"question":"Sentence 1: But let's do dinner and a show to-night at all events.\\" Sentence 2: We should go to dinner, a show, then go out to a bar.

Answer:","response":"The first step of the rusting process is the water combining with carbon dioxide in the air to form carbonic acid. This occurs when water, either in the form of liquid or moisture in the atmosphere, reacts with the carbon dioxide present in the air, resulting in the formation of a weak carbonic acid solution.

There was much public debate, before and after the abortive sale, as to whether Manchester Corporation ought to buy Trafford Park, but the corporation could not agree terms quickly enough, and so on 23 June Ernest Terah Hooley became the new owner of Trafford Park, for the sum of £360,000 (£40.9 million as of 2019).On 17 August, Hooley formed Trafford Park Estates Ltd, transferring his ownership of the park to the new company – of which he was the chairman and a significant shareholder – at a substantial profit. The initial plans for the estate included a racetrack, exclusive housing and a cycle works, along with the development of the ship canal frontage for \\"all types of trade including timber\\". By that time the ship canal had been open for two years, but the predicted traffic had yet to materialise. Hooley met with Marshall Stevens, the general manager of the Ship Canal Company, and both men recognised the benefit that the industrial development of Trafford Park could offer to the ship canal, and the ship canal to the estate. In January 1897 Stevens became the managing director of Trafford Park Estates. He remained with the company, latterly as its joint chairman and managing director, until 1930. The company initially chose not to construct buildings for letting, and instead leased land for development. But by the end of June 1897 less than one per cent of the park had been leased, and so the park's existing assets were put to use until more tenants could be found. Trafford Hall was opened as a hotel in 1899, to serve prospective industrialists considering a move to the park, along with their key employees. It had 40 bedrooms, available to \\"Gentlemen only\\".

In 1951, with secret means of communications established, Wolters sent his first letter to Speer in five years. He suggested that Speer move ahead with his memoirs. In January 1953, Speer began work on his draft memoirs, and over the next year lengthy missives, sometimes written on tobacco wrappings or candy wrappers but most often on toilet paper, made their way to Wolters' office in Coesfeld. Marion Riesser, who had continued as Wolters' secretary as he began private architectural practice, transcribed these notes into as many as forty closely typed pages per missive, and the draft totalled 1,100 pages. Wolters objected that Speer called Hitler a criminal in the draft, and Speer presciently observed that he would likely lose a good many friends were the memoirs ever to be published. Wolters had come to believe that reports of Nazi genocide were exaggerated by a factor of at least ten, that Hitler had not been given credit for the things he did right and that Germany had been harshly treated by the Allies.In the mid-1950s, Wolters quarrelled with Kempf who effectively dropped out of the network for a number of years, adding to the burden on Wolters and Riesser. While Speer's pleas for his former associate and his former secretary to work together eventually brought about a healing of the breach, this was to some degree superficial as Kempf was aware that Wolters, even then, disagreed with Speer's opinions. Wolters questioned Speer's readiness to accept responsibility for the Nazi regime's excesses and did not believe Speer had anything to apologise for, though the strength of his feelings on this point was kept from Speer—but not from Kempf and Riesser.Wolters was tireless in his efforts on behalf of Speer and his family to such an extent that his son, Fritz, later expressed feelings of neglect.

He also served as the 25th Vice President of the United States from March to September 1901 and as the 33rd Governor of New York from 1899 to 1900. As a leader of the Republican Party during this time, he became a driving force for the Progressive Era in the United States in the early 20th century. His face is depicted on Mount Rushmore, alongside those of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Abraham Lincoln. Theodore Roosevelt Jr. was born on October 27, 1858, at East 20th Street in New York City. He was the second of four children born to socialite Martha Stewart \\"Mittie\\" Bulloch and businessman and philanthropist Theodore Roosevelt Sr. He had an older sister, Anna (nicknamed \\"Bamie\\"), a younger brother, Elliott, and a younger sister, Corinne. Elliott was later the father of First Lady Anna Eleanor Roosevelt, the wife of Theodore's distant cousin, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. His paternal grandfather was of Dutch descent; his other ancestry included primarily Scottish and Scots-Irish, English and smaller amounts of German, Welsh, and French. Theodore Sr. was the fifth son of businessman Cornelius Van Schaack \\"C.V.S.\\" Roosevelt and Margaret Barnhill. Theodore's fourth cousin, James Roosevelt I, who was also a businessman, was the father of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Mittie was the younger daughter of Major James Stephens Bulloch and Martha P. \\"Patsy\\" Stewart. Through the Van Schaacks, Roosevelt was a descendant of the Schuyler family. Roosevelt's youth was largely shaped by his poor health and debilitating asthma. He repeatedly experienced sudden nighttime asthma attacks that caused the experience of being smothered to death, which terrified both Theodore and his parents. Doctors had no cure. Nevertheless, he was energetic and mischievously inquisitive. His lifelong interest in zoology began at age seven when he saw a dead seal at a local market; after obtaining the seal's head, Roosevelt and two cousins formed what they called the \\"Roosevelt Museum of Natural History\\". Having learned the rudiments of taxidermy, he filled his makeshift museum with animals that he killed or caught; he then studied the animals and prepared them for display. At age nine, he recorded his observation of insects in a paper entitled \\"The Natural History of Insects\\". Roosevelt's father significantly influenced him. His father was a prominent leader in New York's cultural affairs; he helped to found the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and had been especially active in mobilizing support for the Union during the Civil War, even though his in-laws included Confederate leaders. Roosevelt said, \\"My father, Theodore Roosevelt, was the best man I ever knew. He combined strength and courage with gentleness, tenderness, and great unselfishness. He would not tolerate in us children selfishness or cruelty, idleness, cowardice, or untruthfulness.\\" Family trips abroad, including tours of Europe in 1869 and 1870, and Egypt in 1872, shaped his cosmopolitan perspective. Hiking with his family in the Alps in 1869, Roosevelt found that he could keep pace with his father. He had discovered the significant benefits of physical exertion to minimize his asthma and bolster his spirits. Roosevelt began a heavy regime of exercise. After being manhandled by two older boys on a camping trip, he found a boxing coach to teach him to fight and strengthen his body.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Does he have kids?","response":"Yes, Theodore Roosevelt Jr. had kids."},{"question":"Premise: \\"A young adult is painting an advertisement on the side of a building.\\" Hypothesis: \\"A person is getting messy.\\" Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?

Ben was prescribed cholesterol medication, while Andy didn't go to the doctor because he was careless. Which friend took a drug that changed the levels of HMG-CoA reductase? Answer:","response":"Ben, one of the two old friends who were both found to have high levels of cholesterol, took a drug that changed the levels of HMG-CoA reductase. This is because Ben was prescribed cholesterol medication by a doctor to help manage his elevated cholesterol levels. HMG-CoA reductase, or 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, is a key enzyme involved in cholesterol synthesis in the liver. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) to mevalonate, which is a crucial step in the production of cholesterol. Therefore, drugs that target HMG-CoA reductase are designed to reduce cholesterol production and, consequently, lower the overall blood cholesterol levels. Cholesterol-lowering medications, known as statins, work by inhibiting the activity of HMG-CoA reductase. These drugs are particularly common in the management of high cholesterol. They help prevent the buildup of cholesterol in the arteries, reduce the risk of cardiovascular events such as heart attacks and strokes, and also offer other health benefits. Since Ben's doctor prescribed him cholesterol medication, it is highly likely that he took a statin drug to manage his high cholesterol levels. Statins, acting as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, change the levels of this enzyme, thereby decreasing the production of cholesterol in the liver. In contrast, Andy did not go to the doctor to address his high cholesterol levels due to his carelessness. In the absence of medical intervention, it is unlikely that Andy took any drugs to alter his HMG-CoA reductase levels, leaving his cholesterol levels unmanaged and posing a greater risk to his cardiovascular health in the long term. In conclusion, it is Ben, the friend who was prescribed cholesterol medication, who took a drug that changed the levels of HMG-CoA reductase. This pharmacological intervention would assist him in better managing his high cholesterol levels and reducing the associated risks, while Andy's negligence in seeking medical attention left his cholesterol levels unaddressed."},{"question":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Reasoning: Human emotions and thoughts are complex, and there is no foolproof method for accurately interpreting them solely based on external indicators, such as facial expressions and body language. While certain expressions and gestures may give clues as to what someone is feeling or thinking, it still remains subjective and open to interpretation. Moreover, individuals often suppress or mask their true emotions and might display body language that contradicts their actual thoughts. Additionally, cultural differences and personal idiosyncrasies can complicate the interpretation of facial expressions and body language.

It is in Central California, on the boundary between California's Inyo and Tulare counties, 84.6 miles (136.2 km) west-northwest of the lowest point in North America at Badwater Basin in Death Valley National Park at 282 ft (86 m) below sea level. The west slope of the mountain is in Sequoia National Park and the summit is the southern terminus of the John Muir Trail which runs 211.9 mi (341.0 km) from Happy Isles in Yosemite Valley. The east slope is in the Inyo National Forest in Inyo County. Question: is mount whitney the highest mountain in california?","response":"Yes, Mount Whitney is indeed the highest mountain in California. It stands at an impressive height of 14,505 feet (4,421 meters) above sea level, which also makes it the highest summit in the contiguous United States, which refers to the 48 adjoining U.S. states on the North American continent. This also means it is the highest peak in the Sierra Nevada mountain range. Mount Whitney sits in Central California, precisely on the boundary between California's Inyo and Tulare counties. Its geographic location is 84.6 miles (136.2 kilometers) west-northwest of the lowest point in North America, which is Badwater Basin in Death Valley National Park that sits at 282 feet (86 meters) below sea level. Not only is the height of Mount Whitney significant, but the surrounding areas and trails contribute to its fame. Particularly, the west slope of the mountain is contained within Sequoia National Park. The mountain's summit is geographically important as it stands as the southern terminus, essentially the end point, of the John Muir Trail. The trail covers 211.9 miles (341.0 kilometers), starting from Happy Isles in Yosemite Valley. On the other hand, the east slope of Mount Whitney is part of the Inyo National Forest, which is located in Inyo County. The geographical and ecological diversity surrounding Mount Whitney is one of the reasons it is a popular destination for hiking and mountain climbing. Indeed, this area is unique because it encompasses the highest and lowest points in the contiguous United States within such a short distance, illustrating a dramatic contrast in terrain elevation, flora, and fauna. It's also important to note the cultural significance Mount Whitney holds for the Native American tribes in the region, particularly the Owens Valley Paiute, who consider it a sacred place. So, in summary, yes Mount Whitney is the highest mountain in California, the contiguous United States, and the Sierra Nevada, with its dramatic heights, diverse surrounding terrain and ecosystems, and significant geographical and cultural importance."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Dan is a dance instructor.

Neglecting friction such as air resistance, all small bodies accelerate in a gravitational field at the same rate relative to the center of mass. This equality is true regardless of the masses or compositions of the bodies. - The kilogram or kilogramme (SI unit symbol: kg) is the base unit of mass in the International System of Units (SI) (the Metric system) and is defined as being equal to the mass of the \\"International Prototype of the Kilogram\\" (IPK, also known as \\"Le Grand K\\" or \\"Big K\\"). - An airplane or aeroplane (informally plane) is a powered, fixed-wing aircraft that is propelled forward by thrust from a jet engine or propeller. Airplanes come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and wing configurations. The broad spectrum of uses for airplanes includes recreation, transportation of goods and people, military, and research. Commercial aviation is a massive industry involving the flying of tens of thousands of passengers daily on airliners. Most airplanes are flown by a pilot on board the aircraft, but some are designed to be remotely or computer-controlled. - The International System of Units (; abbreviated as SI) is the modern form of the metric system, and is the most widely used system of measurement. It comprises a coherent system of units of measurement built on seven base units. The system also establishes a set of twenty prefixes to the unit names and unit symbols that may be used when specifying multiples and fractions of the units. - In physics, a force is any interaction that, when unopposed, will change the motion of an object. In other words, a force can cause an object with mass to change its velocity (which includes to begin moving from a state of rest), i.e., to accelerate. Force can also be described intuitively as a push or a pull. A force has both magnitude and direction, making it a vector quantity. It is measured in the SI unit of newtons and represented by the symbol F. - Miniature dachshunds have a typical weight of 8 to 11 pounds in the United States . They also are normally a height of 5 to 7 inches at the withers . They are nicknamed \`\` wiener dogs '' , \`\` hot dogs '' or \`\` sausage dogs '' . - In physics, mass is a property of a physical body. It is the measure of an object's resistance to acceleration (a change in its state of motion) when a net force is applied. It also determines the strength of its mutual gravitational attraction to other bodies. The basic SI unit of mass is the kilogram (kg). - Altitude or height (sometimes known as depth) is defined based on the context in which it is used (aviation, geometry, geographical survey, sport, and many more). As a general definition, altitude is a distance measurement, usually in the vertical or \\"up\\" direction, between a reference datum and a point or object. The reference datum also often varies according to the context. Although the term altitude is commonly used to mean the height above sea level of a location, in geography the term elevation is often preferred for this usage. - Height is the measure of vertical distance, either how \\"tall\\" something is, or how \\"high up\\" it is. For example \\"The height of the building is 50 m\\" or \\"The height of the airplane is 10,000 m\\". When used to describe how high something like an airplane or mountain peak is from sea level, height is more often called altitude. Height is measured along the vertical (y) axis between a specified point and another. - Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe. - Engineering is the application of mathematics and scientific, economic, social, and practical knowledge in order to invent, innovate, design, build, maintain, research, and improve structures, machines, tools, systems, components, materials, processes, solutions, and organizations. - The dachshund (or or ) is a short-legged, long-bodied, hound-type dog breed. - Gravity, or gravitation, is a natural phenomenon by which all things with mass are brought toward (or \\"gravitate\\" toward) one another, including planets, stars and galaxies. Since energy and mass are equivalent, all forms of energy, including light, also cause gravitation and are under the influence of it. On Earth, gravity gives weight to physical objects and causes the ocean tides. The gravitational attraction of the original gaseous matter present in the Universe caused it to begin coalescing, forming stars and the stars to group together into galaxies so gravity is responsible for many of the large scale structures in the Universe. Gravity has an infinite range, although its effects become increasingly weaker on farther objects. - Mean sea level (MSL) (abbreviated simply sea level) is an average level of the surface of one or more of Earth's oceans from which heights such as elevations may be measured. MSL is a type of vertical datuma standardised geodetic reference pointthat is used, for example, as a chart datum in cartography and marine navigation, or, in aviation, as the standard sea level at which atmospheric pressure is measured in order to calibrate altitude and, consequently, aircraft flight levels. A common and relatively straightforward mean sea-level standard is the midpoint between a mean low and mean high tide at a particular location. - The Moon is an astronomical body that orbits planet Earth, being Earth's only permanent natural satellite. It is the fifth-largest natural satellite in the Solar System, and the largest among planetary satellites relative to the size of the planet that it orbits (its primary). Following Jupiter's satellite Io, the Moon is second-densest satellite among those whose densities are known. - In science and engineering, the weight of an object is usually taken to be the force on the object due to gravity. Weight is a vector whose magnitude (a scalar quantity), often denoted by an italic letter \\"W\\", is the product of the mass \\"m\\" of the object and the magnitude of the local gravitational acceleration \\"g\\"; thus: . The unit of measurement for weight is that of force, which in the International System of Units (SI) is the newton. For example, an object with a mass of one kilogram has a weight of about 9.8 newtons on the surface of the Earth, and about one-sixth as much on the Moon. In this sense of weight, a body can be weightless only if it is far away (in principle infinitely far away) from any other mass. Although weight and mass are scientifically distinct quantities, the terms are often confused with each other in everyday use (i.e. comparing and converting force weight in pounds to mass in kilograms and vice versa).

It has been praised for potentially improving the quality and taste of the meat produced. Such practices often include feeding the animals with specific diets, providing them with comfortable living situations, and even exposing them to unique experiences that could positively impact their stress levels and overall well-being. One such extraordinary approach is being applied in North Wales, where turkeys are raised on a generous diet of classical music and home-grown grain mix – a combination that may have earned them the title of \\"most pampered\\" turkeys in the region. The Musical Influence on Turkey Rearing The idea of including music as a part of the turkeys' environment can be traced back to various studies about the impact of music on animals' well-being. Research has shown that music has the potential to calm animals, reduce their stress levels, and even lead to positive physiological responses. In this case, the chosen genre is classical music, well-known for its soothing and stress-relieving properties. The decision to introduce classical music to the turkeys in North Wales is based on the belief that keeping these birds calm and relaxed will not only lead to happier and healthier animals but also have a positive effect on the quality of the meat produced. Numerous studies and anecdotes from farmers suggest that stress can impact the taste and tenderness of the meat. By providing the turkeys with a calming environment through the incorporation of classical music, the farmers aim to make a positive impact on the quality of their produce. Home-Grown Grain Mix Diet In addition to the melodious sounds of classical music, the unique aspect of these pampered turkeys' lives is their diet. The farmers in North Wales have considered the importance of providing a wholesome, nutritious, and balanced diet for their birds, which is why they chose to feed them with a home-grown grain mix. Producing their grain mix allows farmers to have complete control over the quality and nutritional content of the feed provided to their turkeys. The grains used in the mix are grown in the local region, ensuring the food's freshness and suitability to the needs of the birds. This focus on a high-quality diet can positively impact the turkeys' health and growth, as well as facilitate the production of delicious and tender meat. The Resulting Produce By combining the calming effects of classical music with a home-grown grain mix diet, the farmers in North Wales have created an optimal environment for their turkeys. This unique approach to raising these birds has seen great success, as the resulting meat is said to be of superior quality when compared to conventionally raised turkeys. The impact of classical music and a home-grown grain mix on the quality of the turkeys is evident in the taste, tenderness, and overall experience that consumers have when selecting and enjoying this premium produce. As a result, the demand for these pampered turkeys has increased, and the farmers are recognized for their innovative and caring approach to animal husbandry. Conclusion The practice of raising turkeys while exposing them to classical music and a nutritious diet of home-grown grains emphasizes the importance of creating a nurturing environment for animals in the process of meat production. The success of this approach, as evidenced by the improved quality of the resulting produce, has not only set a higher standard for other farmers in the industry but also attracted more discerning consumers looking for better-tasting and ethically raised meat. Ultimately, the turkeys raised on classical music and a home-grown grain mix in North Wales are redefining what it means to be pampered in the world of poultry."},{"question":"His biography of Anthony the Great entitled Life of Antony(Βίος καὶ Πολιτεία Πατρὸς Ἀντωνίου, Vita Antonii) became his most widely-read work. Translated into several languages, it played an important role in the spreading of the ascetic ideal in Eastern and Western Christianity. Depicting Anthony as an illiterate and holy man who through his existence in a primordial landscape has an absolute connection to the divine truth, the biography also resembles the life of his biographer Athanasius. It later served as an inspiration to Christian monastics in both the East and the West.

It's hard to look away. Overall, this film is nothing more than an incredibly irresponsible social experiment--and a futile, biased experiment at that. The filmmakers are manipulative and seem to have no problems going for the lowest possible denominator. The manner in which the money is presented to Ted is pure exploitation. The intervening steps that the filmmakers force Ted to participate in (meeting with so-called experts) were empty and devoid of any substantive attempt to connect with Ted. Instead, it's painfully obvious that they serve to cover the filmmaker's posteriors and to further exploit Ted's situation. The worst part is that the filmmakers stop following Ted after 6 months; and seemingly are cut off entirely from the subject they had followed so closely months before. If they had cared, they would have found better \\"experts\\" to help Ted. If they truly wanted to see what Ted would do, then they should have let him spend the money without any intervention. This film is at best a high-brow Jackass stunt and not a documentary. It's sad to think how much 100,000 could have actually changed a homeless person's life had it been put in the right hands.

After hearing this news, he convinced his wife, Charlotte, to get checked out. After running several tests, the doctors determined Charlotte has no cancer, but she does have high blood pressure. Relieved at this news, Jason was now focused on battling his cancer and fighting as hard as he could to survive. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Who has more abnormal cells in their body? Hint: Cancer is a disease that causes cells to divide out of control. Normally, the body has systems that prevent cells from dividing out of control. But in the case of cancer, these systems fail. Cancer is usually caused by mutations. Mutations are random errors in genes. Mutations that lead to cancer usually happen to genes that control the cell cycle. Because of the mutations, abnormal cells divide uncontrollably. This often leads to the development of a tumor. A tumor is a mass of abnormal tissue. As a tumor grows, it may harm normal tissues around it. Anything that can cause cancer is called a carcinogen . Carcinogens may be pathogens, chemicals, or radiation. Answer:","response":"Jason has more abnormal cells in his body."},{"question":"Summarize: Judges did not agree with power plant operators that the shutdown, ordered after the 2011 Fukushima disaster, was an \\"expropriation\\" of their assets.

Imagine you have two bags filled with colorful marbles. One bag is filled with green marbles representing the Irish ancestral group and the other bag is filled with red marbles representing the Italian ancestral group. The more marbles in a bag, the larger that ancestral group is! Let's find out which bag has more marbles and thus which ancestral group is larger: Irish or Italian? First, let's start by learning about these ancestral groups. Irish people come from a beautiful country in the shape of a tiny island called Ireland, which is located just above a bigger island named the United Kingdom. The green color on the Irish flag represents the Irish people and their ancestors. On the other side of the sea, there is a beautiful boot-shaped country called Italy. This is where Italian people come from. They are represented by the red color on their Italian flag. Now, we can count the marbles – or rather, the people – in each ancestral group. Today, there are millions of people around the world who have Irish or Italian ancestry! When we look at the numbers, we find out there are more red marbles, or Italian descendants, than there are green marbles, or Irish descendants. There are approximately 60 million people living in Italy itself, while Ireland has about 6.5 million people. Plus, there are many more Italian descendants in other parts of the world. So, the winner of this great ancestral battle is the Italian ancestral group! The bag filled with red marbles is much bigger and has many more marbles than the bag filled with green Irish marbles. Keep in mind, being from a bigger or a smaller ancestral group doesn't make one group better than the other. It's important to respect, love, and learn from all different backgrounds because each ancestral group has its own unique history and beautiful culture. And that's the story of the great ancestral battle between Irish and Italian ancestral groups! Remember to keep exploring and learning about all the different types of marbles – or ancestral groups – around the world."},{"question":"Text: Originally, the toll was 0.60 in each direction. Several years later, this was changed to a 1.00 toll collected for traffic going westbound to Coronado only. Although the bridge was supposed to become \`\`toll-free'' once the original bridge bond was paid (which occurred in 1986), the tolls continued for sixteen additional years. On June 27, 2002, it became the last toll bridge in Southern California to discontinue tolls, despite objections from some residents that traffic to the island would increase. The islands upon which the toll booths sat, as well as the canopy over the toll plaza area, are still intact, located at the western end of the bridge in the westbound lanes. Though tolls are no longer collected, beginning February 19, 2009 there was talk of resuming westbound toll collection to fund major traffic solutions and a tunnel.

It’s important that you clean out their habitat on a regular basis. If your quail live in a hutch with a wire floor, you can easily collect and clean up the droppings by placing newspapers or shallow containers (like litter trays) underneath the hutch. If you wish, you can use the collected droppings for fertilizer. If you keep your quail in a deep litter habitat, you may only need to clean the litter once every couple of weeks. How much your quail will need depends on how many quail you have, how mature they are, and what breed they are. Adult Japanese quail, for example, eat approximately 14-18 g (.5-.63 oz) of feed per day. Buy food designed specially for the age and life stage of your quail. Their nutritional needs change as they grow and mature. If you are unable to get feed specifically formulated for quail, you can give your quail turkey or game bird feed supplemented with calcium. Add a little shell grit or ground limestone to their feed to provide a calcium boost. Store the food you plan to feed the quail in a dry, cool, well-sealed container. Do not give your quail food that is more than 8 weeks old. Clean water troughs and containers daily to prevent illness. Wash water containers with hot water and a mild detergent, and rinse thoroughly before refilling with fresh water. If you have chicks, fill the water troughs with clean pebbles or marbles to prevent drowning. Regularly examine the quail habitat for damage. Look for rotting wood or holes in the wire or net that could allow predators in (or quail out). Rats often try to get into quail enclosures, so be sure to maintain a secure pen. You may want to do an overall count of your quail daily, weekly or monthly. This is so you know that they’re all there and that the quail are living healthy lives in the habitat. Quail are easily startled, and excessive stress or handling can kill them. Don’t pick up or handle your quail any more than necessary, and enter their habitat only as much as you need to. Keep their enclosure as quiet and natural as possible. Monitor how other pets or wildlife affect your quail, as too much interest from these animals can stress out your quail.","response":"Quail droppings require regular cleaning due to high ammonia levels. Use newspapers or containers underneath wire-floored hutches for easy collection and possible fertilizer use. Deep litter habitats need cleaning every few weeks. Quail diet depends on their number, age, and breed, with specific feeds for each life stage. Calcium supplements like shell grit or limestone can be added. Store food in a sealed container and replace every 8 weeks. Clean water containers daily with hot water and detergent and use pebbles/marbles for chicks safety. Inspect the habitat for damage, maintain security against predators, and do regular quail counts.

Choices: - forrest - ground - compost pile - cactus - floral arrangement The rationale to choose \\"floral arrangement\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","response":"Floral arrangement Step 1: Analyze the given choices In order to choose the most appropriate answer, I will analyze each choice individually: - Forrest: It's a large area covered with trees, but the question asks where a leaf is pulled off from, not the location. - Ground: Leaves can fall on the ground but aren't typically pulled off from the ground itself. - Compost pile: Compost piles consist of decomposing organic matter, including leaves, but again, leaves aren't pulled off directly from it. - Cactus: Few species of cactus may have leaves, but in general, it's not a common source of foliage, and most cacti have spines or scales instead of leaves. - Floral arrangement: This choice involves an arrangement of flowers and greenery, including leaves. People may pull off leaves from floral arrangements to adjust or reshape the design. Step 2: Evaluate the relevance to the question Comparing the analyzed choices and their relevance to the question, the most likely source a leaf would be pulled off of is \\"floral arrangement.\\" Step 3: Justify the choice The rationale to choose \\"floral arrangement\\" as the answer is that it directly involves handling flowers, plants, and their leaves, making it a plausible context where someone would pull a leaf off. The other choices lack the direct relevance to the action of pulling a leaf off."},{"question":"Stimmt der Kommisar mir zu, daß die großen Probleme im Hinblick die Transparenz der Überweisungsgebühren erst dann gelöst werden können, wenn der Euro in allen Mitgliedstaaten eingeführt ist? Translate to English English:","response":"Does the Commissioner agree with me that the major issues regarding the transparency of transfer fees can only be resolved once the euro has been introduced in all Member States? The Commissioner would likely agree that introducing the euro in all Member States could significantly improve the transparency of transfer fees. The introduction of a single currency has a range of benefits, such as facilitating cross-border transactions, reducing currency risk, and promoting economic stability within the European Union (EU). The following points offer a detailed reasoning as to why the introduction of the euro would help resolve the transparency issue around transfer fees. 1. Simplification of transactions: If all Member States adopt the euro as their official currency, conducting transactions within the EU would become much simpler. There would be no need for currency conversions, which often carry substantial fees and opaque pricing structures. The use of a single currency would make cross-border payments easier, while also providing more visibility into the associated fees. 2. Increased competition: The introduction of a single currency would likely encourage competition among financial institutions, thus driving greater transparency in transfer fees. With fewer barriers to trade, there would be greater opportunities for banks and other service providers to expand their services to other Member States. Increased competition would put pressure on institutions to offer more competitive pricing and fee structures, leading to more transparent charges. 3. Harmonized regulations: In order to maintain the stability of the euro and ensure a functioning single market, the EU would need to implement harmonized regulations across all Member States concerning transfer fees and other financial charges. These regulations would help provide clear guidelines to service providers, ensuring that fees are transparent and easy to understand. 4. Performance benchmarks: With a single currency, it would become easier for consumers and regulators to compare performance across institutions, markets, and Member States. These comparisons would help highlight disparities and best practices, encouraging better transparency and driving improvements in the overall market. 5. Public awareness and advocacy: Pervasive use of the euro could also lead to increased public awareness and advocacy about transfer fees and related issues. Such awareness could drive demand for clearer pricing structures, resulting in broader industry shifts that promote increased transparency. In conclusion, the adoption of a single currency, such as the euro, would go a long way in addressing issues of transparency in the context of transfer fees across different Member States. By simplifying transactions, increasing competition, harmonizing regulations, and fostering comparisons, the euro would likely make the overall market more transparent and benefit end-users in the process. However, it is essential to recognize that the introduction of the euro is only one factor influencing transparency; complementary measures addressing regulatory and market dynamics would also be needed to fully resolve such issues."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: There is a place where Christmas lives all year long. It is called Bronner's Christmas Wonderland in Frankenmuth, Michigan. The family-owned business calls itself the world's largest Christmas store. The late Wally Bronner started the business in 1945. Wayne Bronner, Wally's son, is president and CEO of what is now a multi-million dollar corporation. He learned the business from an early age. Some of his best memories are traveling to other countries with his father to find new products for the store. Bronner's sells more than 50,000 holiday products from 70 nations. Half of the products cost less than ten dollars. Wayne Bronner says the demand for small objects to hang on Christmas trees has expanded over the years. People spend more time, effort and money into decorating their homes with these ornaments, lights and religious scenes. Bronner's is famous for its nativity scenes which show the birth of Jesus Christ. Michigan has the nation's highest unemployment rate. Bronner's has been affected by the recession, too. But not in reduced sales. Wayne Bronner said: \\"Even though people are spending less, we're having more people visit here. And as a result we've actually had a sales increase.\\" Bronner's success is also linked to community cooperation and investment. Frankenmuth is a town of 5,000 people in eastern Michigan's farm country. The town was settled by Bavarian Germans in the 1800s. It has kept its traditions alive in buildings and restaurants. Bavarian cultural themes and Bronner's huge store bring 3,000,000 visitors a year. The town is the most popular place for tourists in the state. Bronner's business is aimed at a single day of the year. But that is not too different from other businesses. \\"About half of our business is done in the last quarter of the year, in the last three months. And actually when you compare that with most retailers, that follows the same pattern.\\" Wayne Bronner says the family's long-term planning and willingness to reinvest profits has developed the company into what it is... Question: We can learn from the passage that _ . Options: A: most of Bronner's products are expensive B: Wally Bronner, founder of Bronner's, has passed away C: people are spending less money on small objects D: Frankenmuth is a modern town popular with tourists A:","response":"B: Wally Bronner, founder of Bronner's, has passed away"},{"question":"Use the following highlights to write an article: Money spent on reinforced beds, wider corridors and larger morgue fridges. Hospitals spent an estimated £5.5million over the past three years. Around a quarter of adults in the UK are classed as obese. Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King’s Lynn spent £30,000 on a storage fridge for the dead bodies of obese patients. Article:","response":"Title: Helping Big Friends in Hospitals Once upon a time, in a big, big country called the UK, there lived many people who were like you and me, but some of our friends had a lot more weight. They were called \\"obese\\" and they needed special care in hospitals. Hospitals are places where doctors and nurses work to make people feel better. Now, hospitals had to spend more money to make their places ready for our big friends. They spent about £5.5 million over three years to have stronger beds, bigger hallways, and larger fridges for the morgue. A morgue is a place where dead bodies are kept until they are taken for a funeral. You see, one in every four grown-ups in the UK is obese, and hospitals needed to make sure they could help them. Even the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King's Lynn spent £30,000 on a large fridge just for the dead bodies of our obese friends. So, all the hospitals worked hard to make everything right for all their patients, no matter their size. They wanted everyone to be safe and comfortable, and they knew taking care of our friends' health was very important. And they all lived happily ever after, knowing that they were doing the best they could to help everyone."},{"question":"I read this background article the other day: Plucking, also referred to as quarrying, is a glacial phenomenon that is responsible for the erosion and transportation of individual pieces of bedrock, especially large \\"joint blocks\\". This occurs in a type of glacier called a \\"valley glacier\\". As a glacier moves down a valley, friction causes the basal ice of the glacier to melt and infiltrate joints (cracks) in the bedrock. The freezing and thawing action of the ice enlarges, widens, or causes further cracks in the bedrock as it changes volume across the ice/water phase transition (a form of hydraulic wedging), gradually loosening the rock between the joints. This produces large pieces of rock called joint blocks. Eventually these joint blocks come loose and become trapped in the glacier. I am facing a new situation today: Rob likes to visit high mountainous locations. Last year he visited the the Alps mountains in Austria. There he saw an unique type of glacier called valley glacier. This year he went further east to visit the Ural mountains in Russia. There he didn't see any valley glacier. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: In which year Rob would not observe quarrying effect, this year or last year?","response":"Based on the information provided, Rob would not observe the quarrying effect in the Ural mountains this year, as he did not see any valley glaciers there.

Pick up on “yes,” “no,” “thank you,” and similar key terms. Practice other common conversational phrases. Identify a few key food terms by name. Learn several helpful food phrases. Add some useful descriptive terms. Identify names for family members. Name some common animals in Tagalog. Count from 1-10 in Tagalog. Article:","response":"Learning a new language can be a daunting yet enriching experience, as it opens the doors for cultural exploration, travel, and personal development. For this journey, the destination may be Tagalog: the national language of the Philippines! Tagalog is not only widely spoken in the Philippines, but also by many Filipino communities around the world. The ensuing article will provide some guidance on how to take your first steps towards becoming a proficient Tagalog speaker. The most basic items in our conversational toolkit are, of course, common greetings. In Tagalog, 'good morning' translates to \\"Magandang Umaga\\", 'good afternoon' to \\"Magandang Hapon\\", and 'good evening' becomes \\"Magandang Gabi\\". Say hello with an enthusiastic \\"Kamusta?\\" or \\"Hello?\\" If asked, \\"Kamusta ka?\\", meaning 'how are you', the proper response would be \\"Mabuti naman, salamat\\", effectively meaning 'I'm good, thank you.' Speaking of 'Thank you', gratitude is expressed as \\"Salamat\\", while 'You’re welcome' is \\"Walang anuman\\". Other key terms include affirmations and negations. For the former \\"Oo\\" means 'Yes', and for the latter \\"Hindi\\" means 'No'. Simple, yet essential words such as these often form the backbone of any language-learning journey. As you continue to develop your Tagalog conversational skills, it's important to practice other common phrases. For example, asking \\"Ano ang pangalan mo?\\" is 'What is your name?', and answering \\"Ang pangalan ko ay...\\" is 'My name is...'. Don't forget an important phrase to ask for help: \\"Tulungan mo ako\\", translates to 'Help me'. Understanding the names for various food items will come in handy for any Tagalog speaker, especially while traveling in the Philippines or dining at a Filipino restaurant. \\"Kanin\\" refers to 'rice', a staple within Filipino cuisine. Meanwhile, \\"Manok\\" is 'chicken', \\"Baboy\\" is 'pork', \\"Isda\\" is 'fish', and \\"Gulay\\" is 'vegetables'. Other helpful food phrases include \\"Gutom ako\\" (I am hungry), \\"Busog ako\\" (I am full), or \\"Masarap\\" (It’s delicious). Adding descriptive terms to your vocabulary is another useful strategy. Get acquainted with \\"Maganda\\" (beautiful), \\"Malaki\\" (big), \\"Maliit\\" (small), \\"Mabait\\" (kind), \\"Masama\\" (bad) amongst others. Each word will enable you to express various sentiments, observations, or descriptions more effectively. Another step in this linguistic endeavour is naming family members. \\"Ina\\" indicates 'mother', \\"Ama\\" is 'father', \\"Kapatid\\" is 'sibling', \\"Anak\\" is 'child', and \\"Lolo\\" and \\"Lola\\" indicate 'grandfather' and 'grandmother' respectively. Whether you’re at a local zoo or simply fond of animals, learning how to identify some common animals in Tagalog is also essential. \\"Aso\\" is a dog, \\"Pusa\\" is a cat, \\"Ibon\\" is a bird, \\"Baka\\" is a cow, \\"Kabayo\\" is a horse and \\"Isda\\" is a fish. Lastly, to wrap up our first foray into Tagalog, learning to count from 1-10 is vital. The numbers are: one (isa), two (dalawa), three (tatlo), four (apat), five (lima), six (anim), seven (pito), eight (walo), nine (siyam), and ten (sampu). Mastering the basics of Tagalog, as with any language, is a journey that requires time, patience, and practice. Begin with common phrases, then slowly expand to include food items, descriptors, names of family members, animals, and even numbers. Before long, you'll find yourself navigating the new language with an impressive degree of confidence and fluency. Enjoy this enlightening process of language learning and embrace the culture that comes along with it!"},{"question":"Answer the following question: Process: - Air enters the lungs through bronchial tubes - Air enters bronchioles - Bronchioles have tiny air sacs called alveoli - Alveoli surrounded by small blood vessels - Oxygen absorbed by small blood vessels - Vessels deliver oxygen to every cell in the body - Blood brings carbon dioxide back to lungs - Carbon dioxide released when you exhale. Question: suppose resting or sleeping happens, how will it affect less oxygen absorbed by small blood vessels. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","response":"When a person is resting or sleeping, their oxygen demand is generally lower than when they are active. This is because the body's metabolic processes slow down during rest, reducing the overall need for oxygen. As a result, the absorption of oxygen by the small blood vessels in the alveoli may be less compared to when a person is active. Regarding the second effect mentioned, which is the delivery of oxygen to every cell in the body, there will be a lessened effect but still sufficient to meet the body's requirement at rest. Since the body's demand for oxygen is lower during resting or sleeping, the reduction in oxygen absorption does not have a negative impact on the oxygen delivery to cells. Blood circulation continues to function efficiently, ensuring that oxygen is delivered to every cell in the body as needed, but at a decreased rate compared to when a person is active. In summary, during resting or sleeping, there is less oxygen absorbed by small blood vessels but the oxygen delivery to the body cells is still sufficient to meet their demands, and thus has a lessened effect on the second process mentioned."},{"question":"Instructions: A text is given in Malayalam.

According to this view, rational discussion about metaphysical ideas, about moral values and even about purposes is possible. Popper's student W.W. Bartley III tried to radicalise this idea and made the controversial claim that not only can criticism go beyond empirical knowledge, but that everything can be rationally criticised. What type of knowledge is not the only sphere of rational criticism, according to Popper's student W.W. Bartley III?","response":"According to W.W. Bartley III, a student of the philosopher Karl Popper, the sphere of rational criticism is not solely confined to empirical or scientific knowledge. Bartley III expanded upon Popper's idea that rationality is not restricted to empirical theories and proposed that all knowledge, thoughts, or ideas can be exposed to rational examination and critique, regardless of their nature. Popper believed that the method of criticism is to seek and eliminate contradictions in knowledge, considering it a general method that applies to various spheres, such as empirical or scientific theories, metaphysical ideas, moral values, and even purposes. His view implied that rational discussion and debate about these diverse subjects are possible, since all knowledge can be criticized to address inconsistencies, strengthen arguments, and refine ideas. Bartley III, taking this idea further, made the controversial claim that rational criticism can be applied to everything, not merely empirical knowledge. He argued that all forms of knowledge can and should be evaluated through a critical lens, involving scrutiny, evaluation, and the elimination of inconsistencies. This encompasses not only scientific theories and empirical knowledge but also extends to other areas like ethics, metaphysics, aesthetics, religion, politics, and personal beliefs. In essence, W.W. Bartley III's stance on rational criticism asserts that no form of knowledge is exempt from critical assessment and examination, encouraging an open and resilient approach to understanding and refining ideas across all disciplines and subjects. This broader perspective promotes continuous scrutiny and learning, ultimately fostering the development of more coherent, robust, and reliable knowledge."},{"question":"My old roommate’s cats, Clise and Monkey, were about as different as cats could be. Clise, rescued as an emaciated kitten from a local park, grew up to be morbidly obese. His interests mainly involved eating food, begging for food, or going around the neighborhood scrounging for food. He could hear a can opener from a mile away. Monkey was a more active cat. He liked to chase the laser pointer and was the first to run to the door when someone arrived. But he could also be lazy, lounging in a sunbeam or stretched out on the couch. Both of them liked to watch TV. Soon after I moved in, I started having health issues which necessitated a lot of time lounging around myself. This was the era of reality TV, back when much of it was actually good. The cats, Monkey especially, watched with me. Monkey definitely had his preferences. His favorite shows were The Girls Next Door and Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders: Making The Team. Notice a theme here? Playboy Playmates and professional cheerleaders. Monkey liked his T & A (tits and ass). If one of these shows was on, and I turned it to Project Runway or something, Monkey would march off. But as soon as I turned it back, and he could hear the high-pitched giggling, he’d come running back. Clise’s favorite shows were Top Chef, Iron Chef, and Rachael Ray. Food porn. If there was something he especially craved, like a shrimp stir-fry, he’d assume a begging pose, right in front of the TV, as if Rachael might take pity on him and throw him a scrap or two. I moved out about a year later. A few months previous, Monkey ended up catching some wasting disease and dying, but Clise, as far as I know, is still there, begging for scraps from anyone he can — in real life or televised.

Of course I will discourage anyone else from seeking their services for their hair. I have been to 20 volume probably 4 or 5 times and so I would say I am a fairly new costumer. As a natural redhead, I am rather particular about who I allow do my hair. Up until a few weeks ago, I only allowed Stacey, the manager and \\"master stylist\\" to cut my hair. But I recently decided I had wanted a change and that so we discussed dying my hair using either a balayage technique or all over color. I showed her some ideal pictures and so we decided on the balayage. The idea is similar to an ombre but a little less drastic and more natural looking. After spending nearly 3.5 hrs in the salon after having worked an entire night shift and 160.00 later, I was less than impressed. The blonde color was VERY subtle and consisted of about 3 inches on my ends whereas it should have comprised a greater portion of my hair. My initial reaction was that it was \\"just ok, whatever, I guess I like it.\\" Part of that reaction was because I spent the entire night working a 12 hour shift and I just wanted to get out of the salon. Also, my hair was of course curled so it was hard to actually see what was going on until I straightened it. The next day I spent trying to like my overpriced dye job that appeared dried out. The product seemed heavily applied in some areas and clearly not applied enough in other areas creating an amateur look. It's not at all what I would expect from someone who is considered a \\"master stylist.\\" To be honest, Stacy's personal style should have told me I should have opted for someone else. It's should always be a tell-tale sign, if your stylist's hair looks a hot mess, yours probably will too. What really frustrates me more than anything is not the overpriced product I was sold, but the poor customer service that resulted thereafter. I called expressing dissatisfaction with my hair a couple days later. I would have done it sooner but I worked 3 12 hr shifts immediately following my hair experience and clearly they aren't open the hours that I am awake. When I called 4 days after my botch job, Stacy had the day off and the next week off for that matter. I explained to Lindsey, the receptionist, that I was unhappy and wanted an allover color to be applied to achieve my natural color or something close to. I clarified several times that I wouldn't be charged again for services rendered and she reassured me that I wouldn't. I also asked for her name in case if there were any issues. A followup appointment was made for a week out since Stacey had time off and I patiently waited. When I arrived at my appointment, I explained to Stacey that I just didn't like my hair. I explained that the ends looked simply washed out and that I would just like an all over color to get rid of them. I chose a red that was brighter than my natural, but red fades, and I can't imagine one all over color costing more than another if the technique is the same. Stacy told me that she would have to charge me 75.00 to fix my hair as it was an entirely different style. I explained to her that I discussed this already with Lindsey who stated that I would absolutely not be charged and that she stated this on more than 1 occasion. She told me that Lindsey must not have understood as she documented that I wanted to come in for a couple more highlights. I told Stacy that it was obvious that Lindsey didn't understand and that I couldn't have been more explicit or clear what I wanted. Needless to say she wouldn't budge and suggested doing an all over color at my next visit in 6-8 weeks. I was rather appalled that as a business owner, she felt this was the answer to fixing what she messed up. I told her I would not be returning and that she can cancel my future appointment. Since I have a friend who is a stylist, I will be going to her in the future. Even she looked at my hair and stated she couldn't believe the horrible styling job I was sold. She stated \\"I thought something looked a little different but I thought it was just where your ends had faded.\\" NOT WORTH 160.00!","response":"This review has a negative sentiment.

The man in red leotard carried the barbel all the way up his head the crowd cheered. the athlete Answer:","response":"(D). raised the barbel again and fell down. Explanation: The given passage presents a competition between two athletes, one in a blue leotard and the other in a red leotard. The athlete in the blue leotard fails to complete the task, while the athlete in the red leotard successfully raises the barbel, prompting the crowd to cheer. Since the athlete failed to complete the challenge, it would be most natural for them to attempt the task again. Therefore, option (D) is the most likely to follow. Options (A), (B), and (C) are incorrect for the following reasons: (A) is not a natural continuation of the story, because it merely rephrases the initial failure of the man in the blue leotard. (B) introduces a scenario which is out of context—an athlete hugging the crowd would generally not result in winning a competition. (C) contradicts the passage, because it states that the red-leotard athlete dropped the barbel, when in the passage it says they successfully carried it all the way up their head."},{"question":"(1) The district Viñac is one of thirty-three districts of the province of Yauyos in the Peruvian region Lima . (2) District Viñac is one of thirty-three districts of the region Lima in Yauyos province in Peru . Do these two sentences mean the same thing?","response":"Before I answer, let me break down both sentences and analyze their structure. Sentence 1: - The district Viñac - is one of thirty-three districts - of the province of Yauyos - in the Peruvian region Lima. Sentence 2: - District Viñac - is one of thirty-three districts - of the region Lima - in Yauyos province - in Peru. Step 1: Identify the main subject in both sentences. In both sentences, the main subject is \\"district Viñac.\\" Step 2: Identify the main information being presented. In both sentences, the main information is that Viñac is one of thirty-three districts. Step 3: Identify the location descriptors. In Sentence 1, the descriptors are \\"the province of Yauyos\\" and \\"the Peruvian region Lima.\\" In Sentence 2, the descriptors are \\"the region Lima,\\" \\"Yauyos province,\\" and \\"in Peru.\\" Step 4: Compare the location descriptors.

And the answer is...","response":"Okay little buddy, let's solve this problem together. So, we have this equation: -2929*i - 230770 = 2779*i - 1283*i + 485*i First, we need to find out how many 'i's are on both sides of the equation. On the left side, we have -2929*i, and on the right side, we have 2779*i - 1283*i + 485*i. Now, let's add and subtract the i's on the right side: 2779*i - 1283*i + 485*i = (2779 - 1283 + 485)*i = 1981*i So, our equation now looks like this: -2929*i - 230770 = 1981*i Next, let's move all the 'i's to one side of the equation. To do that, we will add 2929*i to both sides: -230770 = 1981*i + 2929*i Now, let's add 1981*i and 2929*i together: -230770 = (1981 + 2929)*i = 4910*i Now we need to find the value of 'i'. To do this, we will divide both sides by 4910: i = -230770 / 4910 And when we do the division, we get the value of 'i': i = -47 So, the answer to our problem is i = -47.

Tucked into the woods along a country road in rural Virginia, the church holds about 50 worshippers. On this cold November Sunday, Abduraheem and his family of eight noticeably increase the congregation's size. They do their best to follow the unfamiliar English of the old Baptist hymns, which are very familiar to their new neighbors. And they share the hymns from their former home — Sudan. Standing in a single line in front of the altar, the family fills the church with Arabic song. \\"Unbelievable,\\" Abduraheem says repeatedly, as he describes his journey from a crowded prison cell in Sudan to a fixed-up house on the farm of his new pastor. \\"Unbelievable\\" seems like the only word that could describe the turn his life took, thanks to a Facebook post and a U.S. congressman. Abduraheem's work as a former pastor is not outlawed in his native Sudan, but Christians are a minority in a diverse country that has suffered through multiple civil wars. According to the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, there has been \\"an escalation in the Sudanese government's persecution of Christians,” since the 2011 secession of South Sudan. Abduraheem says his work was spreading the gospel; the Sudanese government accused him of espionage, and he was detained along with two other pastors in December 2015. \\"The first day when they took us to the prison, they beat us,” he says softly. Abduraheem was shifted from prison to prison. For five months, he wore the same clothes he was wearing when he was arrested. His eyes became damaged from the harsh prison light. Yet, despite constant interrogations, just two meals of beans a day and a tiny cell with barely enough room to sleep, he says the worst part of prison was not knowing. How long would the Sudanese war likely last? - weeks - not enough information - years - months Answer:","response":"The information you provided is focused on Hassan Abduraheem's personal experiences in Sudan and his eventual journey to the United States. This doesn't provide direct information about the duration of the Sudanese war or conflict.

We have two expressions with candies: -121316 candies * c + 316 candies = -121000 candies * c To find out how many candies 'c' is, let's work together step by step. Step 1: Add 121000 candies * c to both sides: -121316 candies * c + 316 candies + 121000 candies * c = 0 Step 2: Now, combine the candies * c on the left side: (-121316 candies + 121000 candies) * c + 316 candies = 0 Step 3: Calculate how many candies we have left: -316 candies * c + 316 candies = 0 Now, we want to get 'c' all by itself. Step 4: Subtract 316 candies from both sides: -316 candies * c = -316 candies Step 5: We need to find out how many candies 'c' is, so divide both sides by -316 candies: c = -316 candies / -316 candies Finally, we can see that c equals to one candy: c = 1 So, the answer is: c = 1"},{"question":"Q: You are given a sentence in Italian.

Article: A deal has been signed to turn by-products from a Scottish distillery into fuel for cars. In what is declared to be a world first, the Tullibardine distillery in Perthshire has linked up with a spin-out company from Napier University in Edinburgh. They plan to use bacteria to feed on the \\"leftovers\\" from the whisky making process. This will produce butanol which can be used to fuel vehicles. More than 90% of the stuff that comes out of a whisky distillery is not whisky. It is leftovers like draff and pot ales -- both produced in the early stages of the process. They are high in sugar and are currently used for things like fertiliser and cattle feed. Napier University's Biofuel Research Centre (BfRC) has already shown that the right bacteria can feed on those by-products to produce butanol--a direct replacement for vehicle fuel. Now the spin-out company, Celtic Renewables, and independent whisky producer Tullibardine have signed an agreement. Together they will apply the process to thousands of tons of the distillery's leftovers. Professor Martin Tangney, founder of Celtic Renewables, said \\"Our partnership with Tullibardine is an important step in the development of a business which combines two important Scottish industries -- whisky and renewables. This project shows that creative use of existing technologies can _ resources on our doorstep to benefit both the environment and the economy.\\" Douglas Ross, managing director of Tullibardine, which spends PS250,000 disposing of its by-products every year, said \\"We are delighted to be partnering Celtic Renewables in this creative business, the obvious benefits of which are environmental. It takes a cost to us and turns it into something that has social as well as commercial value.\\" The project is being supported by a grant from the Scottish government's Zero Waste Scotland initiative. Celtic Renewables said it eventually aimed to build a processing plant in Scotland, with the hope of building an industry that could be worth PS60m a year.

In other works, landscape backgrounds for figures can still form an important part of the work. Sky is almost always included in the view, and weather is often an element of the composition. Detailed landscapes as a distinct subject are not found in all artistic traditions, and develop when there is already a sophisticated tradition of representing other subjects. - Weather is the state of the atmosphere, to the degree that it is hot or cold, wet or dry, calm or stormy, clear or cloudy. Most weather phenomena occur in the troposphere, just below the stratosphere. Weather refers to day-to-day temperature and precipitation activity, whereas climate is the term for the statistics of atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time.

Looking resplendent in their Sunday Best the Obamas laughed and joked with each other as they made their way back to the White House after the service at St John's Church. Mr Obama also told reporters he would 'absolutely' be watching the women's soccer world cup final between USA and Japan today. While the First family gathered around the television White House and congressional aides were continuing discussions to find a solution for increasing the nation's borrowing authority while reducing long-term deficits, behind the scenes. This. comes after the failure to get a deal after five straight days of. meetings last week between Mr Obama and congressional leaders at the. White House. But there was hope today that congressional leaders still had time 'to get something big done' with Mr Obama. 'I. think that what is encouraging is that the leaders in Congress seem to. have all agreed that we can't push to a default,' White House budget. director Jack Lew said. Sunday best: The Obamas head home after attending a service at St John's Church in Washington, while Congress leaders worked behind the scenes to try and seal a debt deal. 'So I think that there are many conversations going on in order to make sure that doesn't happen.' The. government will exceed the current 14.3trillion debt ceiling in 16. days, after which it will be in default of its obligations. The. consequences could be far-reaching, with potentially higher interest. rates on mortgages and car loans, a halt in Social Security checks and. unsettled world financial markets. Talks have continued over the weekend and White House spokesman Dan Pfeiffer. said on Twitter that Mr Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and other White. House officials were discussing 'various options' with lawmakers. throughout the day yesterday. Meanwhile Republican House Speaker John Boehner is 'keeping the lines of. communication open,' his spokesman, Mike Steel told Bloomberg. 'Meetings have been. occurring.' Republicans have rejected any plan that contains tax increases. Lew said on NBC's Meet The Press that the president 'made clear he wants the largest deal possible.' Back to the White House: The President shakes hands with Reverend Luis Leon before he, First Lady Michelle and daughters Malia and Sasha head home. Not much to smile about: Mr Obama shares a joke with his wife who looks less than impressed, as the family walk out of the church gates. Stroll: Mrs Obama is seen with daughter Malia, left, while the President walks with the couple's other daughter Sasha after the service. 'He wants to do the most we can to. reduce the deficit,' Lew said. 'But he also said that if we can't get. the most done, then in addition to extending the debt we should do as. much as we can.' House Republicans are preparing to. vote this week on allowing an increase in the government's borrowing. limit through 2012 as long as Congress approves a balanced-budget. constitutional amendment. Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., called that. proof Republicans are willing to compromise and 'hardly a radical idea' but the Senate's No 2 Democrat, Dick Durbin of Illinois, said that bill. doesn't have the needed support in the Senate. 'This notion that we have to change the Constitution to do what we were elected to do is just plain wrong,' Durbin said. Lew also did not like the idea. In the background: The Obamas head back to the White House where talks between congressional leaders were thought to be ongoing throughout the weekend. 'What these ideas do is say let's. kick the can down the road so that others will deal with it,' he said. 'The challenge is for Washington now to do the job the American people. sent us here to do.' DeMint said the U.S. is on course for. a financial disaster and that lawmakers have 'to draw a line in the. sand now because a day of reckoning is going to come.' 'And the longer we put it off the bigger the problems are going to be for our country,' DeMint said. Holding the fort: Meanwhile White House Budget Director Jack Lew revealed there were 'many conversations' going on as the battle to secure a deal before August 2 carried on. However, if it comes down to it,. White House officials who say Congress won't let the U.S. default are. 'probably right on that,' DeMint said. Senators are working on a bipartisan. plan that would allow Mr Obama to raise the debt limit without a prior. vote by lawmakers. The talks focused on how to address long-term deficit. reduction in the proposal in hopes of satisfying House Republicans. 'Lines of communication remain open with all parties,' said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner. Mr Obama admitted that. compromise was needed in talks with Republicans to solve the. crisis, during his weekly radio and internet address yesterday. He said it would take 'shared sacrifice' for. Democrats and Republicans to come to an agreement. 'Let's be honest. Neither party in this town is blameless,' he said in. his broadcast to the nation. 'Both have talked this problem to death without. doing enough about it. That's what drives people nuts about Washington.' He attempted to reach out to the middle class in the address, repeating his. call for higher taxes on the wealthy and reforms to politically popular. entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare. 'We are all. part of the same country. We are all in this together,' he said. But Republicans renewed their call for an amendment to require a balanced budget. 'The only reason this administration doesn't want a constitutional. amendment is because they want to keep spending the American people's. money,' Senator Orrin Hatch said in the Republican response. 'And the only. reason congressional Democrats would refuse to pass it, is because they. know the people of this country would rise up and quickly ratify it.' In his weekly broadcast Mr Obama continued to insist that it was necessary to remove some tax breaks. 'Simply. put, it will take a balanced approach, shared sacrifice, and a. willingness to make unpopular choices on all our parts,' he said. 'That. means spending less on domestic programmes,' the President said. 'It. means spending less on defence programmes. ... And it means taking on. the tax code, and cutting out certain tax breaks and deductions for the. wealthiest Americans.' 'The truth is, you can't solve our deficit without cutting spending,' Mr Obama said. 'But. you also can't solve it without asking the wealthiest Americans to pay. their fair share - or without taking on loopholes that give special. interests and big corporations tax breaks that middle-class Americans. don't get.' Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","response":"This article from 2011 talks about a time when the United States government was trying to figure out what to do about the money it owes, called the \\"debt ceiling.\\" The debt ceiling is a limit on how much money the government can borrow. Back then, the government was close to reaching that limit, and they needed to find a solution before August 2 to avoid not being able to pay the money they owed. President Barack Obama and other politicians were working together to try and find a solution. They had many meetings, but it was tough because each group had different ideas about what to do. While they were working on this important problem, President Obama and his family went to church one Sunday morning. They appeared happy and relaxed, even though there was a lot of work to do. The president also mentioned that he would be watching a women's soccer game later that day. In the meantime, people who work in the White House and other important leaders kept talking and trying to find a solution to the debt ceiling problem. There were different ideas, but they all agreed that they needed to find a way to fix it so that the government didn't get into more trouble. The article explained that if the government didn't find a solution, it could cause problems like higher costs for people borrowing money for things like houses and cars, as well as possibly stopping important payments like Social Security checks."},{"question":"Here is a review left by a customer on a product.

To do this, we will add 3029*t to both sides of the equation. -2884*t + 1885 + 3029*t = -3029*t + 3029*t (-2884 + 3029)*t + 1885 = 0 Step 2: Combine the variable terms Now, we will combine the terms with the variable t. (145)*t + 1885 = 0 Step 3: Isolate the variable t To isolate t, we need to remove the constant term 1885 from the equation. We will do this by subtracting 1885 from both sides of the equation. 145*t + 1885 - 1885 = 0 - 1885 145*t = -1885 Step 4: Solve for t Finally, to solve for t, we need to divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of t, which is 145. 145*t / 145 = -1885 / 145 t = -13 So, the solution for the given equation is t = -13."},{"question":"Nu trebuie să fim intimidați de impozitul pe profit și mai ales nu avem nevoie de prelegeri din partea unor persoane ca dl Sarkozy, care se simte foarte confortabil cu o rată de 8,2 % în Franța, în timp ce rata noastră este, de fapt, de 11,9 %.

Through a broader lens, the film Teza focuses on the ways in which political upheaval and social change have impacted cultures and nations across the larger African Diaspora.Told mainly through a series of flashbacks, Teza follows the personal narrative of Anberber, who, after leaving Ethiopia for Germany to become a doctor, is led to return to his home village by lingering spirits and haunting visions from his childhood. Using the power of memory as its primary device, Teza recounts the historical circumstances that have framed the context in which contemporary Ethiopia exists.The movie chronicles Anberber's internal struggle to stay true--both to himself and to his homeland--but above all, the film explores the possession of memory, a right that humanity mandates that each of us have--the right to own our pasts.

(CNN) -- A Florida judge's ruling Wednesday will allow a foreign-born high school basketball player who was ruled ineligible and his team to compete in the playoffs, even though they could ultimately be stripped of any title they win. Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Spencer Eig temporarily barred the Florida High School Athletic Association from disqualifying Brian Delancy, who was born in the Bahamas, and Dr. Michael M. Krop Senior High School from the district playoffs, which begin Thursday. Delancy \\"is very happy and relieved and he feels happy for his teammates,\\" said attorney David Baron, who helped represent the athlete, 19, and two other players. The board of the athletic association, which said Krop did not file proper paperwork on Delancy's eligibility and immigration status, on Tuesday ruled he was ineligible and that the top-ranked team must forfeit the 19 games it won when the senior guard played. Eig did not rule on Delancy's eligibility, but granted a temporary injunction to allow Krop to play until a full slate of hearings and appeals can take place within the athletic association, Roger Dearing, the association's executive director, said it was too late to appeal Eig's ruling and Krop will compete. But, he said, the ruling is not the end of the matter. Dearing said the association will hear new appeals after the tournament, likely in April.

John Wayne Gacy was an American serial killer. John Wayne Gacy, born in 1942, was a notorious American serial killer and sex offender who went by the name of \\"Pogo the Clown\\" or the \\"Killer Clown,\\" due to his occupation as a children's party clown. 2. Gacy's criminal activities and murder spree. Gacy's criminal activities began in the 1960s with sexual assaults on teenage boys. His killing spree started in the early 1970s and continued until his arrest in 1978. 3. Number of victims and modus operandi. Gacy killed at least 33 young men and boys, making him one of the most prolific serial killers in American history. He usually lured his victims to his home under the pretext of job offers or other false pretenses. Afterward, he sexually assaulted, tortured, and then strangled or suffocated them with a makeshift tourniquet. He buried most of the victims' bodies in a crawl space under his house, while a few others were dumped in nearby rivers. 4. Arrest, trial, and execution. Gacy was arrested in December 1978 after the police started investigating the disappearance of a teenager named Robert Piest, who was last seen with Gacy. The search of Gacy's house led to the discovery of multiple bodies buried in the crawl space. He was convicted of 33 murders in 1980 and subsequently sentenced to death. Gacy was executed by lethal injection on May 10, 1994. Given the evidence and historical context, the statement \\"John Wayne Gacy killed several people\\" is indeed true, as he was responsible for the murder of at least 33 individuals between the early 1970s and 1978."},{"question":"Q:Given the following context: The opening soprano solo in E major, \\"I know that my Redeemer liveth\\" is one of the few numbers in the oratorio that has remained unrevised from its original form. Its simple unison violin accompaniment and its consoling rhythms apparently brought tears to Burney's eyes. It is followed by a quiet chorus that leads to the bass's declamation in D major: \\"Behold, I tell you a mystery\\", then the long aria \\"The trumpet shall sound\\", marked pomposo ma non-allegro (\\"dignified but not fast\\"). Handel originally wrote this in da capo form, but shortened it to dal segno, probably before the first performance. The extended, characteristic trumpet tune that precedes and accompanies the voice is the only significant instrumental solo in the entire oratorio. Handel's awkward, repeated stressing of the fourth syllable of \\"incorruptible\\" may have been the source of the 18th-century poet William Shenstone's comment that he \\"could observe some parts in Messiah wherein Handel's judgements failed him; where the music was not equal, or was even opposite, to what the words required\\". After a brief solo recitative, the alto is joined by the tenor for the only duet in Handel's final version of the music, \\"O death, where is thy sting?\\" The melody is adapted from Handel's 1722 cantata Se tu non-lasci amore, and is in Luckett's view the most successful of the Italian borrowings. The duet runs straight into the chorus \\"But thanks be to God\\".The reflective soprano solo \\"If God be for us\\" (originally written for alto) quotes Luther's chorale Aus tiefer Not. It ushers in the D major choral finale: \\"Worthy is the Lamb\\", leading to the apocalyptic \\"Amen\\" in which, says Hogwood, \\"the entry of the trumpets marks the final storming of heaven\\". Handel's first biographer, John Mainwaring, wrote in 1760 that this conclusion revealed the composer \\"rising still higher\\" than in \\"that vast effort of genius, the Hallelujah chorus\\". Young writes that the \\"Amen\\" should, in the manner of Palestrina, \\"be delivered as though through the aisles and... answer the following question: What did Handel orignally write in da capo but shorten to dal segno? A:","response":"Handel originally wrote the aria \\"The trumpet shall sound\\" in da capo form, but he shortened it to dal segno, probably before the first performance.

Though they basically play pop/alternative rock, their music has touched a number of other styles throughout their 30-year career, such as new wave, punk rock, grunge, MPB and electronic music. They are one of the most successful rock bands in Brazil, having sold more than 6,3 million albums as of 2005 and having been covered by several well-known Brazilian artists and a couple of international singers. They were awarded a Latin Grammy in 2009 and have won the Imprensa Trophy for Best Band a record four times. On February 12, 2010, Titas announced in their official website that drummer Charles Gavin would leave the band for personal reasons. Gavin later stated that he was physically and mentally exhausted because of the tours and album releases. The quartet continued their performances of the Sacos Plasticos tour with drummer Mario Fabre, who is still with the band as of 2018, though not as an official member. Fabre was suggested by Gavin himself. When asked about the status of Fabre in the band, Bellotto explained that \\"he is the official drummer! He's the drummer of Titas! But he isn't one of Titas, because our history began long ago, at Greek mythology... \\" During an interview, keyboardist Sergio Britto said the band was planning to start recording a new album in 2011. Nothing else was said since then, until March 2013, when they revealed they were starting to work on a new album, to be released in the second half of 2013. The album would be self-produced, and, according to Britto, it would be \\"a mixture between Cabeca Dinossauro and O Blesq Blom.

Search for local hiking groups. Your brain needs rest. Try wearing a sleep mask and/or listening to white noise to create a peaceful environment. Avoid things like caffeine, alcohol, and drugs. While these substances may temporarily reduce anxiety, they end up making it worse in the long-term. A key component of being “laid-back” is to refuse to let life’s little annoyances rattle your composure. When you’re getting irritated or angry, pause to think about what’s causing your anger. Psychologists speak of the power of reframing events, of activating the reasoning brain to bring balance to the emotional brain. If you’re running late for an important appointment, reframe the situation from one of distress and disappointment into a problem-solving opportunity. Even if you can’t figure out a solution, just considering possibilities will lower the bar on your emotional volume and put you in a more positive state.

A key figure in the 17th century scientific revolution, he is best known for his laws of planetary motion, based on his works \\"Astronomia nova\\", \\"Harmonices Mundi\\", and \\"Epitome of Copernican Astronomy\\". These works also provided one of the foundations for Isaac Newton's theory of universal gravitation. - A hypothesis (plural hypotheses) is a proposed explanation for a phenomenon. For a hypothesis to be a scientific hypothesis, the scientific method requires that one can test it. Scientists generally base scientific hypotheses on previous observations that cannot satisfactorily be explained with the available scientific theories. Even though the words \\"hypothesis\\" and \\"theory\\" are often used synonymously, a scientific hypothesis is not the same as a scientific theory. A working hypothesis is a provisionally accepted hypothesis proposed for further research. - Claudius Ptolemy (\\"Klaúdios Ptolemaîos\\", ; ) was a Greek writer, known as a mathematician, astronomer, geographer, astrologer, and poet of a single epigram in the Greek Anthology. He lived in the city of Alexandria in the Roman province of Egypt, wrote in Koine Greek, and held Roman citizenship. Beyond that, few reliable details of his life are known. His birthplace has been given as Ptolemais Hermiou in the Thebaid in an uncorroborated statement by the 14th-century astronomer Theodore Meliteniotes. This is a very late attestation, however, and there is no other reason to suppose that he ever lived anywhere else than Alexandria, where he died around AD 168. - In mathematics, a hyperbola (plural \\"hyperbolas\\" or \\"hyperbolae\\") is a type of smooth curve lying in a plane, defined by its geometric properties or by equations for which it is the solution set. A hyperbola has two pieces, called connected components or branches, that are mirror images of each other and resemble two infinite bows. The hyperbola is one of the three kinds of conic section, formed by the intersection of a plane and a double cone. (The other conic sections are the parabola and the ellipse. A circle is a special case of an ellipse). If the plane intersects both halves of the double cone but does not pass through the apex of the cones, then the conic is a hyperbola. - In mathematics, an ellipse is a curve in a plane surrounding two focal points such that the sum of the distances to the two focal points is constant for every point on the curve. As such, it is a generalization of a circle, which is a special type of an ellipse having both focal points at the same location. The shape of an ellipse (how \\"elongated\\" it is) is represented by its eccentricity, which for an ellipse can be any number from 0 (the limiting case of a circle) to arbitrarily close to but less than 1. - Perseus ( c. 150 BC ) was an ancient Greek geometer , who invented the concept of spiric sections , in analogy to the conic sections studied by Apollonius of Perga . - An astronomer is a scientist in the field of astronomy who concentrates their studies on a specific question or field outside of the scope of Earth. They look at stars, planets, moons, comets and galaxies, as well as many other celestial objects either in observational astronomy, in analyzing the data or in theoretical astronomy. Examples of topics or fields astronomers work on include: planetary science, solar astronomy, the origin or evolution of stars, or the formation of galaxies. There are also related but distinct subjects like physical cosmology which studies the Universe as a whole. - The work known as the Almagest, named \\"\\" (\\"\\") in Ancient Greek, and also called Syntaxis Mathematica or Almagestum in Latin, is a 2nd-century Greek-language mathematical and astronomical treatise on the apparent motions of the stars and planetary paths, written by Claudius Ptolemy. One of the most influential scientific texts of all time, its geocentric model was accepted for more than 1200 years from its origin in Hellenistic Alexandria, in the medieval Byzantine and Islamic worlds, and in Western Europe through the Middle Ages and early Renaissance until Copernicus. - Apollonius of Perga (c. 262 c. 190 BC) was a Greek geometer and astronomer noted for his writings on conic sections. His innovative methodology and terminology, especially in the field of conics, influenced many later scholars including Ptolemy, Francesco Maurolico, Johannes Kepler, Isaac Newton, and René Descartes. Apollonius gave the ellipse, the parabola, and the hyperbola their modern names. The hypothesis of eccentric orbits, or equivalently, deferent and epicycles, to explain the apparent motion of the planets and the varying speed of the Moon, is also attributed to him. Ptolemy describes Apollonius' theorem in the \\"Almagest\\" XII.1. The crater Apollonius on the Moon is named in his honor. - Francesco Maurolico (Greek: , \\"Frangiskos Mavrolikos\\"; Latin: \\"Franciscus Maurolycus\\"; \\"Francisci Maurolyci\\"; Italian: \\"Francesco Maurolico\\"; September 16, 1494-July 21 or July 22, 1575) was a mathematician and astronomer from Sicily. Born to a Greek family and immersed in the study of classical Greek texts, throughout his lifetime he made contributions to the fields of geometry, optics, conics, mechanics, music, and astronomy. He edited the works of classical authors including Archimedes, Apollonius, Autolycus, Theodosius and Serenus. He also composed his own unique treatises on mathematics and mathematical science. - In geometry, Apollonius' theorem is a theorem relating the length of a median of a triangle to the lengths of its side. It states that \\"the sum of the squares of any two sides of any triangle equals twice the square on half the third side, together with twice the square on the median bisecting the third side\\" Specifically, in any triangle \\"ABC\\", if \\"AD\\" is a median, then It is a special case of Stuart's theorem. For a right-angled triangle the theorem reduces to the Pythagorean theorem. From the fact that diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other, the theorem is equivalent to the parallelogram law. - In mathematics, a conic section (or simply conic) is a curve obtained as the intersection of the surface of a cone with a plane. The three types of conic section are the hyperbola, the parabola, and the ellipse. The circle is a special case of the ellipse, and is of sufficient interest in its own right that it was sometimes called a fourth type of conic section. The conic sections have been studied by the ancient Greek mathematicians with this work culminating around 200 BC, when Apollonius of Perga undertook a systematic study of their properties. - In physics, an orbit is the gravitationally curved path of an object around a point in space, for example the orbit of a planet about a star or a natural satellite around a planet. Normally, orbit refers to a regularly repeating path around a body, although it may occasionally be used for a non recurring trajectory or a path around a point in space. To a close approximation, planets and satellites follow elliptical orbits, with the central mass being orbited at a focal point of the ellipse, as described by Kepler's laws of planetary motion. - In geometry, a spiric section, sometimes called a spiric of Perseus, is a quartic plane curve defined by equations of the form - In the Hipparchian and Ptolemaic systems of astronomy, the epicycle (from , literally \\"on the circle\\", meaning \\"circle moving on another circle\\") was a geometric model used to explain the variations in speed and direction of the apparent motion of the Moon, Sun, and planets. In particular it explained the apparent retrograde motion of the five planets known at the time. Secondarily, it also explained changes in the apparent distances of the planets from Earth. - René Descartes (Latinized: Renatus Cartesius; adjectival form: \\"Cartesian\\"; 31 March 159611 February 1650) was a French philosopher, mathematician, and scientist. Dubbed the father of modern western philosophy, much of subsequent Western philosophy is a response to his writings, which are studied closely to this day. He spent about 20 years of his life in the Dutch Republic. - Sir Isaac Newton (25 December 1642 20 March 1726/27) was an English mathematician, astronomer, and physicist (described in his own day as a \\"natural philosopher\\") who is widely recognised as one of the most influential scientists of all time and a key figure in the scientific revolution. His book \\"Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica\\" (\\"Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy\\"), first published in 1687, laid the foundations of classical mechanics. Newton also made seminal contributions to optics, and he shares credit with Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz for developing the infinitesimal calculus.

Immersing in nature, campfire meals, starlit nights, and the rush of simplicity are part and parcel of a camping experience. It's an opportunity to disconnect from the monotony of everyday life, reconnect with nature, and create unforgettable memories. Firstly, let's discuss the preparation part. Choose your camping site wisely and research it thoroughly. National parks, forests, mountains, or beaches—each has a distinctive charm. Depending on the location, the packing list, activities, potential challenges, and safety measures will differ. Next up is your camping gear. The essential checklist includes a sturdy tent, sleeping bag, a camping stove (if you plan to cook), cooler, camp chairs, lantern or flashlight, and basic tools like a pocket knife or multi-tool. Keep comfort, durability, and packability in mind when selecting these items. Food and hydration are crucial. Pack plenty of snacks like nuts and fruits along with ingredients for your main meals. Remember, your goal is to pack nutrient-dense, lightweight, and non-perishable food. Don't forget to carry plenty of water and a water purifier in case you run out and need to source water at your campsite. Wearing the right clothes is equally important. Layering is key to handle changing temperatures. Quick-dry fabrics that wick moisture away are better than cotton. Include rainwear, hiking boots, warm socks, hat, gloves, and sunglasses in your packing list. Safety is paramount when camping. Carry a first-aid kit with bandages, antiseptic wipes, tweezers, medical tape, and pain killers. Include a whistle, map, compass, and even a GPS if you're going off-trail. Pay attention to weather forecasts and local wildlife reports. The light pollution in cities often obstructs our view of the night sky. A camping trip offers the chance to witness undiluted, vast canvases of stars—so don't forget your binoculars if you're a star-gazing enthusiast. Remember, one of the goals of camping is to respect and preserve nature. Avoid disrupting ecosystems, ensure your camping materials are eco-friendly, and once you depart, leave no trace behind. Lastly, a camping trip isn't complete without activities. Hiking, fishing, bird watching, nature photography, cycling, or sightseeing, include fun activities that enrich your camping experience. Evenings can be spent around a campfire, roasting marshmallows, telling ghost stories, playing the guitar, or simply enjoying the tranquil silence. Once you've mapped out your plans and packed your gear, all that's left is to set out and sink into the wilderness. Enjoy every moment— the mesmerizing sunrise, the serene sunset, the chill of the nightfall, the harmony of nature's sounds, and the sense of tranquility. Should you need more specifics on gear recommendations or have any questions regarding your camping trip, feel free to reach out. Happy camping!

Instead of the furious comebacks the Cards have been known for this year, the Cards grabbed a commanding lead in the fifth inning Friday and held on. \\"We got it. It is unbelievable,\\" outfielder Allen Craig said. \\"This is an unbelievable group of guys. I am just glad to be a part of this.\\" Craig, who caught the last out of the game, was more than a part of it. He hit a home run in the third inning of Friday's game and stole a home run from Ranger Nelson Cruz leaping over the wall to bring the ball back. Another one of the stars of Friday's game was Cardinals catcher Yadier Molina, who had two hits and knocked in two RBIs. Another St. Louis star was hurler Chris Carpenter, who continued his undefeated postseason run by stymieing the Rangers for six innings Friday. Rangers pitchers were plagued with wildness Friday and throughout the series. In the fifth inning, the Cardinals were able to get two runs and jump to a commanding 5 to 2 lead without getting a hit, capitalizing on Rangers' walks. The win gives the Cards their 11th World Series championship. The Cardinals last won the championship in 2006. Friday's win may have seemed a little melodramatic compared to the instant-classic World Series game Thursday, when the Cardinals displayed their never-say-die attitude. The Cardinals were pushed to within their last strike in the ninth and 10th innings only to come back and erase two-run deficits both times. They finished the comeback in the 11th inning beating the Rangers 10 to 9 on David Freese's walk-off home run. Freese was named the most valuable player of the series. \\"This is a dream come true,\\" Freese said. \\"This is why you keep battling.\\" Cardinals Manager Tony La Russa said the fans, cheering and supporting, helped his team to the muster the strength to comeback so many times. \\"It is amazing, incredible,\\" La Russa said. \\"This is for you, fans. Thank you so much.\\" Comebacks are nothing new for the Cards, who made a furious dash just to reach the postseason. The team erased a 10.5-game deficit with the Atlanta Braves in the last month of the regular season just to make it to the playoffs. They punctuated that comeback by taking the must-win last two games of the season and stealing the National League wild card from the Braves. Once in the playoffs, the Cards defeated division champs Milwaukee Brewers and Philadelphia Phillies. Both feats defied oddsmakers.

Answer:","response":"Title: Lacking User-friendliness and Stability: Needs Improvement Review: I recently downloaded the \\"org.torproject.android\\" app, with the hope of securing my browsing activities and remaining anonymous online. While there are some notable benefits to using Tor for privacy and bypassing censorship, my experience with this app has been less than satisfactory. I give it a 2 out of 5 stars for the reasons discussed below. First, the user interface lacks the simplicity and intuitiveness that I've come to expect from contemporary applications. The setup process was quite cumbersome, requiring multiple steps and manual configuration settings that were not explained within the app. I found myself relying on external resources and forums to fully understand how to set up and navigate the app. For a first-time user or someone who is not technically inclined, this would be a significant barrier to entry. The speed of the app has also been a point of concern for me. I understand that, due to the nature of the Tor network, connection speeds will likely be slower than those of other VPN services. Nonetheless, the app's performance fell short of my expectations. Loading webpages took longer than I had anticipated, and I occasionally experienced inadvertent disconnections from the network, causing my browsing session to be interrupted. Moreover, stability has been a significant issue. I encountered numerous instances of the app freezing, crashing, or otherwise malfunctioning during daily use. This is an area where the app must improve in order to provide a seamless and reliable user experience. Regarding the anonymity aspect, I am aware that Tor is considered a reliable option for many privacy-conscious users. However, the app's shortcomings make me question the effectiveness of protecting my anonymity online. The frustrating user experience and uncertain reliability make me hesitant to trust the app for sensitive browsing sessions. Ultimately, while the idea behind \\"org.torproject.android\\" is commendable, the app has plenty of room for improvement. I would appreciate a more user-friendly interface with clear instructions and tutorials, streamlined setup processes, and enhanced speed and stability. Although this app boasts unique features compared to other VPN services, the overall user experience detracted from its appeal. As a result, I rate the \\"org.torproject.android\\" app with two stars. I would recommend potential users to either wait for future updates addressing these concerns or to explore other alternative privacy-focused applications until these issues are resolved."},{"question":"By. Louise Cheer. A heritage-listed home with a 150-year history is set to break property records at Sydney's Potts Point with an estimated price tag of 20 million. The 1,970-square-metre home at Potts Point not only boasts a rich past but six bedrooms, five bathrooms and six parking spaces. Advertised as a 'regency revival family estate', Jenner House was home to the brother of department store owner Anthony Horden, Lebbeus Hordern, and was built around 1868 by distinguished architect Edmund Blacket. The Potts Point home on Macleay Street is estimated to sell for about 20 million. The three-storey house was initially built as two storeys circa 1868 and was one of the late 19th century villas lining Potts Point. After Mr Horden, one of New South Wales' wealthiest men - John Thomas Nealk - who made his fortune as a clothes dealer took up residence in about 1875 and died at the address in 1897. It was also once occupied by King George V during his time in the Royal Navy. The Sydney Morning Herald reported the house currently holds the Potts Point record of highest selling residence of 15 million, which was set when it was sold to high-profile car dealer Terry Mullens and wife Wendy by horse trainer Tony Peterson in 2009. In Jenner House's history - which has spanned almost 150 years - it has been known as Stramshall Villa from about 1871 to 1879, Kurrahjeen from 1880 to 1885 and Lugano from 1888 to 1911. Its current name was bestowed on it in 1914. The three-storey house sits on parklands facing north-east with panoramic views of Sydney Harbour, with a circular driveway and a 600-square-metre forecourt garden complete with its own gatehouse. Despite its modern facilities, Jenner House - located on Macleay Street - still retains its colonial roots with 10 marble fireplaces, a grand cedar staircase, a colonnaded entrance foyer, four-metre high ceilings, cast-iron columns and lacy balconies. The home boasts a massive circular garden suitable to hold large parties, overlooking the Sydney Harbour. It's no wonder it has a 20 million price tag with a colonnaded entrance foyer and a grand cedar staircase. Retaining its colonial roots with its 4m high ceilings, a modern edge is added with a kitchen with marble counter tops and industrial kitchen facilities. This is married with a kitchen that could satisfy any keen cook's needs. The house's massive breakfast room leads into an open-plan commercial kitchen which includes a marble island, stainless steel benchtops, a gas stove and double even, a teppanyaki grill and three sinks. Large dinner parties will be no trouble with a sizable entertainment garden and a banquet-sized dining room with a balcony and butler's pantry. Each bedroom is decked out with luxurious marble ensuite bathrooms with heated floors and walk-in wardrobes. The home's lavish style continues onto the last level with a basement workshop encased in sandstone walls and extensive cellars. Jenner House has panoramic views of Sydney Harbour as well as 10 marble fireplaces and kauri timber floors. Five of the property's bedrooms are decked out with marble ensuite bathrooms. According to Australia's Department of Environment, Jenner House was initially built as a two-storey building as one of the late 19th century villas that lined Potts Point and was heritage-listed in 1991. The home's third-storey extensions were commissioned by Mr Nealk and done by well-known architect Thomas Rowe between 1875-1877. Jenner House is being sold through Jason Boon of Richardson & Wrench, Michael Pallier of Sydney Sotheby's International Realty, and Barry Goldman and Robert Page of Raine & Horne Double Bay. A circular driveway greet guests as they enter the property with six spots for cars to park. Cast-iron columns and lacy balconies decorate the outside of the house to maximise the benefits of the view.

Brown mushrooms: Bill gathered 6 brown mushrooms. All of these mushrooms have white spots. So, there are 6 white-spotted brown mushrooms. 3. Blue mushrooms: Ted gathered 6 blue mushrooms. Half of these mushrooms have white spots. So, we need to find half of 6: (1/2) * 6 = 3 There are 3 white-spotted blue mushrooms.

We were writing about the tomboy for the story instead of the plane because the Pick from: 1). tomboy was alive.. 2). plane was alive..","response":"1). Tomboy was alive. We were writing about the tomboy for the story instead of the plane because the tomboy was alive. It was her vibrant energy and zest for life that captured our attention and drew us into the narrative. She was a much more compelling and engaging character than an inanimate object, such as the plane, could ever be. We believed that the tomboy, with her colorful personality and dynamic nature, would make for a far more interesting and meaningful plotline. The tomboy was a girl named Lily, who defied conventional gender stereotypes and possessed a fiery spirit that set her apart from her peers. Growing up in a small, conservative town, she faced constant scrutiny and judgment for her non-conformist choices. Yet, her unyielding spirit only grew stronger with each challenge. Through the eyes of Lily, we aimed to explore the complex themes of identity, self-discovery, and societal expectations. The character of Lily quickly ingratiated herself with readers, primarily because of her unwavering determination and courage. She faced every hurdle with an unapologetically bold demeanor, unwilling to let anyone define who she was or what she should be. Her boundless curiosity and sense of adventure breathed life into the pages of the story, drawing readers into an immersive and emotionally connected narrative experience. On the other hand, the plane was an inanimate object, with no thoughts, emotions, or aspirations. While it played a vital role in the setting and transportation of the characters in the story, it remained a passive player in the events that unfolded. It could not incite the same type of emotional connection with the readers as Lily could, nor did it provide the rich tapestry of challenges, growth, and introspection that Lily's character offered. Moreover, we felt that Lily's story was important to tell, for it would resonate with many readers who were trying to break free from societal norms and expectations. Through her struggles and triumphs, Lily would inspire them to embrace their uniqueness and celebrate their individuality. The plane, though a fascinating piece of machinery, couldn't instill the same sense of motivation or hope. By choosing to write about the alive and spirited tomboy, we not only crafted a more engaging and emotional narrative, but we also shed light on themes that deeply resonated with our readers. Lily's journey had the power to touch the hearts of countless individuals, prompting introspection, inspiring courage, and provoking conversations about the constructs we live within. Ultimately, it was Lily's unwavering vibrance and life that took center stage in our story, while the plane remained a steadfast yet silent backdrop."},{"question":"Given the question: Given the below context: According to the City's 2013 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the largest employers in the city are: Major manufacturers in Grand Forks include wind turbine manufacturer LM Glasfiber and light aircraft manufacturer Cirrus Design.

This area was largely set aside and developed under a state program spearheaded by Hammond during his second term as governor. Delta-area crops consist predominately of barley and hay. West of Fairbanks lies another concentration of small farms catering to restaurants, the hotel and tourist industry, and community-supported agriculture. Which crops are produced in the Delta-area?","response":"The Delta Junction area, located in the Tanana Valley in Alaska, is indeed an essential agricultural region with a significant concentration of farms mostly growing agronomic crops. The region experiences a subarctic climate that supports the cultivation of various cool-season crops and grains. The notable crops produced in the Delta area are as follows: 1. Barley: Barley is the primary crop grown in the Delta area due to its adaptability to the region's cool climate and short growing season. The barley produced in this region is mostly used for animal feed, although it can also be used for human consumption and brewing purposes. 2. Hay: Hay, specifically Timothy hay and other mixed-hay varieties, are another major crop produced in the Delta-area. Hay production serves both local livestock needs and is also shipped to the lower 48 states in the USA for consumption by various livestock operations. 3. Oats: Another cool-season cereal grain, oats, is cultivated in the Delta area to a lesser extent than barley. Oats are primarily used as animal feed, particularly for horses, and other farm animals. 4. Potatoes: Potatoes are also grown in the Delta Junction area, as the cooler climate and well-drained soils are suitable for their production. The potato varieties produced in this region can be used for fresh consumption, frozen products, and chipping markets. 5. Vegetables: The Delta area hosts several small-scale vegetable farms that cater to local and regional markets, supplying fresh produce to nearby communities, restaurants, and hotels. Some of the popular vegetables grown in these farms include lettuce, cabbage, carrots, beets, turnips, zucchini, and various types of squash. 6. Fruits and berries: Although fruits and berries are not primary cash crops in the Delta-area, they still contribute to the agricultural production of the region. Some farms produce cool-hardy fruits and berries such as raspberries, strawberries, rhubarb, and currants. 7. Canola: Although not a major crop yet, the potential cultivation of canola in the Delta area has attracted attention due to Alaska's increasing demand for locally produced agricultural products. Canola oil and meal are valuable for both human consumption and livestock feed, and this crop could provide additional diversity and opportunities for farmers in the Delta region. These crops represent a significant portion of the agricultural production in the Delta Junction area of the Tanana Valley. The overall farming community not only supports local economies and state programs but also contributes to the food security of Alaska and, in some cases, other parts of the United States."},{"question":"Michelle Obama has just started a campaign against childhood obesity with the admission that she put her girls Malia and Sasha on a diet because they were getting fat. Clearly, childhood obesity must be solved urgently. But is it a good idea for mothers to put their daughters on diets?

She was also buried with a copper headband and a copper coin, archaeologists found. How do you keep a demon from disturbing the living? A blade to the throat should do the trick. A few skeletons unearthed in a 400-year-old Polish cemetery have been discovered with sickles placed around their necks. Archaeologists believe this strange burial practice is evidence of a belief in magic and a fear of demons. The sickle burials were found at Drawsko cemetery, a site in northeastern Poland that dates from the 17th to the 18th centuries. Archaeologists, including Marek Polcyn, a visiting scholar at Lakehead University in Canada, have excavated more than 250 graves there since 2008. Among those graves were four skeletons with sickles placed at their throats, and a fifth skeleton with a sickle placed over its hips. Previously, these burials had been described as \\"vampire\\" burials, with the sickles interpreted as a way to prevent the dead from reanimating and terrorizing the living. But in a new study detailed in the journal Antiquity, Polcyn and co-author Elzbieta Gajda, of the Muzeum Ziemi Czarnkowskiej, now reject that characterization. (\\"We deliberately dismiss the interpretation of a revenant (i.e. vampire),\\" isn't something you read in an academic paper every day.) [See Photos of the Sickle Burials at Drawsko Cemetery] Instead, the archaeologists prefer to use the blanket term \\"anti-demonic\\" to talk about these burials, partly because vampires weren't the only kinds of evil incarnations of the dead, according to traditional folk beliefs in the region. But also, the sickle graves were afforded funerary privileges that weren't usually extended to \\"vampires\\" buried elsewhere: They were given Christian burials in sacred ground alongside other members of the community, and their corpses do not appear to have been desecrated or mutilated. In another sign that the people buried with sickles probably were not outsiders, scientists who studied chemical signatures locked in the teeth of these corpses found that all five individuals were locals. (They published those results in a paper in PLOS ONE last year.) \\"The magical and ritual meaning of this gesture seems beyond doubt,\\" Polcyn and Gajda wrote, adding, however, that the sickle might have had more than one ritualistic meaning. The tool may have been intended to keep the dead in their graves under the threat of cutting their throat, but it also might have been used to prevent evil forces from tormenting their souls. What's more, the use of a tool made of iron, which had to undergo a transformation in fire, could symbolize the passage from life to death, the authors wrote. [7 Strange Ways Humans Act Like Vampires] Even though Christianity was the dominant religion in Poland at the time this cemetery was used, traditions from old Slavic pagan faith and folk belief systems still existed, including a belief in demons. Besides the sickles, there is not much that makes these graves unique, so the scientists aren't sure exactly what about these people made them demonic. They may have been thought to have supernatural powers in life, or they might have had physical characteristics considered suspicious (which might have included \\"an exceptionally hairy body,\\" a unibrow, a large head and a red complexion, the authors said, citing traditional Polish folklore). These people also might have died in a traumatic fashion, without any time for the appropriate rites and rituals to make for a smooth spiritual transition into death — a concept some archaeologists call a \\"bad death.\\" While some of the people buried with sickles may have simply died of old age, one of them, a girl, died as a teenager. The authors speculated that she might have met a violent and untimely end, perhaps through drowning, suicide or murder. Unfortunately for archaeologists, however, this death didn't leave its mark on the girl's bones. Polcyn and Gajda wrote that they hope further scientific tests on the corpses, such as biomolecular analyses, will help them understand more specifically what led the dead in Drawsko to be buried with sickles.

MORE: Stonehenge Intricate Treasures Made by Children Although the purpose of the gold lozenge remains a mystery — interpretations have ranged from an elaborate button to an astronomical instrument -- its precise decorations, made of impressed lines, reveals a detailed knowledge of mathematics and geometry. On the chest of the Bush Barrow tribal chief there was a beautifully decorated gold lozenge. It was made of sheet gold with finely incised decoration. Some of the thousands of studs from the dagger. Each stud is thinner than a human hair. They were set into the wood at a density of over 1,000 per square centimeter to create a zig-zag pattern. Produced nearly 4,000 years ago, more than 1,000 years before the invention of any form of magnifying glass, the dagger was decorated with 140,000 tiny studs. The ultra-fine craftwork entailed extremely tiny components such as microscopic gold pins and gold wires. According to optic experts, only children and teenagers, and those adults who had become myopic naturally or due to the nature of their work as children, would have been able to create and manufacture such tiny objects. The eye-stressing work would have blinded most child workers. The image shows how the studs are placed in straight lines and the heads overlap each other like fish scales. This watercolor shows the dagger handle as excavated by William Cunnington in 1808. Among the buried objects, one of the finest was a dagger with an intricately decorated wooden handle. Today only fragments of the original handle survive. Here fragments of the 4,000-year-old wooden handle is mounted on a modern wood reconstruction. Reconstruction of the burial of the Bush Barrow mound. The burial contained the skeleton of a chieftain who lived almost 4,000 years ago. He was laid to rest in regal splendor with objects known today as the Stonehenge treasure. NEWS: Stonehenge Intricate Treasures Made by Children Evidence of “anti-demonic” funerary practices, with sickles placed around the throats of the deceased possibly to ward off demons, has been found in a 400-year-old cemetery in Poland. Researchers examined more than 250 human skeletons which were excavated since 2008 from a post Medieval cemetery in Drawsko, a rural settlement site in northwestern Poland. Dating to the 17th and 18th centuries, the remains represented individuals of all ages and both sexes and included five unique interments with sickles. Photos: Intricate Treasures From Stonehenge Burial Play Video Ancient Lost Army Found? The Persian army of 50,000 soldiers supposedly perished in a sandstorm in ancient Egypt 2500 years ago. Researchers have located a valley of bones they think may belong to the fabled army. DCI “In four of these burials the sickles were placed on the bodies of the dead with the cutting edge tightly against the throat, while the fifth was located on the pelvis,” Marek Polcyn, a visiting scholar at Lakehead University in Canada, and Elzbieta Gajda, of the Muzeum Ziemi Czarnkowskiej, wrote in the current issue of the journal Antiquity. The skeletons with the sickles around the throat were those of an adult male who died between 35–44 years of age, two adult females who died around 30–39 years of age, and an adolescent female who at around 14–19 years old. There was also an adult female aged 50–60 years interred with a large, arch-curved sickle placed across her hips. A stone was placed directly on top of the throat, while a coin was found in her toothless mouth. Ice Age Infant Skeletons Hint at Burial Rites Previously, it was suggested these people were buried as “vampires.” In this view, the sickle placed across the throat was intended to remove the head, should the vampire attempt to rise from the grave. But Polcyn and Gajda argue these burials should be rather interpreted as “anti-demonic.” They noted the sickle burials have none of the characteristics of so-called anti-vampiric practices. They were interred in sacred ground following conventional Christian burial patterns, with the head placed towards the west, and their graves did not appear to have been desecrated. Ancient Priest's Tomb Painting Discovered Near Great Pyramid “Confining the deceased in the grave by means of a sickle may have been a measure to prevent the demonized soul threatening the living, or could have been a reference to biblical symbolism in an attempt to prevent the soul from becoming demonized,” Polcyn and Gajda wrote. Vampires were not the only mythical creatures feared in Poland in the 17th century. As wars, hunger, pestilence, and poverty devastated the country, Slavic pagan faiths resurrected. “The development of the Counter-Reformation was a significant turning point as it brought cultural and intellectual regression, religious fanaticism and a growing climate of terror, deliberately stoked by Catholic clergy spreading fear of the devil and witchcraft,” the researchers wrote. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","response":"In a 400-year-old cemetery in Poland, archaeologists have discovered skeletons buried with sickles placed around their necks, indicating a belief in magic and a fear of demons.

In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer.

Fun is highly subjective, meaning that what may be enjoyable for one person may not necessarily be fun for another.

It asks about the personal preferences of that subject, focusing on what that specific entity might find enjoyable. If directed at a person, it would seek to know their hobbies or activities that they find entertaining. 2. \\"What is fun?\\" - This question is more general, asking about the concept of fun itself. It aims to understand the general idea of fun and what it means for people in general. This question does not necessarily seek to know an individual's preferences or experiences but instead focuses on the wider context of fun and its definition.

This situation can be analyzed in various ways to arrive at a comprehensive understanding of both individuals' actions and risk-taking tendencies. (i). William was a risk taker. Based on the given sentence, it is clear that William was a risk taker for several reasons. First, he decided to invest all of his money into a single stock, which is considered a high-risk move in the world of finance. This choice indicates that William was willing to put everything he had on the line for the possibility of a substantial financial gain. William's decision can be an indication of his confidence in the stock he chose, which may have been based on thorough research and financial analysis. On the other hand, it could also be a testament to his attraction to the idea of potentially earning a significant profit quickly, even at the risk of losing it all. This willingness to take risks could have been influenced by various factors, such as an ambitious nature or an optimistic personality. (ii). Ian was not a risk taker. In contrast, Ian's decision not to invest all of his money into one stock shows that he likely had a more conservative approach to investing and financial management. By not following in William's footsteps, Ian demonstrates that he values stability and preservation of his capital over the potential for rapid financial gains. Ian's choice may be driven by several factors, with one of the most obvious being his aversion to risk. His preference for not putting all his eggs in one basket could be due to a cautious personality, a strong desire to protect his financial assets, or a belief in having a diversified investment portfolio as a safer and more sustainable option for long-term growth. Furthermore, Ian's decision could also be influenced by other considerations, such as maintaining an emergency fund or providing for his family's needs, which would prompt him to avoid high-risk investments. Ian might also place a higher value on pursuing financial goals slowly and steadily, following the principle that patience and discipline can lead to long-term wealth accumulation. In conclusion, the sentence demonstrates that William was a risk taker by investing all of his money into one stock, while Ian, who did not do the same, was not a risk taker. Both individuals had distinct approaches to their financial decision-making, either because of their personal beliefs, values, or circumstances. These different methods of handling investments can have varying outcomes in the long run, and neither strategy is universally right or wrong. Instead, they serve as examples of how people's varying risk appetites and financial goals can shape their investment choices."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Jassy (film) - Jassy was a 1947 British film melodrama based on a novel by Norah Lofts.

(Health.com) -- Amanda Santos wanted to send her 5-year-old daughter, Skylar, to a small private school. But after they interviewed, met the teachers, and submitted Skylar's medical records, they never heard back from the school, despite repeated inquiries. Santos, who lives in Fairhaven, Massachusetts, can't say for sure why communication was cut off so abruptly, but she's convinced that Skylar's severe nut allergy was an issue. \\"They knew going in that she had an allergy; they said it was no problem,\\" says Santos. \\"But until we sat down and had a meeting about the precautions they'd have to take -- kids washing their hands, asking parents not to send nuts to school, that kind of thing -- they didn't realize how severe it was. I just think they didn't want her there, didn't want to deal with all of that.\\" The","response":"Santos family was left feeling disappointed and frustrated by the lack of response from the private school. Amanda couldn't help but believe that her daughter was being discriminated against because of her severe nut allergy. While it is understandable that schools need to consider the safety of all students and the additional precautions that may be necessary, it is essential that they approach these situations with empathy and not discriminate against students with allergies. After this disheartening experience, Amanda decided to explore other educational options for her daughter. She began engaging with her local public school and discussing Skylar's allergy with the school administrators and teachers. To her relief, she found that the public school was more than willing to accommodate and prioritize Skylar's needs, understanding the importance of maintaining a safe and inclusive learning environment for all students. The school administration promptly rolled out a comprehensive allergy management plan for Skylar and any student with similar allergies. Protocols were put in place to ensure that all teachers, staff, and students were educated about allergies, and specific measures were taken to minimize potential exposure to allergens. Examples of these measures included maintaining nut-free zones within classrooms, regular training for staff on how to manage allergic reactions, and the implementation of strict handwashing guidelines for students before and after eating. The school also worked collaboratively with parents to make sure they were informed about the allergy policies in place and encouraged them to send nut-free foods for their children’s lunches. Throughout the process, Amanda became an advocate for Skylar and other children with life-threatening allergies. She collaborated closely with the school to develop and refine their policies, ensuring they met the appropriate safety standards and continuously educating other parents and the broader community about the importance of providing a safe learning environment for all children. Amanda became involved with allergy support groups in her area, speaking at local events and sharing her family's experience, in hopes that their story could help others going through similar situations. In the end, Amanda realized that although Skylar's severe nut allergy presented some challenges in finding the right educational environment, it also opened up opportunities to connect with a supportive community and make a positive impact on the lives of others. Skylar thrived at her new school, forming strong friendships with her classmates, and excelling academically. The school's commitment to providing an inclusive and safe environment for all students showcased how a sense of understanding, collaboration, and individualized care can make a significant difference in the lives of children like Skylar, and others facing similar obstacles."},{"question":"Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Worst headset I have ever owned.

Who's horse was called Marengo?","response":"Marengo was a famous war horse belonging to Napoleon Bonaparte, the French military and political leader who rose to prominence during the French Revolution and its associated wars. The horse was an Arab stallion, renowned for his speed, agility, strength, and unwavering loyalty to his master. Marengo, named after the Battle of Marengo where Napoleon emerged victorious against the Austrians in 1800, became one of Napoleon's favorite mounts throughout his military campaigns. Foaled in 1793, Marengo was eventually acquired by the French General when the stallion was around seven years old. Marengo accompanied Napoleon during numerous battles and played a crucial role in the famous Egyptian campaign, the Battle of Austerlitz, and the Battle of Waterloo. Standing at approximately 14 hands 1 inch tall, Marengo was not the tallest or the most imposing of horses, but he was known for his remarkable qualities as a reliable and resilient warhorse. He possessed a grey coat with a distinctive blaze down his face and a few white markings on his legs. His uncanny ability to cover long distances under challenging circumstances made him a valuable companion for Napoleon. On various occasions, Marengo allowed Napoleon to reach crucial strategic positions swiftly, making a significant difference in the outcomes of the battles. Marengo was so vital to Napoleon that he often had his warhorse painted in his official portraits, thus creating a lasting association between the two. Marengo became a symbol of Napoleon's military prowess and a figure of admiration among the soldiers and the public. The stallion's journey came to an end on June 18, 1815, after the Battle of Waterloo, where Napoleon faced a crushing defeat at the hands of the Seventh Coalition, an alliance of European forces. Marengo was injured during the battle and was captured by the British, marking the separation of the famed horse from his master. Later, Marengo was shipped to England, where he passed through various owners before finding a permanent residence at the Waterloo Stables. There, he spent the remainder of his days and eventually died in 1831 at the age of 38. Even in death, Marengo continued to hold relevance in the minds of the public. His skeleton was preserved and can still be seen on display at the National Army Museum in London, a testament to his influence on military history and the deep bond between the extraordinary warhorse and the iconic leader, Napoleon Bonaparte."},{"question":"Use reasoning to answer the following question.

Options: - (A) mushrooms - (B) green plants - (C) plants - (D) mammals - (E) agriculture - (F) honeybees - (G) photosynthesis - (H) animals","response":"We can narrow down the options by considering the process through which organisms create food and the type of organisms that perform this function. Organisms that create their own food are called autotrophs, and they do this through a process called photosynthesis, which requires sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water to produce glucose (food) and oxygen. Now we can evaluate each option: (A) mushrooms - Mushrooms are fungi, and they do not perform photosynthesis. They are heterotrophs, meaning they get their food from other organisms. (B) green plants - Green plants are known to perform photosynthesis due to the presence of chlorophyll, which aids in the absorption of sunlight. They create food for themselves and serve as a primary food source for other organisms. This seems like a strong candidate. (C) plants - This is a broader category that includes green plants, but some plants, like parasitic plants, may not produce their own food. Therefore, \\"green plants\\" is a better answer. (D) mammals - Mammals are heterotrophs and do not produce their own food. (E) agriculture - This is a human activity and not an organism, so it doesn't fit the question. (F) honeybees - Honeybees are insects and are also heterotrophs, relying on plants for food. (G) photosynthesis - This is a biological process, not an organism. (H) animals - Animals are heterotrophs and do not produce their own food.

The diverse crew, including Amelia Brand (Anne Hathaway), Romilly (David Gyasi), and Doyle (Wes Bentley), traverses through a newly discovered wormhole to search for a new home in a risky interstellar journey. From the visuals, cinematography, to the sound design, \\"Interstellar\\" is, without a doubt, a cinematic marvel. Set pieces such as the harsh, barren landscapes of Earth and the breathtaking vistas of distant, unexplored planets keep the audience visually enthralled throughout the three-hour odyssey. Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema delivers a stunningly immersive experience that deserves to be seen on the biggest and boldest screens available. The Oscar-winning score, composed by Hans Zimmer, complements the film's delicate themes and emotional core with a mix of ambient, melodic, and at times, intensely powerful orchestral arrangements. Although some may argue that the film's narrative can be convoluted, especially when it delves into abstract concepts like the fifth dimension and the power of love, \\"Interstellar\\" excels in its emotional storytelling. Anchored by a strong and moving performance from McConaughey, the weight of personal sacrifice, love, and the pain of separation is palpable throughout. Jessica Chastain and Anne Hathaway also deliver compelling performances, while Michael Caine plays his familiar mentor role, adding gravitas and depth to the proceedings as Dr. John Brand, an aging NASA physicist. The themes of \\"Interstellar\\" resonate with the timeless human desire for exploration and understanding of the universe around us. Nolan masterfully weaves a compelling narrative that gently forces viewers to consider humanity's role in the cosmos, problems we are leaving for future generations, and the potentially mind-bending scientific solutions that may await us in the uncharted realms of deep space. In conclusion, \\"Interstellar\\" is a thought-provoking, visually awe-inspiring, and, at its core, truly humanistic movie that resonates long after the final credits roll. Christopher Nolan has crafted a complex and rewarding journey through space, time, and the soul of humanity, cementing his status as one of the most innovative and skilled filmmakers of this generation. Although the film's pacing may occasionally feel laborious, and some of its scientific theories contentious, \\"Interstellar\\" offers moviegoers an unforgettable and moving experience that should not be missed."},{"question":"Consider the question.

A\\" Possible answers: (i) few amount of days. (ii) very lengthy amount of time. (iii) couple of billion dollars. (iv) very few amount of minutes.","response":"The Grand Canyon took a very lengthy amount of time to form. To be more specific, the formation of the Grand Canyon occurred over a period of millions of years. This extensive time frame allowed for the geological processes, such as erosion and tectonic activities, to gradually carve out the intricate landscape we see today. The formation of the Grand Canyon is mainly attributed to the erosive power of the Colorado River, which has cut through layers of sedimentary rocks as it flowed southwest from its headwaters in the Rocky Mountains. Over millions of years, the river worked its way downward, making the canyon deeper, as well as to the sides, widening the gulf between the canyon rims. However, the formation process was not linear, and the canyon was not created through erosion alone. Tectonic activities, such as the uplifting of the Colorado Plateau, also played a significant role in the formation of the canyon. This uplift essentially provided a steeper gradient for the Colorado River, resulting in a faster rate of erosion and creating the unparalleled depth and width of the Grand Canyon. In addition to these factors, volcanic activity and the deposition of sediment by ancient rivers, lakes, and seas have also contributed to the complex geological history of the canyon. Through the analysis of rock layers and dating techniques, geologists have estimated that the oldest rocks in the Grand Canyon are about 1.8 billion years old, while the youngest are approximately 270 million years old. The canyon itself, however, began forming around 5 to 6 million years ago when the Colorado River first started cutting through the area. Thus, the answer to the question \\"How long did it take the Grand Canyon to form?\\" is a very lengthy amount of time, involving a combination of various geological processes that took place over millions of years."},{"question":"Высококлассные врачи -Кацовская Виктория Яковлевна, Шохар-Троцкая Марианна Константиновна, мои многочисленные друзья и, конечно моя милая жена Тамара.

Answer:","response":"The missing first step of the process of forming a hurricane is the development of a tropical disturbance or wave, which serves as the initial stage for the growth of the hurricane. Let's break down the entire process into steps for better understanding. 1. Formation of a tropical disturbance: The hurricane formation process begins with the development of a tropical disturbance or wave. This is a cluster of thunderstorms that form over warm tropical waters, usually near the equator, particularly in the Atlantic Ocean. These tropical disturbances are caused by the convergence of moist air at the surface, which gets lifted to form clouds and precipitation. The warm ocean waters provide the necessary energy and moisture to fuel the growth of these disturbances. 2. An area of low pressure causes rotation: As the tropical disturbance grows, it eventually creates an area of low pressure due to the rising warm air. The Earth's rotation (Coriolis effect) causes the air around this low-pressure area to start rotating, giving the disturbance a circular shape. This rotation aids in organizing the thunderstorms and strengthening the system. 3. Several thunderstorms come together around this area: As the rotating system of low pressure continues to develop, it attracts and organizes more thunderstorms and moist air around it. The converging air rises and cools, and the moisture in it condenses into clouds and rain. This releases heat, known as latent heat, which warms the air and creates even more instability, leading to the further development of the tropical system. 4. The storm is fed by rising air from warm ocean water evaporating: The driving force behind the intensification of the storm is the warm ocean water below. As the water evaporates, it rises and continually feeds the system with warm, moist air, supplying energy to the storm. The constant supply of warm air allows the storm to grow stronger and better organized. 5. When the wind speeds reach 74 mph, the storm is considered a hurricane: As the storm continues to feed on the warm ocean water and builds in strength, it transitions through various stages of tropical cyclone development. When sustained wind speeds within the storm reach 74 mph (119 km/h) or higher, it is considered a hurricane (or typhoon, or cyclone, depending on the region). Throughout the life of a hurricane, it continues to gather energy from the warm ocean waters, and can grow in size and intensity. Once the system moves over cooler waters or land, it loses its energy source, leading to its eventual weakening and dissipation."},{"question":"- Что я должен делать во время болезни?

Schindler","response":"Title: Johanna's Unsung Truth Plot Outline: Johanna Klausman is a Jewish violinist prodigy from Berlin trying to survive the horrors of World War II. She and her family are forced into a concentration camp after her father's Jewish heritage is discovered. Johanna faces brutality and loss everywhere, seemingly surrendered to silence forever, until she finds solace in a violin at the camp, a forgotten remnant of a world she once knew where joy, music and laughter were possible. Her sublime music touches the heart of Oskar Schindler, a German businessman turned savior of the Jews, who visits the concentration camp and is intrigued by the sublime music echoing in the freezing silence. He brings hope into the terror-forged world Johanna lives in, recognizing her talent as the beacon that illuminates the darkness. This is not your typical World War II film. Throughout the movie, Johanna refuses to speak as her own silent protest against the inhumanity she witnesses every day. Her only form of communication is through her music, and it is through her music that Schindler communicates with her - a relationship where words are irrelevant, where everything that needs to be said, is said through notes and melodies. The story unfolds as Schindler forms a bond with Johanna and her violin, which becomes a symbol of hope, resilience and a collective voice for the unheard. He uses both his influence and resources to protect Johanna and hundreds of other Jews from sure death, calling them his 'workers' and risking his own life amidst Nazi persecution. Schindler's journey is not one merely to save lives, but to preserve the spirit and soul of humanity. The climax of the story is a high-stakes escape when the concentration camp is ordered to be liquidated. At the heart is Johanna's refusal to give up her music, even when threatened with death, her silent rebellion providing hope and emotional strength to her fellow prisoners. Her violin strains become the rallying call for a daring escape orchestrated by Schindler. In the end, after their successful escape, in a poignant moment when Johanna and Schindler are saying farewell, Johanna speaks three words to Schindler: \\"Thank You, Maestro.\\" This breaks her long silence and offers the perfect closure to their relationship - a bond that began with unspoken words and ended with gratitude expressed through speech. \\"Johanna's Unsung Truth\\" explores resilience, the power of music, and the humanity in times of war, how one courageous man and a silent Jewish girl united by the power of music, staged a revolt against the gruesome travesties of concentration camps during one of humankind's darkest hours."},{"question":"Options are: (i) No (ii) Yes Given those answer options, answer the question: Question: who is natalie portman married to?

Solar power, in particular, has shown promise as an effective alternative to traditional fossil fuels. Although advancements in solar energy technologies have made it more accessible and cost-effective, some geographic regions face limitations in adopting solar power due to weather conditions, specifically the presence of clouds and fog. One such example is the city of London, which is known for its often foggy and overcast weather. With a large population and tremendous energy needs, London could potentially benefit from solar power. However, the specific weather conditions of the region pose a significant challenge to the efficiency of solar power generation, as constant cloud cover and fog can reduce the amount of sunlight that reaches the solar panels. The cloud cover in London averages around 62% annually, which indicates that the city receives less sunlight than it could benefit from. Hypothesis: The hypothesis is that \\"By applying a customized solar power generation system designed to overcome the limitations imposed by cloud cover and fog, London can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of solar energy production, supporting its transition to clean energy and reducing the dependency on fossil fuels.\\" To test this hypothesis and integrate solar energy effectively in London, various factors should be considered in developing a customized solar power system: 1. Development of advanced solar panels with higher efficiency: One approach to tackle the problem of reduced sunlight is to invest in research and develop solar panels with higher conversion rates. These high-efficiency solar panels would enable more energy generation from the smaller amount of sunlight available in the region. 2. Using low-light tolerant solar panels and solar trackers: Low-light tolerant solar panels are designed to function in overcast or foggy conditions. Additionally, by incorporating solar trackers – mechanisms that direct solar panels to follow the sun throughout the day – the panels can optimize the amount of sunlight captured, further increasing potential energy generation. 3. Combining solar power generation with energy storage solutions: Storing excess energy generated by solar panels can counteract variations in sunlight availability. By introducing large-scale battery storage systems, surplus solar energy can be stored during peak generation times and used during periods of low sunlight. 4. Creating a hybrid energy system: A combination of renewable energy sources, such as wind power or hydroelectric power, can supplement solar power during periods of reduced sunlight. This diversified approach ensures a continuous supply of clean energy, balancing the limitations of solar power in a region like London with other available renewable options. 5. Encouraging distributed generation: Encouraging households and businesses to install rooftop solar panels could reduce the strain on centralized power plants and improve the overall efficiency of the energy grid. This distributed approach would allow the city to harness energy from numerous micro-generation points, providing a decentralized power infrastructure. In conclusion, the hypothesis suggests that by incorporating these customized solutions, London can mitigate the limitations of cloud cover and foggy weather on solar power generation, bolstering its clean energy initiatives and reducing its reliance on fossil fuels. Testing this hypothesis would involve monitoring the implementation of these customized systems and analyzing their impact on London's overall solar energy production, efficiency, and impact on fossil fuel consumption."},{"question":"Aion yhdessä kollegojeni kanssa tukea toimia, joiden tavoitteena on suurempien määrärahojen saaminen.

Yet there are no vaccines and there is a \\"pressing need\\" for new treatments, he said. The warning comes as doctors in England say a new strain of fungi is causing outbreaks in hospitals. There are more than five million types of fungi, but only three major groups cause the majority of deaths in people: Prof Gow said: \\"Most people know about mild fungal infections, but nobody's ever died from athlete's foot. \\"However, a million people die a year from fungal infections and we need to understand these different types of infection and how to deal with them.\\" The infections are more deadly in people with weakened immune systems - such as patients with HIV - so the fungal problem is particularly acute in Africa. \\"It's an underappreciated problem and it's a very serious challenge in the parts of the world least equipped to deal with it,\\" Prof Gow added. Patients having cancer therapy or who are taking immunosuppressant drugs after an organ transplant are also more susceptible to infection.

He is generally considered to be one of the greatest English composers; no other native-born English composer approached his fame until Edward Elgar, Ralph Vaughan Williams, and Benjamin Britten in the 20th century. - Tomaso Giovanni Albinoni (8 June 1671 17 January 1751) was an Italian Baroque composer. While famous in his day as an opera composer, he is mainly remembered today for his instrumental music, such as the concerti. - Art music (also known as Western classical music, cultivated music, serious music, canonic music, or more flippantly, \\"real music\\" and \\"normal music\\") is an umbrella term that refers to musical traditions, implying advanced structural and theoretical considerations and a written musical tradition. The main tradition in the Western world is usually called classical music. \\"Serious\\" or \\"cultivated\\" music are terms frequently used as a contrast for ordinary, everyday music (popular and folk music, also called \\"vernacular music\\"). After the 20th century, art music was divided into two extensions: \\"serious music\\" and \\"light music\\". - Giuseppe Domenico Scarlatti (Naples, 26 October 1685 Madrid, 23 July 1757) was an Italian composer who spent much of his life in the service of the Portuguese and Spanish royal families. He is classified primarily as a Baroque composer chronologically, although his music was influential in the development of the Classical style and he was one of the few Baroque composers to transition into the classical period. Like his renowned father Alessandro Scarlatti, he composed in a variety of musical forms, although today he is known mainly for his 555 keyboard sonatas. - Jean-Baptiste Lully (born Giovanni Battista Lulli ; 28 November 1632 22 March 1687) was an Italian-born French composer, instrumentalist, and dancer who spent most of his life working in the court of Louis XIV of France. He is considered a master of the French baroque style. Lully disavowed any Italian influence in French music of the period. He became a French subject in 1661. - Johann Pachelbel (baptised September 1, 1653 buried March 9, 1706) was a German composer, organist, and teacher who brought the south German organ tradition to its peak. He composed a large body of sacred and secular music, and his contributions to the development of the chorale prelude and fugue have earned him a place among the most important composers of the middle Baroque era. - George Frideric (or Frederick) Handel (born , ; 23 February 1685 (O.S.) [(N.S.) 5 March] 14 April 1759) was a German, later British baroque composer who spent the bulk of his career in London, becoming well known for his operas, oratorios, anthems, and organ concertos. Handel received important training in Halle and worked as a composer in Hamburg and Italy before settling in London in 1712; he became a naturalised British subject in 1727. He was strongly influenced both by the great composers of the Italian Baroque and by the middle-German polyphonic choral tradition. - Bach Collegium Japan ( BCJ ) is composed of an orchestra and a chorus specializing in Baroque music , playing with period instruments . It was founded in 1990 by Masaaki Suzuki with the purpose of introducing Japanese audiences to European Baroque music . Suzuki still remains its music director . The ensemble has recorded all of Bach 's cantatas , a project that extended from 1995 to 2013 and accounts for over half of its discography . - Amsterdam is the capital and most populous municipality of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Its status as the capital is mandated by the Constitution of the Netherlands, although it is not the seat of the government, which is The Hague. Amsterdam has a population of 847,176 within the city proper, 1,343,647 in the urban area, and 2,431,000 in the Amsterdam metropolitan area. The city is located in the province of North Holland in the west of the country. The metropolitan area comprises much of the northern part of the Randstad, one of the larger conurbations in Europe, with a population of approximately 7 million. - The Renaissance was a period in European history, from the 14th to the 17th century, regarded as the cultural bridge between the Middle Ages and modern history. It started as a cultural movement in Italy in the Late Medieval period and later spread to the rest of Europe, marking the beginning of the Early Modern Age. - Alessandro Scarlatti (2 May 1660 22 October 1725) was an Italian Baroque composer, especially famous for his operas and chamber cantatas. He is considered the founder of the Neapolitan school of opera. He was the father of two other composers, Domenico Scarlatti and Pietro Filippo Scarlatti. - Giovanni Battista Draghi (4 January 1710 16 March 1736), best known as Pergolesi or Giovanni Battista Pergolesi, was an Italian composer, violinist and organist. - The earliest written records regarding the region come from the \\"Nihon Shoki\\", which describes the founding of the Ikuta Shrine by Empress Jing in AD 201. For most of its history, the area was never a single political entity, even during the Tokugawa Period, when the port was controlled directly by the Tokugawa Shogunate. Kobe did not exist in its current form until its founding in 1889. Its name comes from , an archaic title for supporters of the city's Ikuta Shrine. Kobe became one of Japan's 17 designated cities in 1956. - A. G. M. (Ton) Koopman (born 2 October 1944) is a Dutch conductor, organist and harpsichordist. He is also professor at the Royal Conservatory of The Hague. In April 2003 he was knighted in the Netherlands, receiving the Order of the Netherlands Lion. - Marc-Antoine Charpentier (1643 24 February 1704) was a French composer of the Baroque era. - Johann Sebastian Bach (28 July 1750) was a German composer and musician of the Baroque period. He enriched established German styles through his skill in counterpoint, harmonic and motivic organisation, and the adaptation of rhythms, forms, and textures from abroad, particularly from Italy and France. Bach's compositions include the \\"Brandenburg Concertos\\", the \\"Goldberg Variations\\", the Mass in B minor, two Passions, and over three hundred cantatas of which around two hundred survive. His music is revered for its technical command, artistic beauty, and intellectual depth. - Dieterich Buxtehude (; c. 1637/39 9 May 1707) was a Danish-German organist and composer of the Baroque period. His organ works represent a central part of the standard organ repertoire and are frequently performed at recitals and in church services. He composed in a wide variety of vocal and instrumental idioms, and his style strongly influenced many composers, including Johann Sebastian Bach. Today, Buxtehude is considered one of the most important composers in Germany of the mid-Baroque. - Antonio Lucio Vivaldi (4 March 1678 28 July 1741) was an Italian Baroque composer, virtuoso violinist, teacher and cleric. Born in Venice, he is recognized as one of the greatest Baroque composers, and his influence during his lifetime was widespread across Europe. He composed many instrumental concertos, for the violin and a variety of other instruments, as well as sacred choral works and more than forty operas. His best-known work is a series of violin concertos known as \\"The Four Seasons\\". - Heinrich Schütz ( 6 November 1672) was a German composer and organist, generally regarded as the most important German composer before Johann Sebastian Bach and often considered to be one of the most important composers of the 17th century. He wrote what is traditionally considered to be the first German opera, \\"Dafne\\", performed at Torgau in 1627, the music of which has since been lost. He is commemorated as a musician in the Calendar of Saints of the Lutheran Church on 28 July with Johann Sebastian Bach and George Frideric Handel. - Pieter William Kee (born August 30, 1927) is a Dutch organist and composer. - He was born in Kobe to parents who were both Christians and amateur musicians; his father had worked professionally as a pianist. (Suzuki has as an adult joined the Reformed Church in Japan, a Calvinist denomination. ) Masaaki Suzuki began playing organ professionally at church services at the age of 12. He earned degrees in composition and organ at the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music, then earned Soloist Diplomas at the Sweelinck Conservatory in Amsterdam, where he studied harpsichord and organ with Ton Koopman and Piet Kee and improvisation with Klaas Bolt. - Georg Philipp Telemann ( 25 June 1767) was a German Baroque composer and multi-instrumentalist. Almost completely self-taught in music, he became a composer against his family's wishes. After studying in Magdeburg, Zellerfeld, and Hildesheim, Telemann entered the University of Leipzig to study law, but eventually settled on a career in music. He held important positions in Leipzig, Sorau, Eisenach, and Frankfurt before settling in Hamburg in 1721, where he became musical director of the city's five main churches. While Telemann's career prospered, his personal life was always troubled: his first wife died only a few months after their marriage, and his second wife had extramarital affairs and accumulated a large gambling debt before leaving Telemann. - François Couperin (10 November 1668 11 September 1733) was a French Baroque composer, organist and harpsichordist. He was known as \\"Couperin le Grand\\" (\\"Couperin the Great\\") to distinguish him from other members of the musically talented Couperin family. - Arcangelo Corelli (17 February 1653 8 January 1713) was an Italian violinist and composer of the Baroque era. His music was key in the development of the modern genres of sonata and concerto, in establishing the preeminence of the violin, and as the first coalescing of modern tonality and functional harmony. - Jean-Philippe Rameau ( ) was one of the most important French composers and music theorists of the Baroque era. He replaced Jean-Baptiste Lully as the dominant composer of French opera and is also considered the leading French composer for the harpsichord of his time, alongside François Couperin. - Giuseppe Tartini (8 April 1692 26 February 1770) was a Venetian Baroque composer and violinist. - Klaas Bolt (March 6, 1927 in Appingedam April 11, 1990 in Haarlem) was a Dutch organist and improviser. He taught improvisation at the Sweelinck Conservatory (named for Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck, a Dutch organist and composer of the Renaissance) in Amsterdam, where Masaaki Suzuki was among his students. Bolt was a proponent of the use of slow tempi when playing hymns. He played many hymns at his weekly evening hymn sings, which drew substantial audiences. He would typically improvise the hymn introductions at these events. What object entity has the relation of 'named after' with the subject 'bach collegium japan'?

In the very first day his instructor was showing different processes used on fruits. One of them was glace fruit. He showed the class how to prepare glace fruit and kept some of the glace fruits on bowl A. To compare glace fruits with non glace fruits he kept some non glace fruits on bowl B. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would bowl A fruits be preserved longer or shorter than bowl B fruits? Hint: Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2] The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] Answer:","response":"Bowl A fruits would be preserved longer than bowl B fruits. Step 1: Identify the type of fruits in each bowl - Bowl A contains glace fruits (candied or crystallized fruits) - Bowl B contains non-glace fruits (regular, non-preserved fruits) Step 2: Understand the preservation process for glace fruits - Glace fruits are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs moisture from the fruit and preserves it. - The process can take from several days to several months, depending on the fruit size and type. - This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year. - Drenching the fruit in syrup causes it to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavorable osmotic pressure created. Step 3: Compare the preservation process of glace fruits with non-glace fruits - Glace fruits undergo a specific preservation process that allows them to last longer than non-glace fruits. - Non-glace fruits do not undergo any preservation process, which makes them perishable in a shorter period of time compared to glace fruits. Based on the information provided and the steps analyzed, it can be concluded that the fruits in bowl A (glace fruits) would be preserved longer than the fruits in bowl B (non-glace fruits)."},{"question":"Önümüzdeki ay yapılacak Olimpiyatlar öncesinde yapılabilecek en iyi reklam gözüyle bakılan zafer coşkuyla karşılandı.

Options are: (a). yes. (b). it is not possible to tell. (c). no.","response":"(b). it is not possible to tell. Although the statement \\"It administers Medicaid through the Department of Medicaid Services\\" indicates that the entity is responsible for overseeing Medicaid, it does not provide enough information to determine whether Medicaid spending has increased by fifty percent year over year. Medicaid is a joint federal and state program that provides health coverage to eligible low-income adults, children, pregnant women, elderly adults, and individuals with disabilities. The program is administered by state governments, according to federal requirements. Each state has the flexibility to design its own Medicaid program, with the federal government providing matching funds based on a state's Medicaid expenditures. To determine whether Medicaid spending has increased by fifty percent year over year, one would need to analyze data on total Medicaid expenditures for the relevant time period. This would typically involve examining both federal and state funding allocations, as well as reviewing detailed reports on program enrollment, utilization, and cost. Several factors can contribute to changes in Medicaid spending, including: 1. Changes in the number of individuals enrolled in the program 2. Modifications to covered services and benefits 3. Alterations in payment rates for healthcare providers participating in the program 4. Health trends and demographic shifts among the Medicaid-eligible population 5. Changes in federal and state policies impacting Medicaid eligibility or financing These factors could lead to an increase or decrease in Medicaid spending year over year, depending on the specific circumstances and policy decisions in a given state. In conclusion, without further data on actual Medicaid expenditures and the factors affecting them during the relevant time frame, it is not possible to tell whether Medicaid spending has increased by fifty percent year over year based solely on the statement \\"It administers Medicaid through the Department of Medicaid Services.\\""},{"question":"Question: \\"Which group of people had a small number of graduates from Harvard?\\" Context: \\"During a panel discussion at Harvard University's reunion for African American alumni during the 2003–04 academic year, two prominent black professors at the institution—Lani Guinier and Henry Louis Gates—pointed out an unintended effect of affirmative action policies at Harvard. They stated that only about a third of black Harvard undergraduates were from families in which all four grandparents were born into the African American community. The majority of black students at Harvard were Caribbean and African immigrants or their children, with some others the mixed-race children of biracial couples. One Harvard student, born in the South Bronx to a black family whose ancestors have been in the United States for multiple generations, said that there were so few Harvard students from the historic African American community that they took to calling themselves \\"the descendants\\" (i.e., descendants of American slaves). The reasons for this underrepresentation of historic African Americans, and possible remedies, remain a subject of debate.\\" Answer: Answer:","response":"The group of people with a small number of graduates from Harvard, as highlighted in the given context during a panel discussion at the Harvard University's reunion for African American alumni, are the historic African Americans, specifically those with a lineage tracing back to the African American community with ancestors who were American slaves. In the 2003-04 academic year, the unintended effects of affirmative action policies were brought up by Lani Guinier and Henry Louis Gates, two prominent black professors at Harvard. They observed that the majority of the black students at the university were either Caribbean and African immigrants or their descendants, or the mixed-race children of biracial couples. In contrast, only about a third of the black Harvard undergraduates were from families where all four grandparents were born into the African American community. The small population of black Harvard students that derived from the historic African American community referred to themselves as \\"the descendants,\\" reflecting their status as descendants of American slaves. Born to families in the United States with ancestry tracing back multiple generations, these students were notably underrepresented at the prestigious institution. The reasons for the underrepresentation of historic African Americans at Harvard and other elite universities are multifaceted and have been a topic of debate among scholars, policymakers, and educators. Factors contributing to this pattern may include socioeconomic disparities, systemic discrimination within the educational system, and limited access to resources and opportunities that could help prepare and support such students in pursuing higher education at elite institutions. Possible remedies that could address the underrepresentation of historic African Americans at Harvard and similar universities involve a combination of efforts across various domains: 1. Rethinking admission policies: A review of admission policies aiming to ensure that the needs and backgrounds of the historic African American community are considered, thus potentially adjusting the effects of affirmative action policies on this specific demographic. 2. Improving early education opportunities and support: Ensuring that children from the historic African American community have access to quality education and support services early in their lives, which can play a critical role in shaping their academic trajectory. 3. Addressing socioeconomic barriers: Tackling the socioeconomic challenges faced by the African American community as a whole, which could enhance educational and life opportunities for its youth. 4. Strengthening outreach and support programs: Implementing targeted outreach, mentorship, and support programs to encourage and facilitate the pursuit of higher education among the historic African American community's youth. 5. Cultivating diverse representation and role models: Encouraging successful African American alumni from various backgrounds to engage with and inspire younger generations, thus showcasing the value and attainability of elite education for historically underrepresented groups. By focusing on these areas, the underrepresentation of historic African Americans at elite institutions like Harvard may eventually be mitigated. However, it is essential to acknowledge that addressing the deep-rooted causes requires concerted and sustained efforts from multiple stakeholders, including policymakers, educational institutions, communities, and individuals."},{"question":"Q:I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: People think of ice cream as an American food. Yet, ice cream really came from Asia. In the late 1200s Marco Polo, the great explorer, is said to have seen rich Asians eating dishes of ice. Camels had brought the ice from distant mountains. Before it was served, the ice had been flavored with fruits. Marco Polo brought this new dish to Italy, In France cooks changed the ice recipe and made ice cream. At first, cooks tried to keep the recipe a secret. They wanted it to be a special dish for rich people. By the late 1700s, though, ice cream was sold throughout Europe and America. Some great Americans loved ice cream. George Washington was the first to buy a special machine for making it. When Thomas Jefferson returned from France, he brought an ice cream recipe home with him. Dolly Madison, wife of President James Madison, also liked ice cream, and she often served it at the White House. Actually, a famous brand of ice cream was even named after her. In the late 1800s, the ice cream industry began to grow. A way of keeping ice cream frozen had been found, so ice cream makers did not have to worry about ice cream melting anymore.

It is commonly found in freshwater areas, and there are more than 400 species of \\"Spirogyra\\" in the world. \\"Spirogyra\\" measures approximately 10 to 100 m in width and may grow to several centimeters in length. - In vascular plants, phloem is the living tissue that transports the soluble organic compounds made during photosynthesis (known as photosynthate), in particular the sugar sucrose, to all parts of the plant where needed. This transport process is called translocation. In trees, the phloem is the innermost layer of the bark, hence the name, derived from the Greek word (\\"phloios\\") meaning \\"bark\\". - Chlamydomonas is a genus of green algae consisting of unicellular flagellates, found in stagnant water and on damp soil, in freshwater, seawater, and even in snow as \\"snow algae\\" \\"Chlamydomonas\\" is used as a model organism for molecular biology, especially studies of flagellar motility and chloroplast dynamics, biogeneses, and genetics. One of the many striking features of \\"Chlamydomonas\\" is that it contains ion channels, (channelrhodopsins), that are directly activated by light. Some regulatory systems of \\"Chlamydomonas\\" are more complex than their homologs in Gymnosperms, with evolutionarily related regulatory proteins being larger and containing additional domains. - In taxonomy, the Volvocales, also known as Chlamydomonadales, are an order of flagellate or pseudociliate green algae, specifically of the Chlorophyceae. Volvocales can form planar or spherical colonies. These vary from \\"Gonium\\" (4 to 32 cells) up to \\"Volvox\\" (500 cells or more). Each cell has two flagella, and is similar in appearance to \\"Chlamydomonas\\", with the flagella throughout the colony moving in coordination. - Kelps are large seaweeds (algae) belonging to the brown algae (Phaeophyceae) in the order Laminariales. There are about 30 different genera. - Gonium is a genus of colonial algae , a member of the order Volvocales . Typical colonies have 4 to 16 cells , all the same size , arranged in a flat plate , with no anterior - posterior differentiation . In a colony of 16 cells , four are in the center , and the other 12 are on the four sides , three each . A description by G.M. Smith ( 1920 , p. 94 ) : Gonium Mueller 1773 : Colonies of 4 - 8 - 16 cells arranged in a flat quadrangular plate and embedded in a common gelatinous matrix or connected by broad gelatinous strands . Cells ovoid to pyriform , with a single cup - shaped chloroplast containing one pyrenoid . Each cell with two cilia of equal length , contractile vacuoles at the base of the cilia , and an eyespot . Four - and eight - celled colonies with the cilia on the same side ; sixteencelled colonies with the four central cells having their cilia on the same side and the twelve marginal cells with radially arranged cilia . Asexual reproduction by simultaneous division of all cells in the colony to form autocolonies , or by a formation of 2 - 4 zoospores in each cell . - A flagellate is a cell or organism with one or more whip-like organelles called flagella. The word \\"flagellate\\" also describes a particular construction (or level of organization) characteristic of many protists (eukaryotic organisms) and their means of motion. The term presently does not imply any specific relationship or classification of the organisms that possess flagellae. However, the term \\"flagellate\\" is included in other terms (such as \\"dinoflagellate\\" and \\"choanoflagellata\\") which are more formally characterized. - The Chlorophyceae are one of the classes of green algae, distinguished mainly on the basis of ultrastructural morphology. For example, the chlorophycean CW clade, and chlorophycean DO clade, are defined by the arrangement of their flagella. Members of the CW clade have flagella that are displaced in a \\"clockwise\\" (CW, 17 o'clock) direction e.g. Chlamydomonadales. Members of the DO clade have flagella that are \\"directly opposed\\" (DO, 126 o'clock) e.g. Sphaeropleales. They are usually green due to the dominance of pigments chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b. The chloroplast may be discoid, plate-like, reticulate, cup-shaped, spiral or ribbon shaped in different species. Most of the members have one or more storage bodies called pyrenoids located in the chloroplast. Pyrenoids contain protein besides starch. Some algae may store food in the form of oil droplets. Green algae usually have a rigid cell wall made up of an inner layer of cellulose and outer layer of pectose. - Chlorella is a genus of single-cell green algae belonging to the phylum Chlorophyta. It is spherical in shape, about 2 to 10 m in diameter, and is without flagella. \\"Chlorella\\" contains the green photosynthetic pigments chlorophyll-a and -b in its chloroplast. Through photosynthesis, it multiplies rapidly, requiring only carbon dioxide, water, sunlight, and a small amount of minerals to reproduce. - Charophyta is a division of freshwater green algae. The terrestrial plants, the Embryophyta emerged within Charophyta, with the class Zygnematophyceae as a sister group. In some charophyte groups, such as Zygnematophyceae or conjugating green algae, flagellae are absent and sexual reproduction does not involve free-swimming flagellate sperm. Flagellate sperm, however, are found in stoneworts (Charales) and Coleochaetales, orders of parenchymatous charophytes that are the closest relatives of the land plants, where flagellate sperm are also present in all except the conifers and flowering plants. Fossil stoneworts of Devonian age that are similar to those of the present day have been described from the Rhynie chert of Scotland. - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - Algae (singular \\"alga\\" ) is an informal term for a large, diverse group of photosynthetic organisms which are not necessarily closely related, and is thus polyphyletic. Included organisms range from unicellular genera, such as \\"Chlorella\\" and the diatoms, to multicellular forms, such as the giant kelp, a large brown alga which may grow up to 50 m in length. Most are aquatic and autotrophic and lack many of the distinct cell and tissue types, such as stomata, xylem, and phloem, which are found in land plants.

Zhengde's top advisors made every attempt to dissuade him from inviting this lama to court, arguing that Tibetan Buddhism was wildly heterodox and unorthodox. Despite protests by the Grand Secretary Liang Chu, in 1515 the Zhengde Emperor sent his eunuch official Liu Yun of the Palace Chancellery on a mission to invite this Karmapa to Beijing. Liu commanded a fleet of hundreds of ships requisitioned along the Yangtze, consuming 2,835 g (100 oz) of silver a day in food expenses while stationed for a year in Chengdu of Sichuan. After procurring necessary gifts for the mission, he departed with a cavalry force of about 1,000 troops. When the request was delivered, the Karmapa lama refused to leave Tibet despite the Ming force brought to coerce him. The Karmapa launched a surprise ambush on Liu Yun's camp, seizing all the goods and valuables while killing or wounding half of Liu Yun's entire escort.

Question: suppose the entire planet has heated up happens, how will it affect LESS sediment being transported. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","response":"B: less Step 1: Understand the process of sediment transport The sediment transport process involves erosion of soil, transportation of sediment through rivers, and deposition in lakes, oceans, and other water bodies. Convection currents play a significant role in moving sediment around the world. Step 2: Consider the effect of global heating on sediment transport When the entire planet heats up, it leads to various changes in the environment. These changes include increased evaporation, changes in precipitation patterns, and potential alterations in convection currents. Step 3: Analyze effects on sediment transport Increased evaporation may lead to decreased river flow, as water levels in rivers and other water bodies decline. This reduced flow means less sediment would be carried downstream to be deposited. Additionally, altered precipitation patterns could further reduce river flows and disrupt the sediment transport process. Changes in convection currents could limit the distribution of sediment, as well. Step 4: Conclude about the sediment transport Based on the potential effects of global heating, it's likely that less sediment would be transported.

I ordered a beer instead of a martini because I do not like hard liquor, so the","response":"best alternative for me was a refreshing beer with a lower alcohol content, allowing me to enjoy my drink at a slower pace and socialize with my friends without feeling the need to down it in one gulp. Furthermore, beers typically come in a wider variety of styles and flavors, such as crisp lagers, rich stouts, and fruity ales, providing me with a multitude of options that I can choose from based on my mood, the occasion, or the local specialties available. Another factor that influenced my decision was the food pairing aspect. Beers tend to pair better with a range of dishes, complementing a diverse selection of cuisines and enhancing the flavors rather than overpowering them as a martini might. For instance, a hoppy IPA may accentuate the spice in a bowl of chili, whereas a light Pilsner could contrast nicely with a slice of pizza, or an amber ale might bring out the rich umami notes in a burger. On the other hand, martinis have more limited pairings, typically best suited to light appetizers like olives and smoked salmon. Additionally, beer can be a more economical choice compared to martinis, especially when considering that craft beers offer an exciting array of complex flavors and aromas, often at a fraction of the price of a cocktail. Moreover, beer has a less aggressive alcohol content meaning I can consume more of it responsibly throughout an entire evening, which can be a more budget-friendly option when out with friends or during happy hour. Drinking beer also gives me the opportunity to support and explore the local brewing scene. Many cities and towns boast an array of microbreweries, offering unique and innovative brews that reflect the character of the region. By opting for a beer rather than a martini, I can indulge in an authentic drinking experience and engage in conversation about the local brews with my friends and fellow patrons, thereby creating a stronger sense of camaraderie and shared enjoyment. Finally, opting for a beer can make for a more relaxed and less formal social atmosphere. While martinis often evoke images of elegance and sophistication, they can sometimes create an air of pretension or exclusivity. Beer, on the other hand, is versatile and unpretentious, conveying a spirit of conviviality and inclusivity that suits my preference for a laid-back and friendly setting. In conclusion, I ordered a beer instead of a martini because I do not like hard liquor, and the beer provided me with a more approachable and enjoyable drinking experience, better food pairings, an economical choice, a way to connect with the local brewing community, and a convivial ambiance that aligns with my preference for a relaxed and inclusive social atmosphere."},{"question":"What is the title of this article: Exclusive Jurisdiction is a concept whereby only one Grand Lodge will be recognised in any geographical area.

With the convincing victory, Tampa Bay clinched the NFC South division title, maintained a perfect 5-0 division record, and scored their first kickoff return touchdown in franchise history. Tampa Bay's defense recorded the first points of the game, as Ronde Barber intercepted Chris Redman's pass on the third play of the game and returned it 29 yards for a touchdown. Atlanta got on the board next with kicker Morten Andersen making a 33-yard field goal. On the ensuing kickoff, Micheal Spurlock made team history by becoming the first Buccaneer player to return a kickoff for a touchdown. It was the first kickoff return touchdown for Tampa Bay in 32 seasons, 498 games, and 1,865 attempts. After the Buccaneer defense forced a Falcons punt, Jeff Garcia commandeered a long, clock-eating 10-minute drive ending in a 33-yard field goal by Matt Bryant to make the score 17-3. With just over five minutes remaining in the first half, Tampa bay recovered an Atlanta fumble, and Earnest Graham scored a 1-yard TD run. Graham became the first player in club history to score a touchdown in six consecutive games. With a 24-3 lead, Tampa Bay performed a pooch kickoff, and Atlanta muffed the return, while Kalvin Pearson recovered. Tampa Bay drove to the 24-yard line, but DeAngelo Hall intercepted a pass intended for Joey Galloway at the Atlanta 11-yard line. The Buccaneers would immediately regain possession as Greg White forced and recovered a fumble on the next play. Matt Bryant then easily converted a 28-yard field goal to take a 27-3 lead into halftime. Tampa Bay would receive the second half's opening kickoff, but was forced to punt after a 7-minute drive. On Atlanta's third play, Jermaine Phillips intercepted a pass intended for Jerious Norwood which set Tampa Bay up at the Atlanta 23-yard line. Matt Bryant then scored the half's first points with a 34-yard field goal to make the score 30-3. In the fourth quarter, punter Josh Bidwell successfully pinned Atlanta at their own 6-yard line. The resulting poor field position eventually led to Tampa Bay taking over near midfieldied Michael Bennett carried six times all the way to the Atlanta 1-yard line, from which Anthony Becht scored the game's final points off a 1-yard TD catch.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Let's Go to Prison Context: John Lyshitski (Dax Shepard) has spent most of his life being a slimeball, thanks to Judge Nelson Biederman III, who has been giving him hard sentences ever since he stole a car at the age of eight. Now he wants revenge, but finds that the judge died an all too peaceful death three days previous to Johns release from prison.He turns his attention to Nelson Biederman IIIs obnoxious son, Nelson Biederman IV (Will Arnett). At a dedication ceremony for Nelson III, John hops into Nelson's BMW, steals his change, spits in his coffee and uses up his inhaler. In the BMW after the ceremony, Nelson IV yells at his attorney (who has the speakerphone on in the fully occupied board room), starts to sing, and when he goes for the inhaler, finds it empty. He stops at a pharmacy, panicked, and starts knocking items off the shelf in an attempt to find a replacement inhaler. The pharmacy owners think he's another junkie robber, and that the inhaler he finally finds is a tiny pistol, and call the police. Nelson ends up convicted on that robbery and demands that the Biederman foundation call the governor to dismiss his charges. Even though the governor owes the foundation a favor, the board of directors decide to let Nelson go to prison as they have grown tired of his asinine deportment. John is not satisfied with Nelson just going to prison, however, so John decides to join him in prison by selling marijuana to undercover police officers. At his sentencing he pleads guilty to the same judge Nelson IV had, and asks for the same sentence (3-5) at the same prison. After negotiating with the judge and bribing a few guards, he ends up as Nelsons cellmate, and here he pretends to be his friend, all in an attempt to give him the wrong advice on surviving life in prison.Somehow, Nelson gets himself out of a numerous array of jams, even discovering that he's gay and meeting the love of his life, gang leader Barry (Chi McBride), a hulking, burly gay caballero with the heart of a dashing romantic hero beating within his massive, hairy...

Call her R. R was from an Eastern European country. We chit-chatted a lot, while she was taking my blood pressure readings and stuff. Lots of fun stories! But she relayed to me one of her first U.S. memories: She wanted to lose weight. She was impressed by some things the U.S. had to offer - \\"you have actual nutritional information on everything!\\" - and thus figured everything she encountered was on the level. And she found a \\"miracle cure\\" company who was along those lines! \\"These are AWESOME miracle shoe inserts! Wear them, and the pounds will melt away!\\" She saved her pennies and dimes; she sprung for the inserts. She received them... and they were shoe inserts; that much was true. But then there was their documentation: \\"using these insoles, combined with a 1200 calorie-per-day diet....\\" Like a 1200-calorie diet won't likely involve weight-loss, no matter what else you did, shoe inserts aside. The inserts did nothing, obviously. It was a sham. At which point she knew she was snookered, but really had no recourse.

I’ve been trying out two new ones to see which I prefer. In the red corner we have MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil and in the blue corner we have NARS Velvet Matte Lip Pencil. So let’s get ready to rumble while I put them through their paces…. Although the packaging of these two is quite similar the formulation and finish of the lip colours are very different – MAC Patent Polish is a light gloss and NARS Velvet Matte has a stark matte finish. So whether you prefer your lips sheer and glossy or pigmented and matte there should be something for everyone here. MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil – this is the first lip pencil that I’ve tried from MAC (apart from lip liner) and I’m really impressed with it. As the name suggests the finish is a very shiny gloss that gives an almost patent shine, it has the feel of a lip gloss but it’s not sticky. The colour is called Spontaneous, MAC describe it as a ‘soft plum with pearl’. It’s definitely a plummy shade, although I can’t really detect any pearl in there. It looks quite dark as a crayon but as it’s very sheer it appears much more natural once it’s on the lips. It’s a great way to introduce darker lip colours to your make-up bag if you’re not used to them. MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil is a bit like a fabulous giant tinted lip balm! The crayon itself is chunky and easy to hold, the nib is quite chunky and not great for precision application, but you could use a lip brush to apply it. I love to apply MAC Patent Polish straight from the crayon, it’s quick and easy, and as it’s very light and sheer it’s easy to wipe away any mistakes and re-apply. Question: What is probably true about the author? === The answer to the above question is A:","response":"The author is likely someone who is interested in and has experience with different makeup products, specifically lip pencils and crayons.

You step into a cave . But instead of the dog, you find beautiful cave paintings. You see paintings of horses, deer, and bison that are drawn in black, brown, red and yellow. Your first question would probably be \\"Who did this?\\" This is what happened to four French boys in 1940. They found the Lascaux caves. The paintings the boys discovered in those caves are 17,000 years old. They were drawn by the ancient people called Cro-Magnons. Cro-Magnons looked much like people of today. They used tools, such as fishing nets. But their art was extremely good. The main cave at Lascaux is called the Great Hall of Bulls, which has a picture of bulls and horses in many colors. The largest animal is 18 feet long. There are smaller animals, such as bison, stags and a bear. There is also a strange spotted two-horned animal. To the left of the main cave are the most famous paintings that are the drawings of multicolored animals. One painting is called Little Horses. On the ceiling are horses and cows. The most unusual sight may be in the Shaft of the Dead Man where there is a thinoceros , a carefully drawn dead man, a wounded bison and a bird. Why did Cro-Magnon artists do these beautiful drawings on cave walls? Did the drawings call upon some magical power? Did the Cro-Magnon people hope that the drawings would bring good luck?

Given the equation -3449*w + 102 = -3415*w, you will first add 3449w to both sides of the equation to eliminate it on the left side. This gives you: 102 = -3415w + 3449w Which simplifies to: 102 = 34w Then, to solve for w, you would divide both sides of the equation by 34: 102 / 34 = w This simplifies to: w = 3 Therefore, for the given problem, the solution is w = 3."},{"question":"Given the question: I have a new situation: Two roommates, Karen and Kelly, have decided to adopt a pet for their apartment.

Does it follow that \\"The made a deafening sound, and he clutched his ears.\\"?","response":"While the original sentence describes a highly intense and chaotic scene, it is not a direct implication that \\"The made a deafening sound, and he clutched his ears.\\" However, we can infer that the situation may indeed cause some level of discomfort or even potential harm to the person experiencing it. Breaking down the original sentence, \\"Its hissing against the ground was a tumult in his ears,\\" suggests that the sound was incredibly loud and chaotic. The use of the word \\"tumult\\" implies a great commotion or disturbance. From this description, we can assume that the person hearing this intense hissing noise is likely experiencing some level of distress. The sentence continues with \\"superheated ash and debris began to fall.\\" This element adds to the dangerous and unstable environment, implying that physical harm may also be a possibility. Taking into account these two aspects of the situation, it is reasonably justifiable that the character might clutch their ears in response to the deafening noise. While the original sentence does not specifically state this action or the intensity of the sound as \\"deafening,\\" we can infer that the character could react in such a manner due to the overwhelming and perilous nature of the scene. However, it is also essential to keep the original context in mind and avoid making unwarranted assumptions. The second sentence, \\"The made a deafening sound, and he clutched his ears,\\" could be an acceptable development of the scene as long as it is consistent with the characters' established traits and the story's tone or narrative style."},{"question":"Sentence 1: One of the main features of Open VOGEL is that it provides built-in tools to facilitate the creation of geometrical models .

Donald Trump triumphantly greeted the three Americans released by North Korea in the early morning darkness at Joint Base Andrews outside Washington early Thursday, an image one can expect to see over and over again come the 2020 U.S. presidential election campaign. “It was a very important thing to all of us to be able to get these three great people out,” Trump told reporters on the tarmac. He then went on to speculate that live television coverage of the arrival “probably broke the all-time in history television rating for 3 o’clock in the morning.” It was a moment the president gladly seized given that his White House has been buffeted by a chaotic mix of policy and personal drama in recent days. The prospect of a potentially historic breakthrough on North Korea could move a number of other unwelcome distractions to the side, including the ongoing Russia investigation, the growing legal difficulties for Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, and the soap opera that the Stormy Daniels story has become. Daniels is the adult film actress who claims she once had an affair with Trump. He denies the claim. Trump also announced Thursday on Twitter that he will meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on June 12 in Singapore. A new CNN poll found that 77 percent of those surveyed support Trump meeting the North Korean leader, and 53 percent approve of his handling of the North Korea issue generally. Those numbers are in keeping with a general trend of late that has seen the president’s poll ratings improving, perhaps in part because of the strong economy.

The two worlds of the chemist are the macroscopic world and the microscopic world. Macroscopic refers to substances and objects that can be seen, touched, and measured directly. Microscopic refers to the small particles that make up all matter. Chemists must observe matter and do experiments macroscopically and then make generalizations and propose explanations that are microscopic in nature. For example, anyone can observe the physical change in appearance that occurs as an iron object such as a tractor that is left out in the elements gradually turns to rust. However, a chemist looks at the rusting tractor and thinks about what is going on with the individual atoms that make up the iron and how they are changing as a result of exposure to oxygen in the air and water from rain. Throughout your study of chemistry, you will often switch back and forth between the macroscopic and microscopic worlds. Two cousins went to college to get a B.S. Greg studied Biology, and his younger cousin Dawn decided to study chemistry. They both graduated Summa Cum Laudae. Which cousin studied less about the small particles that make up all matter? The answer to this question is:","response":"Dawn, who studied chemistry, focused more on the small particles that make up all matter as compared to Greg, who studied Biology. Chemistry as a subject deals with the composition, structure, properties, and transformations of elements and compounds, which includes understanding and investigating atomic and molecular interactions. Chemists analyze and manipulate matter on a microscopic level, focusing on the behavior of atoms, molecules, ions, and other components that make up all matter. On the other hand, Biology is the study of living organisms, their structure, function, growth, origin, evolution, and distribution. While biology does involve the understanding of the basic building blocks of life, such as cells, it generally focuses more on the complex systems and processes within and between living organisms. As a biologist, Greg would have delved into the intricate mechanisms, interactions, and relationships among living organisms, including topics such as genetics, physiology, ecology, and evolution. Both subjects do deal with small particles to some extent – for example, in biology, one should understand cellular structures, proteins, and DNA molecules – but chemistry specifically emphasizes the study of the small particles that make up all matter. Therefore, Dawn, who studied chemistry, studied more about these small particles compared to Greg, who pursued biology."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

Also, throwing away accessories and shirts just because you have a rainbow sun hat doesn't seem rational. 2) \\"Try sorting them inside your dresser and heading to the clothes section\\" is not entirely logical as the previous step was about purging damaged items from the closet, not about re-organizing them in another place. 3) \\"Different size, usually, to fit body's shape\\" seems out of context as this does not provide a step forward in the process of creating the perfect wardrobe. It's more like an advice rather than a subsequent step. 4) \\"Try on everything that's left\\" is the most logical because after sorting out and removing damaged or unwanted items, the remaining clothes should be tried on one by one to ensure they fit properly and look great.

So much for expectations: She became a nationally ranked rower with a 4.0 GPA at the University of Virginia. And now, at the age of 32, she heads up a San Francisco-based recruiting technology company, 1-Page, that last month went public—not on the NASDAQ, but instead on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX). It was the first Silicon Valley company to list on the nascent exchange. Weidenmiller made the move, she says, instead of taking more VC money. The Australian Stock Exchange has easier listing requirements than the NASDAQ. And although the method was unorthodox (the company used a reverse merger with a defunct mining company called InterMet Resources, which allowed it to take over its ticker symbol), the end result is that the company has a market cap of over 100 million. What’s more, the founders–Weidenmiller and her father, who wrote the 1-Page recruiting concept that the company is built on—avoided further dilution from venture capitalists. “You have to take so much funding from VCs,” she says, and then if you go public, many of the VCs have to exit the day their restriction period is up. “So instead, I have investors.” A conversation with Weidenmiller makes it clear that she’s not one to follow the traditional path—not only from a corporate perspective, but also when it comes to women’s issues, which are close to her heart. An outspoken supporter of women in the technology space, she isn’t afraid to say that quotas and regulations may be what’s necessary to get women to equal levels within the sector, much as Title IX allowed her to receive a full scholarship to college. “Why not say 10% of a fund has to go to women-led companies? You’d start seeing huge competition,” she says. The fact that the VC industry is so male-89% of partners –doesn’t help, Wiedenmiller says, noting a Stanford study saying that in 2013 women entrepreneurs received only 4.2% of VC funding. “I heard 99 nos,” she says—which, of course, is typical for many a founder—before she gained investors such as Blumberg Capital and TMT Investments (she bought them out after the IPO). And yet, she says, women-owned businesses are a better bet, citing research from Indiegogo that women are 61% more likely than men to achieve their financial goals on the site. Put another, typically Weidenmillerian way: “Women are incredible, and men are scared shitless,” she says. “It’s so true. I won the biological lottery. I would be freaked out if I were a man.” Write a one or two sentence summary.","response":"Joanna Weidenmiller successfully turned 1-Page, a recruiting technology company, into a 100 million business by taking an unconventional approach and listing on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) through a reverse merger, avoiding further dilution from venture capitalists.

Mary Ochsenhirt Amdur studied the effects of which historic air inversion that killed 20 people? A:","response":"Mary Ochsenhirt Amdur, an American scientist well known for her research in the fields of environmental health and toxicology, conducted significant studies on the effects of air pollution following a historic air inversion event that occurred in Donora, Pennsylvania. This event, known as the Donora Smog, took place in late October 1948, and resulted in the deaths of 20 people while causing serious respiratory issues and other health problems for thousands of residents in the affected area. The Donora Smog event happened during a period of stable atmospheric conditions, trapping polluted air close to the ground level. The area was home to several industrial facilities, including a steel mill and a zinc plant, which emitted high levels of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and other particulate matter. These pollutants were confined by the air inversion and accumulated over time. This led to the formation of a thick smog, which engulfed the town for several days, reducing visibility and dramatically affecting the air quality. Due to the lack of environmental regulations at the time, there wasn't any significant effort made to control the emissions. Mary Amdur researched the health effects of this catastrophic incident and concluded that the toxic combination of pollutants in the air during the event caused severe health problems. Her work focused on the exposure to sulfuric acid mists resulting from the sulfur dioxide reaction with the water particles in the atmosphere, leading to acid precipitation. She also emphasized that continuous exposure to low levels of air pollutants could cause long-term health complications and stressed the importance of adopting stricter air pollution regulations and air quality standards. In the aftermath of the Donora Smog tragedy, Amdur's research played a crucial role in shaping environmental policies in the United States. Her findings contributed to the development of the Clean Air Act, which was first enacted in 1963 and later went through significant amendments in 1970 and 1990, to establish more stringent air quality standards. Furthermore, Mary Amdur's contributions to the field of environmental health acted as a foundation for future research and greatly assisted in raising awareness about the harmful effects of air pollution on human health."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Given the following context: Fowzi Nejad was the only gunman to survive the SAS assault. After being identified, he was dragged away by an SAS trooper, who allegedly intended to take him back into the building and shoot him. The soldier reportedly changed his mind when it was pointed out to him that the raid was being broadcast on live television. It later emerged that the footage from the back of the embassy was coming from a wireless camera placed in the window of a flat overlooking the embassy. The camera had been installed by ITN technicians, who had posed as guests of a local resident in order to get past the police cordon, which had been in place since the beginning of the siege. Nejad was arrested, and was eventually tried, convicted, and sentenced to life imprisonment for his role in the siege. He became eligible for parole in 2005. As a foreign national, he would normally have been immediately deported to his home country but Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, incorporated into British law by the Human Rights Act 1998, has been held by the European Court of Human Rights to prohibit deportation in cases where the person concerned would be likely to be tortured or executed in his home country. Nejad was eventually paroled in 2008 and granted leave to remain in the UK, but was not given political asylum. The Home Office released a statement, saying \\"We do not give refugee status to convicted terrorists. Our aim is to deport people as quickly as possible but the law requires us to first obtain assurances that the person being returned will not face certain death\\". After 27 years in prison, Nejad was deemed no longer to be a threat to society, but Trevor Lock wrote to the Home Office to oppose his release. Because it is accepted by the British government that he would be executed or tortured, he cannot be deported to Iran under the Human Rights Act 1998. He now lives in Peckham, south London, having assumed another identity. answer the following question: What was the soldier going to do to Nejad before he changed his mind?

Ortega testified that he was called to a meeting with AEG Live CEO Randy Phillips,","response":"Dr. Conrad Murray, and Michael's manager at his rented Beverly Hills estate in the weeks leading up to his death. There, they discussed the increasing concerns about Jackson's health and the needed steps to help him recover. \\"It struck me as strange and I was deeply concerned for Michael,\\" Ortega revealed, adding that Jackson appeared frail and exhausted during rehearsals. During the meeting, Ortega expressed his concerns about Jackson's well-being and urged that they seek immediate medical attention for the troubled star. However, he claimed that Phillips and Dr. Conrad Murray seemed more focused on the financial implications of postponing or canceling the tour, and that Jackson's health was secondary to them. As the days went by, Ortega noticed that Jackson's condition appeared to be deteriorating, and he became increasingly worried. He kept reaching out to AEG Live executives in a series of e-mails, pleading for them to intervene and get help for Jackson. \\"If he continues to decline, we might have to make the hard decision to postpone the tour,\\" Ortega wrote in one e-mail. Yet, he stated in his testimony that he received only generic responses, which failed to provide any solid solutions. The wrongful death trial of AEG Live unfolded as Jackson's family accused the entertainment giant of negligence in their hiring and supervision of Dr. Conrad Murray. The family claimed that AEG Live was aware of Jackson's fragile state and should have done more to protect his health. They sought billions of dollars in damages for the loss of their loved one. In a dramatic turn of events, the jury found AEG Live not liable for Michael Jackson's death. They determined that while AEG did hire Dr. Conrad Murray, the company was not responsible for the pop star's untimely demise. The 12-person jury concluded that, despite any concerns, Dr. Conrad Murray was competent to serve as Jackson's physician in the months leading up to his death. The verdict was met with mixed emotions from those involved in the trial, as well as Jackson's fans worldwide. While some believed that justice had been served, others expressed disappointment and believed that AEG Live should have been held responsible for Jackson's death. As for Kenny Ortega, he continued to feel the weight of that fateful period leading to Michael Jackson's tragic passing. He remains haunted by the lost opportunity to save an icon, and the sorrow of witnessing his friend's final days. Despite the controversies surrounding his death, Michael Jackson's enduring legacy as a groundbreaking artist and performer lives on. His music and impact on the pop culture landscape continue to inspire new generations, ensuring that the King of Pop will never be forgotten."},{"question":"What concepts are described in the following sentence? \\"The Golden Curry has Japanese food and has a high rating.

He is an assistant manager to David Moyes at West Ham United. Pearce was the manager of the England national under-21 team from 2007 to 2013 and also managed the Great Britain Olympic football team at the 2012 Olympics. As a player, Pearce played as a defender and appeared for Wealdstone, Coventry City, Newcastle United, West Ham United and Manchester City, but is best known for his spell at Nottingham Forest, where he regularly captained the team and became the club's most capped International, making 76 of his 78 appearances for England while with the club and captaining the national side on nine occasions. Pearce joined Newcastle United along with fellow veterans John Barnes and Ian Rush in the 1997-98 season under Kenny Dalglish, and played in the 1998 FA Cup final, though again he emerged on the defeated side. He scored once during his spell at Newcastle, in a UEFA Champions League tie against Dynamo Kyiv. Eventually Pearce was isolated, along with other players including Rob Lee and John Barnes, upon Dalglish's sacking after Ruud Gullit took over. A number of players were treated coldly by Gullit, and Pearce along with Barnes and Lee were made to train with the reserves despite cumulatively having over 150 England caps between them. Both Pearce and Barnes assert in their autobiographies Gullit felt threatened by the senior players in the squad, and they felt they were being sidelined to prevent them challenging him for the manager's position should it arise. Pearce claims also that he once kicked Gullit up in the air during a training session, and a number of other players sniggered at this due to Gullit's poor relationship with them. Pearce went on to play for West Ham United, a year after falling out of favour with Newcastle manager Ruud Gullit. He made his debut on 7 August 1999 in a 1-0 home win against Tottenham Hotspur. His first goal came on 21 October 2000 in a 2-1 home defeat to Arsenal. He made 50 appearances in all competitions, scoring three goals and in 2001 he was named Hammer of the Year. In the summer of 2001, he was Kevin Keegan's first signing for Manchester City for what would be the final season in his career. He captained the club to the First Division championship and scored direct from a free-kick on his debut, against Watford. In the final game of his career, against Portsmouth, he had the aim to reach 100 career goals. He took a penalty kick for City four minutes into injury time, but missed it along with the chance to reach his target. Throughout his career, Pearce was given the nickname of \\"Psycho\\" for his unforgiving style of play. This was initially a tag afforded to him only by Forest fans, though later it was adopted by England supporters as well. Former England teammate Matthew Le Tissier has since described him as his scariest opponent in his book, Taking Le Tiss. Former Nottingham Forest teammate Roy Keane said Pearce was a \\"man amongst boys\\" at Forest. In recognition of his talents and his support for various charities, he was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II in January 1999. When was the later career of Stuart?","response":"Stuart Pearce's later career can be looked at in two parts: his last playing years and his management career. In his last playing years, Stuart Pearce joined Newcastle United in the 1997-98 season. Here, he played in the FA Cup final in 1998. After a period of turbulence in the club, Pearce moved to West Ham United in 1999. He played his first game for West Ham United on August 7, 1999 and scored his first goal for them on October 21, 2000. Then, in the summer of 2001, he moved to Manchester City. This was his last season as a player before he retired. After retiring, Pearce moved into management. He was the manager of the England national under-21 team from 2007 to 2013.

It was the first time that Easter Islanders had met people from the outside world. The strangers were about to discover something very strange themselves --that they were on an island with hundreds of huge stone statues . The Dutch explorers wondered where the Islanders had come from and why and how they had built the statues. Now science is putting together the story. The first people to arrive on the island came there around A.D. 700. The society that developed there was based on fishing and farming to feed the population, which grew to 12,000. Its success showed itself in a way that has become the island's trademark : hundreds of huge stone figures --the moai. None of the moai was standing when scientists first arrived. People put them back up later; but how had a Stone Age society ever made, moved and set them up there in the first place? And why? There are nearly 900 moai on Easter Island, and while the questions about them remain unanswered, no one doubts the years of effort that must have gone into making them. The real killer of the Easter Islanders came from across the ocean. After 1722, it became popular for explorers to visit Easter Island, bringing diseases. The final blow came in 1862, when slave traders came from Peru and took away 1,500 people, one-third of the population. Question: Before the Dutch explorers arrived on Easter Island, _ .

The Adriatic is the northernmost arm of the Mediterranean Sea, extending from the Strait of Otranto (where it connects to the Ionian Sea) to the northwest and the Po Valley. The countries with coasts on the Adriatic are Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Greece, Italy, Montenegro and Slovenia. The Adriatic contains over 1,300 islands, mostly located along its eastern, Croatian, coast. It is divided into three basins, the northern being the shallowest and the southern being the deepest, with a maximum depth of . The Otranto Sill, an underwater ridge, is located at the border between the Adriatic and Ionian Seas.

Tidal movements in the Adriatic are slight, although larger amplitudes are known to occur occasionally. The Adriatic's salinity is lower than the Mediterranean's because the Adriatic collects a third of the fresh water flowing into the Mediterranean, acting as a dilution basin. The surface water temperatures generally range from in summer to in winter, significantly moderating the Adriatic Basin's climate. - Trogir (Ancient Greek: , \\"Tragyrion\\" or , \\"Tragourion\\" \\"Trogkir\\") is a historic town and harbour on the Adriatic coast in Split-Dalmatia County, Croatia, with a population of 10,818 (2011) and a total municipality population of 13,260 (2011).

Scholars debate the scope of the word \\"castle\\", but usually consider it to be the private fortified residence of a lord or noble. This is distinct from a palace, which is not fortified; from a fortress, which was not always a residence for nobility; and from a fortified settlement, which was a public defence though there are many similarities among these types of construction. Usage of the term has varied over time and has been applied to structures as diverse as hill forts and country houses. Over the approximately 900 years that castles were built, they took on a great many forms with many different features, although some, such as curtain walls and arrowslits, were commonplace. - Kamerlengo ( Gradina Kamerlengo ) is a castle and fortress in Trogir , Croatia . It was built by the Republic of Venice The castle was built in the mid- 15th century by Marin Radoj as part of an expansion of the Veriga Tower , built on the site in the late 14th century .

Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state. - The Middle East is a transcontinental region centered on Western Asia and Egypt. The corresponding adjective is \\"Middle-Eastern\\" and the derived noun is \\"Middle-Easterner\\". The term has come into wider usage as a replacement of the term Near East (as opposed to Far East) beginning in the early 20th century. - Venice (; ) is a city in northeastern Italy and the capital of the Veneto region. It is situated across a group of 117 small islands that are separated by canals and linked by bridges. These are located in the shallow Venetian Lagoon, an enclosed bay that lies between the mouths of the Po and the Piave Rivers. Parts of Venice are renowned for the beauty of their settings, their architecture, and artwork. The lagoon and a part of the city are listed as a World Heritage Site. - Croats are a nation and South Slavic ethnic group at the crossroads of Central Europe, Southeast Europe, and the Mediterranean Sea. Croats mainly live in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, but are an officially recognized minority in Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Italy, Montenegro, Romania, Serbia, and Slovakia. Responding to political, social and economic pressure, many Croats have migrated throughout Europe (especially Germany, Austria, Switzerland, France and Italy) and the Americas (particularly the United States, Canada, Argentina, and Chile), establishing a diaspora. - A palace is a grand residence, especially a royal residence, or the home of a head of state or some other high-ranking dignitary, such as a bishop or archbishop. - The Republic of Venice, or traditionally known as the Most Serene Republic of Venice, was a state originating from the lagoon communities in the area of Venice, now northeastern Italy. It existed from the late seventh century AD until 1797. Although it had a long history of war and conquest, the republic's modern reputation is chiefly based on its status as an economic and trading power. - An arrowslit (often also referred to as an arrow loop, loophole or loop hole, and sometimes a balistraria) is a thin vertical aperture in a fortification through which an archer can launch arrows. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - Croatia, officially the Republic of Croatia, is a sovereign state between Central Europe, Southeast Europe, and the Mediterranean. Its capital city is Zagreb, which forms one of the country's primary subdivisions, along with its twenty counties. Croatia covers and has diverse, mostly continental and Mediterranean climates. Croatia's Adriatic Sea coast contains more than a thousand islands. The country's population is 4.28 million, most of whom are Croats, with the most common religious denomination being Roman Catholicism. - A mediterranean climate or dry summer climate is the climate typical of the lands in the Mediterranean Basin. The lands around the Mediterranean Sea form the largest area where this climate type is found, but it also is found in most of coastal California, in parts of Western and South Australia, in southwestern South Africa, sections of Central Asia, and in central Chile. - Split-Dalmatia County is the central-southern Dalmatian county in Croatia. The administrative center is Split. The population of the county is 455,242 (2011). The land area is 4540 km. - Most Serene Republic (\\"Serenissima Respublica\\" in Latin) is a title attached to a number of European states through history. By custom, the appellation \\"Most Serene\\" is an indicator of sovereignty (see also Serene Highness or Most Serene Highness for a sovereign prince); consequently \\"Most Serene Republic\\" emphasizes the sovereignty of the republic. - \\"Country House\\" is a song by English alternative rock band Blur. It was released as the lead single from the band's fourth album \\"The Great Escape\\" on 14 August 1995. \\"Country House\\" was the first of two Blur singles to reach number one on the UK Singles Chart (the second being 1997's \\"Beetlebum\\"). - Zagreb is the capital and the largest city of Croatia. It is located in the northwest of the country, along the Sava river, at the southern slopes of the Medvednica mountain. Zagreb lies at an elevation of approximately above sea level. In the last official census of 2011 the population of the City of Zagreb was 792,875. The wider Zagreb metropolitan area includes the City of Zagreb and the separate Zagreb County bringing the total metropolitan area population up to 1,237,887.

I am definitely the hoarder in our house. My husband could live out of two bags, use about five kitchen items each year, and doesn’t gather anything for future use or hang on to much for sentimental value. (Which probably means the items he has hung on to mean a whole lot more!) I am always tucking something away here or stashing materials there…all in preparation for “some day.” It’s also part of the teacher in me. Do you know many teachers that don’t have a ton of stuff or utilize every bit of storage available? But, over the last several years, I’ve been fairly good about going through things every six months and weeding out a little here and a little there. Today I’ll be sharing six simple ways to declutter your home and why you should! GIVE THINGS AWAY It’s nice to make money, but sometimes you come across something that you really think someone else could use and you don’t want to throw it away. If it’s the perfect fit for that person, they may adopt the item and add their own wear and tear! Anyone that’s had children knows that kids go through things so fast and it’s nice to save a little money by taking hand-me-downs from a friend or relative. If the receiver decides they don’t want the item, let it be. They’ll either get rid of it on their own or decline the offer. If they choose the latter, maybe the rest of this list will help. PACK If you know you don’t want to purge an item from your house AND you know that you will use it in the future, but it’s not an everyday use item, pack it up. We have several containers of things in our garage that are full of items we use once or twice each year. I have added close to 100 boxes of things to simply declutter our home while it’s on the market. I took a look at everything and kept the essentials (well, maybe even more than the essentials), and packed up the rest. What effect does the author probably believe that decluttering the house will have on it's market value? A. that it will improve the market value B. that it will have no impact C. the author has not given thought to market value D. not enough information Answer:","response":"A. that it will improve the market value"},{"question":"Data: name = The Wrestlers, food = Indian, priceRange = more than £30, customer rating = high.

KSM's original concept of using one of the hijacked planes to make a media statement was scrapped, but Bin Laden considered the basic idea feasible. Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM developed an initial list of targets. These included the White House, the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, and the World Trade Center. According to KSM, Bin Laden wanted to destroy the White House and the Pentagon, KSM wanted to strike the World Trade Center, and all of them wanted to hit the Capitol. No one else was involved in the initial selection of targets. Bin Laden also soon selected four individuals to serve as suicide operatives: Khalid al Mihdhar, Nawaf al Hazmi, Khallad, and Abu Bara al Yemeni. During the al Matar meetings, Bin Laden told KSM that Mihdhar and Hazmi were so eager to participate in an operation against the United States that they had already obtained U.S. visas. KSM states that they had done so on their own after the suicide of their friend Azzam (Nashiri's cousin) in carrying out the Nairobi bombing. KSM had not met them. His only guidance from Bin Laden was that the two should eventually go to the United States for pilot training. Hazmi and Mihdhar were Saudi nationals, born in Mecca. Like the others in this initial group of selectees, they were already experienced mujahideen. They had traveled together to fight in Bosnia in a group that journeyed to the Balkans in 1995. By the time Hazmi and Mihdhar were assigned to the planes operation in early 1999, they had visited Afghanistan on several occasions. Khallad was another veteran mujahid, like much of his family. His father had been expelled from Yemen because of his extremist views. Khallad had grown up in Saudi Arabia, where his father knew Bin Laden, Abdullah Azzam, and Omar Abdel Rahman (the \\"Blind Sheikh\\"). Question: \\"What other building was on the list of targets besides the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, and the World Trade Center?\\" Response: \\"Empire State Building\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","response":"No, the response does not correctly answer the question. The original list of targets mentioned in the text includes the White House, the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, and the World Trade Center. The Empire State Building is not mentioned as one of the targets."},{"question":"What is the solution to this math problem? Solve 0 = 3*a + 8*a - 2*a for a.","response":"The given mathematical equation is 0 = 3*a + 8*a - 2*a. The first step is to simplify the equation. To do this, we need to add and subtract like terms, in this case, the \\"a\\" terms. When we add 3*a, 8*a, and -2*a together, we get 0 = 9a (3 + 8 - 2 = 9, and each of these coefficients is multiplied by 'a'). The simplified equation is 0 = 9a. Next, we need to solve this equation for \\"a\\". We can do this by isolating \\"a\\" on one side of the equation. Since the equation is currently in the form of 0 = 9a, we can isolate 'a' by dividing both sides of the equation by 9. 0/9 = 9a/9. 0 = a. So, the solution for the equation 0 = 3*a + 8*a - 2*a is a = 0. Remember, zero divided by any number gives zero, and this is why no matter what number you choose for 'a' (in this case 0), the sum of the equation will be zero (since everything is multiplied by 'a'). If you test the solution by plugging a = 0 back into the original equation, it should hold true: 0 = 3*(0) + 8*(0) - 2*(0), 0 = 0 + 0 - 0, 0 = 0. which proves that the solution (a = 0) is correct."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Process: - A hurricane usually starts as an organized thunderstorm activity that stretches at least 100 miles across and maintains its identity for more than 24 hours - Under the right conditions it can develop further and start to spin around a low-pressure center - If it develops it&#x27;s classified as a &#x27;tropical cyclone&#x27; or &#x27;tropical depression&#x27; - If the system strengthens and wind speeds rise past 39 mph, the system is dubbed a &#x27;tropical storm&#x27; - If the pressure in the center drops even further and the winds really pick up and forms a clearly defined &#x27;eye&#x27; it&#x27;s a hurricane - Question: suppose a tropical storm develops further happens, how will it affect MORE POWERFUL hurricanes. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","response":"C: no effect"},{"question":"Here is a question about this article: On May 16, rescue groups from South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Russia and Taiwan arrived to join the rescue effort.

Originally containing digitized back issues of academic journals, it now also includes books and primary sources, and current issues of journals. It provides full-text searches of almost 2,000 journals. As of 2013, more than 8,000 institutions in more than 160 countries had access to JSTOR; most access is by subscription, but some older public domain content is freely available to anyone. JSTOR's revenue was 69 million in 2014. William G. Bowen, president of Princeton University from 1972 to 1988, founded JSTOR. JSTOR originally was conceived as a solution to one of the problems faced by libraries, especially research and university libraries, due to the increasing number of academic journals in existence. Most libraries found it prohibitively expensive in terms of cost and space to maintain a comprehensive collection of journals. By digitizing many journal titles, JSTOR allowed libraries to outsource the storage of journals with the confidence that they would remain available long-term. Online access and full-text search ability improved access dramatically. Bowen initially considered using CD-ROMs for distribution. However, Ira Fuchs, Princeton University's vice-president for Computing and Information Technology, convinced Bowen that CD-ROM was an increasingly outdated technology and that network distribution could eliminate redundancy and increase accessibility. (For example, all Princeton's administrative and academic buildings were networked by 1989; the student dormitory network was completed in 1994; and campus networks like the one at Princeton were, in turn, linked to larger networks such as BITNET and the Internet.) JSTOR was initiated in 1995 at seven different library sites, and originally encompassed ten economics and history journals.

Three NATO members are permanent members of the United Nations Security Council with the power to veto and are officially nuclear-weapon states: the United States, France and the United Kingdom. NATO's headquarters are located in Haren, Brussels, Belgium, where the Supreme Allied Commander also resides. Belgium is one of the 28 member states across North America and Europe, the newest of which, Albania and Croatia, joined in April 2009. An additional 22 countries participate in NATO's Partnership for Peace program, with 15 other countries involved in institutionalized dialogue programmes. The combined military spending of all NATO members constitutes over 70% of the global total. Members' defence spending is supposed to amount to 2% of GDP. - The Commodore 64, also known as the C64, C-64, C= 64, or occasionally CBM 64 or VIC-64 in Sweden, is an 8-bit home computer introduced in January 1982 by Commodore International. It is listed in the Guinness World Records as the highest-selling single computer model of all time, with independent estimates placing the number sold between 10 and 17 million units. Volume production started in early 1982, marketing in August for . Preceded by the Commodore VIC-20 and Commodore PET, the C64 took its name from its of RAM. It had superior sound and graphical specifications compared to other earlier systems such as the Apple II and Atari 800, with multi-color sprites and a more advanced sound processor. - X-COM (sometimes stylized as \\"X-Com\\") is a science fiction video game franchise featuring an elite international organization tasked with countering alien invasions of Earth. The series began with the strategy video game \\"\\" created by Mythos Games and MicroProse in 1994. The original line up by MicroProse included six published and at least two cancelled games, as well as two novels. The \\"X-COM\\" series, in particular its original entry, achieved a sizable cult following and has influenced many other video games; including the creation of a number of clones, spiritual successors, and unofficial remakes. - Home computers were a class of microcomputers entering the market in 1977, and becoming common during the 1980s. They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming. - Sidney K. \\"Sid\\" Meier (born February 24, 1954) is a programmer, designer, and producer of several popular strategy video games and simulation video games, most notably the \\"Civilization\\" series. Meier co-founded MicroProse in 1982 with Bill Stealey and is the Director of Creative Development of Firaxis Games, which he co-founded with Jeff Briggs and Brian Reynolds in 1996. He has won several prestigious accolades for his contributions to the video game industry. - Dr. Jeffery L. Briggs (born March 10, 1957, in Florence, Alabama) is founder and former President and CEO of Firaxis Games, a video game developer based in Hunt Valley, Maryland, United States. He was previously a game designer at MicroProse but left that company in 1996 along with Sid Meier and Brian Reynolds to form Firaxis Games. - Guinness World Records, known from its inception in 1955 until 1998 as The Guinness Book of Records and in previous U.S. editions as The Guinness Book of World Records, is a reference book published annually, listing world records and national records, both of human achievements and the extremes of the natural world. The book itself holds a world record, as the best-selling copyrighted book of all time. As of the 2017 edition, it is now in its 63rd year of publication, published in 100 countries and 23 languages. The international franchise has extended beyond print to include television series and museums. The popularity of the franchise has resulted in \\"Guinness World Records\\" becoming the primary international authority on the cataloguing and verification of a huge number of world records; the organisation employs official record adjudicators authorised to verify the authenticity of the setting and breaking of records. - A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out an arbitrary set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. The ability of computers to follow a sequence of operations, called a \\"program\\", make computers very flexible and useful. Such computers are used as control systems for a very wide variety of industrial and consumer devices. This includes simple special purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls, factory devices such as industrial robots and computer assisted design, but also in general purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices such as smartphones. The Internet is run on computers and it connects millions of other computers. - The Partnership for Peace (PfP) is a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) program aimed at creating trust between NATO and other states in Europe and the former Soviet Union; 22 states are members. It was first discussed by the Bulgarian Society Novae, after being proposed as an American initiative at the meeting of NATO defense ministers in Travemünde, Germany, on 2021 October 1993, and formally launched on 1011 January 1994 NATO summit in Brussels, Belgium. - The IBM System/360 Model 30 was a low-end member of the IBM System/360 family. It was announced on April 7, 1964, shipped in 1965, and withdrawn on October 7, 1977. - The bit is a basic unit of information in computing and digital communications. A bit can have only one of two values, and may therefore be physically implemented with a two-state device. These values are most commonly represented as either a . The term \\"bit\\" is a portmanteau of binary digit. In information theory, the bit is equivalent to the unit \\"shannon\\", named after Claude Shannon. - A microwave oven (commonly referred to as a microwave) is a kitchen appliance that heats and cooks food by exposing it to microwave radiation in the electromagnetic spectrum. This induces polar molecules in the food to rotate and produce thermal energy in a process known as dielectric heating. Microwave ovens heat foods quickly and efficiently because excitation is fairly uniform in the outer of a homogeneous, high water content food item; food is more evenly heated throughout (except in heterogeneous, dense objects) than generally occurs in other cooking techniques. - MOS Technology, Inc. (\\"MOS\\" being short for Metal Oxide Semiconductor), also known as CSG (Commodore Semiconductor Group), was a semiconductor design and fabrication company based in Norristown, Pennsylvania, in the United States. It is most famous for its 6502 microprocessor and various designs for Commodore International's range of home computers. - A board game is a tabletop game that involves counters or moved or placed on a pre-marked surface or \\"board\\", according to a set of rules. Some games are based on pure strategy, but many contain an element of chance; and some are purely chance, with no element of skill. - A mobile device (or handheld computer) is a small computing device, typically, small enough to hold and operate in the hand and having an operating system capable of running mobile apps. These may provide a diverse range of functions. Typically, the device will have a display screen with a small numeric or alphanumeric keyboard or a touchscreen providing a virtual keyboard and buttons (icons) on-screen. Many such devices can connect to the Internet and interconnect with other devices such as car entertainment systems or headsets via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or near field communication (NFC). Integrated cameras, digital media players, mobile phone and GPS capabilities are common. Power is typically provided by a lithium battery. - Strategy (from Greek \\"stratgia\\", \\"art of troop leader; office of general, command, generalship\\") is a high level plan to achieve one or more goals under conditions of uncertainty. In the sense of the \\"art of the general\\", which included several subsets of skills including \\"tactics\\", siegecraft, logistics etc., the term came into use in the 6th century C.E. in East Roman terminology, and was translated into Western vernacular languages only in the 18th century. From then until the 20th century, the word \\"strategy\\" came to denote \\"a comprehensive way to try to pursue political ends, including the threat or actual use of force, in a dialectic of wills\\" in a military conflict, in which both adversaries interact. - A video game publisher is a company that publishes video games that they have either developed internally or have had developed by a video game developer. As with book publishers or publishers of DVD movies, video game publishers are responsible for their product's manufacturing and marketing, including market research and all aspects of advertising. - Albania (; ), officially the Republic of Albania, is a sovereign state in Southeastern Europe. It has a population of 3.03 million as of 2016. Tirana is the nation's capital and largest city, followed by Durrës and Vlorë. Albania is located in the south-western part of the Balkan peninsula, bordered by Montenegro to the northwest, Kosovo to the northeast, the Republic of Macedonia to the east, and Greece to the south and southeast. The country has a coastline on the northern shore of the Mediterranean Sea, the Adriatic Sea to the west and the Ionian Sea to the southwest where the Albanian Riviera begins. Albania is less than from Italy, across the Strait of Otranto which connects the Adriatic Sea to the Ionian Sea. - The Apple IIe (styled as Apple //e) is the third model in the Apple II series of personal computers produced by Apple Computer. The \\"e\\" in the name stands for \\"enhanced\\", referring to the fact that several popular features were now built-in that were available only as upgrades or add-ons in earlier models. It also improved upon expandability and added a few new features, which, all combined, made it very attractive to first-time computer shoppers as a general-purpose machine. The Apple IIe has the distinction of being the longest-lived computer in Apple's history, having been manufactured and sold for nearly 11 years with relatively few changes. - A smartphone is a mobile phone (also known as cell phones or cell mobiles) with an advanced mobile operating system that combines features of a personal computer operating system with other features useful for mobile or handheld use. Smartphones, which are usually pocket-sized, typically combine the features of a mobile phone, such as the abilities to place and receive voice calls and create and receive text messages, with those of other popular digital mobile devices like personal digital assistants (PDAs), such as an event calendar, media player, video games, GPS navigation, digital camera and digital video camera. Smartphones can access the Internet and can run a variety of third-party software components (\\"apps\\" from Google Play, Apple App Store, etc). They typically have a color display with a graphical user interface that covers more than 76% of the front surface. The display is almost always a touchscreen and sometimes additionally a touch-enabled keyboard like the Priv/Passport BlackBerrys, which enables the user to use a virtual keyboard to type words and numbers and press onscreen icons to activate \\"app\\" features. - Star Raiders is a space combat simulator video game for the Atari 8-bit family of computers. It was written by Doug Neubauer, an Atari employee, and released in cartridge form by Atari in 1979. It was later ported to other Atari computer and game platforms. - Strategy video games are a video game genre that focuses on skillful thinking and planning to achieve victory. It emphasizes strategic, tactical, and sometimes logistical challenges. Many games also offer economic challenges and exploration. They are generally categorized into four sub-types, depending on whether the game is turn-based or real-time, and whether the game focuses on strategy or tactics. - MicroProse was an American video game publisher and developer founded by \\"Wild\\" Bill Stealey and Sid Meier in 1982 as MicroProse Software Inc. It developed and published numerous games, many of which are regarded as groundbreaking, classics and cult titles, including starting the \\"Civilization\\" and \\"X-COM\\" series. Most of their internally developed titles were vehicle simulation and strategy games. - NATO Commander is a commercial computer strategy game designed by Sid Meier and released in 1983 by MicroProse . The game ran on 8 - bit home computers of its day such as the Atari 8 - bit family , Apple II and Commodore 64 . The player takes the roll of the Supreme Allied Commander of NATO forces in Europe as they respond to a massive Warsaw Pact attack . The goal is to slow their advance and inflict casualties , hoping to force a diplomatic end to the war before West Germany is overrun . The same game engine was also used as the basis for Conflict in Vietnam , Crusade in Europe and Decision in the Desert . - The Apple II is an 8-bit home computer, one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputer products, designed primarily by Steve Wozniak (Steve Jobs oversaw the development of the Apple II's foam-molded plastic case and Rod Holt developed the switching power supply). It was introduced in 1977 at the West Coast Computer Faire by Jobs and was the first consumer product sold by Apple Computer. It is the first model in a series of computers which were produced until Apple IIe production ceased in November 1993. The Apple II marks Apple's first launch of a personal computer aimed at a consumer market branded towards American households rather than businessmen or computer hobbyists. - The IBM System/360 (S/360) is a mainframe computer system family that was announced by IBM on April 7, 1964, and delivered between 1965 and 1978. It was the first family of computers designed to cover the complete range of applications, from small to large, both commercial and scientific. The design made a clear distinction between architecture and implementation, allowing IBM to release a suite of compatible designs at different prices. All but the incompatible model 44 and the most expensive systems used microcode to implement the instruction set, which featured 8-bit byte addressing and binary, decimal and (hexadecimal) floating-point calculations. - Atari is a corporate and brand name owned by several entities since its inception in 1972, currently by Atari Interactive, a subsidiary of the French publisher Atari, SA (ASA). The original Atari, Inc. founded in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney was a pioneer in arcade games, home video game consoles, and home computers. The company's products, such as \\"Pong\\" and the Atari 2600, helped define the electronic entertainment industry from the 1970s to the mid-1980s. - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux. - A simulation video game describes a diverse super-category of video games, generally designed to closely simulate aspects of a real or fictional reality. - Arithmetic or arithmetics (from the Greek \\"arithmos\\", \\"number\\") is the oldest and most elementary branch of mathematics. It consists of the study of numbers, especially the properties of the traditional operations between themaddition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Arithmetic is an elementary part of number theory, and number theory is considered to be one of the top-level divisions of modern mathematics, along with algebra, geometry, and analysis. The terms \\"arithmetic\\" and \\"higher arithmetic\\" were used until the beginning of the 20th century as synonyms for \\"number theory\\" and are sometimes still used to refer to a wider part of number theory. - The IBM System/360 introduced byte-addressable memory with 8-bit bytes, as opposed to bit-addressable or decimal digit-addressable or word-addressable memory, although its general purpose registers were 32 bits wide, and addresses were contained in the lower 24 bits of those addresses. Different models of System/360 had different internal data path widths; the IBM System/360 Model 30 (1965) implemented the 32-bit System/360 architecture, but had an 8 bit native path width, and performed 32-bit arithmetic 8 bits at a time. - A military alliance is an international agreement concerning national security, when the contracting parties promise to support each other in case of a crisis that has not been identified in advance. Military alliances differ from coalitions, as coalitions are formed for a crisis that are already known. - Stephen (or Stephan) Gary \\"Steve\\" Wozniak (born August 11, 1950), nicknamed \\"Woz\\", is an American inventor, electronics engineer, programmer, and technology entrepreneur who co-founded Apple Inc. He is known as a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, along with Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. - The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide. It is a \\"network of networks\\" that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and peer-to-peer networks for file sharing. - The MOS Technology 6502 (typically \\"\\"sixty-five-oh-two\\"\\" or \\"\\"six-five-oh-two\\"\\") is an 8-bit microprocessor that was designed by a small team led by Chuck Peddle for MOS Technology. When it was introduced in 1975, the 6502 was, by a considerable margin, the least expensive full-featured microprocessor on the market. It initially sold for less than one-sixth the cost of competing designs from larger companies, such as Motorola and Intel, and caused rapid decreases in pricing across the entire processor market. Along with the Zilog Z80 it sparked a series of projects that resulted in the home computer revolution of the early 1980s. - Apple Computer 1, also known later as the Apple I, or Apple-1, is a desktop computer released by the Apple Computer Company (now Apple Inc.) in 1976. It was designed and hand-built by Steve Wozniak. Wozniak's friend Steve Jobs had the idea of selling the computer. The Apple I was Apple's first product, and to finance its creation, Jobs sold his only motorized means of transportation, a VW Microbus, for a few hundred dollars, and Wozniak sold his HP-65 calculator for 500; however, Wozniak said that Jobs planned to use his bicycle if necessary. It was demonstrated in July 1976 at the Homebrew Computer Club in Palo Alto, California. - A strategy game or strategic game is a game (e.g. video or board game) in which the players' uncoerced, and often autonomous decision-making skills have a high significance in determining the outcome.

Starr was afflicted by life-threatening illnesses during childhood, and he fell behind in school as a result of prolonged hospitalisations. He briefly held a position with British Rail before securing an apprenticeship at a Liverpool equipment manufacturer. Soon afterwards, he became interested in the UK skiffle craze and developed a fervent admiration for the genre. In 1957, he co-founded his first band, the Eddie Clayton Skiffle Group, which earned several prestigious local bookings before the fad succumbed to American rock and roll by early 1958. When the Beatles formed in 1960, Starr was a member of another Liverpool group, Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. After achieving moderate success in the UK and Hamburg, he quit the Hurricanes and joined the Beatles in August 1962, replacing Pete Best. Starr played key roles in the Beatles' films and appeared in numerous others. After the band's break-up in 1970, he released several successful singles including the US number-four hit \\"It Don't Come Easy\\", and number ones \\"Photograph\\" and \\"You're Sixteen\\". In 1972, he released his most successful UK single, \\"Back Off Boogaloo\\", which peaked at number two. He achieved commercial and critical success with his 1973 album Ringo, which was a top-ten release in both the UK and the US. He has featured in a number of documentaries and hosted television shows.

It is available as either for download or in streaming, as opposed to first airing on broadcast or cable television. The format can be used as a preview, a promotion, as part of a collection of shorts, or a commercial. A webisode may or may not have been broadcast on TV. What defines it is its online distribution on the web, or through video-sharing web sites such as Vimeo or YouTube. While there is no set standard for length, most webisodes are relatively short, ranging from 315 minutes in length. It is a single web episode, but collectively is part of a web series, a form called web television that characteristically features a dramatic, serial storyline, where the primary method of viewership is streaming online over the Internet. The term \\"webisode\\" (a portmanteau formed from the words 'web' and 'episode') was first introduced in the Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary in 2009. - Adult Swim is a programming block of the American cable network Cartoon Network that operates at night from 8:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m., Eastern and Pacific Time. It is programmed by Williams Street Productions, a subsidiary of Turner, which also developed two prior television programming blocks seen on Cartoon Network: Toonami (which later became a block on Adult Swim in 2012) and Miguzi. The name comes from a phrase used by public swimming pools in the United States to label designated times when children are restricted from using the facilities in favor of adults. - CBS (an initialism of the network's former name, the Columbia Broadcasting System) is an American commercial broadcast television network that is a flagship property of CBS Corporation.

Most current medical dramatic programming go beyond the events pertaining to the characters' jobs and portray some aspects of their personal lives. A typical medical drama might have a storyline in which two doctors fall in love. Communications theorist Marshall McLuhan, in his on the nature of media, predicted success for this particular genre on TV because the medium \\"creates an obsession with bodily welfare\\". - Toonami is a brand name geared towards action-oriented programming, primarily consisting of American animation and Japanese anime.

This woman had not been very supportive of me in my role ever since I began working there. I couldn’t figure out if she was arrogant or lacking in self esteem. During this meeting / confrontation, she told me, in no uncertain terms, just what she didn’t like about some recent decisions I had made. I listened to her speak for about 30 minutes. She, quite methodically, tore me apart. Initially, I had planned to hear her out, make a few vague remarks, and send her on her way, thinking that maybe she just needed to be heard. But about 20 minutes into her harangue, I had a change of heart. I decided that, if she asked for a response for me, if she asked my advice, I was going to tell her exactly what I thought. She did, in fact, ask me for a response. I asked her if she was a happy person, and said that I suspected that she was not, as she came across as a bully and was acting like a horrible person. She sat and looked at me, then burst into tears. I waited. Looking up, she said, “Yes, you are correct. I am a horrible person. And I am miserable. What can I do?” We spent some time discussing what she could do, and (even though I didn’t want to take the time to do it) I asked her if she would like a mentor — me? She said that she would like such a thing. This woman and I ended up becoming fairly, no, very good friends and she has been one of my strongest supporters. I didn’t expect that.

The moneylender, who was old and ugly, fancied the businessman's beautiful daughter. So he proposed a bargain. The moneylender told them that he would put a black pebble and a white pebble into an empty bag. The girl would then have to pick one pebble from the bag. If she picked the black pebble, she would become the moneylender's wife and he would _ her father's debt. If she picked the white pebble, she need not marry him and her father's debt would still be forgiven. But if she refused to pick a pebble, her father would be thrown into jail. They were standing on a pebble-strewn path. As they talked, the moneylender bent over to pick up two pebbles. The sharp-eyed girl noticed that he had picked up two black pebbles and put them into the bag. He then asked the girl to pick a pebble from the bag. No doubt she was caught in a dilemma. What would you have done if you were the girl? Careful analysis would produce three possibilities: 1.The girl should refuse to take a pebble. 2.The girl should know that there were two black pebbles in the bag and expose the money-lender as a cheat. 3.The girl should pick a black pebble and sacrifice herself in order to save her father from his debt and imprisonment. The above story is used with the hope that it will make us appreciate the difference between lateral and logical thinking. Read on... The girl put her hand into the moneybag and drew out a pebble. Without looking at it, she fumbled and let it fall onto the pebble-strewn path where it immediately became lost among all the other pebbles. \\"Oh, how clumsy of me!\\" she said. \\"But never mind, if you look into the bag for the one that is left, you will be able to tell which pebble I picked.\\" Since the remaining pebble is black, it must be assumed that she had picked the white one.

The girl in the story did not choose one of the three obvious options presented to her; instead, she came up with an innovative solution that allowed her to avoid a difficult situation.

His sketches are archived here on the Bucks blog, and other drawings are available on his personal Web site, BehaviorGap.com. What I’m about to relate is a story I suspect many of you have experienced at least once if you’re in a relationship. My wife mentioned that her friend had recently redone her kitchen. As she explained all of the renovations, I started doing mental arithmetic that quickly added up to big dollars, dollars we couldn’t afford. Instead of engaging in a fun conversation about why my wife liked the kitchen and what she thought was cool about it, I responded with my typical “We can’t afford that.” Of course when she heard my response, my wife gave me a confused look and said, “What are you talking about?” Clearly, after 15 years of marriage, I haven’t fully learned the lesson that just because my wife is talking about a new kitchen she’s not implying that she wants to remodel her kitchen. She was only discussing something of interest to her and what she thought might be of interest to me. So why did I make the leap and start to feel tension in my shoulders? After all, my wife is no stranger to money. Her undergraduate degree is in finance, and she served as the chief financial officer of a small development company. More recently she’s taken over as our family C.F.O., which leads me to wonder why I’m assuming she’s talking about money when in reality she’s just talking about life. This conversation isn’t the first time that I’ve made the leap to money based on things my wife tells me. For example, every time she mentioned someone she knew that was planning a family trip to Hawaii, I immediately started calculating how much such a trip would cost. Even something as simple as talking about where friends plan to send their children to college makes me start thinking about money. The reality is that my brain is wired to think differently when it comes to money. Based on my experience, and the stories others have related, it’s clear that men and women can have completely different approaches to how they talk about money. What I took as code for, “I want a new kitchen,” was just my wife talking about something she enjoyed. How many times has this happened between you and your spouse? Even if it happens a lot, this is not a question of who’s right and who’s wrong. Rather, it’s an opportunity for us to recognize that when we’re dealing with people who we care about, we can’t impose our money language and expectations on them. I will probably continue to do mental arithmetic when I’m chatting with my wife, but if I remember that 99 percent of the time she’s simply talking about subjects that interest her, I can reduce my anxiety over money. How we were raised to view money (let alone the other influences of gender, experience and education) all play a role in how we talk and think about money. So it’s healthy to recognize that we all bring baggage to these conversations. Hopefully it won’t take me another 15 years to put it into practice.","response":"\\"Understanding Each Other's Money Talk: A Story About Marriage and Different Ways of Discussing Finances\\""},{"question":"One stop shop.

The answer to this question is:","response":"\\"It fluctuates.\\" Ice wedging is a form of mechanical weathering caused by the expansion of freezing water in cracks and joints of rocks. The process involves cycles of freezing and thawing, which cause the water to expand when it turns into ice and exert pressure on the surrounding rock. Over time, this pressure results in the wedging apart of rock pieces and eventually the formation of larger fractures. It is important to note that the rate of ice wedging is not constant and can fluctuate due to several factors, including: 1. Ambient temperature: The freeze-thaw cycle depends on the temperature. In colder climates with prolonged periods of sub-zero temperatures, there may be limited opportunities for thawing, thereby slowing the rate of ice wedging. In contrast, regions with frequent fluctuations around the freezing point can experience more cycles and thus, increased ice wedging activity. 2. Amount of water available: The presence of water within rock cracks is essential for ice wedging to occur. In drier environments with limited water supply or permeable rocks, the process can be minimal or even non-existent. 3. Rock type and structure: Some rocks are more susceptible to ice wedging than others. Rocks with a higher porosity and a network of interconnected pores and fractures can facilitate water infiltration, making them more prone to ice wedging. On the other hand, dense and impermeable rocks are less likely to experience significant ice wedging. 4. Elevation and aspect: Ice wedging tends to be more prominent at higher elevations, where freezing temperatures are more common. Additionally, the aspect or the direction a slope is facing can influence the rate due to differences in sunlight exposure and temperature conditions. 5. Seasonal variations: The rate of ice wedging can be influenced by the length and severity of the winter season. Longer and more severe winters can lead to increased ice wedging, while milder winters can result in reduced levels of activity. In conclusion, the rate of ice wedging is not a fixed value but fluctuates depending on various factors. Understanding these factors can help in predicting and mitigating the impacts of ice wedging on infrastructure, natural landscapes, and other geological features."},{"question":"Article: Over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medication can be used to treat swelling around the nose that can result in a nose ring bump.

But after three long years, NASA's successor is almost ready to make an entrance. Orion, the agency's newest manned spaceship, is being prepared for its first mission in December. In future missions, it will journey into deep space -- to Mars and beyond -- farther than humans have ever gone before. Orion comes loaded with superlatives. It boasts the largest heat shield ever built and a computer 400 times faster than the ones on the space shuttles. It will be launched into space on the most powerful rocket NASA has ever made. No astronauts will be aboard the December flight, which will test the spacecraft's systems for future manned missions. Final work on the spacecraft is under way at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Orion came one step closer to completion this month with the stacking of the crew module atop the service module. \\"Now that we're getting so close to launch, the spacecraft completion work is visible every day,\\" Orion Program Manager Mark Geyer said in a statement. A 3,600-mile journey When complete, the Orion capsule will resemble a fencing foil, with a tall spire shooting up from a rounded base. At the top will sit a launch abort system, with downward-facing thrusters that would save the crew from a jarring crash in the event of a rocket malfunction. The bottom portion, the service module, will perform various functions such as in-space propulsion and cargo storage. Nestled between the two will be the crew module, capable of supporting human life from launch until recovery. Attached to the service module will be a United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket. For the first time since the space shuttle's debut launch in 1981, the crew compartment will ride on the tip of the rocket rather than hanging onto its side, evoking the configuration of the famous Apollo or Gemini missions. Question: \\"What is significant about the Orion?\\" Answer: \\"Its computere is less than 400 times faster than the shuttle's\\" Is this answer correct?","response":"No, sweetie, that answer is not correct. The Orion is actually considered remarkable because its computer is 400 times faster than the ones on the space shuttles. It's like saying that Orion's brain works a lot faster than the brains of the old space shuttles. Also, it can go farther into space than any other spaceship with humans aboard has gone before.

Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal? Options are: A). Vibrate the mold to get the bubbles to rise and pop.. B). Use a spoon to get the bubbles to rise and pop..","response":"Option A, vibrating the mold to get the bubbles to rise and pop, makes more sense to accomplish the goal of removing bubbles from silicone that has been poured into a mold. This is because using a vibration method allows for a more efficient and even distribution of energy across the silicone material, which helps to effectively dislodge trapped air bubbles and bring them to the surface. Additionally, there are several methods to apply vibration, allowing you to choose the most suitable one for your specific mold and silicone. In comparison, using a spoon (Option B) to get the bubbles to rise and pop may not be as effective for several reasons. First, manually stirring the silicone with a spoon might introduce more air bubbles into the mixture, especially if it's not done carefully and slowly. This can defeat the purpose of attempting to remove the bubbles in the first place. Second, this method might not be as efficient, as it relies heavily on the user's skill and precision to identify and target the air bubbles, which can be time-consuming and may not yield the best results. There are various techniques for applying vibration to the mold, some of which are: 1. Manual tapping: This involves gently tapping the sides of the mold with your hands or a tool like a rubber mallet. It can be an effective method for smaller molds, but it might not work as well for larger ones or more intricate designs. 2. Electric vibrator: These devices are specifically designed to apply consistent vibration to a mold or casting table. Electric vibrators come in various sizes, allowing you to choose the best option for your project. 3. Vacuum chamber: A vacuum chamber applies negative pressure to the mold and silicone mixture, helping the trapped air bubbles to expand and rise to the surface. This method can be highly effective, but it can be more expensive than tapping or using an electric vibrator. It also requires access to a vacuum chamber. 4. Pressure pot: Another alternative is using a pressure pot, which applies positive pressure to the silicone-filled mold, reducing the size of air bubbles and forcing them to the surface. This technique can be effective, but it requires access to a pressure pot and may be more expensive or complicated than other methods. Overall, Option A, vibrating the mold, is the best approach for removing bubbles from silicone that has been poured into a mold. It provides a more efficient and effective solution, allowing for the even distribution of energy across the silicone material while reducing the likelihood of introducing new air bubbles in the process. It also offers the user more options for fine-tuning the method for their specific project."},{"question":"Select your answer: Which is this about?

The farming world Akir is threatened by the tyrannical warlord Sador, who rules the sinister Malmori Empire and, his body parts deteriorating, is capturing and appropriating them from others. Sador's huge dreadnaught (nicknamed \\"Hammerhead\\") mounts a \\"Stellar Converter\\", a weapon that turns planets into small stars. He demands that the peaceful Akira submit to him when he returns in \\"seven risings of your red giant\\", or he'll turn his Stellar Converter on their planet. Zed, last of the famous Akira Corsairs, is old and nearly blind. He suggests they hire mercenaries to protect their world. Since Akir lacks valuable resources, its people can offer just food and shelter in payment. Unable to go in person, Zed offers his ship for the job if they can find a pilot. The ship is fast and well-armed, but, despite its AI navigation/tactical computer Nell, cannot defeat Sador alone. Shad, a young man who has piloted the ship and is well known to Nell, volunteers for the recruiting mission. Seeking weapons, Shad goes to the space station of Doctor Hephaestus (perhaps named after the weaponsmith of the Olympians Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades), an old friend of Zed. The station is populated mostly by androids, except for two humans — Hephaestus, whose numerous life support-systems have turned him into a cyborg; and his beautiful daughter Nanelia, who looks after him and the androids. The doctor wants Shad to mate with his daughter, by force if necessary. Shad can't bring himself to abandon his people; he convinces Nanelia to help him escape. She follows in her own ship; although she has no weapons, her highly advanced computer systems might be useful. The two split up to look for more mercenaries. Answer:","response":"The name of Nanelia's father is Doctor Hephaestus."},{"question":"Select the correct sentiment of the following review: Philip. K. Dickian movie.

Kenneth has three times as many fish in his aquarium and Matthias has 15 less fish than Kenneth in his aquarium. How many fish do the boys have in total?. Me: Hmmm, let me think. I think this is the detailed solution:","response":"First, let's find out how many fish Kenneth has in his aquarium. Since Kenneth has three times as many fish as Micah, and Micah has 7 fish, we can multiply Micah's number of fish by 3. Kenneth's fish = 3 × 7 = 21 fish Now let's find out how many fish Matthias has in his aquarium. We know that Matthias has 15 fewer fish than Kenneth, so we can subtract 15 from the number of fish Kenneth has. Matthias' fish = 21 - 15 = 6 fish Finally, to find the total number of fish the boys have, we simply add up the number of fish each of them has in his aquarium. Total fish = Micah's fish + Kenneth's fish + Matthias' fish Total fish = 7 + 21 + 6 = 34 fish Thus, the boys have a total of 34 fish in their aquariums."},{"question":"What is the title of this article: Prior to 1992, Armenians would participate in the Olympics representing the USSR.

Pine city was located in the mountains, and was inhabited by nature lovers and people that protected the environment. Bird city was situated on the banks of a large river flowing into the sea. They relied mostly on conventional agriculture and used fertilizer for their crops. Hint: Marine pollution is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles. The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter. The answer to this question is:","response":"Based on the information provided, Bird city released more human waste into the ocean.

Fifteen professors who teach legal ethics at law schools across the country signed the complaint, which was filed with the D.C. Bar’s Office of Disciplinary Counsel. Conway is a member of the D.C. Bar under her maiden name, Kellyanne Fitzpatrick, although records show that her membership has been suspended for non-payment of dues (she remains an active member of the New Jersey Bar). The complaint states that attorneys holding public office “have a higher obligation to avoid conduct involving dishonest [sic], fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation than other lawyers.” Conway allegedly failed to live up to that obligation when she referred to a “Bowling Green Massacre” as justification for President Trump’s travel ban, even though “Ms. Conway knew there was no massacre.” The complaint also says that Conway made another false statement when she said that President Obama banned Iraqis from the United States after the so-called massacre. The argument put forward in the complaint says that there was no formal ban on Iraqis, only an order of enhanced screening. In addition to those instances, Conway is accused of “conduct involving ‘dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation,'” for claiming that “alternative facts” supported the Trump administration’s claims regarding the size of the President’s inauguration crowd. The complaints says, “‘alternative facts’ are not facts at all; they are lies.” On top of the alleged dishonesty, the professors allege that Conway “misused her position” when she promoted Ivanka Trump‘s brand on television from the White House, although they admit that this did not necessarily violate the attorney ethics rules. [Image via Fox Business screengrab] ||||| A group of law professors from around the country has filed a professional misconduct complaint against White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, a graduate of George Washington University Law School who was admitted to the D.C. Bar in 1995. The letter, filed with the office that handles misconduct by members of the D.C. Bar, said Conway should be sanctioned for violating government ethics rules and “conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation,” the letter says. The 15 professors, who specialize in legal ethics, cite several incidents, including a television interview in which Conway made the “false statement that President Barack Obama had ‘banned’ Iraqi refugees from coming into the United States for six months following the ‘Bowling Green Massacre,’ ” and the use of her position to endorse Ivanka Trump products. “We do not file this complaint lightly,” the professors said in their filing. “We believe that, at one time, Ms. Conway, understood her ethical responsibilities as a lawyer and abided by them. But she is currently acting in a way that brings shame upon the legal profession.” The professors teach at law schools such as Georgetown University Law Center, Yale Law School, Fordham University and Duke University. (Reuters) [Read the professors’ letter of complaint against Conway] The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The letter was sent to the D.C. Office of Disciplinary Counsel, the chief prosecutor for disciplinary matters that involve active or inactive attorneys who are members of the D.C. Bar. Conway is listed as a D.C. Bar member under her maiden name, Kellyanne E. Fitzpatrick, but is a suspended member for not paying her dues, according to the disciplinary filing. D.C. Disciplinary Counsel Wallace “Gene” Shipp Jr. said that his office receives about 1,500 complaints a year but investigates only between 400 to 500 of them. The actions that can be taken range from dismissal of the complaint to the prosecution of charges and possible disbarment, he said. [White House says Conway has been ‘counseled’ after touting Ivanka Trump’s products] Since she has been serving as counselor to President Trump, Conway has been caught up in several controversies. Last month, during an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” she said the White House had put forth “alternative facts” regarding the size of Trump’s inauguration crowd. “ ‘Alternative facts’ are not facts at all; they are lies,” the professors said in their filing. 1 of 10 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Controversial comments from Kellyanne Conway that made headlines View Photos Conway, counselor to President Trump, coined the term “alternative facts” and referred to a “Bowling Green massacre” that never happened.

Abbe Smith, a Georgetown Law Center professor and director of the Criminal Defense and Prisoner Advocacy Clinic, said she has never filed such a complaint before and generally does not believe that lawyers should routinely face discipline under the broad rule they cited, which includes conduct outside the practice of law. “But Ms. Conway’s conduct was so outside the norm for a member of the legal profession,” Smith said. “What prompted our complaint was a combination of the specific conduct that Ms. Conway engaged in plus the fact that she holds such a high public office.” Read more: A university takes on one of its own, alumna Kellyanne Conway ‘Morning Joe’ host says Kellyanne Conway was banned because ‘everything she said was disproven’ ||||| Summary:","response":"A group of 15 law professors have filed a complaint claiming that Kellyanne Conway, a counselor to President Trump, violated the professional rules for attorneys by giving false information to the media.

You look at the reviews. Would the following review decrease or increase the chances of you buying the product? Review title: Does not fit 2010 4Runner Product review: Even though it says that this product fits a 2010 Runner Limited, there is no way to make it fit without serious modifications to the vehicle. Do not buy it if you have a 2010 4Runner. Answer:","response":"This review would significantly decrease the chances of me buying the product for several reasons. Firstly, the review clearly states that the product does not fit a 2010 4Runner Limited, despite the product's claim of compatibility with that specific make and model. This indicates that there may be issues with the product's description, which could be a warning sign of other potential inaccuracies or misrepresentations. Secondly, the reviewer's experience highlights the issue of potential required modifications to the vehicle for the product's installation. Making such serious modifications can be both time-consuming and costly, and it may also void the vehicle's warranty. For most consumers, this would be an undesirable situation and could deter them from purchasing the product. Additionally, the strong language used by the reviewer, such as \\"Do not buy it,\\" implies that the reviewer had a negative experience using the product and felt compelled to warn others against making the same mistake. This further reduces the chances of purchasing the product, as potential buyers are likely to be influenced by the negative experiences of others, especially when alternative options may be available. Moreover, since reviews often play a critical role in decision-making for online purchases, potential buyers usually rely on honest and reliable feedback from other customers. If this review was one among many positive reviews, it might have a less significant impact on the purchase decision. However, if this review was representative of a larger trend or if there were similar negative reviews, it would substantially decrease the chances of purchasing the product. In conclusion, the review described above would decrease the chances of buying the product due to concerns about accurate product descriptions, the potential need for serious vehicle modifications, and the negative experiences shared by the reviewer. It is essential to weigh both positive and negative reviews when making a purchase decision, and this particular review would certainly raise alarm bells and prompt further investigation before proceeding with a purchase."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Title: Do not buy this!!!

The waitress, Laura Vasquez (Rosario Dawson), tells him that the murderers were Serleena (Lara Flynn Boyle), a shapeshifting Kylothian who has taken the form of a lingerie model, and her two-headed servant Scrad (Johnny Knoxville). Laura says they were looking for something called the Light of Zartha. J is strongly attracted to Laura, and in violation of MIB rules, does not neuralyze her to erase her memories of the aliensâand of him. J finds that little is known about the Light of Zartha, except that it is immensely powerful. As he investigates the crime, every lead points to his mentor, Agent Kâwho was neuralyzed when he retired, and remembers nothing of his MIB service. In Truro, Massachusetts, where K is now the town's postmaster, J explains this, and convinces him by proving that all of his fellow postal workers are aliens.

K regains his memories, but it's not enough: Years before, he neuralyzed himself, specifically to erase what he knew of the Light of Zartha, and those memories have not returnedâbut as a precaution, he left himself a series of clues. At the pizzeria, they find a locker key. J hides Laura, who fears for her safety, with the worm aliens from the first movie. The key opens a locker in Grand Central Station where a society of tiny aliens, who worship K as their deity, guard their most sacred relics: K's wristwatch and video store membership card. K recovers both, to the aliens' horror, but J gives them his watch as a replacement, and becomes their new deity. At the video store, as J and K...

A first-of-its-kind linguistic movement started in 1895, in what is now Odisha. The movement gained momentum in later years with the demand for a separate Orissa Province to be formed by bifurcating the existing Bihar and Orissa Province. Due to the efforts of Madhusudan Das, the Father of Oriya nationalism, the movement eventually achieved its objective in 1936, when Orissa Province became the first Indian state (pre-independence) to be organised on the basis of common languages. Answer this question: 8. in 1936 which state became the first to be formed on linguistic basis?

Answer:","response":"Insufficient information to provide an answer."},{"question":"thread tolerance after coating 6h Can you repeat this sentence, but capitalize it correctly?","response":"Thread Tolerance After Coating 6H Can you repeat this sentence, but capitalize it correctly? Thread tolerance after coating refers to the allowable deviation in the dimensions of a threaded component after it has been coated with a certain material, such as a paint or protective layer. A common type of thread tolerance is the 6H standard, which is used for a range of applications where the accuracy of threads is important for assembly and function. The 6H tolerance standard defines the limits of the size of threads and their corresponding allowances. It is based on the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) system of limits and fits. The ISO 6H tolerance class is defined by the maximum and minimum dimensions of the internal (nut) thread, which ensures that it will correctly engage with an external (bolt) thread in the mating component. The 6H tolerance standard is commonly used for producing threaded fasteners and machine parts for industrial, automotive, and mechanical applications. It provides an appropriate level of precision that ensures reliable and consistent assembly for these types of parts. When a threaded component undergoes coating, it is necessary to ensure that the coating process does not affect the thread tolerance beyond the specified limits. This is because the coating adds an extra layer of material to the component, which can cause the thread dimensions to change. When a threaded part is coated, the coating material needs to be of uniform thickness and conform to the thread profile to avoid affecting the tolerance. In some cases, it may be necessary to adjust the dimensions of the component before coating to account for the thickness of the coating material and ensure that the final part conforms to the 6H tolerance after the coating is applied. In summary, the 6H thread tolerance standard is an important measure to ensure that threaded components maintain their accuracy and fit together correctly after coating. The coating process should be carefully managed, so the final coated product remains within the specified dimensional limits to achieve reliable and consistent assembly and performance."},{"question":"We can talk all you want about Chris Paul, Justin Gray and Eric Williams.

Anna swims across the surface of a lake and later she plunges several feet below the surface to explore. At which depth will the temperature of the water be colder surface of water or several feet deep in water?? A:","response":"In general, the temperature of the water will be colder several feet deep in the water compared to the surface. This is due to the phenomenon called thermal stratification, which occurs in many lakes and other bodies of water. Thermal stratification results from the fact that water's density varies with temperature. When heated, water expands and becomes less dense, allowing it to rise. Conversely, cooling water contracts and becomes denser, causing it to sink. This difference in density leads to the formation of distinct layers within a body of water, with the warmest water at the surface and the coldest water at the bottom. In the upper layer, known as the epilimnion, the water is exposed to sunlight and is generally warmer. This layer extends from the surface to a certain depth where the temperature starts to decrease more rapidly. As Anna swims across the surface of the lake, she will likely experience the warmest water temperatures. As one goes deeper into the lake, the temperature begins to drop more rapidly in a thinner layer called the thermocline. This is the transition zone between the warm surface water and the cold deeper water. If Anna plunges several feet below the surface into this thermocline, she will likely notice a significant decrease in temperature compared to the surface. Below the thermocline, there is a layer called the hypolimnion, where the coldest and densest water is found. The temperature in this zone remains relatively stable and typically does not mix with the upper layers. However, during certain periods, such as during seasonal turnover events, mixing can occur, and the temperature differences between the layers become less pronounced. It is worth noting that the depth of the thermocline and the temperature gradients can vary depending on the size and depth of the lake, the time of year, and other environmental factors. Nonetheless, in most cases, the temperature of the water will be colder several feet deep compared to the surface."},{"question":"What kind of task would test someone's ability to perform physical reasoning?","response":"A task that would test someone's physical reasoning could be building a block tower.

Wendy's truck has a gas tank that can hold 20 gallons. She also has a car with a gas tank that holds 12 gallons. The truck's tank is half full. The car's tank is 1/3 full. If she fills them both up completely, how many gallons does she add?","response":"Here's the step-by-step reasoning process: Step 1: Determine the current amount of gas in the truck's tank The truck has a gas tank that can hold 20 gallons, and it's currently half full. So we have to find half of 20 gallons. Half of 20 gallons = 20 * 0.5 = 10 gallons The truck currently has 10 gallons of gas in its tank. Step 2: Determine the current amount of gas in the car's tank The car has a gas tank that can hold 12 gallons, and it's currently 1/3 full. So we need to find 1/3 of 12 gallons. 1/3 of 12 gallons = 12 * (1/3) = 4 gallons The car currently has 4 gallons of gas in its tank. Step 3: Determine how many gallons Wendy needs to add in the truck's tank to fill it up. Since the truck's tank can hold 20 gallons and it currently has 10 gallons, we need to find the difference to know how many gallons Wendy needs to add to fill it up. 20 gallons (full capacity) - 10 gallons (current amount) = 10 gallons Wendy needs to add 10 gallons of gas to fill up the truck's tank. Step 4: Determine how many gallons Wendy needs to add in the car's tank to fill it up. Since the car's tank can hold 12 gallons and it currently has 4 gallons, we need to find the difference to know how many gallons Wendy needs to add to fill it up. 12 gallons (full capacity) - 4 gallons (current amount) = 8 gallons Wendy needs to add 8 gallons of gas to fill up the car's tank. Step 5: Calculate the total amount of gallons Wendy needs to add to both vehicles. Now that we know Wendy needs to add 10 gallons to the truck's tank and 8 gallons to the car's tank, we can find the total amount of gallons she needs to add by summing the two quantities: 10 gallons (for the truck) + 8 gallons (for the car) = 18 gallons Final answer: Wendy needs to add 18 gallons of gas to fill up both the truck and car's tanks completely."},{"question":"Dimitrija Čupovski (Macedonian: Димитрија Чуповски) (November 8 1878 – October 29 1940) was a Macedonian textbook writer and lexicographer.

Context: How to blow a bubble with bubblegum<br>Buy some bubblegum. You can buy gum at pretty much every corner store. Chewing gums can be used to make bubbles, but they won't be as big, and they'll usually pop too easily. Hypothesis: It has been said that chewing gum bubbles are easy to pop.","response":"Yes, we can draw the following hypothesis from the context: Hypothesis: Chewing gum bubbles are easier to pop as compared to bubblegum bubbles. The context indicates that although it is possible to create bubbles with chewing gum, they tend to not be as large and are generally less durable than bubbles made with bubblegum. This is because bubblegum is specifically formulated to be more elastic and better suited for bubble-blowing purposes, whereas chewing gum is primarily meant for the enjoyable experience of chewing and flavor release. In further detail, the key difference between bubblegum and chewing gum lies in the ingredients and properties of the two. Bubblegum typically contains higher levels of a particular type of polymer, which gives it enhanced pliability and elasticity, allowing it to be stretched and blown into larger bubbles without easily bursting. Chewing gum, on the other hand, tends to have a denser and more brittle texture, making it less ideal for creating large and stable bubbles. Furthermore, the process of how gum is formulated can also contribute to these characteristics. For instance, bubblegum often includes ingredients, such as synthetic rubbers and plasticizers, which impart elasticity and flexibility, allowing the gum to be manipulated into various shapes with ease. Chewing gum, however, is largely designed for prolonged chewing and the release of flavors, which means that it may focus more on providing a satisfying texture and taste, instead of prioritizing the ability to blow bubbles. In conclusion, the hypothesis drawn from the context suggests that chewing gum bubbles are indeed easier to pop compared to bubblegum bubbles, primarily due to the differences in ingredients, formulation and intended purpose of the two types of gum. Bubblegum is specifically designed for blowing bubbles, while chewing gum is formulated to offer a pleasant chewing experience and flavor release. As a result, bubbles made with chewing gum tend to be less stable and resilient than those created using bubblegum."},{"question":"Ian Weatherhead lived in Somerset many years before moving to Cheltenham .

Step 1: Simplify the right side of the equation. -42 + 42 equals to 0. So the equation simplifies to -4*m = 0. Step 2: Solve for m. To isolate m, you would divide both sides of the equation by -4. That's because in the equation -4*m = 0, m is being multiplied by -4. To undo the multiplication and solve for m, you need to do the reverse operation, which is division. So, m = 0 / -4 Step 3: Simplify to find the value of m. 0 divided by any number is 0. So, m equals 0. Thus, the value of m that satisfies the equation is m = 0."},{"question":"Galena is the most important ore of which metal?","response":"To find out which metal Galena is the most important ore of, I will perform the following steps: Step 1: Research Galena.

Debates were covered on front pages of college newspapers and emphasized in yearbooks, and team members even received the equivalent of athletic letters for their jackets. There even were rallies sending off the debating teams to matches. Yet, the debates never attained the broad appeal that athletics enjoyed. One reason may be that debates do not have a clear winner, as is the case in sports, and that scoring is subjective.

Everton, who had lost goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg to injury in the second half, have now won just one of their past 20 meetings with their local rivals. Liverpool - who moved up to second - created the better chances, with Stekelenburg and his replacement Joel Robles saving well from Roberto Firmino. There was a flashpoint in the second half when a dreadful tackle by Ross Barkley on Jordan Henderson sparked angry scenes and the Everton midfielder was fortunate to escape with only a yellow card from referee Mike Dean. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp's celebrations at the final whistle carried an extra edge as Mane's late strike sealed three points they desperately needed to keep in touch with Premier League leaders Chelsea. Liverpool are six points behind Antonio Conte's side and will surely take great satisfaction from digging out a vital victory that was based on grit rather than the flowing football that has been their trademark this season. The hosts' high tempo start put the Reds on the back foot but as the game went on they exerted greater control and in the end deserved the win simply for looking the more dangerous side and creating the better chances. And once again Sturridge proved how important he can be to Klopp and Liverpool's cause - despite being marginalised or injured for much of the season - with the run and shot that struck the post before Mane swooped to win the 227th Merseyside derby. Liverpool needed to bounce back from the stumbles of a shock 4-3 defeat at Bournemouth and a home draw against West Ham United. They have done so in style with away wins at Middlesbrough and now Everton. Everton's record in Merseyside derbies has been a tale of almost unbroken misery since their last win, a 2-0 win against Roy Hodgson's Liverpool in October 2010. There are, however, signs of improvement and they will feel unfortunate not to hold out here and concede so late on. For the first 45 minutes they adhered to boss Ronald Koeman's demand for a high-intensity pressing game but ran out of steam after the break, not helped by the loss of James McCarthy to injury. Substitute Gareth Barry may still possess the old guile, but sadly for him and Everton the legs are also ageing and he was miles off the pace - though his substitute appearance did take him second behind Ryan Giggs in the list of most Premier League games played. Everton also failed to give sufficient support to main marksman Romelu Lukaku and Koeman will surely be looking to address this problem in the January transfer window. There are signs that the Toffees are now moving in the right direction, despite suffering their first home Premier League defeat of the season - but Koeman still has much to do. Barkley has been the centre of much attention this season, whether as the victim of tough love from Koeman or with transfer speculation as he enters the last 18 months of his contract. Here he was centre of attention for different reasons after a late touchline lunge on his England team-mate Henderson in the second half that was somehow only punished with a yellow card. It led to angry exchanges between the players, and Henderson and Barkley also clashed later, the latter wisely not rising to the Liverpool captain's bait. Barkley's night was summed up by a wild cross into the Gwladys Street that brought a furious response from his manager. These are tough times for the talented 23-year-old midfielder.

Maybe not the best football - you have to adapt to Everton's wild game. A game like this you have to interrupt their rhythm with passing. \\"In the second half it was clear they couldn't do the same. We were better, we didn't give one chance away I think. \\"The goal was not the hardest shot from Sturridge, but hard enough. It was a wonderful feeling. \\"I don't like the flares too much.

Michelle and Matthew Shiels and their sons Richard and Brandon are all aces at the game, honing their skills at their 'house of cards' in Edington, Birmingham. Only last week, 19-year-old Brandon scooped £9,200 in the UK and Ireland Poker Tour tournament, staged in London. Brandon Sheils is pictured left, his brother Richard (right), father Matthew (centre) and mother Michelle have all quit their jobs to become poker champions. But former Birmingham University economics graduate Richard, who did his dissertation on the game, has gone one better. The 23-year-old scooped £27,000 in the Deep Stack contest, staged at Nottingham's Dusk Till Dawn Poker Club. For 24 hours, Richard battled with 328 of the best players in the country, and came out on top. In fact, between them, Brandon and Richard have made a whopping £75,000 since November. As a family, the Sheils take part, on average, in three competitions a week - and they claim there is a reason for their staggering success. Michelle (pictured receiving a poker prize) and husband Matthew have appeared in tournaments on satellite television. Guided by 48-year-old Matthew, a former accountant, and Michelle, who sold her nursery business to concentrate on poker, they say they have replaced the luck, chance and risk with a mathematical formula. Richard, who began playing in earnest after leaving university in 2012, said: 'In our house, there is a fine line between gambling and poker. 'I did my dissertation on poker, the science and maths behind the game. You can see where the gambling is, and where it is not. 'It would be extremely silly to go down the gambling route. If you meet gamblers, you are going to make money from them.' But Richard admitted you can't completely eradicate luck. 'If I played you 100 times, I wouldn't beat you 100 times,' he explained, 'but I would beat you more than 50 times, which would mean I'd make money.' Richard, who spent two months playing the Vegas tables, was introduced to cards at a very early age. He learned to count using a deck. 'Old school poker is very touchy-feely,' he said, 'but nowadays it's all about the maths and theory. Mind you, when we're in a tournament together it becomes very competitive. 'I'm getting better and better. At the moment, I'm a better player than Brandon, but he's improving all the time. I taught him how to play.. I've made the mistakes and made sure he doesn't make them. 'My ambition is to be good enough to play for a living, but rich enough not to have to.' Michelle and Matthew are no slouches and have appeared in tournaments on satellite television. Cards on the table: The family say they have replaced the luck, chance and risk element of the game with a mathematical formula. 'Mum ran a nursery,' Richard explained. 'She sold that, semi-retired and played poker. She's been on Channel 4's Late Night Poker a few times, and her biggest win is £12,000.' Michelle, 41, said: 'Richard and Brandon are better players, to be fair. I'm always asked if I'm better than my husband and he says I am, but I'm not sure. 'I have no fixed plans for the future. Sometimes I get bored with it and go off the boil, then return.' Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","response":"This is a story about a family - a mom (Michelle), a dad (Matthew), and their two sons (Richard and Brandon) - in Birmingham who quit their jobs to play a game called poker, in which you use cards. Kind of like how we play Go Fish or Old Maid, but this is a grown-up game that you can actually win money from! Richard and Brandon have won a lot of money - enough to buy thousands of toys - from playing this game. In fact, they are so good at it that they play in big tournaments and even on TV sometimes. The boys learned from their mom and dad. Their dad, Matthew, used to be an accountant. You can think of an accountant like a person who's very good at math and knows a lot about money. Their mom, Michelle, used to run a nursery where little kids go to play and learn. But they both decided to quit their jobs and play poker instead. This family doesn't think of poker just as a game of luck like tossing a coin, they use math and theories. It's like when we separate our jelly beans by color before eating them - it just makes things easier and more predictable. This way, they win more often than they lose which means they earn more money. The coolest part? Even though they compete against each other, they all support and help each other get better at poker. It's like when we play a game together and I let you win sometimes so that you can learn and get better. Michelle, the mom, even won a big cash prize once! But she says that her sons are better players. So, in short, this is a family that plays a game together, learns from each other, and even earns money from it. It's like if we were to start getting money every time we play and win at Candyland!"},{"question":"Q: Is this product review positive? Title: It's a champ in our house! Review: I received the Diaper Genie as a shower gift for my first child (now 6), but it was the original model (i.e., narrow opening), and I had difficulty finding refills. While shopping for a replacement diaper pail for my second child, I was sold on the Diaper Champ. It is so easy and convenient to use, and it requires only one hand to use. No worry about a wobbly pail as you insert and store the diaper thanks to the pail's broad-based bottom (and it will be difficult for my son to topple this one over). Many customers have complained about diaper odor, but I have found using Glad scented kitchen garbage bags nearly eliminates this problem (however, cheaper scented bags don't work as well). The cost of these garbage bags is negligible compared to the cost of Diaper Genie refills. Answer: The answer is:","response":"Yes, the product review is positive. The reviewer portrays a favorable impression of the Diaper Champ based on their experience. They compare this product positively with their previous one, the Diaper Genie, and express satisfaction with the improvements in the updated model they bought for their second child. Firstly, from the title the reviewer has used, \\"It's a champ in our house!\\", we can infer that they are pleased with the purchase - the term 'champ' suggests winning qualities, thus implying that the product has met and possibly exceeded the buyer's expectations. Secondly, the reviewer emphasizes the convenience and ease of using the Diaper Champ mentioning, \\"It is so easy and convenient to use,\\" and, \\"it requires only one hand to use,\\" which are positive aspects of the product. Then, they detail a practical advantage of the Diaper Champ over the Diaper Genie - the difficulty in finding refills for the Diaper Genie lead them to purchase the Diaper Champ which offers an easier solution. The reviewer also appreciates the design of the Diaper Champ, mentioning the stability of the broad-based bottom as a beneficial feature. Moreover, while the reviewer acknowledges complaints from other customers about diaper odor, they present an effective solution using Glad scented kitchen garbage bags that successfully minimize this issue. This constructive approach shows satisfaction with the product, as they have taken it upon themselves to find a solution rather than considering the product to have a fault. Lastly, the reviewer considers the financial advantage, underscoring that \\"the cost of these garbage bags is negligible compared to the cost of Diaper Genie refills.\\" This comparison reaffirms the positive impression of the product. Therefore, considering these points as a whole, the review about the Diaper Champ is quite positive as the reviewer appreciates its functionality, fiscally beneficial solution for refills, and offers problem-solving against odor complaints."},{"question":"(CNN) -- It's called the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment, and weeks before authorities say he got on a plane with a bomb, Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab was in it. The vast government databank, known as TIDE, is administered by the FBI's Terrorist Screening Center. It contains information about hundreds of thousands of people, the majority of them foreign nationals, who are suspected of having terrorist leanings. An FBI official said AbdulMutallab was included in TIDE after his father warned the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria of his son's hard-line beliefs and possible ties to militant Islamists. To understand how he could have been under the government's scrutiny and still make it onto a U.S.-bound plane with an explosive, you have to understand the way the government's watch list system works. TIDE is just the start. The FBI uses the raw information contained in the TIDE databank to determine whether to put the subject onto the government's terror watch list, known as the Terrorism Screening Data Base. That list contains the names and aliases of about 400,000 people, but AbdulMutallab didn't make the cut. According to Chad Kolton, a spokesman for the FBI's Terror Screening Center, there wasn't enough hard evidence to back up AbdulMutallab's father's fears, and so he wasn't placed on the terror list. The bureau's own Web site spells out the criteria for inclusion in the screening database, saying that \\"only individuals who are known or reasonably suspected to be or have been engaged in conduct constituting, in preparation for, in aid of, or related to terrorism are included.\\" Based on the article and the following list of answers, write a list of questions. 1. not enough 2.

Start by combining the constants on the right-hand side: 44 - 353 - 57 = -309 - 57 = -366 Now, the equation becomes: -61*l = -366 To find the value of l, you need to isolate l by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of l, which is -61. So, divide both sides of the equation by -61: (-61*l) / (-61) = (-366) / (-61) This simplification results in: l = 6 Therefore, the solution for the given equation is l = 6."},{"question":"Review: gross-out flicks , college flicks , or Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?","response":"Step 1: Identify the context of the sentence The sentence is discussing movie genres or categories (\\"gross-out flicks, college flicks\\") and seems to be part of a movie review.

It fails. After the credits, the story is introduced by narrator Michael Rennie, who dubs the voice of then Lieutenant-Colonel Desmond Young, who plays himself in the film. Young is captured and meets Rommel briefly as a prisoner of war; he states that Rommel was not only his enemy at the time, but an enemy of civilisation, and makes it his mission after the war to discover what really happened to Rommel during the final years of his life â at the time that Young wrote his book, it was believed that Rommel had died as a result of the wounds he had suffered when an Allied fighter strafed his staff car. The film flashbacks to the period of 1941-42, as the British prepare to counterattack Egypt, directed by General Bernard Montgomery: The Germans are defeated at El Alamein in 1942. The situation is made worse when Rommel is ordered by Adolf Hitler (Luther Adler) to stand fast and not retreat, even in the face of overwhelming Allied superiority in men and supplies, but the retreat is allowed. Rommel becomes increasingly disillusioned with Hitler after his pleas to evacuate his men are dismissed. An ailing Rommel is sent back to Germany to recuperate while his beloved Afrika Korps is driven back across North Africa and destroyed. Rommel is approached while in hospital by an old family friend, Dr. Karl StrÃ¶lin (Cedric Hardwicke), with a request that he join a group plotting to overthrow Hitler. Rommel is very hesitant.

Most people over 65 have retired from work, freeing up their time for hobbies, grandchildren, and other interests. Stamina, strength, reflex time, and the senses all decline during old age, and the number of brain cells decreases as well. The immune system becomes less efficient, increasing the risk of serious illnesses such as cancer and pneumonia. Diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease that cause loss of mental function also become more common. and the situation: Two neighboring towns had different demographics. Hill town had younger inhabitants, most of them in their 30's and 40's. Lake town was inhabited by elderly people, most of them above 65 years of age. Answer the following question: Which town had more people with decreased stamina? The answer is:","response":"Lake town had more people with decreased stamina. This is because Lake town is predominantly inhabited by elderly people who are above 65 years of age. As mentioned in the background information, old age begins in the mid-60s and lasts until the end of life. During this stage of life, stamina, strength, reflex time, and the senses all decline. This is primarily due to the reduction in muscle mass, bone density, and bodily functions that come with aging. Furthermore, the immune system becomes less efficient, which can contribute to overall decreased stamina and higher risk of illnesses. On the other hand, Hill town had younger inhabitants, mostly in their 30's and 40's. People in this age group generally have higher stamina and physical capabilities due to the fact that they are in the prime of their lives, with their bodies still being strong and resilient.

Step-by-step justification: 1. Iron is exposed to oxygen: This step remains unaffected since it is the initial exposure and does not involve water. 2.

A chemical reaction occurs: The chemical reaction, which involves the formation of rust, may be affected indirectly by the reduced amount of water. 4. The iron starts to oxidize: Oxidation is the primary reaction involved in rusting, but the presence of water can accelerate the process. Therefore, if less water is absorbed, the oxidation might occur at a slower rate, thus indirectly impacting this step. 5.

For the words that might not have direct translations, I looked for alternative words that convey the same meaning by understanding the context of the sentence. For example, the phrase \\"utter madness\\" can be translated to \\"خیلی دیوانگی\\" (very much madness). In this context, the word \\"madness\\" refers to the situation being unreasonable or shocking. For words like \\"girls\\" and \\"mother,\\" we have direct translations in the Persian language, which are \\"دختران\\" and \\"مادر\\" respectively. In terms of conveying the meaning behind enjoying the rain, the verb to enjoy is \\"لذت بردن\\" and rain is \\"باران.\\" However, in Persian, \\"لذت بردن از باران\\" (enjoying the rain) would be more appropriate.

Some of the earliest temples, especially in Crete, don't belong to any Greek order. It seems that the first peripteral temples were rectangle wooden structures. The different wooden elements were considered divine, and their forms were preserved in the marble or stone elements of the temples of Doric order. The Greeks used standard types, because they believed that the world of objects was a series of typical forms which could be represented in several instances. The temples should be canonic, and the architects were trying to achieve the esthetic perfection. From the earliest times there were certain rules strictly observed in rectangular peripteral and prostyle buildings. The first buildings were narrow to hold the roof, and when the dimensions changed, some mathematical relations became necessary, in order to keep the original forms. This probably influenced the theory of numbers of Pythagoras, who believed that behind the appearance of things, there was the permanent principle of mathematics. Why were the first buildings narrow?","response":"The first buildings were narrow because they needed to hold the roof properly. If the buildings were too wide, it would be difficult for the roof to stay up without collapsing. By making the buildings narrow, it was easier to support the roof and keep the structure stable.

Hamas spokesman warns against escalation.","response":"Title: Tensions Escalate as Israel Conducts Airstrikes on Targets in Gaza The Israeli military recently carried out extensive airstrikes, targeting nearly three dozen sites within the Gaza Strip in a rapidly escalating conflict. The operation, which has generated shock and sorrow amongst the people of Gaza, has been met with strong statements from both the Israeli Prime Minister and a spokesman for Hamas, who has warned against further escalation. The airstrikes in Gaza were executed in response to incessant rocket fire from the area, with Israel's Prime Minister vowing that the militant Palestinian group Hamas will pay for the tragic loss of life that has occurred as a result of these attacks. The grieving aunt of one of the victims expressed her anguish to CNN, stating that the situation was \\"just too sad to even imagine.\\" While the Israeli authorities have made it clear that they will do whatever it takes to ensure the safety and security of their citizens, the question remains whether continued airstrikes and uninhibited retaliation will only serve to prolong the suffering of innocent residents on both sides of the border. Attention must be paid to the ramifications that this exchange of violence might have on the already strained relationship between Israel and its Palestinian neighbors. As the situation remains tense, the spokesperson for the Hamas has warned against further escalation, cautioning that the consequences could be severe for both Israeli and Palestinian people. The emergence of such a dire situation raises significant concerns over the efficacy of attempts to establish peace and cooperation between the two nations, particularly considering the long-standing history of tension in the region. Gaza, which has long been under the control of Hamas, has experienced several devastating conflicts with Israel over recent years. These hostilities have resulted in widespread destruction and loss of life in Gaza, perpetuating a cycle of violence that ultimately serves no other purpose than to harm those who have no influence over the decisions of their rulers. The people caught in the crossfire continue to suffer as their homes, schools, and places of work are obliterated, and as their loved ones are injured or killed. This latest series of Israeli airstrikes underscores the urgent need for a lasting solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict – one that will safeguard and respect the rights and dignity of all parties involved. The United Nations, as well as the United States and other influential actors, have a role to play in facilitating diplomatic efforts that can bring all sides of the conflict to the table and broker an enduring peace. As the situation unfolds, the international community must remain vigilant and assess the consequences of the ongoing violence, remembering that beneath the rubble and clouds of smoke, there are real human beings with dreams, aspirations, and families. It is only through understanding, empathy, and painstaking diplomacy that a just and peaceful resolution can be achieved, allowing Israelis and Palestinians to live side by side in harmony, free from the threats of war and senseless tragedy."},{"question":"Translate \\"That must never be allowed to become a fait accompli hence the amendment to this resolution to put pressure on China, which I warmly support.\\" to Finnish?","response":"Se, jota ei koskaan saa antaa tapahtua, on nimeltään fait accompli.

Conjugation, in the much-studied E. coli system is determined by plasmid genes, and is an adaptation for transferring copies of the plasmid from one bacterial host to another. It is seldom that a conjugative plasmid integrates into the host bacterial chromosome, and subsequently transfers part of the host bacterial DNA to another bacterium. Plasmid-mediated transfer of host bacterial DNA also appears to be an accidental process rather than a bacterial adaptation. Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): How does conjugation take place?","response":"Alright, let's imagine bacteria are like tiny little houses, and plasmids are like the letters they send to their neighbors. Conjugation is like a way for these houses to share their letters with each other. When two little houses (bacteria) decide to share their letters (plasmids), they build a tiny bridge between them called a pilus. With the help of this bridge, the letters can move from one house to the other. This is how conjugation takes place. Oftentimes, these letters aren't super important, but sometimes they can give the houses new skills or abilities, like helping them protect themselves from medicines we use to clean up the neighborhood. So, conjugation is a way for bacteria to share small parts of themselves, like letters, or plasmids, that might help them out in certain situations."},{"question":"Good Night, and Good Luck is a 2005 American historical drama film directed by George Clooney and starring David Strathairn, George Clooney, Robert Downey, Jr., Patricia Clarkson and Jeff Daniels. The movie was written by Clooney and Grant Heslov (both of whom also have acting roles in the film) and portrays the conflict between veteran radio and television journalist Edward R. Murrow and U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin, especially relating to the anti-Communist Senator's actions with the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. Although released in black and white, Good Night, and Good Luck was filmed on color film stock but on a greyscale set, and was color corrected to black and white during post-production. It focuses on the theme of media responsibility, and also addresses what occurs when the media offer a voice of dissent from government policy. In September 2005, Clooney explained his interest in the story to an audience at the New York Film Festival: \\"I thought it was a good time to raise the idea of using fear to stifle political debate.\\" Having majored in journalism in college, Clooney was well-versed in the subject matter. His father, Nick Clooney, was a television journalist for many years, appearing as an anchorman in Cincinnati, Ohio, Salt Lake City, Utah, Los Angeles, California, and Buffalo, New York. The elder Clooney also ran for Congress in 2004. George Clooney was paid 1 each for writing, directing, and acting in Good Night, and Good Luck., which cost 7.5 million to make. Due to an injury he received on the set of Syriana a few months earlier, Clooney could not pass the tests to be insured. He then mortgaged his own house in Los Angeles in order to make the film. Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban and former eBay president Jeff Skoll invested money in the project as executive producers. The film ultimately grossed more than 54 million worldwide. The CBS offices and studios seen in the movie were all sets on a soundstage. To accomplish a pair of scenes showing characters going up an elevator, different \\"floors\\" of the building were laid out on the same level. The \\"elevator\\" was actually built on a large turntable at the intersection of the two floor sets, and rotated once the doors were closed. When the doors reopened, the actors appeared to be in a different location. In doing so, the movie exercised a bit of dramatic license--the CBS executive offices at the time were located at 485 Madison Avenue. CBS News was located in an office building just north of Grand Central Terminal (demolished and now the site of the Met Life Building); and the See It Now studio was located in Grand Central Terminal itself, above the waiting room. For dramatic effect, all three areas were depicted as being in the same building. Clooney and producer Grant Heslov decided to use only archival footage of Joseph McCarthy in his depiction. As all of that footage was black-and-white, that determined the color scheme of the film. A young Robert Kennedy is also shown in the movie during McCarthy's hearing sessions. He was then a staff member on the Senate subcommittee chaired by McCarthy.

Find the speed downstream and upstream? Options: (A) 40, 68 kmph (B) 40, 30 kmph (C) 70, 30 kmph (D) 40, 60 kmph (E) 20, 60 kmph. Explanation:","response":"First, we need to understand the concepts of downstream and upstream speeds. Downstream speed is the boat's speed in still water plus the speed of the current, as both help the boat move faster. Upstream speed, on the other hand, is the boat's speed in still water minus the speed of the current, as the boat moves against the current. Given: Speed of the boat in still water = 50 kmph Speed of the current = 20 kmph 1. Calculate downstream speed: Downstream speed = Speed of boat in still water + Speed of current Downstream speed = 50 kmph + 20 kmph Downstream speed = 70 kmph 2. Calculate upstream speed: Upstream speed = Speed of boat in still water - Speed of current Upstream speed = 50 kmph - 20 kmph Upstream speed = 30 kmph So the downstream speed is 70 kmph and the upstream speed is 30 kmph. This matches option (C): 70, 30 kmph.

The victims included 1.5 million children and represented about two-thirds of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe. Some definitions of the Holocaust include the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders, bringing the total to about 11 million. Killings took place throughout Nazi Germany, German-occupied territories, and territories held by allies of Nazi Germany. - Vice Admiral Emory Scott Land (January 8, 1879 November 27, 1971) was an officer in the United States Navy, noted for his contributions to naval architecture, particularly in submarine design. Notable assignments included serving as Chief of the Navy's Bureau of Construction and Repair during the 1930s, and as Chairman of the U.S. Maritime Commission during World War II. - USNS Short Splice ( T - AK - 249 ) was a United States Maritime Administration C1 - M - AV1 type coastal cargo ship , originally planned as an Alamosa - class cargo ship . Constructed as Short Splice for the Administration , completed in August 1945 and placed in operation by the War Shipping Administration during the closing period of World War II. However , the war ended , and she was transferred to the U.S. Army as USAT Short Splice who kept her in service until transferred to the U.S. Navy in 1950 . - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - The United States dropped nuclear weapons on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively, during the final stage of World War II. The United States had dropped the bombs with the consent of the United Kingdom as outlined in the Quebec Agreement. The two bombings, which killed at least 129,000 people, remain the only use of nuclear weapons for warfare in history. - The War Shipping Administration (WSA) was a World War II emergency war agency of the US government, tasked to purchase and operate the civilian shipping tonnage the US needed for fighting the war. Both shipbuilding under the Maritime Commission and ship allocation under the WSA to Army, Navy or civilian needs were closely coordinated though Vice Admiral Emory S. Land who continued as head of the Maritime Commission while also heading the WSA. Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'operator' with 'united states navy'. The answer to this question is:","response":"Vice Admiral Emory Scott Land. In the given information, it is mentioned that Vice Admiral Emory Scott Land served as an officer in the United States Navy and had noteworthy contributions to naval architecture. He served in various roles such as the Chief of the Navy's Bureau of Construction and Repair during the 1930s and Chairman of the U.S. Maritime Commission during World War II. It is through these roles he was associated with the United States Navy. Therefore, under the relation 'operator' in the context of the US Navy, Vice Admiral Emory Scott Land is the answer. This is because 'operator' implies having management or control, which is correlatable with his service and leadership position in the United States Navy."},{"question":"WHITE HOUSE — An audio recording was released Monday depicting children desperately crying and begging for their parents after being separated from them by U.S. immigration authorities at its southwestern border, sparking new outrage against the Trump administration and its new \\"zero-tolerance policy\\" towards illegal immigrants.

ProPublica says an unidentified whistleblower passed on the recording to a civil rights attorney, who gave it to the website. Among the disturbing sounds heard on the recording was a child identified by ProPublica as a six-year-old girl from El Salvador begging authorities in Spanish to call her aunt to pick her up from the detention center.

Start with the given equation: 2020 = -29*y + 1034 2. Subtract 1034 from both sides of the equation to move the constant term to the other side: 2020 - 1034 = -29*y + 1034 - 1034 3. Simplify the equation after subtraction: 986 = -29*y 4. To isolate y, divide both sides of the equation by -29: 986 / -29 = (-29*y) / -29 5.

She hits a bad bump driving home drunk on a dark road. Later, hearing noises in the garage, she finds a bleeding man, mangled and impaled on her jeep's bumper. Not calling 911, she tries to help, but he suddenly attacks. Panicked, she hits him with a golf club. After that, she buries his body in a shallow grave in the woods off Clover Rd. The next day, Mary covers up the crime (before parents return from a weekend trip); she scrubs off the blood but doesn't get the dent fixed (a suspicious cop at the auto shop scares her off, then she detours for her grandmas parrots at airport cargo). Mary starts coming apart. Irrational, she crashes on a tree to camouflage the small dent with a bigger dent. Later the news reveals the missing man is kindergarten teacher Timothy Emser (Kevin Corrigan), bipolar and unstable when he vanished. Strange things occur in Mary's house, making her feel toyed with by someone unseen; she descends into paranoia. It transpires that Rick (Christopher Shand), her boyfriend, gets involved in the cover up and goes to retrieve incriminatory evidence (a blanket) off the corpse, but is killed, replaced in Emser's grave. It becomes clear Emser survived. Unhinged, he returns to make Mary live through the same nightmare she inflicted on him. He stalks Mary many ways. The parrots squawk strange phrases, which alert Mary. At one point, she falls down the stairs, impaling a screw driver in her thigh.

The two projects are expected to pressure earnings on a per-share, pretax basis by 91 cents. The company said it now expects full-year earnings to be between 30 cents and 50 cents a share, down from the former outlook calling for a range of 1.20 to 1.45. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expected 1.45 a share. KBR’s revised outlook excludes legal costs of 15 million, or 11 cents a share, associated with legacy U.S. government contracts. KBR said it would seek to regain some of its losses from project vendors but didn’t calculate possible reimbursements into their new forecast.

I'll create two characters - a Japanese diplomat (J.D.) and a Russian diplomat (R.D.) - to serve as vehicles for their respective countries' viewpoints. Step 1: Establishing a setting and beginning the conversation between the diplomats. Step 2: Outlining the issue of the Kuril Islands conflict. Step 3: Presenting the Japanese perspective on the issue. Step 4: Presenting the Russian perspective on the issue. Step 5: Exploring potential solutions or a compromise. --- Setting: A diplomatic meeting has been organized between Japan and Russia to discuss the long-standing territorial dispute over the ownership of the Kuril Islands. J.D.: Thank you for meeting with me today to discuss the ongoing conflict over the Kuril Islands. As you know, this has been a contentious issue for both of our countries for decades. R.D.: Indeed, it is important that our two countries come together to address this issue and find a resolution that can promote peace and harmony in our region. Step 2: Outlining the issue of the Kuril Islands conflict. J.D.: For some historical context, Japan maintains that its sovereignty over the four southernmost islands - Etorofu, Kunashiri, Shikotan, and Habomai - was established in the 19th century. However, after World War II, the Soviet Union claimed control over these islands. R.D.: Yes, that's correct. The Soviet Union gained control under the Yalta Agreement in February 1945 and later, after Japan's surrender, added the islands to Soviet territory in accordance with the Potsdam Declaration. Step 3: Presenting the Japanese perspective on the issue. J.D.: Japan believes that the Soviet Union's actions violated the internationally accepted principles of territorial change following the end of World War II. We argue that the islands are an inherent part of Japanese territory and their seizure was a clear violation of our sovereignty. R.D.: I understand your concerns, but let's consider Russia's perspective on this matter too. Step 4: Presenting the Russian perspective on the issue. R.D.: The Russian Federation, as the successor state to the Soviet Union, has maintained control over the islands for over 70 years. We consider the post-WWII settlement as legitimate and binding, so the ownership of the Kuril Islands should not be in question. Moreover, there are residents on these islands who consider themselves Russian, and their rights need to be protected as well. Step 5: Exploring potential solutions or a compromise. J.D.: While our countries have not yet reached a resolution on this matter, we must find a way to ease tensions in the region and create a more cooperative environment. Has your government considered options such as joint economic activities on the islands, or any other forms of collaboration? R.D.: We are open to such possibilities and have even discussed a peace treaty in the past. However, resolving the territorial issue will require sincere negotiations and mutual understanding. A compromise that respects both sides' positions and historical ties to this region must be achieved, but it may take time. J.D.: Indeed, a delicate and thoughtful approach is necessary for this complex conflict. I look forward to further discussions and potential solutions that can bring our two nations closer to a resolution."},{"question":"Is it possible to conclude that \\"Three dogs run through shallow water.\\" if \\"There is a trio of animals in liquid.\\"?","response":"Not really, little buddy.

She was, to put it bluntly, hotter than hell. On top of that, she’s one of the sweetest, nicest people you were ever going to meet. Needless to say, I was quite smitten, and quickly arranged to spend a week in London with her. When I showed up, she was wearing very interesting pajamas. At least for a few minutes. Unfortunately, my two cats, who had never spent a night in my home without me being there, were, less than impressed when I didn’t show up by 5 PM the day I left, despite having arranged for one of my parents to come over each day to feed them and make sure they had water, etc. Playing with them was optional, but neither would show themselves during that week. Nothing looked amiss on the first floor to Mom or Dad. The food was eaten, the water, apparently drunk, etc. When I got home and went upstairs I found something quite different. There was a trail of toilette paper strewn all over the hallway. My pillow was in the bedroom door and shredded. My alarm clock was on the floor.

Blood Sugar Sex Magik was released on September 24, 1991, the same day as Nirvana's breakthrough album Nevermind. It was certified gold just over two months later on November 26, 1991, and certified platinum on April 1, 1992; since then it has gone seven times platinum in the United States. The album peaked at number 3 on the Billboard 200. Originally, \\"Give it Away\\" did not fare well in the mainstream; several of Warner Bros.' target radio stations refused to air it, telling the band to \\"come back to us when you have a melody in your song\\". KROQ (of Los Angeles), however, began to play the single several times daily, and that, according to Kiedis, \\"was the beginning of the infusion of 'Give It Away' into mass consciousness.\\" The single ultimately peaked at number 9 on the UK Top 40 and number 73 on the Billboard Hot 100. Blood Sugar Sex Magik has sold over 13 million copies worldwide.Due to the success of \\"Give it Away\\", the band did not foresee \\"Under the Bridge\\" as being equally viable. Warner Bros. sent representatives to a Chili Peppers' concert in order to figure out what would ultimately be the next single. When Frusciante began playing \\"Under the Bridge\\", Kiedis missed his cue; the entire audience began singing the song, instead. Kiedis was initially \\"mortified that I had fucked up in front of Warner's people ... I apologized for fucking up but they said 'Fucking up? Are you kidding me? When every single kid at the show sings a song, that's our next single.'\\" \\"Under the Bridge\\" was, therefore, selected as Blood Sugar Sex Magik's second single. By January 1992, \\"Under the Bridge\\" had exploded, peaking at number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100.To promote the album in Europe, Kiedis and Frusciante both agreed they would make the trip.

Creating a link between school uniform and paedophilia seems to be a dangerous and unhelpful Eileen Prior, Scottish Parent Teacher Council A council spokeswoman said the choice of store was an advisory only, and was not intended as an advertisement for M&S. The letter was sent to parents following the case of Barry McCluskey, 39, from King's Park. The former nurse posed as a 14-year-old girl to entice children to perform sex acts in front of web cameras. McCluskey pleaded guilty to 49 charges stretching back to 2003, including lewd and libidinous practices and behaviour, at the High Court in Glasgow in February. The Scottish Parent Teacher Council said the letter to parents was not needed and unwise. Chief executive Eileen Prior said: \\"Creating a link between school uniform and paedophilia seems to be a dangerous and unhelpful one for everyone involved. \\"It implies that young people are in some way responsible for the activities of paedophiles, which is an extremely dangerous argument and one which has echoes of the comments sometimes made around rapists and women's dress. \\"If there is evidence of activity by a paedophile in the area, then police and parents should be informed and involved.\\" She added: \\"Many parents - and indeed young people themselves - are keen to have a dress code in school which requires everyone in the school community to dress in a way which is appropriate for a working environment.\\" ||||| Great news: One school has finally figured out how to stop pedophilia. We always thought adults were the problem, but apparently boys and girls are inviting predators to target them by wearing short skirts and tight pants. Barry McCluskey of King's Park, Scotland recently pleaded guilty to posing as a 14-year-old girl online and convincing dozens of children to perform sex acts via webcam. The BBC reports that in response to this troubling case, King's Park Secondary School sent a letter to parents about a new dress code. It read: We believe that an appropriate school uniform (eg school trousers, knee-length school skirt etc) protects children from being targeted by sexual predators.

We must do all we can to keep our children safe. A modest school uniform is more appropriate than fashion skirts, trousers or tops. Advertisement Parents were advised that they could purchase \\"appropriate\\" clothing at the department store Marks and Spencer. Many parents were rightly outraged by the school implying that when a child is singled out by a pedophile, it's their fault for dressing too seductively. As Eileen Prior, chief executive of the Scottish Parent Teacher Council, points out, that horrible argument sounds all too familiar: Creating a link between school uniform and paedophilia seems to be a dangerous and unhelpful one for everyone involved. It implies that young people are in some way responsible for the activities of paedophiles, which is an extremely dangerous argument and one which has echoes of the comments sometimes made around rapists and women's dress. Advertisement There are legitimate reasons to make children wear school uniforms, such as lessening distractions or providing the school with a preppy panache, but warding off predators is not one of them. Children need more education on online safety and what sorts of activities they need to report to adults, but changes to their clothing accomplish nothing. Pedophiles don't lose interest in children when they put on a looser pair of pants. Sending this message to kids only primes them for believing that victims are somehow at fault when they're sexually assaulted.

Analyze the text content and structure of both sentences. 2. Compare the names and relationships described in both sentences. 3.

Step 1: Analyzing the text content and structure Both sentences have the same structure, in which a woman is described as the wife of someone and the mother of two others. Step 2: Comparing the names and relationships The sentences contain the following names and relationships: - Sentence 1: Wife of Dana Å ariÅ, mother of Dario and Predrag Å ariÄ - Sentence 2: Wife of Dana Šarić, mother of Dario and Predrag Šarić Step 3: Assessing differences There are differences in the spelling of the last name (Å ariÅ vs. Šarić), which seems to be due to a character encoding issue. The first sentence is not displaying the special characters (such as 'š' and 'ć') correctly, causing them to appear as a combination of other characters instead. When the correct characters are used, both sentences would look like: - Corrected Sentence 1: Wife of Dana Šarić, mother of Dario and Predrag Šarić - Sentence 2: Wife of Dana Šarić, mother of Dario and Predrag Šarić Conclusion: With the corrected encoding, these two sentences have the same meaning, as they both describe the woman as the wife of Dana Šarić and the mother of Dario and Predrag Šarić.

Question: What are both of the other forms that jit has? Context: The verbs of most aspect pairs differ in one of two ways: by prefix or by suffix. In prefix pairs, the perfective verb has an added prefix—for example, the imperfective psát (to write, to be writing) compared with the perfective napsat (to write down, to finish writing). The most common prefixes are na-, o-, po-, s-, u-, vy-, z- and za-. In suffix pairs, a different infinitive ending is added to the perfective stem; for example, the perfective verbs koupit (to buy) and prodat (to sell) have the imperfective forms kupovat and prodávat. Imperfective verbs may undergo further morphology to make other imperfective verbs (iterative and frequentative forms), denoting repeated or regular action.

Stream-of-consciousness explanation: Stress is a natural response that our body experiences while dealing with tough situations, goals, or challenges. It stems from complex communication between the brain and the body, releasing various chemicals and hormones. Even though some individuals may believe that by not thinking about stress, they can avoid experiencing it, this isn't entirely accurate. In fact, the human brain constantly processes unconscious thoughts, and several factors can trigger stress, including external events, internal emotions, and even our subconscious reflections. Moreover, completely avoiding stress might not be entirely beneficial, as stress serves a purpose within our system. It acts as a physical or psychological stimulus that pushes us to adapt, learn, and perform better. It works as a signal that prods us to address problems, make changes or find new strategies for dealing with life. Therefore, rather than attempting to stop thinking about stress entirely as a solution, a healthier approach would be to learn how to manage stress effectively. Techniques such as mindfulness, exercise, a balanced diet, and engaging in activities you enjoy can help reduce stress levels and promote a healthier lifestyle. So, the answer to the question about whether you can completely stop experiencing stress by simply not thinking about it is: no."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Farsightedness, or hyperopia, is the condition in which distant objects are seen clearly, but nearby objects appear blurry.

Its territorial center was in the modern district of Herzogtum Lauenburg and originally its eponymous capital was Lauenburg upon Elbe, though in 1619 the capital moved to Ratzeburg. - Bogislaw X of Pomerania, \\"the Great\\", (3 June 1454 5 October 1523) was Duke of Pomerania from 1474 until his death in 1523. - Schleswig-Holstein is the northernmost of the 16 states of Germany, comprising most of the historical duchy of Holstein and the southern part of the former Duchy of Schleswig. Its capital city is Kiel; other notable cities are Lübeck and Flensburg. - Pomerania-Stolp was one of the partitions of the Duchy of Pomerania. Centered in Supsk, it was created from another partition of the Duchy of Pomerania, Pomerania-Wolgast, to satisfy Bogislaw V, Duke of Pomerania in 1368, and existed until 1459, when it was inherited by Eric II of Pomerania-Wolgast. In 1474, it was merged to the partition of Bogislaw X, Duke of Pomerania, who four years later became the sole duke of Pomerania. - Lower Saxony is a German state (\\"Bundesland\\") situated in northwestern Germany and is second in area, with , and fourth in population (8 million) among the sixteen \\"Länder\\" of Germany. In rural areas Northern Low Saxon, a dialect of Low German, and Saterland Frisian, a variety of Frisian, are still spoken, but the number of speakers is declining. - The Duchy of Pomerania (, 12th century 1637) was a duchy in Pomerania on the southern coast of the Baltic Sea, ruled by dukes of the House of Pomerania (\\"Griffins\\"). - John V of Saxe - Lauenburg ( also numbered John IV ; 18 July 1439 -- 15 August 1507 ) was the eldest son of Duke Bernard II of Saxe - Lauenburg and Adelheid of Pomerania - Stolp ( * 1410 -- after 1445 * ) , daughter of Duke Bogislaus VIII of Pomerania - Stolp .

The district of Herzogtum Lauenburg is named after the former Duchy of Saxe-Lauenburg. - The Duchy of Pomerania was partitioned several times to satisfy the claims of the male members of the ruling House of Pomerania dynasty. The partitions were named after the ducal residences: Pomerania-Barth, -Demmin, -Rügenwalde, -Stettin, -Stolp, and -Wolgast. None of the partitions had a hereditary character, the members of the House of Pomerania inherited the duchy in common. The duchy thus continued to exist as a whole despite its division. The only exception was made during a war with the Margraviate of Brandenburg, when in 1338 Barnim III of Pomerania-Stettin was granted his partition as a fief directly from the Holy Roman Emperor, while Pomerania-Wolgast remained under formal Brandenburgian overlordship.

Choices: - nitrogen - solids - air - water A: Answer:","response":"Phospholipids are unable to mix with water. To understand why phospholipids cannot mix with water, it's essential to know their structure and properties. Phospholipids are a type of lipid molecule that plays a crucial role in the structure and function of cell membranes. They consist of a hydrophilic (water-loving) head and two hydrophobic (water-fearing) tails. The hydrophilic head contains a phosphate group, which is negatively charged and can form hydrogen bonds with water molecules. This property allows the head group to readily interact with water. On the other hand, the hydrophobic tails are made up of long chains of hydrocarbons that are nonpolar, meaning they lack an overall charge. Due to this, water molecules cannot form proper interactions with the hydrophobic tails, resulting in their aversion to water. When phospholipids come into contact with water, they spontaneously arrange themselves to form structures such as bilayers or micelles. In these structures, the hydrophilic heads face the water, while the hydrophobic tails are sequestered away from the water, effectively minimizing the contact between the hydrophobic tails and water molecules. This arrangement is incredibly stable and energetically favorable. It forms the foundation of the lipid bilayer found in cell membranes, which plays a vital role in maintaining cellular integrity and regulating the passage of chemicals into and out of the cell. In contrast, phospholipids can interact with other substances more readily, depending on their hydrophobic or hydrophilic nature. For instance, they can mix with other lipids (fats and oils) that have similar properties, particularly in their hydrophobic regions. This compatibility plays a crucial role in the formation of biological membranes, lipid droplets, and lipoprotein particles. In summary, phospholipids are unable to mix with water due to their unique structure, which consists of a hydrophilic head and two hydrophobic tails. This arrangement mainly contributes to the formation of lipid bilayers and biological membranes, making phospholipids essential components of living organisms."},{"question":"Are the following two questions the same?

Sleep is a necessary process that promotes proper body functioning and can improve the quality of your life. Not only is the quantity of sleep important, but also the quality of sleep. Your bedroom should be shaped to your taste and to allow you to sleep in a peaceful environment. One of the biggest mistakes people make in their sleep is to use their bedroom for activities other than sleep. If your bedroom also functions as a command station for your life and work, the likelihood of your sleeping being poor is rather high. Bedrooms should be designed, decorated and used for mainly sleep. TVs, computers and other things should not be in your bedroom if at all possible. Establishing regular sleeping and waking times can help improve the quality of your sleep especially for those suffering from sleeplessness. Avoid hot food, caffeine, sugar and alcohol at least 4 to 6 hours before your sleep time. Develop a regular exercise program. Proper exercise and nutrition will help improve sleeping patterns. However, avoid exercising 2 hours before sleeping, since this may stimulate your body and make sleeping more difficult. Establish a pre-bedtime rule that will help focus you on sleep. You can try meditation ,reading or deep breathing and relaxation. Your bedtime rule should be yours. Do not worry about it fitting into a specific category. Do what is the best for you. Things such as room temperature, noise and light levels and even your bed mattress can have a lot of effect on the quality of sleep that you experience. Block out distracting noises and lights.

Seeing the value in critical feedback and the lessons that failure can offer is a tough pill to swallow. For those confident in their capabilities, their social standing (in their companies/communities etc), and their abilities, the pill goes down a little easier. For those who experience imposter syndrome, feel insecure about their work, or are new in their careers, it is more difficult. Here’s the thing: these are not binary personalities. While some people are overly confident about themselves, and some people are overly insecure about themselves, most people have a blend of both. As such, even the most confident people can feel the sting when they get critical feedback or screw something up. This is a guide with some things I have learned over the years about how to turn feedback and failure to your advantage. In my not-so-humble opinion, the perfect blend of a human being is confidence in their ability to execute and accomplish their goals, but with a healthy dose of awareness of their current limitations. Let’s face it, overly confident people are often not just at risk of being swallowed up by ego, but can also lack the empathy to understand other folks they need to work with who don’t share the same confidence. An understanding of our current limitations is healthy. When we understand we are not great at something, but we are eager to learn and improve, it opens us up to counsel and tuition. The confidence piece plays an important role in helping us to remember: “I might suck now, but I am going to learn and get better”.

Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved. - Vienna is the capital and largest city of Austria and one of the nine states of Austria. Vienna is Austria's primary city, with a population of about 1.8 million (2.6 million within the metropolitan area, nearly one third of Austria's population), and its cultural, economic, and political centre. It is the 7th-largest city by population within city limits in the European Union. Until the beginning of the 20th century, it was the largest German-speaking city in the world, and before the splitting of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in World War I, the city had 2 million inhabitants. Today, it has the second largest number of German speakers after Berlin. Vienna is host to many major international organizations, including the United Nations and OPEC. The city is located in the eastern part of Austria and is close to the borders of the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary. These regions work together in a European Centrope border region. Along with nearby Bratislava, Vienna forms a metropolitan region with 3 million inhabitants. In 2001, the city centre was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. - The United Nations (UN) is an intergovernmental organization to promote international co-operation. A replacement for the ineffective League of Nations, the organization was established on 24 October 1945 after World War II in order to prevent another such conflict. At its founding, the UN had 51 member states; there are now 193. The headquarters of the United Nations is in Manhattan, New York City, and experiences extraterritoriality. Further main offices are situated in Geneva, Nairobi, and Vienna. The organization is financed by assessed and voluntary contributions from its member states. Its objectives include maintaining international peace and security, promoting human rights, fostering social and economic development, protecting the environment, and providing humanitarian aid in cases of famine, natural disaster, and armed conflict. - The Czech Republic, also known by the short name Czechia, is a nation state in Central Europe bordered by Germany to the west, Austria to the south, Slovakia to the east and Poland to the northeast.

Dominique Strauss-Kahn, 62, was denied bail by a Manhattan Criminal Court judge and remanded Monday to an 11-by-13-foot cell at New York's Rikers Island jail complex. There, the man whom many refer to as DSK was placed on suicide watch -- a common procedure in high-profile cases, two sources with direct knowledge of the case told CNN. The case has shaken the IMF, an organization of 187 countries working to improve world economies by providing loans and guidance. It has also shaken the political world in France, where the Socialist Party politician was considered a front-runner to unseat President Nicolas Sarkozy. But until his next court appearance Friday, Strauss-Kahn will neither be working to save world economies nor to endear himself to French voters. Instead, he will be largely left alone -- denied contact with other inmates because of his high-profile status, said a New York Department of Correction spokesman who declined to be named. Ahead of Tuesday's meeting to address the Greek debt burden, Spanish Finance Minister Elena Salgado said the alleged crimes of the IMF chief were \\"very serious\\" and suggested letting \\"justice take its course.\\" In Ireland, Minister of Foreign Affairs Eamon Gilmore called the incident a \\"disruption.\\" \\"There's no doubt that an event like that does cause a disruption in the functioning of a body like the IMF when its senior figure is arrested,\\" Gilmore said. \\"We have to wait and see how that works out, and we have to respect the legal process which is under way in New York.\\" British Foreign Secretary William Hague, who was with Gilmore in Dublin, told reporters he hopes the incident does not affect the \\"many important decisions ... before the IMF.\\" \\"At the moment it is important that it functions well,\\" Hague said. \\"So we look to all concerned to make sure that it does.\\" Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny said he was confident the scandal would not affect the organization's broader mission. \\"Ireland as a country deals with the IMF as an institution,\\" Kenny said. \\"We don't get involved in any individual situations.\\" In Washington, U.S. Sen. John Kerry told reporters the situation involving the IMF chief was \\"very troubling, if not damning.\\" \\"You've got to give it a few days to let that develop. But if the evidence is what it appears to be, I think it would be very difficult for him to manage.\\" On Tuesday, IMF spokesman William Murray said in a written statement that the IMF had had no contact with its leader since his arrest. In Strauss-Kahn's absence, First Deputy Managing Director John Lipsky has been named acting managing director, \\"and the fund continues its normal work,\\" Murray said. Murray also said Strauss-Kahn's diplomatic immunity does not apply in the sexual assault case. \\"The MD's (managing director) immunities are limited and are not applicable to this case,\\" he said. He added, however, that any IMF-related documents Strauss-Kahn may have had with him or left in the hotel room would be governed by diplomatic immunity and should be returned to the Washington-based organization. A former French finance minister, national legislator and economics professor in Paris, Strauss-Kahn became the IMF's 10th managing director in November 2007. He is also chairman of the IMF executive board. The alleged victim is a 32-year-old single mother living in the New York borough of the Bronx who moved to the United States from the West African country of Guinea. She had been working at the hotel for at least two years, according to her attorney, Jeffrey Shapiro. \\"Her world has been turned upside down,\\" he said. \\"She is very scared about her future.\\" Shapiro said his client is cooperating with police and prosecutors, and would be willing to testify against Strauss-Kahn. Strauss-Kahn's accuser picked the IMF chief out of a lineup Sunday at a New York police station, saying he was the man who had sexually assaulted her, according to a law enforcement source with direct knowledge of the investigation. \\"She's recovering -- slowly,\\" said Blake Diallo, the general manager of a Harlem restaurant she frequents, who described himself to reporters as her friend. The alleged attack began Saturday around noon, when the housekeeper entered Strauss-Kahn's 525 suite on the 28th floor of the Sofitel Hotel in Midtown to clean. New York Police Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne said the economist emerged naked from a room, ran down a hallway after the woman, and attacked her. He shut the door, preventing the woman from leaving, according to a criminal complaint released by prosecutors. \\"He grabbed the victim's chest without consent, attempted to remove her pantyhose\\" and forcibly grabbed her between her legs, the complaint said. He also forced her to perform oral sex on him, Assistant District Attorney John McConnell said at Monday's arraignment. The criminal complaint alleges that Strauss-Kahn forced the woman to engage \\"in oral sexual conduct and anal sexual conduct\\" and tried to force her to engage in sexual intercourse. He faces charges that include two counts of first-degree criminal sexual act, one count of first-degree attempted rape, one count of first-degree sexual abuse, one count of second-degree unlawful imprisonment, one count of forcible touching and one count of third-degree sexual abuse. The most serious charge, criminal sexual act in the first degree, carries a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison. Afterward, the employee went to the front desk, and staffers alerted police, Browne said. By the time officers arrived, Strauss-Kahn had left in the hotel limousine, according to the law enforcement source. He called the hotel around the same time police got to the hotel to say he had left his phone behind and asked if it could be delivered to him at the airport. Investigators told the hotel staff member to agree to do so and police went to the airport. Two plain-clothes Port Authority police detectives led him off the plane, the source said. Strauss-Kahn's attorneys pointed to their client's lack of a criminal record and the fact that his daughter lives in New York as evidence that he was not a flight risk. Defense attorney Benjamin Brafman called the case \\"very defensible.\\" But Criminal Court Judge Melissa Jackson sided with the prosecution in characterizing Strauss-Kahn as a flight risk and denying him bail. The impact of his arrest has perhaps been strongest in France, where Strauss-Kahn, where the Socialist Party leader had been considered a strong challenger to Sarkozy. But some observers said Tuesday that his political future appears bleak. \\"If the accusations are true, Strauss-Kahn will not be able to run for president,\\" said Jacques Attali, a political analyst and a former top aide to late Socialist President Francois Mitterrand. CNN's Susan Candiotti, Ivan Watson, Richard Roth, Saskya Vandoorne, Caroline Paterson, David Ariosto, Raelyn Johnson and Jim Bittermann contributed to this report.","response":"Austria's Finance Minister, Maria Fekter, has suggested that the head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Dominique Strauss-Kahn, should consider stepping down due to the charges of sexual assault he faces. Strauss-Kahn's bail was denied, and he is now in jail at New York's Rikers Island complex, with his next court appearance scheduled for Friday. The case has caused disruption in the IMF and has had repercussions in France, where Strauss-Kahn was a front-runner in the race to unseat President Nicolas Sarkozy. European finance ministers like Spain's Elena Salgado and Ireland's Eamon Gilmore have expressed their concerns regarding the case, allowing justice to take due course. The British Foreign Secretary, William Hague, has shown hope that the incident does not affect the critical decisions pending before the IMF and that the organization continues to function well. Although the case appears very troubling, U.S. Senator John Kerry believes that Strauss-Kahn should be given a few days to let the situation develop. However, the case raises questions about his ability to continue managing the IMF. In the meantime, First Deputy Managing Director John Lipsky has been named acting managing director, and the organization continues its normal operations. Dominique Strauss-Kahn's diplomatic immunity does not apply in the sexual assault case, but any IMF-related documents he possessed should be returned to the Washington-based organization. The alleged victim, a 32-year-old single mother from Guinea, is cooperating with the police and prosecution and is willing to testify against Strauss-Kahn.

In \\"stand the test of time,\\" the term \\"stand\\" is used in a metaphorical sense implying endurance, perseverance or resilience. It means something is long-lasting and remains unfaded despite time passing. This usage is more idiomatic. 2. In \\"She stands 6 feet tall,\\" the word \\"stand\\" is used in its literal sense denoting a person's height when they are upright or on their feet. This is the basic, physical use of the term. Therefore, when comparing these two sentences, \\"stand\\" is used differently - metaphorically in the first sentence, and literally in the second sentence.

The song was seen as a tribute to Geri Halliwell, and when it topped the UK Singles Chart it became their third consecutive Christmas number-one - equalling the record previously set by the Beatles. Later in 1998, Bunton and Chisholm appeared at the 1998 MTV Europe Music Awards without their other band members, and the group won two awards: \\"Best Pop Act\\" and \\"Best Group\\" for a second time. In late 1998, Brown and Adams announced they were both pregnant; Brown was married to dancer Jimmy Gulzer and became known as Mel G for a brief period. She gave birth to daughter Phoenix Chi in February 1999. One month later, Adams gave birth to son Brooklyn, whose father was then Manchester United footballer David Beckham. Later that year, she married Beckham in a highly publicised wedding in Ireland. The Spice Girls returned to the studio in August 1999, after an eight-month recording break to start work on their third and last studio album. The album's sound was initially more pop-influenced, similar to their first two albums, and included production from Eliot Kennedy. The album's sound took a mature direction when American producers like Rodney Jerkins, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis came on to collaborate with the group. In December 1999 they performed live for a UK-only tour, Christmas in Spiceworld, in London and Manchester, also showcasing new songs from the third album. During 1999, the group recorded the character Amneris' song \\"My Strongest Suit\\" in Elton John and Tim Rice's Aida, a concept album which would later go on to fuel the musical version of Verdi's Aida. The band performed again at the 2000 Brit Awards, where they received a Lifetime Achievement Award. Despite being at the event, Halliwell did not join her former bandmates on stage. In November 2000, the group released Forever. Sporting a new edgier R&B sound, the album received a lukewarm response from critics. In the US, the album peaked at number thirty-nine on the Billboard 200 albums chart. In the UK, the album was released the same week as Westlife's Coast to Coast album and the chart battle was widely reported by the media, where Westlife won the battle reaching number one in the UK, leaving the Spice Girls at number two. The lead single from Forever, the double A-side \\"Holler\\"/\\"Let Love Lead the Way\\", became the group's ninth number one single in the UK. However the song failed to break onto the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart stateside, instead peaking at number seven on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles. \\"Holler\\" did peak at number thirty-one on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart in 2000. The only major performance of the lead single came at the MTV Europe Music Awards on 16 November 2000. In total, Forever achieved only a fraction of the success of its two best-selling predecessors, selling five million copies. In December 2000, the group unofficially announced that they were beginning an indefinite hiatus and would be concentrating on their solo careers in regards to their foreseeable future, although they pointed out that the group was not splitting.

It is involved in the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into two important secondary messengers: inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). These secondary messengers play essential roles in various cellular processes such as cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. PLC consists of a large family of enzymes that are divided into six major classes, which include PLC-β, PLC-γ, PLC-δ, PLC-ε, PLC-ζ, and PLC-η, each with multiple isoforms. These PLC enzymes share conserved domains and possess unique regulatory properties. They can be activated by a variety of mechanisms, such as receptor activation, G-protein binding, or phosphorylation. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) is responsible for releasing calcium ions from intracellular stores, which in turn regulate various cellular processes such as muscle contraction, neurotransmitter release, and gene expression. Diacylglycerol (DAG) activates protein kinase C (PKC), a family of serine/threonine kinases that regulate numerous intracellular signaling pathways and cellular events, including cell survival, proliferation, and apoptosis. Dysregulation of PLC enzymes has been implicated in several pathological conditions, including cancers, neurological disorders, and cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying PLC function and regulation is crucial for developing targeted therapeutics to treat these diseases. In summary, phospholipase C is a critical enzyme that functions in the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and generates vital secondary messengers, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). These secondary messengers are indispensable for various cellular processes, making PLC a significant player in maintaining cellular function and signaling."},{"question":"Information: - Toulouse is the capital city of the southwestern French department of Haute-Garonne, as well as of the Occitanie region. The city lies on the banks of the River Garonne, from the Mediterranean Sea, from the Atlantic Ocean, and from Paris. It is the fourth-largest city in France with 466,297 inhabitants in January 2014. The Toulouse Metro area is, with 1 312 304 inhabitants as of 2014, France's 4th metropolitan area after Paris, Lyon and Marseille and ahead of Lille and Bordeaux. - Bordeaux (Gascon Occitan: \\"\\") is a port city on the Garonne River in the Gironde department in southwestern France. - The term cult usually refers to a social group defined by their religious, spiritual, or philosophical beliefs, or common interest in a particular personality, object or goal. The term itself is controversial and has divergent definitions in popular culture and in academia and has been an ongoing source of contention among scholars across several fields of study. In the sociological classifications of religious movements, a cult is a social group with socially deviant or novel beliefs and practices, although this is often unclear. Other researchers present a less-organized picture of cults on the basis that cults arise spontaneously around novel beliefs and practices. The word \\"cult\\" has always been controversial because it is (in a pejorative sense) considered a subjective term, used as an \\"ad hominem\\" attack against groups with differing doctrines or practices. Cults range in size from local groups with a few members to international organizations with millions. - The United States Army (USA) is the largest branch of the United States Armed Forces and performs land-based military operations. It is one of the seven uniformed services of the United States and is designated as the Army of the United States in the United States Constitution, Article 2, Section 2, Clause 1 and United States Code, Title 10, Subtitle B, Chapter 301, Section 3001. As the largest and senior branch of the U.S. military, the modern U.S. Army has its roots in the Continental Army, which was formed (14 June 1775) to fight the American Revolutionary War (17751783)before the U.S. was established as a country. After the Revolutionary War, the Congress of the Confederation created the United States Army on 3 June 1784, to replace the disbanded Continental Army. The United States Army considers itself descended from the Continental Army, and dates its institutional inception from the origin of that armed force in 1775. - The Rhine (, , ) is a European river that begins in the Swiss canton of Graubünden in the southeastern Swiss Alps, forms part of the Swiss-Austrian, Swiss-Liechtenstein, Swiss-German and then the Franco-German border, then flows through the Rhineland and eventually empties into the North Sea in the Netherlands.

By land area, it is the second largest region of France and the largest outermost region within the European Union. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits.

It comprised delegates appointed by the legislatures or assemblies of the several states. It was preceded by the Second Continental Congress (17751781) and governed under the newly adopted \\"Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union\\", which were proposed 17761777, adopted by the Continental Congress in July 1778 and finally agreed to by a unanimous vote of all thirteen states by 1781, held up by a long dispute over the cession of western territories beyond the Appalachian Mountains to the central government led by Maryland and a coalition of smaller states without western claims. The newly reorganized Congress at the time continued to refer itself as the Continental Congress throughout its eight-year history, although modern historians separate it from the earlier bodies, which operated under slightly different rules and procedures until the later part of American Revolutionary War. The membership of the Second Continental Congress automatically carried over to the Congress of the Confederation when the latter was created by the ratification of the Articles of Confederation. It had the same secretary as the Second Continental Congress, namely Charles Thomson. The Congress of the Confederation was succeeded by the Congress of the United States as provided for in the Constitution of the United States, proposed September 17, 1787, in Philadelphia and ratified by the states through 1787 to 1788 and even into 1789 and 1790. - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about .

They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out. From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council. - Military personnel are members of the armed forces. Usually, personnel are divided into military branches roughly defined by certain circumstances of their deployment. Those who serve in a typical large land force are soldiers, making up an army. Those who serve in seagoing forces are seamen or sailors, and their branch is a navy or coast guard . Marines serve in a marine corps. In the 20th century, the development of powered flight aircraft prompted the development of air forces, serviced by airmen. Designated leaders of military personnel are officers. These include commissioned officers, warrant officers and non-commissioned officers (NCOs). For naval forces, non-commissioned officers are referred to as petty officers (POs). military personnel are instructed to wear dog tags - Trench warfare is a type of land warfare using occupied fighting lines consisting largely of trenches, in which troops are significantly protected from the enemy's small arms fire and are substantially sheltered from artillery. The most famous use of trench warfare is the Western Front in World War I. It has become a byword for stalemate, attrition, sieges and futility in conflict. - The Continental Army was formed by the Second Continental Congress after the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War by the colonies that became the United States of America. Established by a resolution of the Congress on June 14, 1775, it was created to coordinate the military efforts of the Thirteen Colonies in their revolt against the rule of Great Britain. The Continental Army was supplemented by local militias and troops that remained under control of the individual states or were otherwise independent. General George Washington was the commander-in-chief of the army throughout the war. - A republic (from ) is a sovereign state, country, or government which is organized with a form of government in which power resides in elected individuals representing the citizen body and government leaders exercise power according to the rule of law. In modern times, the definition of a republic commonly refers to a government which excludes a monarch. Currently, 147 of the world's 206 sovereign states use the word \\"republic\\" as part of their official names; not all of these are republics in the sense of having elected governments, nor do all nations with elected governments use the word \\"republic\\" in their names. - The English Channel (\\"the Sleeve\\" [hence ] \\"Sea of Brittany\\" \\"British Sea\\"), also called simply the Channel, is the body of water that separates southern England from northern France, and joins the southern part of the North Sea to the rest of the Atlantic Ocean. - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved. - In general, a civilian is \\"a person who is not a member of the military or of a police or firefighting force\\", as defined by Merriam Webster's Dictionary. From the perspective of the U.S. Department of Defense, Chapter 18 of Title 10 United States Code refers to non-military law enforcement officers as civilians since they are employees rather than enlisted personnel, and also in order to distinguish itself from military police.

She encounters Howl's moving castle, where she meets Howl's young apprentice, Markl, and the fire-demon Calcifer, who is the source of the castle's energy and magic. When Howl appears, Sophie announces that Calcifer has hired her as a cleaning lady for the house. Meanwhile, Sophie's country is caught up in a war with a neighboring country. The King summons Howl to fight in the war; however, Howl decides to send Sophie to the King under the pretense of being his mother, to tell the king that Howl is too much of a coward to fight. Before leaving, he gives to Sophie a charmed ring that connects her to Calcifer. Sophie meets Suliman, the king's advisor, and also the Witch of the Waste, whom Suliman punishes by draining all of her power, causing her to regress into a harmless old woman. Suliman says that Howl will meet the same fate if he does not fight; Sophie protests passionately in his defense, allowing Suliman to see Sophie's true form, and to realize that she has feelings for Howl. Howl arrives to rescue Sophie; Suliman tries to trap him, but with Sophie's help, they escape along with the former witch. Sophie learns that Howl has been transforming into a bird-like creature in order to interfere with the plans of both sides in the war, but each transformation makes it more difficult for him to return to human form. Sophie's mother â under Suliman's control â arrives and leaves behind a \\"peeping bug.\\" The former witch promptly destroys the bug by tossing it into Calcifer, who then becomes sick and weak and unable to protect the castle. A few hours later the city is bombed by enemy aircraft. Suliman's henchmen invade the group's abode. After healing Calcifer, Howl tells Sophie that he is not going to leave because he wants to protect her....

The sun beat down on the wet-looking asphalt road that ran along the harbor, next to the concrete waterfront. It curved along in front of the brightly colored Dutch Colonial warehouses of Charlotte Amalie, which were now converted restaurants and jewel shops. Tourists in day-glo shirts and daubs of sunscreen rubbed over peeling skin crowded both sides of the waterfront road. Manny slowed somewhat, keeping an eye on them. On the sidewalk by the shops a tall black man stood by a food cart. The hand-painted wooden sign hanging from the cart's side had faded letters. The man wore a grand suit with tails, like an orchestra conductor, and a top hat perched on his shaved head. A cigar burned in his mouth. For a brief second he held Manny's attention. Then the food cart's owner stepped forward and the strangely dressed man disappeared. Manny looked at the other side of the road. A white girl with oval shaped sunglasses and pink leather pants stepped off the sidewalk into the road in front of his van. He slammed on the brakes, trying to dodge her, but the van couldn't respond that fast. Her ponytail flew up towards the windshield and her head struck the star-shaped hood ornament. She bounced along the asphalt. Manny weaved the van to a stop, with swearing from the passengers in the back. He opened the door and stepped out into the heat. Get up, stand up, the radio cried out, and that was what Manny hoped would happen. He hoped that she would at least just stir and be okay. But she just lay there. Question: Why did Manny slow down? Options: A. not enough information B. the food cart owner stepped forward C. the boy stepped off the sidewalk D. tourists were on the road === The correct answer is Answer:","response":"D. tourists were on the road"},{"question":"Here is a premise: \\"A family walking with three pieces of luggage.\\" Here is a hypothesis: \\"Nobody is walking\\" .Does the premise tell us whether the hypothesis is true?","response":"The premise states, \\"A family walking with three pieces of luggage.\\" This statement provides us with information regarding a family who are in the process of walking and are carrying three pieces of luggage with them. The key points to consider in this premise involve a family (which consists of one or more individuals), a walking action, and three pieces of luggage. On the other hand, the hypothesis states, \\"Nobody is walking.\\" This is a claim that indicates a complete lack of individuals participating in the act of walking. The hypothesis implies the absence of any walking activity being carried out by any person. Now, let's analyze the relationship between the premise and hypothesis to determine if the premise provides us with enough information to evaluate the truthfulness of the hypothesis. When we look at both statements, they seem to be contradictory to each other. The premise clearly mentions that a family is walking which means that there are people involved in the act of walking. In direct opposition to this, the hypothesis suggests that nobody is walking. As such, based on the given premise, we can conclude that the hypothesis is false. The premise does tell us whether the hypothesis is true or not, and in this case, it indicates that the hypothesis is not accurate. The premise clearly states that there is a family involved in walking and carrying luggage, which ultimately demonstrates that the hypothesis claiming \\"Nobody is walking\\" is incorrect."},{"question":"Context: The last action of the war was on the part of the Catalan barons of Roussillon and Cerdagne, which had been assigned to France as surety for war subsidies. The French were only slowly expelled. On 1 February 1473, John entered Perpignan to the joy of its citizens. He placed Catalan garrisons in the castles of Bellegarde, Collioure, and Salses. The French, angered by the abridgement of the treaty of Bayonne, counter-attacked a few weeks later, but some Castilian troops under Prince Ferdinand successfully resisted. John began negotiations that led to a truce in July and a treaty at Perpignan on 17 September. John recognised the treaty of Bayonne in return for French recognition of his sovereignty in the disputed provinces. John agreed to pay 300,000 écus, and Roussillon and Cerdagne were proclaimed \\"neutral\\" until the payment was made. John returned to Barcelona triumphant, but failed to raise the necessary funds. In the summer of 1474 the French conquered Roussillon and March 1475 Perpignan fell to them. The French raided the Empordà as far as Girona in 1476, and John, his allies tied up by their own wars, could not even oppose them. In October 1478 he ceded the two provinces to France until he could redeem them with cash. Revolts against his authority flared in Aragon and Valencia, which had stayed out of the civil war, and he failed to put them down. He did succeed in quashing a revolt in Sardinia. Question: What happened first, the entrance of John to Perpignan, or the placement of the garrisons? Answer:","response":"The entrance of John to Perpignan happened first. It is mentioned that \\"On 1 February 1473, John entered Perpignan to the joy of its citizens.\\" Afterward, he placed Catalan garrisons in the castles of Bellegarde, Collioure, and Salses."},{"question":"Q:Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

One of his wife's patients is brought in unconscious. Joe hears the child calling his name and follows the staff who are trying to revive him without success - the childÂ´s heart flatlines. As Joe approaches the child, suddenly the heart begins beating again. The following afternoon Joe returns to the child who asks him if he is \\"Emily's Joe\\" and tells him she sent him back to tell Joe something. All over the room are drawings of a curvy cross, but the boy doesn't know what the symbol means. The boy tells about his near death experience, that he saw a light, and a woman showing him an image of Joe, and that the cross symbol was what he saw at the end of the rainbow. Later, while passing by another child's room, Joe sees the same drawing. That boy immediately knows who Joe is and tells him that he must \\"go to the rainbow\\". When Joe arrives at home, his parrot mysteriously goes into a rage breaking a pot making the same wavy cross symbol drawn in the spilled soil on the floor.

Here's the equation: 212 = 15965f - 15974f - 67 1. Combine the terms with the variable 'f': 212 = -9f - 67 2. Add 67 to both sides to isolate the terms with 'f' on one side and constants on the other side: 212 + 67 = -9f 279 = -9f 3. Divide both sides by -9 to solve for 'f': 279 / -9 = -9f / -9 -31 = f So, the solution is f = -31."}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.question&&e.question.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.response&&e.response.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},W={class:"search-container"},H={class:"card-container"},D={key:0,class:"empty-state"},N=["disabled"],R={key:0},E={key:1};function F(n,e,h,m,o,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",W,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",H,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(p,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",D,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
