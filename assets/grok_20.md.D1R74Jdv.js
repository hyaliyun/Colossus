During the 2017 NFL Scouting Combine, Ross achieved this feat with an unprecedented time of 4.22 seconds. This record-breaking performance occurred on March 4, 2017. In the world of professional American football, the 40-yard dash is an important evaluative tool. It is mainly used to assess the speed and acceleration of players, especially wide receivers and defensive backs. The result can have a significant effect on a player's attractiveness to teams and their draft position. Running this short distance in the quickest time possible is such an influential factor because it is typically representative of a player's speed for the majority of plays in a game. Prior to 2017, the record was held by running back Chris Johnson. At the 2008 NFL Combine, Johnson ran the 40-yard dash with a record-setting time of 4.24 seconds. This record stood for nearly a decade until Ross' performance. John Ross, a wide receiver, played college football at the University of Washington. His performance at the 2017 Combine dramatically improved his draft stock, leading to him being the ninth overall pick in the 2017 NFL Draft, selected by the Cincinnati Bengals. Despite this impressive performance during the Combine, it's worth noting that success in the 40-yard dash doesn't always translate to professional success on the field. While Ross has demonstrated his incredible speed time and again on the gridiron, he's also struggled with injuries during his professional career which has impacted his consistency and overall contributions to his team. Finally, it's important to highlight the gravity of Ross's achievement. Every year, over 300 of the top college football players in the USA are invited to participate in the Combine, which is conducted in Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis. Over the years, the 40-yard dash has seen only incremental improvements. Therefore, any athlete breaking a long-standing record as Ross did is certainly noteworthy within football chronicles. The athletes compete in several drill and tests, and the 40-yard dash is one of the most exciting and premium ones due to its high stakes and high visibility. And holding the record in such an influential drill certainly cements John Ross' place in the annals of football history."},{"question":"Answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"What might underlie the diversity of neighborhoods in the city?\\" is in \\"The city has many distinct neighborhoods.

The attorneys filed a motion asking U.S. District Judge David L. Bunning to order deputy clerks to use the state's standard form for marriage licenses. Davis disagrees with same-sex marriage, saying it conflicts with her conservative Christian views. After the U.S. Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage, she stopped issuing any marriage licenses so she wouldn't have to give one to a gay couple. She went to jail for five days in defiance of Bunning's order to issue licenses. After a deputy clerk began issuing licenses and Bunning let Davis out of jail, she altered the standard license forms when she returned to her job on Sept. 14. She made a new form that does not include her name or the name of the office, and instructed deputies to issue licenses as notaries public, not as county officials, according to court records. That violates Bunning's order for Davis not to interfere with her deputies issuing licenses, the American Civil Liberties Union argued in the new motion. The altered forms carry Davis' \\"stamp of animus\\" against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people and signal that in Rowan County, members of that community are second-class citizens, the ACLU argued. The motion seeks an order for deputy clerks to use the marriage license forms available before Davis changed them and to disregard instructions from Davis to alter the forms. It also wants Davis' office to issue new, unaltered forms to any couples who received licenses since Sept. 14. The motion asks Bunning to warn Davis that further violations will bring sanctions, including receivership of the office for the limited purpose of issuing marriage licenses, and stiff fines. \\"It's sad that Ms. Davis has continued to interfere with the basic constitutional right of all loving couples to marry and that the plaintiff couples have to ask the court to intervene once again,\\" said James Esseks, director of the ACLU's Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Project. Bill Estep: (606) 678-4655. Twitter: @billestep1 ||||| FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) — She's already spent five days in jail, and now a Kentucky clerk could be back in court soon for altering marriage license forms issued to same-sex couples. FILE - In this Tuesday, Sept. 8, 2015, file photo, Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis, with Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee at her side, greets the crowd after being released from the Carter... (Associated Press) Monday, lawyers for two gay couples and two straight couples questioned the validity of the new marriage licenses and asked a federal judge to order Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis' office to reissue them. If she refuses, the lawyers asked the judge to put the office in receivership and have someone else do it. Davis stopped issuing all marriage licenses in June after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling effectively legalized gay marriage nationwide. Two gay couples and two straight couples sued her. A federal judge ordered Davis to issue the licenses, and the U.S. Supreme Court upheld that order. But Davis refused, citing \\"God's authority.\\" That's when U.S. District Court Judge David Bunning threw her in jail, prompting a fierce debate in the public square about religious liberty versus the civil rights afforded to all U.S. citizens. Davis' office issued marriage licenses while she was in jail, but the licenses did not include her name. Bunning ruled those licenses were valid and released Davis on the condition that she not interfere with her employees. Davis, a Democrat, was greeted at the Carter County Detention Center by a crowd of thousands and a church choir, flanked by her attorney and Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee. But when Davis returned to work last week, she confiscated the marriage licenses and replaced them. The new licenses say they were issued not under the authority of the county clerk, but \\"pursuant to federal court order.\\" Davis said this accommodation preserves her conscience while also granting licenses to same-sex couples. But on Monday, lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union wrote that the validity of the altered licenses is \\"questionable at best,\\" and the new licenses bring \\"humiliation and stigma\\" to the gay couples who receive them. They asked Judge Bunning to order Davis' office to reissue the licenses. If Davis interferes, the lawyers say Bunning should place her office in a receivership for the purposes of issuing marriage licenses. \\"The adulterated marriage licenses received by Rowan County couples will effectively feature a stamp of animus against the LGBT community, signaling that, in Rowan County, the government's position is that LGBT couples are second-class citizens unworthy of official recognition and authorization of their marriage licenses but for this Court's intervention and Order,\\" the lawyers for the couples wrote in a court filing. Mat Staver, Davis' attorney and founder of the Liberty Counsel law firm, did not directly respond to the ACLU's request for Bunning to put the office in a receivership. Staver said he would formally respond to the ACLU's motion Tuesday. But he noted that Democratic Gov. Steve Beshear said last week the altered marriage licenses would be recognized by the state. \\"Kim Davis has made a good-faith effort to comply with the court's order,\\" Staver said. \\"The ACLU's motion to again hold Kim Davis in contempt reveals that their interest is not the license but rather a marriage license bearing the name of Kim Davis. They want her scalp to hang on the wall as a trophy.\\" Sam Marcosson, a constitutional law professor at the University of Louisville, said such receiverships are \\"unusual and extraordinary,\\" and are generally reserved for situations where other legal remedies are unable to end an ongoing violation of the law. Marcosson described what the plaintiffs are now requesting as a \\"limited takeover\\" of her office. The judge could appoint another person to oversee the issuance of marriage licenses, both to ensure that the licenses are issued legally and to protect the deputy clerks, who are now left with the difficult choice to either defy their boss or defy a judge. \\"It's almost a worst-case scenario,\\" he said. \\"The worst case scenario would be to send her to jail again.\\" The judge has wide discretion on who might be appointed. It could be a lawyer, another Rowan County public official or any citizen the judge trusts to carry out his orders impartially, Marcosson said. He said the judge will likely call a hearing, where he might hear testimony about the process Davis undertook to alter the licenses or the instructions she gave to her deputy clerks. ||||| After spending nearly a month in the public eye, Kim Davis has agreed to her first formal interviews. The divisive Kentucky county clerk will appear on the Sept. 22 episode of ABC's Good Morning America and the Sept. 23 episode of Fox News Channel's The Kelly File. ABC News will tease its Kentucky visit between Paula Faris and Davis on Monday's World News Tonight, while Megyn Kelly will interview Davis from her New York studio. She'll question Davis on whether or not she not she disobeyed a federal judge’s order regarding altering the marriage license forms of same-sex couples. Davis achieved instant celebrity earlier in September, several months after the Supreme Court's ruling in favor of gay marriage prompted her refusal to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples on account of her religious beliefs. She was held in contempt of court in September, spending five days in jail. The time since has seen her become a lightening rod for Republican presidential candidates — even figuring into one question during CNN's recent debate. Faris recently upped her ABC News workload, joining the panel of the ever-evolving The View. And for Kelly, it's another booking coup in what's proving to be a banner year. The Kelly File host, who enjoyed a month atop the cable news ratings heap in August after her showing in the first GOP debate, previously got an exclusive with reality stars Michelle and Jim Bob Duggar when allegations about their adult son's sexual misconduct came to light. That sit-down earned Kelly 3.1 million viewers. Davis, who has not been shy about giving press conferences, has yet to speak at length with any national news organization.

That’s everybody’s opinion and that’s everybody’s right,\\" Davis told ABC News. Davis said she's been \\"called Hitler, I’ve been called [a] hypocrite, I’ve been called a homophobe.\\" \\"I’ve been called things and names that I didn’t even say when I was in the world. Those names don’t hurt me,\\" Davis said. \\"What probably hurt me the worst is when someone tells me that my God does not love me or that my God is not happy with me, that I am a hypocrite of a Christian.\\" Davis' attorney, Mathew Staver, was also present for the interview. Earlier this month, Davis was jailed for nearly one week after she refused a judge's order to issue marriage licenses in Rowan County, Kentucky, including to same-sex couples. When Davis returned to work one week ago, she said she wanted her name and title removed from the licenses being issued by her office.

The scenario paints a vivid picture of a woman who is likely delighted because of a present that she has opened, likely during a special occasion or event. The hypothesis, on the other hand, is a simple statement about a woman being seated on a couch. It doesn't mention any specific details about the woman, such as her clothing or facial expressions. The hypothesis does not provide any additional context about the room or the situation the woman might be in. Despite these differences, it is clear that the hypothesis is true when we compare it to the premise. The premise contains all the information needed to confirm the hypothesis. According to the premise, a woman in a red shirt and eyeglasses is, indeed, seated on a beige couch. As the hypothesis only seeks to establish whether a woman is seated on a couch, we can easily deduce that the detailed premise supports the simple hypothesis as true."},{"question":"Q: You are given a sentence in Japanese.

He is remembered for his handling of the Black Sox scandal, in which he expelled eight members of the Chicago White Sox from organized baseball for conspiring to lose the 1919 World Series and repeatedly refused their reinstatement requests. His firm actions and iron rule over baseball in the near quarter-century of his commissionership are generally credited with restoring public confidence in the game. In March 1893, President Grover Cleveland appointed federal judge Walter Q. Gresham as his Secretary of State, and Gresham hired Landis as his personal secretary. Gresham had a long career as a political appointee in the latter part of the 19th century; though he lost his only two bids for elective office, he served in three Cabinet positions and was twice a dark horse candidate for the Republican presidential nomination. Although Gresham was a Republican, he had supported Cleveland (a Democrat) in the 1892 election because of his intense dislike for the Republican nominee, President Benjamin Harrison. Kenesaw Landis had appeared before Judge Gresham in court. According to Landis biographer J.G. Taylor Spink, Gresham thought Landis \\"had something on the ball\\" and believed that Landis's shorthand skills would be of use. In Washington, Landis worked hard to protect Gresham's interests in the State Department, making friends with many members of the press. He was less popular among many of the Department's senior career officials, who saw him as brash. When word leaked concerning President Cleveland's Hawaiian policy, the President was convinced Landis was the source of the information and demanded his dismissal. Gresham defended Landis, stating that Cleveland would have to fire both of them, and the President relented, later finding out that he was mistaken in accusing Landis. President Cleveland grew to like Landis, and when Gresham died in 1895, offered Landis the post of United States Ambassador to Venezuela. Landis declined the diplomatic post, preferring to return to Chicago to begin a law practice and to marry Winifred Reed, daughter of the Ottawa, Illinois postmaster. The two married July 25, 1895; they had two surviving children, a boy, Reed, and a girl, Susanne--a third child, Winifred, died almost immediately after being born. Landis built a corporate law practice in Chicago; with the practice doing well, he deeply involved himself in Republican Party politics. He built a close association with his friend Lowden and served as his campaign manager for governor of Illinois in 1904. Lowden was defeated, but would later serve two terms in the office and be a major contender for the 1920 Republican presidential nomination. A seat on the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois was vacant; President Theodore Roosevelt offered it to Lowden, who declined it and recommended Landis. Other recommendations from Illinois politicians followed, and Roosevelt nominated Landis for the seat. According to Spink, President Roosevelt wanted \\"a tough judge and a man sympathetic with his viewpoint in that important court\\"; Lowden and Landis were, like Roosevelt, on the progressive left of the Republican Party. On March 18, 1905, Roosevelt transmitted the nomination to the Senate, which confirmed Landis the same afternoon, without any committee hearing. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What remarkable achievements did he achieve in his period there?","response":"Kenesaw Mountain Landis achieved remarkable things during his time as the first Commissioner of Baseball. He is known for his handling of the Black Sox scandal, where he expelled eight members of the Chicago White Sox from organized baseball for conspiring to lose the 1919 World Series.

Tweet:@purplesime no worries, glad you like them now go and tell all your friends that they missed out on the 40%!","response":"The sentiment of this tweet can be described as positive. This determination comes from a few elements within the tweet, all of which contribute to its overall positive tone. First, the phrase \\"no worries\\" is an expression that conveys a sense of reassurance and understanding. It implies that the user is letting the recipient know that there is no reason for concern or stress, which is clearly a positive message. Second, the user mentions that they are \\"glad\\" the recipient likes something (likely referring to a product or service based on the text). The use of the word \\"glad\\" suggests that the user is expressing happiness or contentment with the fact that the recipient enjoyed their experience. This amplifies the positive sentiment of the tweet. In addition, the statement \\"now go and tell all your friends that they missed out on the 40%!\\" can also be taken as positive for a couple of reasons. The exclamation point signifies excitement and enthusiasm, which can be regarded as a pleasant emotion. Also, these words can be viewed as a prompt for the recipient to share their positive experience with others, further spreading the sentiment of satisfaction and joy. It's essential to note that while the expression \\"they missed out on the 40%\\" might seem like it could convey a negative sentiment, it isn't the focus of the tweet. Instead, it's being used to emphasize the exclusivity of the offer, making the recipient feel special and potentially provoking excitement to share the news with others. In summary, this tweet communicates a positive sentiment through expressing reassurance, happiness, and excitement. The combination of these elements creates an overall amiable and upbeat tone, motivating the recipient to share their positive experience with others."},{"question":"If \\"A pitcher on the mound about to throw the ball.\\", does this mean that \\"The man is wearing a white baseball uniform.\\"?","response":"Well, a pitcher on the mound about to throw the ball means that a person is standing on a special raised area in a baseball game, getting ready to throw the baseball.

The earliest known execution of a prisoner for crimes committed as a juvenile was Thomas Graunger in 1642. Twenty-two of the executions occurred after 1976, in seven states. Due to the slow process of appeals, it was highly unusual for a condemned person to be under 18 at the time of execution. The youngest person to be executed in the 20th century was George Stinney, who was electrocuted in South Carolina at the age of 14 on June 16, 1944. The last execution of a juvenile may have been Leonard Shockley, who died in the Maryland gas chamber on April 10, 1959, at the age of 17. No one has been under age 19 at time of execution since at least 1964. Since the reinstatement of the death penalty in 1976, 22 people have been executed for crimes committed under the age of 18. Twenty-one were 17 at the time of the crime. The last person to be executed for a crime committed as a juvenile was Scott Hain on April 3, 2003 in Oklahoma. In what year was Thomas Graunger freed?

Understand what factors affect corn production: To predict price movements of corn, you need to be aware of the factors that influence corn production, such as: a. Weather: Weather patterns significantly impact crop outcomes, specifically temperature and rainfall levels during the growth stages. Unfavorable weather conditions can limit or damage corn production, causing prices to spike wildly. b. Technology and farming practices: Advances in technology and farming practices, such as genetically modified crops and precision agriculture, can also impact corn production and prices. c. Government policies and subsidies: Agriculture is heavily regulated, and government policies and subsidies can directly impact the supply side of corn. d. Demand factors: Factors influencing global and regional demand, such as population growth, dietary trends, and biofuel production, can impact corn prices. 2. Monitor corn prices and market trends: Stay informed about the corn commodity market by checking price charts and market news regularly. Following agricultural news sources, you will help you identify trends and upcoming events with potential implications on corn prices. 3.

Futures and options: These are contracts traded on the commodities exchanges, which allow you to speculate on the future price of corn.

Stocks: Another way to invest in corn is by buying stocks of companies involved in the agriculture sector, such as seed producers, fertilizers, and agricultural equipment manufacturers. 5. Employ sound risk management practices: When investing in corn commodities, carefully assess your risk tolerance and financial goals. Set stop-loss orders and have a clear entry and exit strategy for each trade. Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to maintain a healthy balance between potential risks and rewards.

A series of murders of rich young women throughout the area of Globe, Arizona bear the distinctive signature of a serial killer. Clues lead Detective Charles Mendoza to visit Paul White, a sound expert installing hi-fi systems in wealthy people's homes. His special talent is to make a noise which echoes through the air cavities in his head and shows him where the sound of the speakers should come from and echo in the room. He is married to Joan, whom, ten years earlier, he had seduced away from Mike DeSantos, who was her then boyfriend. Joan and Paul have a daughter, Danielle, together. Paul, installing equipment at Dr. Sutter's home, proximal to the most-recent murder, is approached by Detective Mendoza-- they have a cordial conversation about sound equipment, but it turns abruptly, when Mendoza asks Paul if he still hunts. Mendoza questions Paul about whether he knew the victim, and then asks him about the tires on his van-- a tread pattern that has been located at the scene of the murder. Mendoza meets with his partner Phil at the police station, where Phil has gathered criminal record information on Paul-- they speculate on what kind of person he might be based on that information. Mendoza, working from photos of the crime scene, begins to identify some aspects of the killer's M/O. Paul visits Fred, proprietor of the local diner-- Fred mentions that Ann Mason has been asking after Paul, ostensibly to work on her satellite system.

Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: Anger Management Movie plot: In 1979, a hot day in the city finds a whole neighborhood of kids and adults relaxing out doors on the street. A nerdy young boy in love with a beautiful girl is about to receive his first kiss. Just then, the local bully yanks down the boy's shorts and underwear, humiliating him to the laughter of the entire crowd.In the present, timid businessman Dave Buznik (Adam Sandler) works for a pet clothing company in New York City. His abrasive boss Frank Head (Kurt Fuller) takes credit for Dave's money-making work and steps on him in return. His loving girlfriend, Linda (Marisa Tomei) is supportive but wishes he would stand up for himself. Her college friend, Andrew (Allen Covert), wants to date her and treats Dave like a loser. Dave just wants to avoid conflict (and any hint of public affection.)When an inflight misunderstanding with a stewardess goes haywire, Dave is ordered by Judge Daniels (Lynne Thigpen) to undergo anger management therapy at the hands of unorthodox specialist Dr. Buddy Rydell (Jack Nicholson).At his first anger management group meeting, self-effacing Dave is certain he doesn't belong there and asks Buddy to let him out of the course. Odd and volatile characters such as Nate (Jonathan Loughran), Lou (Luis Guzmán), and Chuck (John Turturro) startle him. Buddy pushes Dave hard until Dave actually starts shouting. At the end of the meeting, Buddy says Dave needs to be there. He also arranges for him to pair up with eccentric Chuck for mutual support.As Dave prepares for a romantic evening with Linda, Chuck turns up on his doorstep and insists Dave fulfill his support duties. They go to a restaurant, Chuck picks a fight for no reason ... and Dave ends up back in court on charges of assaulting a waitress and a blind man (Harry Dean Stanton). Judge Daniels orders Dave to step up his therapy or wind up in jail. Buddy decides to move in with Dave for intensive treatment.Buddy's obnoxious behavior includes everything from throwing out Dave's CDs, nudity, sleeping with Dave in his bed (and farting),... My question: What does the judge give Dave? Answer:","response":"The plot summary doesn't explicitly state what the judge gives Dave. However, it mentions that Judge Daniels orders Dave to step up his therapy or wind up in jail after the incident at the restaurant. So, the judge effectively gives Dave an ultimatum: to intensify his anger management therapy sessions with Dr. Buddy Rydell or face imprisonment."},{"question":"Process: - A forest fire starts - The fire surrounds the vicinity - The animals are trapped - Those that survive have their habitat destroyed - The survivors must find a new habitat - Conflict with other animals occur. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the ice cubes will be prepared happens, how will it affect there are less fires. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","response":"In this scenario, the process you describe involves a forest fire starting, animals getting trapped and their habitat being destroyed, and the eventual conflict among survivor animals in search of new habitats. The perturbation hypothesis introduces the idea that ice cubes will be prepared, and the question is whether this event will have any effect on the occurrence of forest fires and their impacts on wildlife. The preparation of ice cubes does not have a direct impact on forest fires. Ice cubes are typically made in a domestic setting for use in beverages and similar applications. They do not play a significant role in forest fire prevention or management. To reduce the number of forest fires, it would be necessary to implement other strategies, such as controlled burns, public education on fire safety, and reducing human-caused ignition sources. However, there may be an indirect effect of ice cube preparation on forest fires in specific scenarios. For example, if a person were to use the ice cubes to help keep themselves hydrated while working on forest fire prevention efforts, such as clearing flammable brush or planting more fire-resistant vegetation. Hydration can help that person to stay more focused and efficient at their tasks, which might contribute somewhat to reducing the risk of a forest fire occurring. In summary, the preparation of ice cubes has no direct effect on forest fires or their impacts on wildlife. While there could be a potential indirect effect if ice cubes are used to help individuals stay hydrated and more effective during forest fire prevention tasks, this connection is quite tenuous. Other interventions should be considered for reducing the occurrence and impacts of forest fires."},{"question":"As a new year is just around the corner, I, like many of you, am taking stock in my life.

A former patient of the accused has come forward, describing him as a \\"sexual predator who knows how to handle people like me\\". This scandal has shone a spotlight on the need to reevaluate mental healthcare practices, patient safety, and advocate for stronger regulations in the field of psychiatry. Details of the case: A recently filed court case contains several shocking allegations against a well-known psychiatrist, including multiple accounts of rape and assault. The unnamed practitioner, who has been in practice for over 20 years, has been put under scrutiny following a series of complaints from his former patients. The most harrowing testimony comes from a woman who had sought psychiatric help from the accused over the years. She detailed her experiences, saying, \\"I wanted to believe that he was there to help me. But unfortunately, I found out that he was there to prey on my vulnerabilities. He used my emotional struggles against me, manipulating me into submission, knowing full well that people like me were easy targets.\\" Expressing her anger and betrayal, the woman now hopes her experiences can help enact positive change for patient protection. Investigation and potential consequences: Given the severity of the case, authorities have initiated a thorough investigation into the allegations. Healthcare boards and psychiatric societies have also been called upon to thoroughly review the professional conduct and certification status of the accused psychiatrist. If found guilty, the psychiatrist could face prison time, lifetime travel restrictions, a revoked license to practice, and damages payable to the victims. Some members of the mental healthcare community have already voiced their concern, impugning the reputation of this psychiatrist and the subsequent impact on public trust in mental health professionals. The situation calls into question the broader industry's practices and emphasizes how important it is for practitioners to abide by strict codes of ethics while ensuring the safety and wellbeing of their patients. Mental health community's response and recommendations for change: In light of the scandal, prominent voices within the mental health community have come forward with recommendations to prevent similar events from occurring in the future. These suggestions include: 1. Institutions and professional societies should strengthen their vetting, certification, and monitoring of psychiatrists, with an emphasis on their adherence to the code of ethics and their professional relationship with patients. 2. In-person and online mandatory training seminars should be conducted for psychiatrists to regularly update their knowledge and understanding of patient safety, consent, and professional boundaries. 3. A comprehensive reporting and follow-up mechanism must be established for patients to report any instances of misconduct or abuse by psychiatrists, without fear of reprisal. 4. Regular audits should be conducted within psychiatric institutions to ensure and maintain high professional standards and safety protocols for patients. 5. Efforts should be intensified to destigmatize mental health, making it easier for patients to spot red flags and engage with their support networks in times of need. Conclusion: The allegations of rape and assault against this psychiatrist demonstrate the urgent need for reform and stricter regulation in mental healthcare practices. It is imperative that professional bodies, institutions, and the community at large take meaningful steps to create a safer environment for vulnerable individuals seeking help. Ensuring accountability, promoting ethical practices, encouraging open dialogue, and empowering patients should be top priorities to regain public trust and provide effective mental health care for all."},{"question":"My question: Is the following statement true? \\"Silverfish grow up to become bright neon colors.\\" Please think gradually:","response":"The statement \\"Silverfish grow up to become bright neon colors\\" is not true. Silverfish, scientifically known as Lepisma saccharina, are small, wingless insects that tend to have a silvery or grayish appearance with a metallic sheen. They do not change color or develop bright neon colors upon maturing or during any stage of their life cycle. Silverfish have three main stages in their life cycle: egg, nymph, and adult. During the nymph stage, they look similar to adults but are smaller and lighter in color. As they grow and molt, they gradually start to resemble adult silverfish, but their color does not change significantly. Adult silverfish maintain their silver or grayish color throughout their lives, which can be up to 8 years in some cases. These insects are common household pests known for their ability to thrive in damp, humid environments and feed on various items, including books, wallpaper, and clothing. They are not harmful to humans but can cause damage to household items and belongings if left unchecked."},{"question":"The discovery was made by canoeists close to Radyr Weir, Radyr, on Saturday shortly after 11:00 BST.

However, it is important to keep in mind that this paragraph may not contain the most up-to-date information on Jürgen Melzer's life and career. Further research would need to be conducted in order to either confirm or debunk the statement that he died in 2017.

Miller, a Pennsylvania native, spent his entire time as commissioner of the Pennsylvania State Police in the state. However, it is important to consider that this conclusion refers to his service in the role of commissioner, not necessarily implying that he never left the state for any personal or professional reasons during that time. Jeffrey B. Miller's tenure as the commissioner of the Pennsylvania State Police began on March 24, 2003, after the Pennsylvania State Senate confirmed his appointment. He served in this capacity until August 8, 2008. As the commissioner of a state police force, it is natural to assume that Miller would have primarily been focused on the safety and security of the state, which in this case is Pennsylvania. Born in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, it seems likely that Miller would have had strong ties to the state and been committed to serving and protecting his home state. Consequently, it is reasonable to infer that he spent the entirety of his time as commissioner in Pennsylvania. In conclusion, based on the information available, we can assert that Jeffrey B.

Former Irish pugilist and Provisional IRA member Danny Flynn returns home to Belfast from a 14-year stint in prison at the age of 32. Weary of the unbroken cycle of violence in Northern Ireland, he attempts to settle down and live in peace. After meeting his drink-sodden old trainer Ike, Danny starts up a non-sectarian boxing club for boys in an old gymnasium. While fixing up the old building, however, he runs across a cache of Semtex hidden underneath the stage. He throws the cache into the river. Danny's action infuriates Harry, a bitter and ruthless IRA lieutenant. Harry feuds with Danny, assassinating the kindly police officer who donates equipment to the boxing club. The murder causes a riot at one of Danny's boxing matches. During the riot, the gymnasium is burned down by Liam, the young son of Maggie, who thinks Danny and his mother are going to elope. Danny has been reconnecting with an old flame, Maggie, now married to an imprisoned IRA man and required by IRA code to remain faithful to him. Their relationship dominates much of the film.

Plans were formed for building a great network of railways, partly for the purpose of developing the natural resources of the country, and partly for the purpose of increasing its power for defense and attack. The existence of serfdom was tackled boldly, taking advantage of a petition presented by the Polish landed proprietors of the Lithuanian provinces and, hoping that their relations with the serfs might be regulated in a more satisfactory way (meaning in a way more satisfactory for the proprietors), he authorized the formation of committees \\"for ameliorating the condition of the peasants,\\" and laid down the principles on which the amelioration was to be effected. This step had been followed by one even more significant. Without consulting his ordinary advisers, Alexander ordered the Minister of the Interior to send a circular to the provincial governors of European Russia (serfdom was rare in other parts), containing a copy of the instructions forwarded to the Governor-General of Lithuania, praising the supposed generous, patriotic intentions of the Lithuanian landed proprietors, and suggesting that perhaps the landed proprietors of other provinces might express a similar desire. The hint was taken: in all provinces where serfdom existed, emancipation committees were formed. The emancipation was not merely a humanitarian question capable of being solved instantaneously by imperial ukase. It contained very complicated problems, deeply affecting the economic, social and political future of the nation. Alexander had to choose between the different measures recommended to him and decide if the serfs would become agricultural laborers dependent economically and administratively on the landlords or if the serfs would be transformed into a class of independent communal proprietors. The emperor gave his support to the latter project, and the Russian peasantry became one of the last groups of peasants in Europe to shake off serfdom. The architects of the emancipation manifesto were Alexander's brother Konstantin, Yakov Rostovtsev, and Nikolay Milyutin. On 3 March 1861, 6 years after his accession, the emancipation law was signed and published.

Here \\"au coût unitaire\\" means at a unit cost and \\"de 50 000 \\" means of 50,000, which states the cost per house.

Movie title: Montevideo: Taste of a Dream Movie plot: Belgrade, Serbian and Yugoslav capital, circa 1930. The story follows eleven passionate, mostly anonymous but very talented soccer players and their journey from the cobblestone streets of impoverished Belgrade neighborhoods to the formation of the national team before the very first World Cup in faraway Uruguay. So far away that the country's capital, Montevideo, seems more a distant dream than a familiar reality. Named after the city where the inaugural World Cup was held, director Dragan BjelogrliÄ's adaptation of journalist Vladimir StankoviÄ's best-selling book centers on the relationship between the two top players: natural talent and poor boy Tirke (MiloÅ¡ BikoviÄ) and playboy superstar MoÅ¡a (Petar Strugar). The two young men eventually become friends when they're thrown together on the front line of the dominant local team, Beogradski sport klub - BSK (BSK Belgrade). As the club hierarchy is faced with the challenge of keeping the squad afloat, the opportunity arises to create a national team. However, team unity is strained when Tirke and MoÅ¡a clash over beautiful women.

We serve meals for the homeless. The entertainers served up a lively show.","response":"While the verb \\"serve\\" is used in both sentences, it does not convey the exact same meaning in each context. However, it is important to note that there are similarities that allow the term \\"serve\\" to be applicable in both situations. Let's analyze the meanings of the word \\"serve\\" in each sentence to gain a better understanding. 1. \\"We serve meals for the homeless.\\" In this sentence, \\"serve\\" refers to the act of providing or supplying food to a specific group of people, in this case, the homeless. It indicates the direct distribution or provision of meals, implying a service to a community in need. This use of the word \\"serve\\" aligns with its more traditional definition, which often denotes serving food or a meal. In this context, \\"serve\\" can be understood as fulfilling a basic human need by offering sustenance and care to those less fortunate. 2. \\"The entertainers served up a lively show.\\" The phrase \\"served up\\" in this sentence has a more metaphorical or idiomatic connotation. It means that the entertainers provided, delivered, or presented a lively show to their audience. Rather than referring to the provision of physical sustenance, as in the first sentence, this usage of \\"serve\\" encompasses the idea of offering an experience or form of entertainment that is intended to be enjoyable or engaging for the viewers. The term \\"serve\\" is used figuratively in this context to emphasize the role of the entertainers in pleasing their audience. In summary, the word \\"serve\\" is used with slightly different meanings in each sentence, though they both revolve around the idea of providing or fulfilling a need. In the first sentence, \\"serve\\" refers to the direct provision and distribution of food to the homeless, aligning with a more traditional meaning of the term. In the second sentence, \\"serve\\" takes on a more metaphorical meaning, relating to the delivery of an enjoyable experience or entertainment instead of providing physical sustenance. Nevertheless, the core concept of providing for a particular need remains consistent in both instances."},{"question":"Extract the answer to the question from the following context.

Question: What can happen when kissing outside? Options: A. herpes B. sexual stimulation C. catch cold D. outburst E. get cold Answer:","response":"C. Catch cold Kissing outside can expose oneself to numerous possibilities, but the option most in line with common sense is catching a cold. This is because when outside, one is exposed to external environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and the presence of pathogens, which all contribute to the possibility of catching a cold. The person you are kissing may have a cold or virus that can be transmitted through close contact. Kissing, particularly when prolonged, can involve an exchange of bodily fluids such as saliva, which may contain various infectious agents like viruses or bacteria. If one person is carrying a cold virus, this act of kissing can easily lead to the transmission of the virus and increase the likelihood of both individuals catching a cold. Additionally, weather conditions may play a role in the probability of getting sick. For instance, cold and wet environments increase the susceptibility of our respiratory system to infections and compromise our immunity. Therefore, kissing outside, particularly during colder months, can contribute to a higher likelihood of catching a cold. It is crucial to practice good hygiene and maintain a healthy immune system to minimize the chances of catching cold or any infections. Washing hands frequently, avoiding close contact with sick individuals, and engaging in a healthy lifestyle can go a long way in lowering the risk of illness when engaged in intimate activities like kissing, both inside and outside."},{"question":"Generate a sentence about this data: 1000 Piazzia, formerName, \\"1923 NZ1951 OB\\"; 1000 Piazzia, periapsis, 352497000000.0; 1000 Piazzia, epoch, 2015-06-27","response":"The celestial object, 1000 Piazzia, previously known by its former name \\"1923 NZ1951 OB,\\" is an astronomical body that orbits around the Sun, exhibiting a distance of approximately 352,497,000,000.0 meters at its closest approach, or periapsis.

They had a splendid cinematography, painstaking screenplays and a sophisticated directing elaborated for efficiency's sake. The police superintendent Ferrot (Yves Montand) is a cop with unconventional methods who usually works all alone. He makes the acquaintance of a young woman Sylvia Léopardi (Stefania Sandrelli) and becomes her lover while ignoring that she has another lover: his superior Ganay (François Périer). When the latter learns it, he kills her in a fit of anger. Ferrot has to investigate the murder and all the clues are inexorably against him... One could deem that this kind of far-fetched story isn't exempt from glitches and sometimes, one can see right through it but Corneau's pedantic directorial style helps to conjure up a stifling, dusky atmosphere. The first part of the film before the night of the murder might seem uninteresting and however, it is crucial for what will follow this key-moment. Corneau falls back on a sober treatment with rather sparse moments and short appearances by secondary, minor characters whom the viewer will see again during the investigation. In spite of drawbacks, Corneau and his scenarist Daniel Boulanger penned a deft story. Ménard (Mathieu Carrière) who sometimes expresses his surprise because Ferrot keeps a relatively low profile during the investigation. But his superior knows that he usually works alone. Actually, Ferrot has to find solid tricks to muddy the waters and so to exonerate himself. Eventually, the chief idea of the film concerns Ferrot himself. He's a cop who bit by bit loses his identity and finds himself in the heart of a terrible depersonalization. It is epitomized by the moment when he throws himself acid on his face so that witnesses won't recognize him when he is brought face to face with them. The backdrop of this thriller, Orléans is efficiently enhanced by Corneau's camera and helps to inspire this eerie thriller its pernicious charm. How would you describe the sentiment of this review?","response":"The sentiment of the review is generally positive with a touch of analysis and constructive criticism. The reviewer highlights Alain Corneau's directorial strengths in creating suspenseful thrillers and his ability to develop intricate plots. There is appreciation for the complex characters, particularly the main character, Ferrot, noting the interesting trajectory of his character from being a cop to facing depersonalization. The use of setting in enhancing the film's overall suspenseful and dark mood is also acknowledged positively by the reviewer. However, the review is not entirely glowing. The reviewer points out that some elements of the storyline may come across as far-fetched and sometimes transparent. It is also mentioned that the presence of minor characters may seem sparse at times, and the first part of the film might appear uninteresting to some viewers. Yet, despite these shortcomings, the critical analysis paints a picture of a carefully crafted thriller that offers viewers an intricate story and a thought-provoking look at the main character's transformation, paired with compelling cinematography and setting choice.

Options: - health - dry skin - pink hands - become wet - wet floor Step-by-step reasoning process below:","response":"Washing hands too often can cause dry skin. Here's the step-by-step reasoning process: 1. Health: Washing hands is generally considered healthy as it helps prevent the spread of germs and diseases. However, excessive hand washing can cause some health issues, such as dry skin and dermatitis. So, health may be affected, but not in a general sense. 2. Dry Skin: This is the most common issue caused by washing hands too often. When you wash your hands, the soap and water strip away natural oils on your skin, which help to keep it moisturized and protected. Over-washing can lead to excessive loss of these oils, resulting in dry, irritated, and cracked skin. So, this option is correct. 3. Pink Hands: Washing your hands too often shouldn't cause your hands to become pink, unless you are using a harsh soap that causes irritation or an allergic reaction. 4. Become Wet: Although washing hands does make them wet temporarily, this is not a long-term consequence of washing hands too often. As soon as the hands are dried, this consequence is eliminated. 5. Wet floor: While a wet floor may be a side effect of hand washing, it's not a direct result of washing hands too often. It's more related to the environment and how water is handled during the process. In conclusion, washing hands too often can cause dry skin, as the excessive washing strips away the natural oils that keep the skin moisturized."},{"question":"If \\"Elder man is working on a project in his home workshop.\\", can we conclude \\"the man is working\\"?","response":"Yes, from the statement \\"Elder man is working on a project in his home workshop,\\" we can indeed conclude that the man is working. The statement provides enough information to confirm the man's involvement in some task or activity in his home workshop, specifically on a project. To describe the situation in more detail, consider the following: 1. Elder man: The man in question is of an older age group, possibly with significant experience and maturity, which may influence his decision to engage in such activities or take on certain projects. Age is an important factor as it highlights the individual's life stage and capacity to work on various tasks. 2. Working on a project: The man is not just doing some minor activity or task but is actively dedicating his time and effort to a project. Projects generally require planning, resources, time management, and a goal or an end product. This implies that the man is not only working but also occupied in something that requires significant attention, investment, and dedication. 3. Home workshop: It is essential to note that this activity is taking place within the confines of his home workshop. This could mean that this project is a personal one, driven by the individual's passions, hobbies, or self-improvement goals. A home workshop often consists of tools, equipment, and resources tailored to the person's interests and expertise. Given that the man is working in his workshop, it is plausible to assume that he is skilled in the tasks he is undertaking. 4. Context and environment: While evaluating this statement, it is also beneficial to consider the context and environment in which it is being portrayed. It is implied that the elder man is engaging in a productive manner, contributing positively to his surroundings and possibly enriching his skill set.

This echoes her own beginnings as the daughter of prostitute Hattie (Susan Sarandon) and an unknown client. Violet is one of several children living at Madam Nell's (Frances Faye) swanky New Orleans brothel in 1917.Early one morning photographer Bellocq (Keith Carradine) comes calling looking for a model. Hattie poses for him while Violet watches. At first Bellocq finds Violets inquisitive nature a bother, but after a while he starts to like her. Violet seems fascinated by Bellocq as he never seems to want to have sex with the girls, but just photograph them.Even given her tender years Violet has been become part of the brothel business.

Randy was fed up with the heat, and Eric loved it, because","response":"Randy was fed up with the heat, and Eric loved it, because he had always been the type to thrive in warmer climates, finding that the sun and higher temperatures invigorated him and filled him with boundless energy. He enjoyed how the heat allowed him to wear lighter clothing, reducing the cumbersome feeling of layers in the colder months. Eric appreciated the outdoors and found that the warmth promoted a more active lifestyle – from engaging in various sports to taking hikes through nature's beautiful landscapes. Additionally, Eric had a special connection with summertime memories that painted a picture of outdoor barbecues with close friends and family, late evenings gathered around a campfire sharing stories and laughter, and long, relaxing days stretched out on a sandy beach, soaking up the sun. These memories seemed more vivid, more cherished, because the heat played such an integral role in crafting those moments. What's more, Eric found that warmer temperatures had a significant impact on his mental and emotional state, lifting his spirits and alleviating any potential seasonal depression. The bright, sunny days seemed to bring out the best in him, inspiring a level of optimism and happiness that the colder, darker months failed to match. In contrast, Randy struggled to find any relief in the sweltering heat. The unyielding warmth made him feel lethargic, sapping him of the motivation to participate in outdoor activities or social events. He longed for the cooler seasons when the refreshing chill of a crisp autumn breeze or the quiet stillness of a snow-blanketed landscape would offer a welcome reprieve from the oppressive heat. Randy never quite understood Eric's enthusiasm for the searing temperatures and would often reminisce about the days when they could enjoy a shared fondness for cold weather. Randy's discomfort manifested in issues with sleeping at night, with the heat making it challenging to find a comfortable position or achieve the optimal environment for rest. This, in turn, impaired his ability to focus and be productive during the day. However, despite the stark divide between Randy's aversion to the heat and Eric's adoration for it, their friendship persisted. They respected and appreciated the unique differences that made them who they were, and that, in many ways, was the glue that held them together. In recognizing this, they found a balance that allowed each of them to enjoy their preferred temperature settings, with Randy indulging in air-conditioned retreats and Eric relishing the outdoor heat. In the end, their ability to embrace their differences and seek common ground strengthened their bond, showing them that weather preferences, while defining in some ways, were ultimately a small aspect of their multifaceted friendship. Thus, Randy and Eric continued navigating the seasons of life together, side by side, basking in each other's warmth."},{"question":"Given the question: Generate a question that has the following answer: clothes, a television and new furniture for the following movie plot: \\"The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner\\" begins with Colin Smith (Tom Courtenay) running, alone, along a bleak country road somewhere in rural England. In a brief voiceover, Colin tells us that running is the way his family has always coped with the world's troubles, but that in the end, the runner is always alone and cut off from spectators, left to deal with life on his own.Next, we see Colin in handcuffs with a group of other similarly encumbered young men. They are being taken to Ruxton Towers, what we would today term a medium security prison for young juvenile offenders. It is overseen by \\"The Governor\\" (Michael Redgrave), who believes that the hard work and discipline imposed on his charges will ultimately make them useful members of society. Colin, sullen and rebellious, immediately catches his eye as a test of his beliefs.An important part of The Governor's rehabilitation program is athletics, and he soon notices that Colin is a talented runner, able to easily outrun Ruxton's reigning long distance runner. As The Governor was once a runner himself, he is especially keen on Colin's abilities because for the first time, his charges have been invited to compete in a five-mile marathon against a nearby public school, Ranley, and its privileged students from upper class families. The Governor sees the invitation as an important way to demonstrate the success of his rehabilitation program.As the Governor takes Colin under his wing, offering him outdoor gardening work and eventually the freedom of practice runs outside Ruxton's barbed wire fences, we learn in a series of flashbacks how Colin came to be incarcerated. We see his difficult, economically strained family life in a lower-class workers' complex in industrial Nottingham.

Rushing here and there, being constantly on call, balancing multiple layers of responsibility may give you a sense of accomplishment – even make you feel important, but it takes a huge toll on every aspect of life. When you constantly push yourself to take on more and more challenges, it is easy to lose sight of why you wanted to be successful in the first place. For many, the reason was to be able to spend less time working and enjoy life more. A frenetic, high-pressure lifestyle creates exactly the opposite. There is a very dark side to constantly pushing yourself to produce more and more. Unfortunately, it creeps up on you and becomes a serious case of self-negligence. When you are busy and driven every minute of every day and well into the evening, it is easy to neglect important things in life that keep you healthy, happy, and create quality of life. A continual stream of urgent tasks that must be completed will overshadow the not-so-urgent, but important activities that make life worth living. It is not just physical well-being that is neglected – mental and emotional well-being also suffer when there is no time for self-care. When your daily schedule is crammed to overflowing one of the first areas of neglect is your diet. Eating regular, nutritious meals become a thing of the past. You are not only too busy to sleep or even take a deep breath now and then, there is no time to prepare decent meals Convenience foods, frozen dinners, take out and fast foods become the norm. It is a steady diet of additive filled, sugar and fat-filled dishes, loaded with empty calories that provide minimal nutrition and damage the body. It is impossible to sustain any level of good health on such a diet. Question: What does the author think about constantly pushing yourself? === The answer to the above question is","response":"that the author believes constantly pushing oneself is harmful and detrimental to various aspects of life. According to the author, a frenetic and high-pressure lifestyle may initially provide a sense of accomplishment and importance, but ultimately it leads to the neglect of essential elements that contribute to overall well-being. When one is always on the run, striving to achieve more and more, it interferes with the initial goal of being successful – having more time to enjoy life. This never-ending drive to accomplish and produce results can slowly turn into a serious case of self-negligence. The author states that it is not only physical well-being that suffers when individuals are unable to find the time for self-care. Mental and emotional health is also impacted in a negative way. In this hectic lifestyle, important activities that make life worth living are overlooked due to the constant need to complete urgent tasks. One of the primary areas where this intense lifestyle manifests is in the diet. Proper, nutritious meals are often ignored, being replaced by convenience foods, take-out, and fast food. These alternatives are filled with additives, empty calories, and provide minimal nutrition, which in turn, makes it difficult to maintain good health. In conclusion, the author thinks that constantly pushing yourself can lead to neglecting important aspects of life and overall well-being, having detrimental consequences on physical, mental, and emotional health. This self-imposed pressure not only hampers the quality of life but also strays individuals from their original goal of enjoying life and finding a true sense of accomplishment."},{"question":"Although the Tories were dismissed from office for half a century, for most of this period (at first under the leadership of Sir William Wyndham), the Tories retained party cohesion, with occasional hopes of regaining office, particularly at the accession of George II (1727) and the downfall of the ministry of Sir Robert Walpole in 1742. They acted as a united, though unavailing, opposition to Whig corruption and scandals. At times they cooperated with the \\"Opposition Whigs\\", Whigs who were in opposition to the Whig government; however, the ideological gap between the Tories and the Opposition Whigs prevented them from coalescing as a single party. They finally regained power with the accession of George III in 1760 under Lord Bute. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What did differing beliefs prevent Lord Bute and George II from doing?","response":"Differing beliefs between Lord Bute and George II may not be the direct cause of any specific inability to cooperate, as their time in power did not overlap. Instead, it is more accurate to say that the ideological differences between the Tories and the Whigs, especially the Opposition Whigs, made it difficult for the parties to unite during this period. At the beginning of George II's reign, the Tories had hopes of regaining power. However, it was the Whig party that remained dominant during his reign, with staunch Whig Sir Robert Walpole governing until 1742. The Tories, under the leadership of Sir William Wyndham, maintained party cohesion but struggled to find an opportunity to regain power. It's worth noting that Lord Bute's rise to power occurred during the reign of George III, not George II. Lord Bute, a Tory, became the Prime Minister in 1762, signaling the end of the long period of Whig dominance. Thus, the question's focus on differing beliefs preventing Lord Bute and George II from doing something is somewhat misplaced, given the historical context. However, if we consider the broader context of the Tory and Whig parties, we can discuss how their ideological differences created challenges. The Tories tended to be more conservative and supportive of the monarchy, while the Whigs were generally more liberal and in favor of parliamentary power. These divisions made it difficult for the two parties to collaborate and coalesce, even when both aimed to oppose corruption and scandals within the ruling Whig government. Consequently, the Opposition Whigs and the Tories maintained separate identities and pursued distinct goals, restricting their capacity to create a more formidable alliance against the ruling Whig party."},{"question":"Q: Where would a business man keep a plane ticket with other documents?

Given these facts, what can planting trees reduce among the following options: - Pollutants - energy barrier - competition - temperature - Fire danger - Shade - Trees - disease A:","response":"Planting trees can reduce the following among the given options: 1. Pollutants - Trees can absorb harmful gases such as carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrous oxides, as well as capture and store various pollutants in their tissues, helping to clean the air. Additionally, they help prevent soil erosion and filter water, reducing the presence of pollutants in water sources. 2. Temperature - Trees provide shade and help regulate the local microclimate by releasing moisture through a process called transpiration, which can result in a cooling effect. This can help mitigate the urban heat island effect in cities and contribute to overall temperature regulation. 3. Fire danger - Through proper tree planting and forest management, including creating buffer zones, ensuring tree spacing, and removing ladder fuels, the risk of forest fires can be reduced. Healthy, well-maintained forests can better withstand the impacts of fires and limit their spread. While planting trees doesn't directly reduce competition, disease, or shade (as these are factors that can occur within a forest ecosystem), it does contribute to a more diverse and healthy ecosystem, which can help in maintaining balance and promoting overall ecosystem health. Planting trees does not reduce energy barriers or the number of trees, as planting trees means adding more trees to the ecosystem."},{"question":"Write an article based on this summary: Javier Valdez knew he was living on borrowed time. Article:","response":"Title: A Brave Journalist's Amazing Journey Once upon a time, there was a brave man named Javier Valdez. He was a very special person, because he worked as a journalist. Journalists are people who write or tell us stories about what is happening in the world, even when it's something difficult or dangerous. Javier Valdez knew that he was living in a very tricky time. This means that he felt like he was always in big trouble, just like when you're late for school and don't want to get caught. He was in danger because he was talking about things that some people were not happy about, things that made them feel bothered or angry. But Javier was a very strong and courageous person, and he wanted to share the truth with everyone. So, he would meet with other people, talk to them, and tell them what he knew, even if it was scary. He really believed in what he was doing, because he knew that stories are powerful and can help people learn important lessons. Some people might think that Javier could have just stayed quiet and not written or talked about those dangerous things. But staying quiet wouldn't feel right to Javier. He wanted to use his words to help make the world a better place, just like how a superhero uses their special talents to save the day. In conclusion, Javier Valdez was an amazing person who knew he was living on borrowed time, meaning his time was short. But he didn't let that stop him from telling important stories. He was brave, hard-working, and kind, and he will always be remembered as an example of what journalism can do to help people see the truth."},{"question":"How is \\"This charming 3 star hotel, built around a patio garden has 55 rooms offering tranquillity and a personalised service tailored to your needs.\\" said in Russian?","response":"To translate the given sentence into Russian, I will break it down into smaller segments, find the appropriate Russian words or phrases, and then construct the new sentence while maintaining the original meaning.

On the left side, we have three terms involving x: 627x, -135x, and -181x. Combine them to simplify the equation: (627 - 135 - 181) * x = 222 * x + 2670 (392) * x = 222 * x + 2670 Step 2: Move the x terms to one side and the constant terms to the other side. Subtract 222x from both sides to move all the x terms to one side: 392x - 222x = 2670 170x = 2670 Step 3: Solve for x by dividing by the coefficient of x. Divide both sides by 170 to find the value of x: x = 2670 / 170 x = 15.7 (rounded to one decimal place) So, the solution for the equation is x ≈ 15.7."},{"question":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process The answer is:","response":"Indirectly impacting a step of the process. To understand how less acid rain could potentially affect the waste removal process in the body, let's first examine the role of acid rain. Acid rain results from the release of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) into the atmosphere, which then mix with water, oxygen, and other substances to form acidic compounds. These compounds are carried by air currents, falling to the ground as acid rain, negatively impacting the environment, plants, and aquatic systems. Now, let's discuss its potential effect on waste removal in the human body. The waste removal process begins with fluids and waste entering the kidneys, where waste materials and excess substances are removed, while essential nutrients are returned to the bloodstream. The final product of this process is urine, which is excreted from the body. Acid rain can indirectly impact human health by compromising the quality of water sources. Contaminated water, when consumed, could introduce additional harmful substances and excess minerals, such as heavy metals, into the body. In turn, the kidneys must work harder to remove these additional waste materials from the body. A decrease in acid rain would likely lead to a reduced burden on the kidneys as a result of cleaner water sources. With fewer harmful substances to remove, the kidneys may become more efficient at waste removal and more capable of handling the regular bodily waste produced. The improved overall waste removal process would then contribute to enhanced kidney function and better overall health. In summary, a decrease in acid rain would indirectly impact a step of the waste removal process by reducing the level of harmful substances in water sources that the kidneys need to filter and remove. This would ultimately result in a more efficient waste removal process and better overall health."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: The keys were black and white, what were they attached to? - front pocket - cabinet - purse - chain - piano The best answer is A:","response":"piano"},{"question":"David Cameron vowed to fight 'incredibly hard' to secure a good deal at today's EU summit European leaders today claimed Britain will 'have to be convinced' to accept a rise in Brussels spending as David Cameron scrambled to build support for a real terms freeze.

The Symphony No. 8 in E-flat major by Gustav Mahler is one of the largest-scale choral works in the classical concert repertoire. Because it requires huge instrumental and vocal forces it is frequently called the \\"Symphony of a Thousand\\", although the work is normally presented with far fewer than a thousand performers and the composer did not sanction that name. The work was composed in a single inspired burst, at Maiernigg in southern Austria in the summer of 1906. The last of Mahler's works that was premiered in his lifetime, the symphony was a critical and popular success when he conducted the Munich Philharmonic in its first performance, in Munich, on 12 September 1910. The fusion of song and symphony had been a characteristic of Mahler's early works. In his \\"middle\\" compositional period after 1901, a change of direction led him to produce three purely instrumental symphonies. The Eighth, marking the end of the middle period, returns to a combination of orchestra and voice in a symphonic context. The structure of the work is unconventional; instead of the normal framework of several movements, the piece is in two parts. Part I is based on the Latin text of a 9th-century Christian hymn for Pentecost, Veni creator spiritus (\\"Come, Creator Spirit\\"), and Part II is a setting of the words from the closing scene of Goethe's Faust. The two parts are unified by a common idea, that of redemption through the power of love, a unity conveyed through shared musical themes. Mahler had been convinced from the start of the work's significance; in renouncing the pessimism that had marked much of his music, he offered the Eighth as an expression of confidence in the eternal human spirit. In the period following the composer's death, performances were comparatively rare. However, from the mid-20th century onwards the symphony has been heard regularly in concert halls all over the world, and has been recorded many times.

Andoheb has called him to undertake a mission for the priesthood, but first refreshes his memory on the story of Kharis (Lon Chaney Jr.).3000 years ago, Kharis and the Princess Ananka were involved in a forbidden love affair. The princess died and because of her sin, her soul was cursed forever. Kharis was buried alive along with her. 30 years prior to the present time, an expedition located and entered the tomb of Ananka. They fought and escaped from the guardian of the tomb-the living Mummy of Kharis. The archaeologists brought Ananka's body back to the Scripps Museum in the United States. However, the priests of Arkham sent Kharis to seek vengeance against the defilers of the tomb. Every person from the expedition that entered the tomb died at the Mummy's hands. Kharis was believed to be destroyed in a fire at the residence of Stephen Banning (Dick Foran), leader of the expedition.The same story is being told to a group of skeptical college students in Mapleton Massachusetts. Professor Norman (Frank Reicher) expands on the story, explaining how Kharis was kept alive by the fluid of the leaves of the Tana bush, a plant that has long been extinct. In fact, Professor Norman himself was entrusted with a quantity of the tana leaves that investigators found in order to conduct scientific research.After the lecture ends, one of the students, Tom Hervey (Robert Lowery), meets up with his girlfriend Amina Mansori (Ramsay Ames), a beautiful woman of Egyptian descent. Amina has been researching Egyptian history, which has brought on a strange, clouded feeling in her mind.Back in Egypt, Andoheb informs Yousef Bey that Kharis still lives and that Yousef's mission is to retrieve Kharis and the body of Ananka and return them to their rightful resting place in Egypt.

(CBSNewYork) — For many people in the Tri-State area, it’s hard to imagine a repeat of Superstorm Sandy and the flooding that followed, but a new study suggests it could happen again. From the Jersey Shore to Connecticut, few coastal communities were spared by the floodwaters in 2012, and New York City was no exception. “It was absolutely horrifying,” Tribeca resident Tara Reilly said. “We had no power, we basically had to evacuate. Having lived through 9/11, being down here again during something traumatic like that was scary.” A team of researchers created a computer model that predicts the likelihood of other Sandy-like flood events in New York City, and the findings are alarming, CBS2’s Elise Finch reported. “Events like Hurricane Sandy, which currently occur approximately every 400 years — the frequency that those events will occur may be as much as once every 20 years,” Benjamin Horton, Ph.D., of Rutgers University, said. Horton said the primary reason for the dramatic increase is rising sea levels. “Sea levels will rise in the 21st century because we’re increasing our atmospheric temperatures, which are causing our oceans to expand and our ice sheets to melt,” he said. “Quite simply, if you increase atmospheric air temperatures, you increase ocean temperatures.” “Oceans are the heat sources for hurricanes, so a warmer ocean means more intense hurricanes and also a potential increase in their frequency,” he explained. Those findings apply to New York City and the entire Tri-State area. “I had no idea that we could be facing this again, but I hope we don’t,” Bronx resident Frank Bucello said. “I think we’re in trouble if that’s what they’re speaking of,” Brick resident Rob Severini said. “I lived in Union Beach when the storm hit, I lost where I lived and it was devastating.” Researchers hope their findings will motivate people to take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to both plan and build better coastal protection structures. The study found that intense storms and flooding could increase anywhere from three to 17 times their current frequency. The increase will be determined by sea-surface temperatures over the next few decades. ||||| Significance This study demonstrates quantitatively that the frequency of Hurricane Sandy-like extreme flood events has increased significantly over the past two centuries and is very likely to increase more sharply over the 21st century, due to the compound effects of sea level rise and storm climatology change. Abstract Coastal flood hazard varies in response to changes in storm surge climatology and the sea level. Here we combine probabilistic projections of the sea level and storm surge climatology to estimate the temporal evolution of flood hazard. We find that New York City’s flood hazard has increased significantly over the past two centuries and is very likely to increase more sharply over the 21st century. Due to the effect of sea level rise, the return period of Hurricane Sandy’s flood height decreased by a factor of ∼3× from year 1800 to 2000 and is estimated to decrease by a further ∼4.4× from 2000 to 2100 under a moderate-emissions pathway. When potential storm climatology change over the 21st century is also accounted for, Sandy’s return period is estimated to decrease by ∼3× to 17× from 2000 to 2100. In October of 2012, Hurricane Sandy flooded the US East Coast with extreme storm surges. At the Battery tide gauge in New York City (NYC), the storm surge reached 2.8 m; the storm tide, which includes also the astronomical tide, reached a record height of 3.44 m (the North American Vertical Datum of 1988). Estimating the frequency of Sandy-like flood events, including how it changes over time, provides critical information for coastal risk mitigation and climate adaptation. Previous studies have investigated the frequency of Hurricane Sandy under the historical climate (1⇓⇓–4). In this study, we focus on how the frequency of extreme floods induced by Sandy-like events varies in response to changes in the sea level (5) and storm activity (6, 7) due to climate change. In particular, we investigate (i) the influence of historical sea level rise in shaping the current flood hazard in NYC and (ii) the impact of projected future climate change and sea level rise on Sandy-like flood events. To compare flood events across time periods, we define the flood height as the peak water level during a storm relative to a baseline mean sea level (e.g., the mean sea level in 2000). Here we focus on the sea level components that vary with the climate and do not account for the effect of astronomical tide. Thus, we calculate the flood height as the sum of the peak storm surge and relative sea level (RSL; relative to the baseline). Then, for a given climate state, the return period (reciprocal of frequency) of floods of different heights can be estimated by combining (i) the storm frequency (assuming that the storms arrive as a Poisson process) and (ii) the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the flood height, which can be obtained by combining the CDF of the storm surge and the probability distribution function (PDF) of RSL (Methods). In such a framework, we integrate the estimated RSL PDF with modeled storm frequency and storm surge CDF (which, together, describe storm surge climatology) to estimate NYC’s flood return periods from year 1800 to 2100. We consider storm surges induced by hurricanes/tropical cyclones. (Extratropical cyclones can also induce coastal flooding in NYC (8), although the flood magnitude is often smaller.) We estimate the current and future hurricane surge climatology for NYC following ref. 9, using large numbers of synthetic surge events that are generated with a statistical deterministic hurricane model (10) and a high-resolution hydrodynamic model (11). Specifically, in ref. 9, the NYC surge climatology was estimated for the observed climate of 1981–2000 based on the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis, as well as for the global climate model (GCM) modeled climate of 1981–2000 and projected climate of 2081–2100 (under the A1B emission scenario of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Emissions Scenarios) based on four GCMs [CNRM-CM3 (Centre National de Recherches Météorologiques, Météo-France), ECHAM5 (Max Planck Institute), GFDL-CM2.0 (NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory), and MIROC3.2 (Center for Climate System Research/National Institute for Environmental Studies/Frontier Research Center for Global Change, Japan)]. The analysis of ref. 9 accounted for the variation of storm track and intensity and their changes with the climate conditions, but it applied a statistical mean storm size. Here, based on recent research on storm size (12, 13), we incorporate the statistical size variation into the analysis (Methods). However, how storm size changes with the climate is still not accounted for, given the limited physical understanding of what controls the storm size (12) and initial numerical evidence that storm size may change little on average over the 21st century climate (14). By comparing the NCEP estimates and GCM estimates for the same period of 1981–2000, ref. 9 bias-corrected the projected storm frequency for 2081–2100, assuming the model bias does not change over the projection period. Here we apply the same assumption and bias-correct the projected storm surge CDF for 2081–2100 through quantile−quantile mapping (15) (Methods). Then, we assume that the NCEP-estimated surge climatology of 1981–2000 represents that of 2000 and the (unbiased) GCM-projected surge climatology of 2081–2100 represents that of 2100, and we estimate the surge climatology for every decade between 2000 and 2100 through linear interpolation. We do not consider potential changes of storm climatology from 1800 to 2000; i.e., in the analysis, the surge climatology between 1800 and 2000 is represented by the NCEP estimates for year 2000. We set year 2000 to be the baseline (RSL = 0 m). For the future RSL, we use the probabilistic, localized projections of RSL at the Battery generated as part of ref. 16’s global set of RSL projections. The projections are based on combined PDFs for (i) thermal expansion and ocean dynamic changes derived from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (17); (ii) glacier mass balance changes derived from the projections of ref. 18; (iii) ice sheet mass balance based upon a fusion of the expert assessment of ref. 19 and structured expert elicitation of ref. 20; (iv) land water storage estimated as a function of global population; (v) nonclimatic, approximately linear, long-term sea level change due to glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA), subsidence, and other processes, estimated from tide gauge data; and (vi) the static equilibrium fingerprints of sea level change caused by glacier and ice sheet mass fluxes (21). Here we use 10,000 Monte Carlo (MC) samples of the projected RSL time series to estimate the PDF of RSL for the Battery for every decade from 2000 to 2100, under the emissions scenario Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 (roughly comparable to the A1B scenario used for the surge climatology projection; see ref. 22). We note that the thermal expansion, ocean dynamic, and glacier contributions to these RSL projections are based upon a large number of GCMs (given equal weights); given the inherent correlation between storm climatology change and sea level rise (23), future research may develop RSL projections for individual GCMs to be combined with the storm surge projection for the corresponding GCMs. We apply an estimate of past RSL from 1800 to 2000 for NYC based on a spatiotemporal empirical hierarchical statistical model (24) that incorporates data from (i) the Battery tide gauge (1856 to present with 18 missing or incomplete years); (ii) other, shorter tide gauges in the Northeast US Atlantic coast; (iii) a high-resolution, three-century proxy RSL reconstruction from Barnegat Bay, NJ (25); and (iv) lower-resolution proxy RSL reconstructions from elsewhere in New Jersey (24, 26, 27) (Methods). Results We integrate the estimated storm surge climatology and RSL to estimate the return periods for various flood heights (0 m to 6 m) for NYC for every decade from 1800 to 2100. Fig. 1 shows the estimated flood return period curves for the years 1800, 2000, and 2100. The return period of a storm surge (also flood height) of 2.8 m, similar to Hurricane Sandy, is 398 y in 2000 (RSL = 0 m). This estimate is lower than the 516-y estimate found in ref. 9, indicating that neglecting the storm size variation can significantly underestimate the surge hazard. As demonstrated by the substantial shift of the flood return period curve, the flood hazard for NYC has increased significantly from 1800 to 2000 and will increase even more sharply to 2100. Considering only the effect of RSL rise, the return period of Sandy’s flood height (2.8 m) is estimated to be ∼1,200 y in 1800 and ∼90 y in 2100. Storm surge climatology change can also significantly affect the flood return periods over the 21st century; when it is accounted for, the estimated return period of Sandy’s flood height in 2100 becomes ∼23 y to 130 y, depending on the applied climate models. The flood height with Sandy’s return period (398 y) is estimated to be about 2.3 m in 1800 and 3.7 m in 2100, considering only the effect of RSL rise. When the change of storm climatology is also accounted for, this flood magnitude becomes about 3.5 m to 4.3 m in 2100. Fig. 1. Return periods of flood heights (relative to the mean sea level of the baseline year 2000) in NYC, estimated for years 1800, 2000, and 2100. The solid blue curve shows the return period of flood heights (also storm surges as RSL = 0 m) for year 2000, estimated based on NCEP reanalysis. Other solid curves show the return period of flood heights for 2100, based on the projected RSL distributions and surge climatology projected by the various climate models(CNRM-CM3, GFDL-CM2.0, ECHAM5, and MIROC3.2). The dashed blue curve shows the return period of flood heights for 2100 based on the projected RSL of 2100 and the NCEP surge climatology (of 2000, neglecting the change of surge climatology from the baseline). The dash-dotted blue curve shows the return period of flood heights for 1800 based on the estimated RSL of 1800 and the NCEP surge climatology (of 2000, neglecting the change of surge climatology). The blue shading shows the 90% confidence interval of the 2000 NCEP curve (the statistical confidence interval for the other curves is similar). The red dashed lines highlight Sandy’s flood height of 2.8 m (horizontal) and Sandy’s estimated return period in 2000 of 398 y (vertical). To better demonstrate the temporal evolution of the frequency and magnitude of Sandy’s flood in NYC, we display time series of the estimated return period for Sandy’s flood height (2.8 m) and flood height with Sandy’s estimated return period (398 y) from 1800 to 2100, along with the estimated/projected RSL (Fig. 2). Between 1800 and 2000, RSL in NYC rose by 50 ± 8 cm. During this same interval, global mean sea level rose by about 13 cm to 18 cm [14 cm in the 20th century and −1 cm to +4 cm in the 19th century, depending upon modeling assumptions (24)]. About half of the RSL rise in NYC was due to GIA [about 1.3 mm/y to 1.5 mm/y, or 26 cm to 30 cm total (24, 25)]. The remainder of the difference between NYC and global sea level likely reflects ocean dynamics. Under RCP 4.5, RSL rise in NYC over the course of the 21st century will likely (67% probability) be between 0.5 m and 1.0 m and will very likely (90% probability) be between 0.4 m and 1.2 m, with a “worst case” (1-in-1,000 probability) rise of 2.6 m (16). The projected RSL rise in NYC is higher than the projected global mean sea level rise (likely 0.5 m to 0.8 m under RCP 4.5) because of the combined effects of (i) GIA, (ii) potential changes in ocean dynamics (likely −5 cm to +23 cm over the 21st century under RCP 4.5), and (iii) increased sensitivity of RSL rise in NYC to mass loss from Antarctica (by about a factor of 20% for the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and 4% for the East Antarctic Ice Sheet). However, NYC experiences a less-than-global rise due to mass loss from Greenland (by about 60%) and glaciers (by about 40%) (16). Because of the accelerating rise in RSL, NYC’s flood hazard will increase more significantly over the 21st century than over the past two centuries. This effect of RSL rise may, again, be further intensified by the change of surge climatology, although relatively large uncertainty exists in the storm climatology projections by the GCMs [largely due to their very different projections of the storm frequency (9)].

(Top) Return period of Sandy’s flood height of 2.8 m. (Middle) Flood height with Sandy’s estimated return period of 398 y (in 2000). As in Fig. 1, solid curves show the estimates accounting for the change in both RSL and surge climatology, and dashed and dash-dotted blue curves show the estimates accounting for only the change in RSL. (Bottom) Estimated past and projected future RSL (black solid curve, mean; shading, 5% to 95% quantile range). Annual mean sea level observed at the Battery tide gauge is shown by the green curve, and the proxy reconstruction from Barnegat Bay is represented by the red rectangles, showing 2σ vertical and geochronological uncertainties. Discussion The results of this analysis demonstrate how dramatically the frequency and magnitude of NYC’s extreme floods may increase over time, due to the compound effects of sea level rise and storm climatology change. The absolute value of the return period of extreme surges like Sandy (i.e., about 400 y), however, may be overestimated, because the physically based hurricane modeling (necessary for analyzing the impact of climate change) does not account for the effect of extratropical transition. With Hurricane Sandy as a pronounced example, a significant portion of tropical cyclones moving into high latitudes of the US Atlantic coast undergo extratropical transition (28); improved understanding of extratropical transition and its impact on surge hazard warrants future research. At least two well-documented hurricane strikes in NYC in the late 18th and early 19th centuries (1788 and 1821) (29, 30) likely resulted in storm surges similar to or greater than that of Hurricane Sandy. Moreover, based on a sediment record of coastal inundation events in the region (2), a series of coarse-grained flood-induced event beds were deposited over the last 350 y (Fig. 3). Absolute maximum water levels cannot be directly estimated from these storm deposits, but at least six of these event beds are coarser than the event bed associated with Hurricane Sandy, which suggests that these events had more energetic currents and/or waves capable of transporting coarser material. The combination of historical archives and geological proxies (see also ref. 30) points toward higher probabilities of extreme coastal flooding in NYC compared with estimates derived from physical modeling as in this study and from instrumental water level records (3). Fig. 3. Maximum grain size of event beds from Seguine Pond, Staten Island. D90 is the grain size (in millimeters) where 90% of the grains are finer. Likely storms responsible for each event bed are noted. Labels in black are historically documented hurricanes, and labels in gray are extratropical storms. (In some cases, definitive attribution is difficult because multiple events occur close together in time and, given age model uncertainties, more than one storm is a plausible candidate.) Six of the event deposits from the late 17th to 20th centuries are coarser than the deposit associated with Hurricane Sandy (dashed line). Data were obtained from the proxy record of ref. 2. Estimating the return period of extreme flood events is challenging, and the process of risk analysis requires continuous updates wherein improved modeling and new data inform frequency estimates. Also, large uncertainties exist in GCM projections on both future storm activity and RSL rise, as shown in this study; future research should examine the GCMs on their capability to accurately project the key atmospheric and ocean variables that control hurricane activity and sea level dynamics. Ultimately, proxy storm records that span centuries to millennia, over various climate states, may provide critical information for evaluating model projections of both the frequency of extreme floods (31, 32) and how they change with the climate (33). Methods We apply the nine storm datasets generated by ref. 9 for NYC. The nine datasets were generated for the 1981–2000 climate estimated by NCEP reanalysis and the 1981–2000 and 2081–2100 climates estimated by each of the four GCMs. Each dataset includes 5,000 storms that pass within 200 km of the Battery with maximum wind speed greater than 21 m/s, with estimated annual frequency. These storms were generated with a statistical deterministic approach (10), which models the storm track and intensity deterministically given the storm environmental conditions, which in turn were simulated or sampled based on statistics. The model also estimates the storm radius of maximum wind deterministically, given an externally supplied storm outer radius (storm size). In ref. 9, the observed basin mean storm size was applied to all storms. In this study, we account for the variation of the storm size. For each storm, we sample the storm size from a statistical log-normal distribution (12) for the Atlantic basin and assume it is constant over the lifecycle of the storm [as it is observed not to change much over the storm lifetime (13)]. Then, we apply a recently developed theoretical wind model (13) that connects inner ascending and outer descending regions of the storm to estimate the radius of maximum wind from the storm outer size and intensity. With the updated storm characteristics, we use the same method as described in ref. 9 to estimate the storm surface wind and pressure to drive the storm surge simulation using a high-resolution hydrodynamic model (11). The hydrodynamic modeling has been validated by previous studies (8, 9) and is relatively accurate (error < 10%) in simulating historical NYC surge events, including Hurricanes Irene and Sandy. It does not resolve relatively small factors such as wave setup, riverine flow, and stratification (34), as these conditions are either not defined for synthetic storms or too computationally demanding to incorporate for this case involving 45,000 simulations. Also, the current coastline and bathymetry are applied for the end-of-the-century simulations, and we focus on the first-order impact of climate change and sea level rise; future study may also investigate the effect of the long-term changes of the shoreline and estuaries (35). Based on the simulated storm surge peaks at the Battery, we perform statistical analysis on each dataset. To obtain the storm surge CDF, we apply the peaks-over-threshold method to model the tail of the distribution with a generalized Pareto distribution, using the maximum likelihood method, and we model the rest of the distribution with nonparametric density estimation, as described in ref. 9. The statistical confidence intervals of the estimated return levels (estimated using the Delta Method as in ref. 9) are similar across the datasets and are relatively small, as very large numbers of numerical samples are applied. Climate model projections can be biased, and thus they should be bias-corrected before applications. In particular, the GCM projected surge climatology should be unbiased before being combined with RSL distributions to estimate flood hazards. We bias-correct the storm frequency and storm surge CDF separately. We consider the storm frequency and storm surge CDF estimates based on the NCEP reanalysis to be accurate for the 1981–2000 climate. We unbias the GCM-projected storm frequency by multiplying it with a correction factor, which is simply the ratio of the NCEP-estimated frequency and GCM-estimated frequency for the 1981–2000 climate. We unbias the storm surge CDF through quantile−quantile mapping (15): The GCM-estimated surge CDF for the 1981–2000 climate is first matched with the NCEP-estimated surge CDF, generating a correction function depending on the quantile, which is then used to unbias the GCM-projected surge CDF for the 2081–2100 climate quantile by quantile. The unbiased storm surge climatology is then interpolated over time and combined with RSL estimates to investigate the evolution of the flood hazard. The RSL estimates are 19-y running averages (16), and thus, here, we neglect the interannual variation of the sea level. Many previous studies (9, 36) have considered deterministic RSL estimates (e.g., 1 m or the 90th percentile). Here we incorporate the uncertainty in RSL estimates. We neglect the relatively small nonlinear interaction between the surge and RSL at the Battery (9, 36) and estimate the flood height (Hf) as the sum of surge (H) and RSL (S). The CDF of the flood height is then obtained simply through a convolution operation over the CDF of the surge and the PDF of RSL P { H f ≤ h } = P { H + S ≤ h } = ∫ − ∞ ∞ P { H ≤ h − s } f S ( s ) d s . [1] Then, assuming that, under a given climate, the storms arrive as a stationary Poisson process with the rate as the annual storm frequency λ, we estimate the (mean) return period of (storms with) floods exceeding level h as T ¯ H f ( h ) = 1 λ ( 1 − P { H f ≤ h } ) . [2] We perform this analysis for every 10-y time point between 1800 and 2100 to obtain the time-varying flood height return periods. The PDF of RSL for each decade over 2000–2100 is obtained simply through kernel density estimation using the 10,000 MC samples generated by ref. 16. To reconstruct past RSL over 1800–2000, we apply a spatiotemporal empirical hierarchical model developed by ref. 24. In this model, the sea level field is viewed as the sum of a time-varying, spatially uniform term g(t), a spatially varying, temporally linear term l(x)(t-t 0 ), and a temporally and spatially varying term m(x,t) f ( x , t ) = g ( t ) + l ( x ) ( t − t 0 ) + m ( x , t ) . [3] Individual observations y i are modeled as noisy observations of f(x,t) y i = f ( x i , t i ) + w ( x i , t i ) + y 0 ( x i ) + ε i y , [4] t i = t ^ i + ε i t , [5] where x i is the spatial location of observation i, t i is its age, w ( x i , t i ) is a white noise process that captures sea level variability at a subdecadal level (which we treat here as noise), t ^ i is the mean observed age, ε i t and ε i y are errors in the age and sea level observations, and y 0 ( x i ) is a site-specific datum offset. The terms g, l, m, w, and y 0 have mean zero Gaussian process priors with Matérn covariance functions. The covariance functions are characterized by hyperparameters reflecting prior expectations about the amplitude, spatial scale, and temporal scales of variability, which we set using a maximum likelihood method. To apply the model to the New York and New Jersey region, we use the high-resolution (1σ errors of approximately ±3 cm) Barnegat Bay, NJ, proxy record of ref. 25; the Common Era NJ proxy database of ref. 24, which has a lower resolution (approximately ±10 cm or more) but provides more extensive spatial coverage; and tide gauge data from the Battery, from Sandy Hook, Atlantic City, and Cape May, NJ, from Philadelphia, PA, from Lewes, DE, from Willets Point, Long Island, and from Bridgeport, CT. Results shown in the paper are for the site of the Battery tide gauge, and the PDF of RSL at each time point is Gaussian. The effect of astronomical tide can be significant for flood risk, and it should be investigated in future research. This effect may be incorporated through applying joint probability analysis on the surge and tidal distributions (9) and accounting for the effects of surge-tide nonlinearity (9) and surge duration (4). If the tidal effect is included, Sandy’s return period based on its storm tide level (3.44 m) will be significantly longer than the return period estimated here based on its storm surge level (2.8 m), because Sandy’s surge peak at the Battery happened very unusually on the abnormal high tide. However, the tidal effect will not change with the climate, and thus the trend of flood frequency change will be similar.

The paper was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The study is based on a combination of historical data and computer model projections performed by Ning Lin of Princeton University, Benjamin Horton and Robert Kopp of Rutgers University, and Jeff Donnelly of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. The historical data consist of tidal gauge records taken from New York City, going back to 1856, and geological records from the same area going back two millennia. The model projections consist of Kopp's work on future sea-level models; Lin's work on future storm intensity; and the work of Horton, Kopp and Donnelly on historical sea levels and storm surges. The scientists ask the question: How frequent will floods like that produced by Sandy be in the future? Earlier research led by Andra Reed, now a postdoctoral scholar at Rutgers, had shown a 20-fold increase in the frequency of extreme floods, primarily as a result of sea-level rise, between the historic period from 850 to 1850 and the late 20th century. The historic sea-level rise was largely due to natural effects, like the slow sinking of the land in the mid-Atlantic region in response to the end of the last ice age; but over the late 20th century, human-caused climate change came to dominate sea-level rise. In the paper published today, the authors report that floods as intense as Sandy's would have occurred about once every 400 years on average under the sea-level rise conditions of the year 2000, but that over the 21st century are expected to be about four times more probable due to an acceleration in the rate of sea-level rise. \\"The grand answer is that things are going to get worse by 2100,\\" says Horton, who is professor of Marine and Coastal Sciences in the School of Environmental and Biological Sciences. \\"If nothing changes with hurricanes, sea-level rise alone will increase the frequency of Sandy-like events by 2100.\\" But the size, intensity, and tracks of hurricanes may change. In the paper, Princeton's Lin combined historical climate data and modeling of future climate conditions and storm surges. She found that these changes may lead to a more modest three-fold increase in flood probability, but may also break badly against New York City, making Sandy's flood 17 times more probable. \\"As we refine climate and hurricane dynamic models, we will have more accurate predictions that will allow planners to better design flood mitigation strategies,\\" said Lin, the study's lead author. The study built upon past work by Kopp, professor of earth and planetary sciences in the School of Arts and Sciences, estimating sea levels over the 21st century. \\"We ask, 'What is likely?' and 'What are the extremes?'\\" Kopp said. \\"We take into account factors that cause local sea level to vary from global sea level. And we've shown, through geological investigations, that our projections are consistent with the assumption that temperature and sea level will be related in the future as they have been over the past two thousand years.\\" Projections are not predictions and, Horton says, the spread between what's \\"likely\\" and \\"extreme\\" is an indication of the complexity of future projection. \\"Things are only going to get worse by 2100,\\" Horton says. \\"It's just a question of how much worse it will get. There is no happy scenario.\\" # ||||| What is a summary?","response":"A new study led by Rutgers University has found that New York City could face flooding caused by storms, comparable in intensity to Hurricane Sandy, with seventeen times more frequency than previously estimated. Flooding at these levels would occur at least three times more frequently by the end of the century, with scientists warning floods will become more frequent and powerful over the next few decades, primarily due to rising sea levels. Researchers hope the findings may motivate people to take action in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, as well as plan and build better coastal protection structures."},{"question":"Translate the following.

It is essential to recognize that each person's body responds differently to physical exertion, and therefore, a general best answer would not encompass the entirety of the population. However, a detailed analysis of the most common complaints - dizziness, exercise-related tiredness, cramps, headaches, and exhaustion - can provide a better understanding of the issues people face after jumping up and down. 1. Dizziness: Dizziness after jumping up and down is a fairly common complaint and can be attributed to several factors. One potential cause is the rapid change in blood pressure during physical activity, which may lead to lightheadedness or dizziness. Another cause can be dehydration, as inadequate fluid intake may cause a drop in blood volume, leading to dizziness. 2. Exercise-related Tiredness: It is natural to feel tired after engaging in physical activity. Jumping up and down is a high-impact exercise that requires the use of various muscle groups. As a result, the body utilizes more energy and oxygen, which can lead to tiredness after the activity. Additionally, if an individual is not conditioned or used to this type of exercise, they may experience more fatigue than someone who is physically fit. 3. Cramps: Muscle cramps can occur after jumping up and down for extended periods. These involuntary muscle contractions can be caused by overuse of the muscles, muscle fatigue, or dehydration. Additionally, electrolyte imbalances resulting from excessive sweating can lead to muscle cramping. 4. Headaches: Physical exertion may trigger headaches in some individuals. The cause of these headaches can vary, including dehydration, tension in the neck and shoulders, or even a lack of oxygen during the activity (known as exercise-induced hypoxia). Furthermore, some people may be more prone to exercise-induced headaches due to genetic predisposition. 5. Exhaustion: Exhaustion may be experienced by those who push themselves too hard during physical activity, especially if they are not accustomed to this level of exertion. Exhaustion is a sign that the body has reached its limits and needs time to recover. In conclusion, the best answer to the complaints people have after jumping up and down cannot be narrowed down to a single issue. Dizziness, exercise-related tiredness, cramps, headaches, and exhaustion are all possible outcomes following intense physical activity, such as jumping up and down. However, understanding these potential complaints can help individuals take appropriate measures to prevent or mitigate them, ensuring a more enjoyable and safer exercise experience."},{"question":"Read the following article and select the best answer.

But hotel rates inPortlandare up, she said. She thinksPhiladelphia's higher popularity is due to good marketing, a decrease in airfare of 16% compared to the overall 8% decrease for domestic flights and more interest in historic destinations in general. FAMILY TRAVEL Rather than take a two-week vacation to Europe, families are going to national parks. David Mandt, spokesman for the Association of Amusement Parks, is cautiously optimistic about the summer season. He said even when gas was 4 a gallon in 2008, people continued to visit theme parks--they simply selected parks closer to their homes. While for years, park operators have used special offers, promotions and discounts to encourage families to visit at a specific time, the deals may be easier to find this year, especially when it comes to packages that include accommodations. Universal Orlando Resort has a deal allowing families to book a three-night package and receive two additional nights free.

She thought that people who make decisions for the country should listen to all the people instead of only a few. So, she joined a special event called the Democracy Spring protest. A protest is like when kids say they don't want to eat broccoli - they want someone to know they don't like something. At the Democracy Spring protest, lots of people came together peacefully, holding signs and singing songs, to tell the leaders they want change. During this protest, Rosario Dawson and some others felt very strongly about what they were saying. So, they did an action called \\"civil disobedience.\\" This is when people break a small rule on purpose, to show they don't agree with it, like when a child refuses to clean their room because they don't think it's fair. Even though they were trying to send a message in a good way, the police officers had to follow the rules too. So, they had to arrest Rosario Dawson and some other protesters. Arresting is like when parents put their child in time-out because they didn't follow the rules. The good news is, Rosario Dawson didn't stay in trouble for long.

The first statement describes a particular scene with two women in an outdoor or public setting, where one woman is holding a blue innertube, while the other is wearing a white jacket and reaching for a trashcan. The specifics seem to describe a situation that could be interpreted as being outdoors, possibly near a beach or pool, and with an environmental concern because of the mention of the trashcan. On the other hand, the second statement states that \\"a woman is at home checking her Facebook on her laptop alone.\\" This scene is fundamentally different from the first statement, as it involves only one woman who is indoors and engaging in a personal activity. Moreover, this woman is said to be alone, which contrasts with the presence of two women in the first statement. Additionally, there's no mention of a blue innertube, white jacket, or reaching for a trashcan in the second statement. Given these discrepancies between the two statements, it is not possible to draw a connection or establish a conclusion that links them. Both scenarios depict different situations that involve women, but the context, location, and activities involved vary significantly. This lack of connection could be intentional, as the two statements could be describing unrelated situations, or it could be an accidental oversight that omits crucial information enabling a connection to be made. Regardless, with the available information, it is not feasible to conclude that \\"On the left side of a woman that's holding a blue innertube, there's a woman wearing a white jacket who is reaching the trashcan\\" based on the information that \\"a woman is at home checking her Facebook on her laptop alone.\\""},{"question":"Q: In this task, you are given an input list.

Finn goes to Paris to study art. A:","response":"Title: A Canvas in the City of Lights Plot: Finn is a young and talented art enthusiast who has always been passionate about painting and art history. Despite having a strong connection to the art world, he feels stuck in a small town with limited opportunities to grow. He dreams of exploring beyond the familiar confines of his hometown, and his favorite artist, Vincent Van Gogh, has always been a major inspiration for his journey into the world of art. When he learns about a prestigious art academy in Paris that offers a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to study art history and hone his painting skills, Finn is determined to be a part of it. However, there are several obstacles in his path. First, the academy is notoriously hard to get into, with a highly competitive enrollment process. Second, his family is against his decision to move to Paris. They would like him to stay close to home and take over the family business. Despite the obstacles, Finn refuses to give up on his dreams. He works tirelessly to build an impressive art portfolio and self-publishes an art history blog, showcasing his unique perspective on famous works of art. He also works several odd jobs to fund his travels to Paris, often painting murals and creating custom artwork for his fellow townspeople. His dedication pays off when he receives a scholarship and the chance to study at the prestigious art academy in Paris. His departure is bittersweet, as he faces opposition from his family and leaves the familiar comforts of his hometown. Upon arriving in Paris, Finn is immediately captivated by the city's rich artistic and cultural history. He is determined to make the most of this opportunity and follows the footsteps of Vincent Van Gogh, visiting the legendary places the artist frequented. As Finn navigates the challenges of adjusting to a new city, the demands of the art academy, and forming new friendships, he discovers an underground art movement taking place in Paris. The artists in this movement challenge traditional artistic norms and push the boundaries of creativity, reigniting Finn's passion for painting and giving him the courage to explore his unique artistic voice. Finn also encounters Chloé, a local artist, and sparks fly. She introduces him to the local art scene, filling his days with vibrant art exhibitions and lively discussions about art philosophy. They develop feelings for each other, but their pursuit of their artistic dreams puts their love to the test. Finn struggles with balancing his commitment to the art academy, the underground art movement, and his relationship with Chloé. When an Art Battle competition with a substantial cash prize is announced, Finn sees an opportunity to validate his dedication to his art and prove his talent to his family. He decides to submit a piece and pour every ounce of his passion, talent, and soul into creating a masterpiece that reflects his journey and experiences in Paris. Despite facing stiff competition and harsh criticism from the conservative judges, Finn finds the courage to stay true to his unique artistic vision. In the end, Finn’s piece resonates with the audience, and he wins the competition. This life-defining moment is a turning point for Finn, who realizes that success lies in embracing our unique gifts, walking the path less traveled, and staying true to ourselves. His family, witnessing the impact of his art, finally accepts his passion and decision to pursue a career in art. The movie concludes with Finn, accompanied by Chloé, returning to his hometown, where he uses the prize money to establish an art studio and gallery. This space serves as a creative hub, attracting artists from all over the world to celebrate their unique artistic visions. Together, Finn and Chloé continue inspiring others to chase their dreams and build a legacy in the little town that once seemed to have limited opportunities."},{"question":"Generate a short movie review that has \\"I.\\" sentiment (Pick your answer from: I. negative; II. positive;).","response":"I. Negative: The movie I recently watched, \\"Elemental Rift\\", left a lot to be desired. From the very beginning, the plot was all over the place. The lack of coherent storytelling coupled with the extremely convoluted narrative made the watching experience extremely strenuous. The acting was nothing to write home about, either. Each actor seemed to be partaking in a completely different movie – there was no chemistry between the cast members, and the scene transitions were incredibly jarring. The characters were shallow, with development left in the dust and replaced by redundant cliches that barely held their own. The lead character, played by otherwise-renowned actor, Devon Shire, was shockingly one-dimensional and lacking the charisma we're used to seeing from him. Another disappointing aspect of \\"Elemental Rift\\" was its visual effects. Despite boasting a high-budget production, the graphics seemed like an afterthought. The entire aesthetics of the movie were murky and underwhelming, with the CGI, in particular, being almost cringe-worthy at times. Moving on to the screenplay and dialogue, things didn’t improve much. The dialogue was tremendously heavy-handed and didn’t propel the story forward. Instead, it was filled with uninspired catchphrases that seemed to be there merely for the sake of making the audience cringe. And let’s not forget about the soundtrack. One would think that even if all other aspects of a movie falter, at least the music might be a savior. But unfortunately, the same uninspired trend followed here with repetitive, jarring tunes doing nothing to enhance the scenes they played in. In conclusion, \\"Elemental Rift\\" is a cinematic misstep that seems to miss the essence of what makes a movie enjoyable or engaging. Lackluster performances, poor scriptwriting, forgettable music, and a baffling storyline collectively mar the viewing experience beyond repair. The only redeeming element might have been the well-designed poster. Unfortunately, the same amount of creativity didn’t translate onto the screen. To say that my expectations were not met would be a colossal understatement, as the frustration of having spent two hours on this movie looms large. In short, \\"Elemental Rift\\" serves as a disappointing testament to wasted potential. In my honest review, I'd suggest viewers skip this one."},{"question":"Question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What was conducted by Henry Wood when it was played at a London Promenade Concert? , can you please find it? Elgar is probably best known for the first of the five Pomp and Circumstance Marches, which were composed between 1901 and 1930. It is familiar to millions of television viewers all over the world every year who watch the Last Night of the Proms, where it is traditionally performed. When the theme of the slower middle section (technically called the \\"trio\\") of the first march came into his head, he told his friend Dora Penny, \\"I've got a tune that will knock 'em – will knock 'em flat\\". When the first march was played in 1901 at a London Promenade Concert, it was conducted by Henry J. Wood, who later wrote that the audience \\"rose and yelled ... the one and only time in the history of the Promenade concerts that an orchestral item was accorded a double encore.\\" To mark the coronation of Edward VII, Elgar was commissioned to set A. C. Benson's Coronation Ode for a gala concert at the Royal Opera House in June 1901. The approval of the king was confirmed, and Elgar began work. The contralto Clara Butt had persuaded him that the trio of the first Pomp and Circumstance march could have words fitted to it, and Elgar invited Benson to do so. Elgar incorporated the new vocal version into the Ode. The publishers of the score recognised the potential of the vocal piece, \\"Land of Hope and Glory\\", and asked Benson and Elgar to make a further revision for publication as a separate song. It was immensely popular and is now considered an unofficial British national anthem. In the United States, the trio, known simply as \\"Pomp and Circumstance\\" or \\"The Graduation March\\", has been adopted since 1905 for virtually all high school and university graduations.In March 1904 a three-day festival of Elgar's works was presented at Covent Garden, an honour never before given to any English composer.

Creating such a smooth passage means adjusting a vehicle's speed so that it always arrives at the lights when they are green.That is theoretically possible, but practically hard.Roadside signs wired to traffic lights can help get the message across a couple hundred metres from a crossing, but such signs are expensive, and are not widespread.Margaret Martonosi and Emmanouil Koukoumidis at Princeton University, and Li-Shiuan Peh at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, however, have an idea that could make the process cheaper and more effective.Instead of a hardwired network of signs, they propose to use mobile-phone applications.

It includes many subgenres that have the commonality of focusing on the actions of the avatar using some sort of weapon. Usually this weapon is a gun, or some other long-range weapon. A common resource found in many shooter games is ammunition. Most commonly, the purpose of a shooter game is to shoot opponents and proceed through missions without the player character being killed or dying. A shooting game is a genre of video game where the player has limited spatial control of his or her character, and the focus is almost entirely on the defeat of the character's enemies using long-range weaponry. - Windows Phone (WP) is a family of mobile operating systems developed by Microsoft for smartphones as the replacement successor to Windows Mobile and Zune. Windows Phone features a new user interface derived from Metro design language. Unlike Windows Mobile, it is primarily aimed at the consumer market rather than the enterprise market. It was first launched in October 2010 with Windows Phone 7. Windows Phone 8.1 is the latest public release of the operating system, released to manufacturing on April 14, 2014. - Microsoft Corporation (commonly referred to as Microsoft or MS) is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Redmond, Washington, that develops, manufactures, licenses, supports and sells computer software, consumer electronics and personal computers and services. Its best known software products are the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems, Microsoft Office office suite, and Internet Explorer and Edge web browsers. Its flagship hardware products are the Xbox video game consoles and the Microsoft Surface tablet lineup. As of 2016, it was the world's largest software maker by revenue, and one of the world's most valuable companies. - A fish is any member of a group of organisms that consist of all gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered obsolete or paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term \\"fish\\" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology. The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification. - Skype is an application that provides video chat and voice call services. Users may exchange such digital documents as images, text, video and any other, and may transmit both text and video messages. Skype allows the creation of video conference calls. - A Platform game (or platformer) is a video game which involves guiding an avatar to jump between suspended platforms and/or over obstacles to advance the game. The player controls the jumps to avoid letting the avatar fall from platforms or miss necessary jumps. The most common unifying element of games of this genre is the jump button, but now there are other alternative like swiping in touchscreen. \\"Jumping\\", in this genre, may include swinging from extendable arms, as in \\"Ristar\\" or \\"Bionic Commando\\", or bouncing from springboards or trampolines, as in \\"Alpha Waves\\". These mechanics, even in the context of other genres, are commonly called \\"platforming\\", a verbification of \\"platform\\". Games where jumping is automated completely, such as 3D games in \\"The Legend of Zelda\\" series, fall outside of the genre. - A fighting game is a video game genre in which the player controls an on-screen character and engages in close combat with an opponent, which can be either an AI or controlled by another player. The fight matches typically consist of several rounds and take place in an arena, while each character has widely differing abilities but each is relatively viable to choose. Players must master techniques such as blocking, counter-attacking, and chaining attacks together into \\"combos\\". Since the early 1990s, most fighting games allow the player to execute special attacks by performing specific input combinations. The fighting game genre is related to but distinct from beat 'em ups, which involve large numbers of enemies against the human player. - Plumage (\\"feather\\") refers both to the layer of feathers that cover a bird and the pattern, colour, and arrangement of those feathers. The pattern and colours of plumage differ between species and subspecies, and may vary with age classes. Within species there can be different colour morphs. - An antagonist is a character, group of characters, institution, or concept that stands in or represents opposition against which the protagonist(s) must contend. In other words, an antagonist is a person or a group of people who opposes a protagonist. - Windows Mobile is a family of mobile operating systems developed by Microsoft for smartphones and Pocket PCs. - TAGAP : The Apocalyptic Game About Penguins ( or just ' TAGAP ' for short ) is a computer action game series for Microsoft Windows , released as freeware .

The genre includes diverse subgenres such as fighting games, shooter games and platform games which are widely considered the most important action games, though some real-time strategy games are also considered to be action games. - Windows Embedded Compact, formerly Windows Embedded CE and Windows CE, is an operating system subfamily developed by Microsoft as part of its Windows Embedded family of products. Unlike Windows Embedded Standard, which is based on Windows NT, Windows Embedded Compact uses a different hybrid kernel. Microsoft licenses Windows CE to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), who can modify and create their own user interfaces and experiences, with Windows CE providing the technical foundation to do so. - Penguins (order Sphenisciformes, family Spheniscidae) are a group of aquatic, flightless birds. They live almost exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere, with only one species, the Galapagos penguin, found north of the equator. Highly adapted for life in the water, penguins have countershaded dark and white plumage, and their wings have evolved into flippers. Most penguins feed on krill, fish, squid and other forms of sealife caught while swimming underwater. They spend about half of their lives on land and half in the oceans. - Freeware is proprietary software that is available for use at no monetary cost. In other words, freeware may be used without payment but may usually not be modified, re-distributed or reverse-engineered without the author's permission. Two historic examples of freeware include Skype and Adobe Acrobat Reader. - A protagonist is the main character in any story, such as a literary work or drama. - Real-time strategy (RTS) is a subgenre of strategy video games where the game does not progress incrementally in turns. - Windows NT is a family of operating systems produced by Microsoft, the first version of which was released in July 1993. It is a processor-independent, multiprocessing, multi-user operating system. - In computing, WinG (pronounced \\"Win Gee\\") is an application programming interface that is a port of Windows 95's Device Independent Bitmaps to provide faster graphics performance on Windows 3.x operating environments, and was initially positioned as a way to help game developers more easily port their DOS games to Microsoft Windows, although it was quickly discontinued in favor of DirectX. - Microsoft Windows (or simply Windows) is a metafamily of graphical operating systems developed, marketed, and sold by Microsoft. It consists of several families of operating systems, each of which cater to a certain sector of the computing industry with the OS typically associated with IBM PC compatible architecture. Active Windows families include Windows NT, Windows Embedded and Windows Phone; these may encompass subfamilies, e.g. Windows Embedded Compact (Windows CE) or Windows Server. Defunct Windows families include Windows 9x; Windows 10 Mobile is an active product, unrelated to the defunct family Windows Mobile. - In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies. - Windows IoT, formerly Windows Embedded, is a family of operating systems from Microsoft designed for use in embedded systems. Microsoft currently has three different subfamilies of operating systems for embedded devices targeting a wide market, ranging from small-footprint, real-time devices to point of sale (POS) devices like kiosks. Windows Embedded operating systems are available to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), who make it available to end users preloaded with their hardware, in addition to volume license customers in some cases. - IBM PC compatible computers are those similar to the original IBM PC, XT, and AT, able to run the same software and support the same expansion cards as those. Such computers used to be referred to as PC clones, or IBM clones. They duplicate almost exactly all the significant features of the PC architecture, facilitated by IBM's choice of commodity hardware components and various manufacturers' ability to reverse engineer the BIOS firmware using a \\"clean room design\\" technique. Columbia Data Products built the first clone of the IBM personal computer by a clean room implementation of its BIOS.

We'll move 449*m from the right side to the left side by adding 449*m to both sides: 392*m + 449*m + 29575 = -449*m + 449*m - 26772 Step 2: Simplify the equation: (392 + 449)*m + 29575 = -26772 841*m + 29575 = -26772 Step 3: Now, move the constant 29575 from the left side to the right side by subtracting 29575 from both sides: 841*m + 29575 - 29575 = -26772 - 29575 841*m = -56347 Step 4: Finally, we'll isolate m by dividing both sides of the equation by 841: m = -56347 / 841 m ≈ -67 The solution to the equation 392*m + 29575 = -449*m - 26772 for the variable m is approximately -67."},{"question":"Here are some concepts: celebrate, day, medal, rower What is a sentence about these concepts?","response":"Step 1: Identify the main subject of the sentence In this case, the main subject appears to be \\"rower.\\" Step 2: Incorporate the related concepts into the sentence We have \\"celebrate,\\" \\"day,\\" and \\"medal\\" as related concepts.

While racing wildly with his friends in the snow, Richie's butler, Herbert Cadbury, controls the cars using a remote and guides the children back to Richie's house. He then reminds him about his responsibilities that are due to be executed on Christmas Eve, and instructs him to change his clothes and get ready for tea. Before going to do so, he visits his home scientist, Professor Keanbean, who shows him his recent invention, a wishing machine which works only on Christmas Eve. The day being that, Richie wishes for a \\"big pie\\" from it, and is given a \\"pig sty\\" instead. Cadbury is disgusted seeing this, and sends him off to change his clothes. He meets his parents, Richard and Regina Rich, to ask what they would like to have for Christmas.

Which village made more money from sand mining? Two coastal Canadian towns, Hammond and Soundville decided to start sand mining to bring more money to their budgets. A few months later however, Hammond decided to stop all mining operations and find other sources of income. they wanted to protect the environment. Hint: Sand mining is a direct cause of erosion, and impacts the local wildlife.[2] Various animals depend on sandy beaches for nesting clutches, and mining has led to the near extinction of gharials (a species of crocodile) in India. Disturbance of underwater and coastal sand causes turbidity in the water, which is harmful for organisms like coral that need sunlight. It can also destroy fisheries, financially harming their operators. Removal of physical coastal barriers, such as dunes, sometimes leads to flooding of beachside communities, and the destruction of picturesque beaches causes tourism to dissipate.

During a town hall meeting, an old blind prophet accurately describes Redferne's dream and prophecizes that he is the chosen one destined to save their village and world. However, Redferne has a murky past and feels unworthy to be entrusted with such a great responsibility. Despite his initial reluctance, he agrees to embark on a quest to capture the Warlock when his best friend's only child falls gravely ill due to the afflictions resulting from the Warlock's actions. Act Two: Redferne leaves Elderton, taking up his father's old sword and armor, carrying the weight of the village's hope on his shoulders. He is accompanied by Taya, a skilled archer and his childhood friend. Together, they form an unlikely duo as they navigate the treacherous path to the Warlock's lair. On their journey, they are joined by other brave souls, including a crafty young thief, Idris, who saved their lives from an ambush set by the Warlock's minions; and Amara, a brilliant sorceress exiled from her academic coven for practicing forbidden magic, seeking redemption and a purpose. They must overcome numerous challenges, such as battling magical creatures, surviving an enchanted forest, and solving riddles from ancient guardians, all orchestrated by the cunning Warlock to deter them from reaching him. Along the way, Redferne learns more about his own magical ancestry and the secret his parents kept hidden from him - the reason he was chosen to stop the Warlock. Act Three: Redferne and his companions discover the Warlock's stronghold, the Cavern of Shadows, where they must confront their darkest fears to defeat the Warlock. In a climactic battle, Amara is fatally wounded protecting Redferne, and the Warlock manages to assemble the Oculus Afflictionem. Just as the artifact reaches its maximum power, Redferne's untapped magical abilities awaken, allowing him to deflect the Warlock's torrent of dark energy and disarm him. With the Warlock captured, the Oculus Afflictionem disassembles itself into fragments once more. Redferne chooses to entrust each piece to a different kingdom, ensuring that no individual could wield its tremendous power again. As they return to the village, Redferne is hailed a hero, in spite of his troubled past. He learns the value of friendship and the true meaning of heroism - the ability to do what is right, despite one's fears and doubts. The village begins to heal, and Redferne is finally at peace with his new identity as both a savior and a powerful mage. With the Warlock imprisoned, Redferne and his surviving companions form a new league of protectors - the Order of the Chains - vowing to safeguard the realms from any future threats from dark magic. The movie ends with a sense of hopefulness and newfound camaraderie among the heroes as they prepare for their next adventure together."},{"question":"News article: The first debate was the Hillary and Bernie Show, and Hillary received top billing. Not only was Hillary Clinton on the receiving end of the night’s biggest gift — her rival, Bernie Sanders, declaring it time for people to shut up about her email scandal — she also delivered some of the evening’s most stinging retorts. Story Continued Below The Democratic front-runner showed renewed energy and comfort on a presidential debate stage where she, but none of the others, had been before. But one of the most dramatic and memorable moments came from Sanders. And it was a plea for the political conversation to move on from the email controversy that has consumed much of the overall Democratic race. “The American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails,” Sanders declared, after Clinton defended her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state and cast the Republican-led congressional investigation as overly partisan. Clinton beamed wide and, when Sanders was done, reached over to shake his hand. “Thank you Bernie,” she smiled. Inside the room at the Wynn resort and casino, there was a standing ovation among the Democratic attendees of the debate. It wasn’t just Clinton and the crowd that was celebrating. Behind the scenes, her team was too. “Bernie Sanders just did for Hillary what her own staff could not,” one source close to the Clinton campaign said in an email. Clinton had arrived at the debate following months of questions about her use of a private server and email account, its security, whether she trafficked classified materials, and why she set up such an operation in the first place. But after the Sanders remark, CNN’s Anderson Cooper more or less dropped the matter. She was also aided by the fact that she faced little interrogation about the 2012 attacks on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, where four American diplomats were killed. The event spurred the congressional investigation that led to the disclosure of her private email servers. Clinton also did plenty for herself. She moved with relative ease from swipes against her Democratic rivals to more direct attacks on Republicans. And she succinctly summarized her candidacy when pressed about some of her shifting positions about whether she is a moderate or a liberal. “I’m a progressive. But I’m a progressive who likes to get things done,” Clinton declared. Other candidates besides Sanders and Clinton struggled to break through. Jim Webb complained repeatedly about not getting a chance to speak. Martin O’Malley registered few memorable moments. And Lincoln Chafee mostly faded into the background. More than an hour into the debate, data from Twitter showed that the top three candidates mentioned on the platform were Clinton, Sanders and — not one of the other candidates on stage — but instead Donald Trump, who was live-tweeting the debate himself. Notably absent was any substantial mention of Vice President Joe Biden, who planned to watch the debate from his Naval Observatory residence in Washington as he continues his long consideration of whether to jump into the contest. It was not all smooth for Clinton. She was put on the defensive more than once for changing her position on issues and at one point declared, “I never took a position on Keystone, until I took a position on Keystone,” the controversial oil pipeline she recently opposed after long refusing to articulate her stance. “I do absorb new information,” Clinton said, justifying her sometimes shifting positions. Twice, she used the fact that she would be the first woman president to deflect questions — once on the fact that she would be the second Clinton to get the “crown” of the presidency and once about how she would be different from an Obama third term. “I think being the first woman president would be quite a change,” she said of her differences with Obama, though was vague when pressed further for details. Sanders was able to get his strongly progressive message across, coming back repeatedly to his theme of running against big money and railing against millionaires, billionaires and super PACS from the start. “Our campaign finance system is corrupt and is undermining America democracy,” he declared in his opening statement. Later, he rattled off a memorable line about reining in the excesses of the powerful finance industry. “In my view, Congress doesn’t regulate Wall Street,” Sanders said. “Wall Street regulates Congress.” But Clinton also managed to get in some sharp jabs at her surging rival. The memorable moment of kind sentiment between Sanders and Clinton came after she had ripped into him in the opening minutes of the debate, going straight after Sanders for his position on guns, one of the few issues in which the democratic socialist is out of step with the Democratic base. When Sanders was pressed by CNN moderator Anderson Cooper on his position, he cited his current “D minus” rating from the National Rifle Association. However, the Vermont senator has a mixed record on guns, in part a reflection of his constituency — his state prides itself on a deep hunting and gun culture. Sanders voted against the Brady Bill, but voted for an assault weapons ban, and voted to allow firearms on Amtrak, while voting for universal background checks. Asked if Sanders' stance was hard enough on the gun lobby, Clinton replied tartly, “No, not at all.” That wasn’t the only issue on which she went after Sanders, who has surged in the polls, particularly in New Hampshire. She criticized him for his refusal to embrace capitalism and his holding up of European socialism as a model for America, particularly his embrace of Denmark. “We are not Denmark. I love Denmark. We are the United States of America,” she declared. Clinton had a comeback at the ready when O’Malley attacked her at one point, as well. “I was very pleased when Governor O’Malley endorsed me for president in 2008,” she said disarmingly. The debate, held at the Wynn resort and casino in Las Vegas before a live audience of more than 1,000, represented one of the biggest moments yet in the Democratic primary. A big question is how Clinton's strong performance may change the calculation of Biden. Biden’s allies have continually pushed back the timetable for his announcement about whether he'll jump in the race, and he still may wait until after Clinton's high-stakes testimony next week before the House Select Committee on Benghazi. Even without a formal declaration, Biden has been polling in the strong double digits and could further erode Clinton's lead if he makes a serious go of it. Another large presence in the race who was not in attendance but was still front-of-mind — Trump. The Republican front-runner made a bid to turn the debate into The Trump Show, updating his Twitter feed with real-time retorts to what the Democrats were saying on stage. He kicked it off with a quick jab, tweeting, \\"Putin is not feeling too nervous or scared.\\" He also attacked Clinton on her newly stated opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact, saying \\"The trade deal is a disaster, she was always for it! #DemDebate.\\" Trump lit into the lower-polling candidates, tweeting, \\"O'Malley, as former Mayor of Baltimore, has very little chance,\\" and \\"Can anyone imagine Chafee as president? No way.\\" He also said none of the candidates in the Democratic field could come close to his wattage. \\"Sorry, there is no STAR on the stage tonight!\\" Annie Karni, Gabriel Debenedetti and Hadas Gold contributed to this report. ||||| Reuters/Lucy Nicholson Hillary Clinton arrived in Las Vegas as the overwhelming front-runner for the Democratic nomination, and she was destined to leave as the favorite, too. Instead of turning in the safe and solid performance she needed, though, Clinton was closer to spectacular on Tuesday night. Josh Voorhees Josh Voorhees is a Slate senior writer. He lives in Iowa City. She was confident early and poised throughout. More surprisingly—and perhaps more importantly—she also drew first blood on Bernie Sanders, who was put on the defensive early when CNN moderator Anderson Cooper pressed him to explain the biggest blemish on his otherwise progressive resume: His 2005 vote to shield gun makers and dealers from lawsuits. With Sanders struggling, Cooper turned to Clinton to ask if her rival is “tough enough on guns.” Hillary, who earlier this month cleverly made repealing that same law a centerpiece of her gun reform proposal, didn’t hesitate. “No,” she said, “not at all.” Toward the end of the debate she was even able to put some focus on the historic nature of her candidacy and to take some shots at the GOP, two themes that would certainly be central to any general election campaign. Advertisement Bernie had his own strong moments during the debate, but he never quite recovered from his early stumble—particularly in front of a boisterous Democratic crowd that seemed to favor his establishment rival. Hillary’s lesser-known challengers, meanwhile, struggled to keep their sights set squarely on Clinton: Former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley went after Sanders, former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chaffee took a shot at former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb, and Webb spent way too much of his limited speaking time complaining … about his limited speaking time. Clinton, meanwhile, stayed on message and found her way out of one close jam after another, including an opening grilling from Cooper about a slew of reversals on topics ranging from marriage equality to the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The question of political expediency versus principle is a rather tough one for Clinton—and she played fast and loose with the facts when explaining how she came to oppose the trade deal she once called the “gold standard of trade deals”—but her response played well in the room nonetheless. “Are you a progressive or a moderate,” Cooper eventually asked. “I’m a progressive—but I like to get things done,” Clinton answered to cheers. This was the central message of the entire night for the former secretary of state, and it came through loud and clear. Later, Clinton found herself back in the middle of the Iraq war, taking shots from her rivals for her 2002 vote to authorize the war, much as she did back in her 2008 campaign against Barack Obama—something Hillary smoothly used to her advantage. “I recall very well being on a debate stage, I think, about 25 times with then–Sen. Obama debating this very issue,” Clinton responded calmly. “After the election, he asked me to become secretary of state.” Likewise, she dispatched O’Malley’s suggestion that she was too quick to use military force with a similar callback. “I have to say, I was very pleased when Gov. O’Malley endorsed me for president in 2008,” she said, “and I enjoyed his strong support in that campaign.” Clinton’s jujitsu wasn’t relegated to questions about her past. Clinton’s partisan witch-hunt–themed response to questions about her email scandal was nothing we haven’t heard from her before—but the response to her strong delivery suggested that Democratic voters are willing to forgive and forget. Not only did she draw boisterous cheers from the crowd with her tried-if-not-completely-true defense, she even had Sanders coming to her aid. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","response":"This article is about a debate between Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, and some other people who want to be the President of the United States.

Original statement: \\"Three surgeons are performing brain surgery.\\" This statement provides the following information: 1. There are three surgeons. 2. The surgeons are currently performing brain surgery. However, the statement does not explicitly mention any specific details regarding the equipment or tools used during the surgery, including the safety glasses or magnifying lenses. Now let's analyze the conclusion: \\"Three surgeons operate on a patient while wearing magnifying lenses on their safety glasses.\\" This statement includes some additional information and assumptions that were not explicitly stated in the original statement: 1. The surgeons are wearing safety glasses. 2. The safety glasses are equipped with magnifying lenses. While it is common for surgeons, especially in delicate operations like brain surgery, to wear safety glasses and use magnifying lenses to provide a better view of the surgical site, these details are not guaranteed by the original statement. Thus, drawing this conclusion would involve making assumptions about the specific equipment used by the surgeons. In summary, it is not entirely accurate to conclude that the three surgeons are wearing safety glasses with magnifying lenses based solely on the information provided in the statement \\"Three surgeons are performing brain surgery.\\" To make that conclusion, one would need additional information or evidence supporting the use of safety glasses and magnifying lenses during the surgery."},{"question":"Short general knowledge question: where did laura ingalls wilder live?

A:","response":"While I understand the logic behind the statement that \\"not eating\\" might prevent food poisoning caused by microorganisms, I would like to provide a more comprehensive and detailed answer to the question \\"what causes food poisoning?\\" Food poisoning, a common and sometimes severe adverse health effect, is a result of consuming contaminated, spoiled, or toxic food. The primary cause of food poisoning is harmful microorganisms, including bacteria, parasites, and viruses. These organisms can contaminate food at any stage during its production, processing, or cooking. Some of the most common microorganisms responsible for food poisoning include: 1. Bacteria: Some well-known bacteria that cause foodborne illnesses are Salmonella, Escherichia coli (E. coli), Listeria monocytogenes, and Campylobacter. Bacterial contamination typically occurs when food is prepared in unsanitary conditions, improperly stored, or undercooked. 2. Viruses: Norovirus, Rotavirus, and Hepatitis A are examples of viruses that may cause food poisoning. Virus-contaminated food can result from poor food handling practices, such as an infected person preparing food without handwashing or from contaminated water sources. 3. Parasites: Although less common than bacterial and viral contamination, parasites such as Giardia, Cryptosporidium, and Toxoplasma gondii can also cause food poisoning. Parasites can enter the food chain via soil, water, or even by the handling of contaminated animals during food production. Aside from microorganisms, other factors can contribute to food poisoning as well: 1. Chemicals: Certain naturally occurring toxins or chemicals can contaminate some foods, such as mycotoxins produced by molds in grains, aflatoxins in peanuts, and the toxin associated with puffer fish. Additionally, chemical contamination can occur through accidental exposure to pesticides, herbicides, or cleaning products. 2. Allergens: Food poisoning can also be a result of exposure to food allergens, causing symptoms similar to those experienced in an allergic reaction. This is not the same as a typical food poisoning incident, as allergens primarily affect individuals with food allergies. In conclusion, while \\"not eating\\" could potentially reduce the risk of food poisoning, it is not a viable or sustainable solution. A better approach is to practice good food hygiene, proper food handling, and food storage techniques. Additionally, fully cooking food, particularly meats, and being cautious with ready-to-eat foods can significantly reduce the risk of food poisoning."},{"question":"Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

Answer the question: If greenhouse gas were to be halved, the global temperature would increase or decrease?","response":"If greenhouse gas levels were to be halved, it is expected that global temperatures would decrease. Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, causing temperatures to rise. This is commonly referred to as the greenhouse effect. By reducing the levels of these gases in the atmosphere, less heat would be trapped, leading to a lower overall global temperature. However, the magnitude and rate of temperature decrease would depend on various factors, such as the levels of different greenhouse gases being reduced, the rate at which they are removed from the atmosphere, and the overall climate sensitivity. It is important to note that halving greenhouse gas emissions alone may not be sufficient to reverse the long-term consequences of climate change, as some of the changes are already \\"locked-in\\" due to past emissions. Nonetheless, significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions would help mitigate further temperature increases and reduce the risks associated with climate change."},{"question":"Imagine a question and stream-of-consciousness explanation for which this is the answer: yes","response":"Question: Can people improve their problem-solving skills through practicing exercises and expanding their knowledge base? Explanation: Someone might ponder if their problem-solving skills can be developed and enhanced over time. They might wonder if engaging in practice exercises, learning new concepts, and building their knowledge base would contribute to better problem-solving abilities. It seems logical that as individuals broaden their horizons through learning experiences and continuous practice, their capacity for tackling problems would likely improve. In educational settings, for example, students often show growth in their abilities to solve complex problems by continually working on tasks, getting feedback, and acquiring new knowledge. It is reasonable to assume that a similar pattern could apply in general when it comes to improving one's problem-solving skills.

Here is a step-by-step guide to solve the given equation: 1. Equation: -355*k + 2983 + 567 = 0 2. First, combine the constant terms: 2983 + 567 = 3550 So, the equation becomes: -355*k + 3550 = 0 3. Now, you need to isolate the k term. Move the constant term (3550) to the other side of the equation by subtracting it: -355*k + 3550 - 3550 = 0 - 3550 This simplifies to: -355*k = -3550 4. To solve for k, you need to remove the coefficient (-355) in front of k. You can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by -355: (-355*k) / (-355) = (-3550) / (-355) 5. After dividing, the equation becomes: k = 10 So, the value of k that satisfies the given equation is k = 10."},{"question":"Triple: Philadelphia Flyers GAMES 3,506; Philadelphia Flyers SEASONS 44 What is a sentence that describes this triple?","response":"The Philadelphia Flyers, a professional ice hockey team in the National Hockey League (NHL), have played an impressive 3,506 games over the course of their 44 seasons, showcasing their rich history and significant contribution to the sport since their inception in 1967."},{"question":"Given the question: Generate a question that has the following answer: In the girl's cabin for the following movie plot: T.C., the head counselor at Camp Rolling Hills, is at a campfire with the male campers Sean, Rob, Anthony, Judd, Charlie and Emilio.

He is well-regarded in the community for building intricate puzzles and riddles that the townspeople enjoy solving on their weekends. It's an uneventful existence, but Gary doesn't mind - he is content with the simple joys of life. One day, a mysterious envelope is delivered to Gary's doorstep with no return address. Curiously, it contains an unsigned letter challenging him to build the ultimate puzzle – one that will bring the most exceptional minds in the world to their knees. Accompanying the letter are a series of increasingly complicated riddles, each one fashioned in such a way that they seem to speak to Gary on a personal level. Intrigued and unsettled by the puzzling challenge, Gary begins to devise an elaborate riddle that, when solved, will reveal the identity of the mastermind behind this mysterious challenge. As he works on the puzzle, he begins to notice strange occurrences around him. His reclusive neighbor, Margaret (played by Meryl Streep), seems to be watching him at all times. His long-time best friend, Charlie (played by Sam Rockwell), begins to act distant and suspicious, and Gary's own past starts to unravel as dark secrets emerge. Enlisting the help of his daughter, Melissa (played by Zoey Deutch), and her investigative journalist boyfriend, Stephen (played by Tom Holland), Gary sets in motion a dangerous game of cat and mouse as they work to unravel the mysterious riddles and Gary's increasingly perilous puzzle. As they get closer to solving the riddles and unraveling the puzzle, they discover that the mastermind has been watching and manipulating the lives of the townspeople, using them as pawns in this deadly game. In a shocking twist, Gary discovers that the mastermind is none other than his long-lost twin brother, Thomas (also played by Richard Jenkins), who was separated from him at birth. The two brothers, who had lived vastly different lives, must confront each other and their shared past as they confront the consequences of the puzzles they have created, realizing that they may have met their match in each other. As the thrilling climax unfolds, Gary and Thomas engage in a deadly game of wits and strategy, with each puzzle bringing them closer to a final, devastating confrontation. In the end, the brothers must decide if they are willing to put aside their rivalry and differences to preserve their shared humanity or continue to be locked in a never-ending duel of twisted logic and deception. 'Riddles of the Enigma' showcases a brilliant performance by Richard Jenkins as both the protagonist, Gary, and antagonist, Thomas, and explores the depths of human intelligence, the complexities of sibling rivalry, and the dark side of pursuing perfection."},{"question":"Given the question: There is no hiding from the impact agenda. The impact weighting of the Research Excellence Framework has been increased for 2021, and more recently the UK Government announced a new funding stream for knowledge exchange. But achieving impact isn’t easy, especially for researchers early in their careers. If you ever have a spare week, or ten, it’s worth reading through some of the 6,637 REF impact case studies on the HEFCE website. There are some brilliant and fascinating examples of how researchers have achieved impact, but what strikes me most is how different impact looks across different subjects. At the risk of being flippant, among many of the medical or technological examples there is a familiar pattern and a clear route to impact: make breakthrough; license drug/technology; save lives/£millions. For social and political science (not to mention economics, languages, education, philosophy, etc.) the route to impact is much more fragmented. Among the 97 sociology case studies, for example, impact comes from numerous briefings of government officials and parliamentarians, before the academics join “networks” and “committees” discussing their research and wider issues. Their research is covered by national media, they meet even more people – practitioners or third sector campaigning organisations to pass on their knowledge. And, after all that, and often a good deal more, sometimes there is a policy or practice change that can be pointed to as a direct impact, sometimes not. Central to much of the impact is “access”. Prominent and experienced academics are more likely to get on the committees, know the right journalists and government officials, and have links into third sector organisations, etc. I worked with Professor Sir John Curtice, of election night fame, for a number of years. He didn’t need much support. I advised and facilitated, but after 30 years in the game he knew Whitehall (and Holyrood) inside and out – and they knew him. But many researchers, especially at the start of their careers, don’t... Why isn't achieving impact easy? A. impact requires people to have perseverance B. impact requires many people C. not enough information D. Impact requires access The answer is:","response":"D. Impact requires access. Achieving impact isn't easy, particularly for early-career researchers, because it often requires access to resources, networks, and influential individuals or organizations. Gaining this access can be challenging and time-consuming, especially for those who are just starting out in their careers and have not yet established robust professional networks. Established researchers often have the advantage of having built and fostered relationships throughout their careers, which can offer them more direct routes to impact. They may already have connections with key decision-makers in their field, have served on relevant committees, or know journalists and third-sector organizations that can help to disseminate their research findings. In contrast, early-career researchers may face barriers to achieving impact, such as: 1. Limited professional networks: Without an established network of professional contacts, it can be more difficult for early-career researchers to engage with influential individuals or organizations that could help achieve impact in their research area. 2. Less experience navigating the landscape: Established researchers who have navigated the research landscape throughout their careers may have a better understanding of the channels through which to pursue impact, whereas early-career researchers may not yet have this knowledge or experience. 3. Resource constraints: Achieving impact often requires time, funding, and other resources, which may be more challenging for early-career researchers to access compared to their more established counterparts. 4. Competing priorities: Early-career researchers may face competing demands on their time and resources, such as teaching, administrative tasks, or the pressure to secure tenure, which can leave less time to focus on achieving impact through their research. 5. Gaining credibility: Achieving impact often requires credibility within one's field, which can be harder for early-career researchers to establish compared to those who have built a strong reputation over an extended period. Despite these challenges, early-career researchers should not be discouraged. They can overcome these barriers to achieving impact by actively seeking out mentoring and networking opportunities, collaborating with established researchers and organizations, and remaining persistent in their efforts to share their research findings and insights with those who can benefits from them."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a short passage that may convey stereotype, anti-stereotype, or is unrelated.

They went camping together once a month. Bob was into bird watching, while Andy was fascinated with frogs and salamanders. They went on a trip last week-end and they were very happy with what they had observed. But I can use this background: You may hear males \\"ribbiting,\\" producing a mating call used to attract females to the bodies of water best for mating and breeding. Frog calls can occur during the day or night. Each frog species has a different call that is used to attract mates and warn off rivals. When a female picks a male whose call she likes, the male grabs her and squeezes across her back and around her abdomen. This causes the female to release her eggs. The male then fertilizes the eggs and, in some species, also guards them. What is an answer for this question: Which friend heard fewer frog calls during the night? Answer:","response":"Based on the information provided, it is likely that Bob, the bird enthusiast, heard fewer frog calls during the night. Andy, who was fascinated with frogs and salamanders, would have been more attuned to and focused on listening for frog calls. As a nature enthusiast with a specific interest in frogs and salamanders, Andy would have likely spent more time near bodies of water where frog calls are more prominent. Furthermore, his knowledge of and passion for these creatures would make him more perceptive to their unique mating calls, making it easier for him to identify them during both day and night. On the other hand, Bob, being into bird watching, might have devoted more of his attention to observing and listening for birds. Although he may have still heard some frog calls, he was not as likely to actively seek them out or be as proficient in recognizing their various calls. His main focus would have been on the bird species they encountered during their camping trip. It is important to note that the number of frog calls heard by each friend could be influenced by several factors, including their individual preferences, the locations they were exploring, and the time they spent near frog habitats. However, given Bob's interest in bird watching and Andy's fascination with frogs and salamanders, it is reasonable to conclude that Bob likely heard fewer frog calls during the night compared to Andy."},{"question":"– United Flight 5277 took off from Chicago's O'Hare International Airport at 2:45pm last Tuesday, heading to Chattanooga. More than halfway through the 71-minute flight, the pilot made an announcement: \\"We're going to turn and go back to O'Hare,\\" one of the passengers recalls him saying to USA Today. Another passenger says the pilot explained that the 76-seat Embraer 175 aircraft was too big to land at Chattanooga, which didn't make sense to her since she'd taken Delta flights to the airport on the same type of plane. The regional flight, a United Express flight operated by SkyWest Airlines, is operated daily, but there had been a last-minute aircraft swap due to a mechanical issue. The Points Guy confirms Chattanooga can indeed handle that size aircraft. The real problem apparently involved ground crew equipment for that particular plane. The 50 passengers aboard were back in Chicago at 4:29pm, and ultimately switched to a 50-seat Bombardier CRJ 200—the aircraft United typically uses for that flight. They ended up in Chattanooga more than three hours late; at some point after the plane had already turned around, they received a text alert from United saying that due to \\"unforeseen circumstances\\" and an \\"unusual situation,\\" their flight would be delayed. A second text message explained that the Chattanooga airport was \\"unable to assist with ground operational requirements for your current aircraft type,\\" and a SkyWest spokesperson says the Embraer was \\"just a different aircraft than typical for ground personnel there.\\" Passengers were refunded and given a 300 voucher for a future flight, and perhaps more importantly, they were also given Cheez-Its upon landing back in Chicago.

They had a salary cap (a limit on how much they can pay their players) of £3.5 million per year because they were losing money. However, now they have more money from Europe and a new deal with the Welsh Rugby Union. So, the salary cap has increased to help them keep their best players and bring back some \\"Welsh exiles\\" (Welsh players who play in other countries) like Leigh Halfpenny, Jonathan Davies, George North, and Luke Charteris.

Federal security forces said in a statement that the man was arrested Friday in the western state of Jalisco along with four others on suspicion of drug trafficking, kidnapping and murder. His full name is not given, but a police official confirmed Saturday that it was Alfredo Beltran Guzman. The official was not authorized to discuss the case publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Beltran Guzman's father is Alfredo Beltran Leyva, a former leader of the Beltran Leyva cartel who in February pleaded guilty to drug trafficking charges in Washington. The Beltran Leyva cartel began as an arm of Joaquin \\"El Chapo\\" Guzman's Sinaloa cartel. Beltran Guzman is also related to the Sinaloa cartel leader who is fighting extradition to the U.S. The Beltran Leyva operation split from the Sinaloa cartel following Alfredo Beltran Leyva's arrest in 2008. Beltran Guzman was arrested Friday without a shot being fired in Zapopan, Jalisco. Rifles, a grenade and drugs were also seized. The statement said Beltran Guzman was connected with the kidnapping in August of several people, including at least one of Joaquin Guzman's sons in Puerto Vallarta. It also suggested he was behind attacks in Guzman's hometown, including on his mother's compound. At some point, pursued by authorities and Guzman's people, Beltran Guzman moved his base of operations from Culiacan, Sinaloa to Guadalajara, Jalisco, the statement said. There he formed a relationship with other criminal groups, presumably the Jalisco New Generation cartel.","response":"Mexican police have arrested Alfredo Beltran Guzman, the son of a drug cartel leader, in the state of Jalisco.

In an outcome few could have imagined several weeks ago, Jones defeated controversial Republican candidate Roy Moore, who had the backing of President Donald Trump. In the wake of Jones' victory, Democrats are more confident about success in next year's congressional midterm elections, and Republicans are looking for a way to rebound. Late Tuesday, Jones paid tribute to the voters and staffers who supported him in his longshot victory over Moore. \\"This campaign has been about common courtesy and decency and making sure everyone in this state, regardless of which ZIP code you live in, is going to get a fair shake in life!\\" he told supporters. Moore was unable to overcome allegations of sexual misconduct stemming back decades involving several women who were teenagers at the time while Moore was in his 30s. Moore stopped short of conceding the race, however, saying, \\"We have been painted in an unfavorable and unfaithful light. We have been put in a hole, if you will, and it reminds me of a [Bible] passage in Psalms 40, 'I waited patiently for the Lord.' That is what we have got to do.\\" Moore had the full backing of the president in the final days of the campaign after Trump initially held back his endorsement in the wake of the allegations against Moore. The president responded Wednesday to questions at the White House about the Alabama race and said that he had hoped for a different result. \\"I wish we would have gotten the seat. A lot of Republicans feel differently. They are very happy with the way it turned out,\\" he said. \\"But as the leader of the party, I would have liked to have the seat. I want to endorse the people who are running.\\" Jones won in large part because of a strong Democratic turnout, especially by African-Americans.

Riots were sparked across the Islamic world in September after a 14-minute trailer for the \\"Innocence of Muslims\\" video was released on YouTube. Troops are now on heightened alert to the risk of another round of protests because a derivative film called \\"The Innocent Prophet\\" is slated to be released on Friday. The new footage created by an ex- Muslim originally from Pakistan has already inflamed tensions in his former home country ahead of its release. Coalition forces are prepared for extreme reactions to the provocative video that could hamper their efforts in neighbouring Afghanistan, which is already a tinder box of religious sensitivities. Defence forces are warned to be wary of inadvertently offending locals as part of their preparations for deployment to the main Australian base in Uruzgan province or other centres of Kabul and Kandahar. Cultural sensitivity training is a standard element of soldiers' pre-deployment training in Australia. But the key points are drilled into all military and civilian personnel going to work in Afghanistan in another intensive four day program at the Al Minhad Air Base outside Dubai. The training includes appropriate ways to handle and store the Koran, which is generally wrapped in a cloth and only opened after the reader has ritually cleansed themselves. This preparation has taken on extra urgency in the aftermath of an increase in insider attacks against Coalition forces. Retribution for perceived slights on Islam are thought to be one possible trigger for these turncoat attacks, which claimed three out of the seven Diggers' lives lost in Afghanistan this year. Coalition forces are wary of violent reactions from Afghans who are upset by breaches of religious protocol. Days of rioting ensued after Coalition soldiers burned copies of the Koran when they were disposing of old books at the Bagram Air Base near Kabul last February. US President Barack Obama and the chief of NATO forces in Afghanistan, General John Allen, both issued televised apologies in a bid to quell the outcry, which insurgents have used as justification for attacks. The Australians' training also covers emergency care of battle casualties, shooting practice and the latest intelligence on the other big killer of troops - improvised explosive devices. Troops are briefed on the latest threats from explosives, practice travelling through mine fields and detecting suicide bombers. Simulated rescue missions of injured people from buildings and vehicles while under fire are used to prepare troops for the worst case scenarios they could encounter during their deployment. Sergeant Chris Johansson, who ran the course, said the exercises were designed to prepare even the most experienced troops for the reality of war. \\"It's meant to get people in the mindset that they are going to a war zone,\\" he said. ||||| Watch Queue Queue Watch Queue Queue Remove all Disconnect ||||| Write a summary.","response":"Australian troops in Afghanistan are preparing for possible violent protests because of the release of a new film that makes fun of Islam.

He also loved being outdoors, spending time with family and friends, and actively participating in his faith. Elder Bailey was a young man who eagerly answered the call to serve a mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He had dedicated two years of his life to sharing the gospel message with those in need and providing service to communities in Sweden. His tragic loss has deeply affected not only his loved ones but also the people he served and the global Mormon community. Elder Bailey graduated from Richfield High School, where he was known for his athleticism, particularly in track and field events. He was also a National Honor Society member and displayed a strong work ethic in both academics and extra-curricular activities. Before leaving for his mission in Sweden, Elder Bailey worked as a lifeguard and in the family business. These experiences, coupled with his commitment to his faith, built a solid foundation for him to take on the challenges and responsibilities that come with serving a mission in a foreign country. Elder Bailey's family and friends cherished the regular letters he sent from Sweden, detailing his missionary work and experiences abroad. They admired how he overcame the obstacles of language and culture to bring the gospel message to the people of Sweden. In his short time there, he managed to form strong bonds and friendships with the locals. Elder Bailey's companion, who was with him at the time of the accident, was uninjured. As per The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints' guidelines, missionaries always travel in pairs for safety and companionship. The church also provides emotional and logistical support to both the missionaries and their families in such challenging times, through local leaders and the mission president. Following the tragic accident, the Church and the Sweden Stockholm Mission officials are coordinating with local authorities in the ongoing investigation. The church will also assist in making arrangements for Elder Bailey's body to be returned home to Utah where his family and loved ones can properly mourn and lay him to rest. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has issued a statement regarding the incident, expressing their deepest sympathy to Elder Bailey's family. The church and its members worldwide mourn the loss of Elder Bailey, with many uniting in prayer for his family during this difficult time. The church's president, Russell M. Nelson, similarly expressed his condolences to the Bailey family. Elder Mason Lewis Bailey's memory will be cherished by those who knew him and the lives he touched during his short but meaningful time in Sweden. His passion for serving others and sharing the gospel will not be forgotten, as it serves as an inspiration and legacy to those who continue in his footsteps."},{"question":"Premise: Cheerleaders wait to catch their teammate. Hypothesis: Cheerleaders do not throw their teammates .Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true?","response":"To determine the validity of the hypothesis \\"Cheerleaders do not throw their teammates\\" based on the premise \\"Cheerleaders wait to catch their teammate,\\" we have to analyze the activities of cheerleading in general, along with the specific information provided in the premise. 1. First, consider the premise. It says that the cheerleaders are waiting to catch their teammate. This implies that someone (presumably their teammate) is in the air or about to be in the air, since you typically \\"catch\\" something or someone that is falling or tossed. 2. The act of tossing or lifting is intrinsic to many cheerleading routines, where one or more cheerleaders might lift or throw another who then performs aerial tricks before being caught. 3. From these two points, it's reasonable to theorize that the teammate did not get into the air on their own and was likely thrown or lifted—most likely by other cheerleaders. In conclusion, based on the premise \\"Cheerleaders wait to catch their teammate\\" we cannot necessarily accept the hypothesis \\"Cheerleaders do not throw their teammates\\" as true, because cheerleading routines often involve teammates throwing or lifting each other into the air. The act of waiting to catch their teammate suggests that the teammate was likely thrown or lifted.

The only really flat note in this splendid work is \\"When the Moon Hits Your Eye Like a Big Pizza Pie, That's Amore,\\" a song that is sung too many times in the movie (once is already too many) and that went on to have a long afterlife in popular music.

Second question: How historically accurate is How to Train Your Dragon? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","response":"First question: How historically and factually accurate is the Netflix drama Marco Polo? The Netflix series Marco Polo, which premiered in 2014, is a historical drama loosely based on the life of the Venetian merchant and explorer Marco Polo. The show was created by John Fusco and chronicles Marco Polo's journey and experiences in the court of Kublai Khan. Although the series is inspired by historical events and characters, there are several inaccuracies and fictional elements that have been incorporated for the sake of storytelling and entertainment. 1. Characters: While some of the characters are real figures from history, such as Marco Polo, Kublai Khan, and Chabi (Kublai Khan's principal wife), other characters like Prince Jingim (Kublai's son) and Hundred Eyes (martial arts expert and Polo's trainer) are fictional or loosely based on historical figures. 2. Timeframe: The show compresses several events and experiences that Polo encountered over his 24-year long travels in the East and this timeline compression may result in inaccuracies regarding the chronology of events. 3. Relationship between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan: While Marco Polo did serve in the court of Kublai Khan, it is improbable that he held such a prominent and influential position as depicted in the series. It is suggested that his role was more of a junior diplomat and merchant, rather than a key advisor. 4. Cultural and historical aspects: The series tends to present anachronistic and exoticized depictions of Asian cultures, which may not be entirely accurate. Additionally, it dramatizes certain historical events and battles for the sake of storytelling and entertainment, which can distort the factual accuracy of these events. Overall, while the series is entertaining and provides a glimpse into the world of Marco Polo and the Mongol Empire, it should not be relied on as an accurate historical account. Second question: How historically accurate is How to Train Your Dragon? How to Train Your Dragon is a series of animated films based on the children's books by Cressida Cowell. The story revolves around the Viking village of Berk and a young Viking named Hiccup, who befriends a dragon named Toothless. It is essential to note that How to Train Your Dragon is a work of fiction and fantasy, and it contains many fantastical elements, such as dragons and fictionalized Norse cultures. While there may be some aspects inspired by historical Viking culture, the series should not be considered historically accurate. Its primary purpose is to entertain with a focus on storytelling, character development, and creative world-building. Are these two questions asking the same thing? Both questions are inquiring about the historical accuracy of the respective media productions, with the first focused on the Netflix drama Marco Polo and the second on the animated film series How to Train Your Dragon. While the context of the two questions is similar - assessing the accuracy of their historical depictions - they are ultimately asking about the accuracy of two different stories, time periods, and genres."},{"question":"Q: I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: when does season 9 of bleach begin Suggested answer: The series is based on Tite Kubo 's manga with same name.

Apply the paste with a clean, wet rag. Scrub the baking soda off.\\"","response":"Title: The Benefits of Using Baking Soda and Water for Cleaning Introduction Baking soda - a common household item that many people have sitting in their pantry. But did you know that this inexpensive, non-toxic product can be used for more than just cooking and baking? The versatility of baking soda truly shines when it comes to cleaning. In this article, we will explore how a simple paste made from baking soda and water can effectively clean various surfaces, while also being eco-friendly. Step 1: Making the Baking Soda Paste To begin, you will need to make a paste by mixing baking soda with water. Start off by finding an appropriate container to mix the ingredients, such as a small bowl or measuring cup. For an average cleaning task, we suggest using 2 tablespoons of baking soda and 1 tablespoon of water. However, feel free to adjust the ratio based on the specific cleaning requirements and the consistency desired. Mix the baking soda and water until they form a homogenous, toothpaste-like consistency. Step 2: Applying the Baking Soda Paste Once your paste is ready, grab a clean, wet rag to apply it onto the surface you want to clean. Ensure that the rag is damp, not soaking wet, as too much excess water can dilute the paste and reduce its effectiveness. Apply the paste in a circular motion, ensuring that it covers the entire area and any stains or grime present. Step 3: Scrubbing the Baking Soda Paste After applying the paste, it's time to scrub it off. Make sure to use the same clean, wet rag for this process. Rub the surface gently in a circular motion to avoid any possible scratches. The abrasive nature of the baking soda paste will help to lift dirt, grease, and other residues that may have been stubborn to clean. For tougher stains or grime, consider adding a bit more baking soda to the paste for added abrasiveness or allowing the paste to sit on the surface for a few minutes before scrubbing. Step 4: Rinsing the Surface Once you are satisfied with the scrubbing, it's time to rinse the surface. Use a clean, wet cloth or sponge to remove the baking soda paste residue, then dry the surface thoroughly with a clean towel. To ensure the best results, always rinse and dry the surface completely, as any residue left behind can leave a white film or streaks. Conclusion In conclusion, not only is baking soda an inexpensive and eco-friendly option for cleaning, but the simple, easy-to-make paste of baking soda and water is also effective in tackling various cleaning jobs around the house. By following these guidelines and understanding the process step-by-step, you can enjoy a natural, chemical-free clean that benefits both you and the environment. So, go ahead and give the humble baking soda paste a try next time you need to tackle a cleaning task!"},{"question":"1. Until recently , Nimar was known as Khandwa . 2.

The name of specific alkanes always ends in - ane . The first part of the name indicates how many carbon atoms each molecule of the alkane has. The smallest alkane is methane. It has just one carbon atom. The next largest is ethane, with two carbon atoms. The chemical formulas and properties of methane, ethane, and several other alkanes are listed in Table below . The boiling and melting points of alkanes are determined mainly by the number of carbon atoms they have. Alkanes with more carbon atoms generally have higher boiling and melting points. Paragraph: Two brothers studied chemistry in school. Ted studied alkanes, while Ned studied cycloalkanes. They both received grade A. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which brother learned more about methane? Answer:","response":"Given the information in the paragraph, the brother who learned more about methane would be Ted. This is because Ted studied alkanes, and methane is a type of alkane. Alkanes, including methane, are saturated hydrocarbons with a general formula of CnH2n+2 and are characterized by the presence of single bonds between carbon and hydrogen atoms. Methane is the simplest and smallest alkane with just one carbon atom, and its chemical formula is CH4. On the other hand, Ned studied cycloalkanes, which are also saturated hydrocarbons but have a different structure. Cycloalkanes contain a closed ring of carbon atoms with single bonds and have a general formula of CnH2n. While they are related to alkanes, cycloalkanes such as cyclohexane and cyclopentane have distinct chemical properties due to their ring formation. In conclusion, Ted would have learned more about methane, as it is an alkane, which was the focus of his studies. Ned studied cycloalkanes, which, while related to alkanes, have different structural and chemical properties than methane and other straight-chain alkanes."},{"question":"The dirtbikes cost 3 * 150 = 450.

Moreover, I will use appropriate, clear language that enables readers to understand the issues I faced. Step 5: Write the negative review Here's the negative review based on my steps: Title: Disappointing Experience at [Place] I recently visited [Place] after hearing mixed reviews, and unfortunately, my experience was far from positive. There were a few key issues that negatively impacted my time there, including poor service, low quality, and an unclean environment. The service at [Place] was notably slow and unprofessional. It took an excessive amount of time to be seated, despite the restaurant being half-empty, and our server seemed uninterested in providing good service. For instance, we had to ask multiple times for refills on our drinks and repeatedly remind them of our orders. In terms of quality, the food was bland and unappealing. I ordered [specific dish], expecting a flavorful meal, but it was incredibly disappointing. The ingredients tasted old and lacked freshness, and the presentation was uninspiring. Cleanliness was another major concern during my visit. The restrooms were dirty, with water on the floor and an unpleasant odor. Additionally, the dining area itself appeared unclean, with stained tablecloths and leftover food on the floor. In conclusion, my experience at [Place] was overwhelmingly negative due to the poor service, low-quality food, and unclean environment. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to others and would suggest that they take the necessary steps to improve their overall customer experience."},{"question":"Teacher:You are given a sentence in Polish.

Context: My fraternal twins were born 2 months early. The staff had already stopped premature labor at six months gestation but it proceeded too quickly this time. Total labor 2.5 hours. Needless to say, they were tiny - female 2 lbs. 3 oz, male 3 lbs. 10 oz. Female was born dark blue - luckily, I was at the finest maternity hospital in this half of the State (McGee Women’s). They brought the female around to breathing, while I cried, thinking that she was dead. The twins were rushed to the NICU, too tiny to breast feed except with pumped milk through a feeding tube. Both were watched closely by doctors and nurses as they were not passing waste properly. The day it was decided that the male needed surgery, the female was discharged to home. The male was transferred to another very good hospital for surgery for a temporary colostomy. He was discharged to home after a week. What broke my heart was that I was allowed to visit him in the hospital but his older brother and twin sister were not allowed. Prior to his discharge, the staff instructed me in changing and maintaining his colostomy bag on a daily basis. He kept the colostomy bag until he was about 5 months old; back into the hospital for the colostomy reversal. The sign that I hung above their shared playpen said “Whatever doesn’t kill me, makes me stronger”. How did I cope with it? Mostly alone. The hospital offered group sessions for parents of severely premature infants. During the very first session, I had a zen realization that, once I realized that the circumstances were out of my control, I GAINED control of myself and my life. A bit like the Serenity Prayer. I shared that epiphany with the group and they looked at me like I had two heads. I had never heard of the Serenity Prayer and I’d been an atheist since age 13, so religion was not my go-to then, nor is it now. That realization helped. The twins are 37 now. Question: Why did the babies have to go to the NICU? Options: - because the labor was too long - not enough information - because they were in a small town - because they were born 2 months early The answer is:","response":"because they were born 2 months early"},{"question":"Answer based on context: Hoping to rebound from their divisional home loss to the Patriots, the Jets flew to Qualcomm Stadium for a Week 3 MNF duel with the San Diego Chargers. In the first quarter, New York took flight as CB David Barrett returned an interception 25 yards for a touchdown.

Article: Most people think that the capital of the movie world is Hollyhood, in the United States. However, the real movie capital is Mumbai, in India. Mumbai used to be known as Bombay, and so the film industry there is called \\"Bollywood.\\" Bollywood makes twice as many movies each year as Hollyhood--more than 800 films a year. The movies from Bollywood are very different from Hollywood movies. For one thing, Bollywood movies are much longer than most Hollywood movies. Most Bollywood movies are more than three hours long, and contain singing, dancing, action, adventure, mystery, and romance (but usually no kissing). Because Bollywood films contain so many different features, this style of film is sometimes called a \\"masala\\" film. (\\"Masala\\" is an Indian word for a mixture of spices.) Another big difference between Bollywood and Hollywood movies is the way movies are made. It takes much longer to make a movie in Hollywood than in Bollywood. In fact, filming may begin on a Bollywood movie before the script even finished. The director and writers can make up the story while the film is being made. Sometimes they will even write the script by hand instead of taking time to type it. Bollywood actors are very popular and some are in such high demand that they may work on several movies at the same time. They may even shoot scenes for several films on the same day using the same costumes and scenery. Since most Bollywood movies follow the same kind of story, shooting scenes for several films at the same time is not a big problem for actors or directors. This also helps keep the cost of Bollywood movies lower than the cost of Hollywood movies. The average Bollywood film, with a budget of only two million U.S. dollars, seems very cheap compared to the average budget of sixty million U.S. dollars for a Hollywood film--thirty times as much! Question: What is NOT true about Mumbai? Answer: Answer:","response":"It is NOT true that Mumbai is known as Hollyhood. Mumbai, formerly known as Bombay, is the home of the Indian film industry known as Bollywood. Hollyhood, actually Hollywood, is located in the United States and is the center of the American film industry."},{"question":"Choose your answer: is the following review positive or negative?

In January 2008 the European Commission sent France a final warning alerting it that it will be taken to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) for the second time and possibly face fines unless it quickly brings its waste water treatment up to EU standards. France is not complying with the 1991 EU directive on urban waste water treatment. The deadline for treating all wastewater covered by the directive was 31 December 2000. In 2004 the European Court of Justice (ECJ) condemned France for failing to designate eleven areas as sensitive and for inadequate treatment facilities in a number of settlements which discharge their waste waters into these areas. The ECJ also found that 121 settlements breached the directive by discharging their waste waters into previously designated sensitive areas. In 2006 France designated the eleven areas as sensitive. However, 140 settlements -- including the city of Paris -- continue to discharge into these sensitive areas. With regard to the 121 settlements discharging into the previously designated sensitive areas France proceeded to rearrange them into 164 settlements, resulting in some settlements no longer meeting the threshold level of 10,000 residents at which the directive applies. The Commission considers such rearranging of settlements to avoid compliance with the directive unacceptable. In November 2009 it referred the matter to the ECJ.

France has faced warnings and potential legal action from the European Commission for not complying with the 1991 EU directive on urban waste water treatment, which aimed to have all wastewater covered by the directive treated by 31 December 2000. In 2004, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) condemned France for failing to designate eleven areas as sensitive and for inadequate treatment facilities in numerous settlements discharging waste waters into these areas. The ECJ also found 121 settlements to be in breach of the directive, as they were discharging their waste waters into previously designated sensitive areas. In 2006, France took action to designate the eleven previously undesignated areas as sensitive. However, 140 settlements, including the city of Paris, continued discharging their wastewater into these sensitive areas.

How old is he now? Give me reasons, before answering the question","response":"Let's use the information given to set up an equation and solve the problem step by step. Let x represent John's current age. In 9 years, John's age will be x + 9. 11 years ago, John's age was x - 11. The problem states that 9 years from now, John will be 3 times as old as he was 11 years ago. We can translate this into the following equation: x + 9 = 3(x - 11) Now, we'll solve the equation to find John's current age. Step 1: Expand the equation: x + 9 = 3x - 33 Step 2: Subtract x from both sides: 9 = 2x - 33 Step 3: Add 33 to both sides: 42 = 2x Step 4: Divide both sides by 2: 21 = x So, John's current age is 21 years old."},{"question":"waste water that contain solid and liquid excreta refers to??","response":"Wastewater that contains solid and liquid excreta refers to sewage or blackwater. My task is to provide information about this type of waste. Here are the step-by-step details and justification for each step: Step 1: Understanding sewage Justification: It is essential to understand the composition of sewage before addressing its management and treatment. Sewage, also known as blackwater, consists of human waste, including fecal matter and urine, mixed with used water. It typically originates from toilets situated in homes, offices, industries, and other establishments. Step 2: Identifying the hazards of untreated sewage Justification: Acknowledging the hazards associated with untreated sewage will emphasize the importance of proper sewage management. Untreated sewage can pose serious environmental and health risks, as it contains harmful pathogens and contaminants. This type of waste can lead to water pollution, the spread of disease, and damage to ecosystems when not managed correctly. Step 3: Describing the sewage treatment process Justification: An overview of the sewage treatment process helps users understand how wastewater is treated before being discharged back into the environment. The sewage treatment process typically involves several stages: 1. Preliminary treatment: Large solids and grit are removed from the sewage through screens and sedimentation tanks. 2. Primary treatment: Sewage is allowed to settle in large tanks, during which heavier solids (sludge) settle to the bottom and lighter materials (scum) float to the top. The sludge and scum are then removed and further processed. 3. Secondary treatment: Biological processes are used to break down organic matter in the wastewater. Common methods include the use of activated sludge, trickling filters, or biofilm reactors. 4. Tertiary treatment (optional): Advanced treatment methods, such as filtration and disinfection, may be used to remove remaining impurities before the treated wastewater is discharged back into the environment. By treating sewage through these methods, the negative environmental and health impacts associated with untreated waste can be minimized."},{"question":"Read the article and select the best answer. Article: The 30-mile road that runs through the mountains of Willie Valley makes most drivers' hands sweat. But Andersen, a 46-year-old father of four, wasn't expecting any trouble on the road last New Year's Eve, when he set off for a ski trip to the Bear Mountains with nine-year-old daughter Mia, four-old son Baylor, and nine-year-old neighbor Kenya. Andersen had driven through the Valley hundreds of times over the years. The weather was fine. But the higher they drove, the more slippery the road became. Rounding a sharp U-turn, Andersen saw a heavy truck off the road and immediately hit his brakes. In a minute, the car was going at 25 miles per hour down the mountain before falling down from a ten-foot dam into the extremely cold Logan River. The crash had broken a few windows, and within seconds, the car was filled with water. \\"It was frightening that we were going fast into deep water,\\" remembers Andersen, a soft-spoken manager. Having lost all sense of direction, Andersen began to search the freezing water for the kids. Mia had been right next to him in the front seat; now, in the blackness, he couldn't find her. \\"I thought, if I don't get out, maybe none of us are going to get out.\\" Andersen got out of his seat belt, swam through a broken window, and, deeply and quickly, breathed air at the surface. That's when he saw a group of men, about ten in all, appear at the top of the dam. One after another, they rushed down into the water. Helping onto safety all the three children, they began to shout at the father, \\"Who else is in the car?\\" Andersen says respectfully, \\" _ .\\" Question: What might be the main cause of the car accident? Options: A: The bad weather. B: The high dam. C: The sudden brake. D: The heavy truck. A:","response":"The main cause of the car accident appears to be C: The sudden brake. As stated in the article, Andersen saw a heavy truck off the road and immediately hit his brakes, causing the car to go 25 miles per hour down the mountain before falling into the Logan River from a ten-foot dam. While factors like the slippery road, sharp U-turn, and the presence of the heavy truck may have contributed to the accident, it was Andersen's sudden braking that ultimately led to the event."},{"question":"Fixed assets, also known as tangible assets or property, plant and equipment (PP&E), is a term used in accounting for assets and property that cannot easily be converted into cash. This can be compared with current assets such as cash or bank accounts, which are described as liquid assets. In most cases, only tangible assets are referred to as fixed. IAS 16 (International Accounting Standard) defines Fixed Assets as assets whose future economic benefit is probable to flow into the entity, whose cost can be measured reliably. Fixed assets belong to one of 2 types: \`\`Freehold Assets'' -- assets which are purchased with legal right of ownership and used, and \`\`Leasehold Assets'' -- assets used by owner without legal right for a particular period of time. is non current assets the same as fixed assets? I. no; II. yes;","response":"II. yes; Non-current assets and fixed assets are the same in the context of accounting. Non-current assets are long-term assets that a company holds and expects to use for more than one accounting period, typically longer than a year. Fixed assets, such as property, plant, and equipment (PP&E), are tangible assets with a useful life longer than one year. Both terms refer to assets that cannot be easily converted into cash and are expected to generate economic benefits for the company over a long period of time. So, non-current assets and fixed assets are essentially the same, with the key difference being that fixed assets specifically refer to tangible assets. Non-current assets may include both tangible and intangible assets."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Given the following passage \\"In April 2009, the United States Supreme Court agreed to hear a suit over reverse discrimination brought by 18 white firefighters against the city.

After the tests were scored, no black firefighters scored high enough to qualify for consideration for promotion, so the city announced that no one would be promoted. In the subsequent Ricci v.

We need to find the value of 'd' in the equation -12 = -3*d - 0. So, first, let's get rid of the - 0 part, because adding or subtracting 0 doesn't change anything. Now, we have -12 = -3*d. Our goal is to find out what number 'd' is. To do that, we need to make 'd' all by itself on one side of the equal sign. Right now, it's being multiplied by -3. Here's a little trick: if we divide both sides of the equation by -3, it will help us separate 'd' and find its value! So, -12 divided by -3 is 4 because when you divide two negative numbers, you get a positive number. And -3*d divided by -3 is just 'd' because the -3's cancel each other out. Now we have our answer: d = 4. And that's it! We solved the math problem and found out the value of 'd' is 4."},{"question":"How is \\"Someone get us down!\\" said in Czech?","response":"To complete the task, I followed the following steps: 1.

Warner Bros made the much-awaited announcement, putting to rest previous speculations. Eddie Redmayne, best known for his transformative performance as Stephen Hawking in 'The Theory of Everything,' and more recently as Lili Elbe in 'The Danish Girl,' has proven his versatile acting skills time and again. The announcement of him joining the Wizarding World universe is being met with excitement and anticipation from fans and critics alike. 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them' is based on J.K. Rowling's 2001 book of the same name. The story is set in a magical universe, some seventy years before Harry Potter's time, and follows the adventures of Newt Scamander, a magizoologist who has a penchant for discovering magical creatures. Redmayne will bring to life the character of Newt Scamander, adding another intriguing role to his already impressive filmography. Although set in the same universe, 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them' is not a prequel or sequel to the Harry Potter series. J.K. Rowling, in a rare foray into screenwriting, has penned the script for the film, her first-ever screenplay, which is expected to explore previously unseen aspects of the magical world. Directed by David Yates, who helmed the last four Harry Potter films, 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them' is anticipated to be a visually captivating and magical cinematic experience. The film also boasts a stellar supporting cast, including Katherine Waterston, Ezra Miller, Dan Fogler, Alison Sudol, and Colin Farrell, among others. With such a talented ensemble, the film is sure to deliver first-rate performances as it transports viewers into a world of enchanting creatures and extraordinary adventures. The confirmation of Eddie Redmayne as the lead actor comes as a major boost for the film, which is already generating considerable buzz among Harry Potter fans and the film industry. Redmayne's exceptional acting abilities and dedication to his craft ensure that the character of Newt Scamander is in good hands. This casting decision seems to be an indication of the film's commitment to delivering an enthralling and top-notch cinematic experience that is worthy of the Harry Potter legacy. 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them' also marks a significant development for Warner Bros, who are eager to reunite with the lucrative Harry Potter franchise. The spin-off film is expected to reignite the magic of the Wizarding World, as it introduces an entirely new chapter set in mystical realms that fans have grown to love and admire. 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them' is slated for a worldwide release on November 18th, 2016. As the release date draws closer, the excitement surrounding the film has been building exponentially. If the reaction to this casting news is any indication, it's safe to say that 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them' is well on its way to becoming a spectacular phenomenon in its own right, carrying on the legacy of the beloved Harry Potter series."},{"question":"Which entity is this text about? The Clark Sisters are an American gospel vocal group consisting of five sisters: Jacky Clark Chisholm (b. 1948), Denise Clark Bradford (b. 1953), Elbernita \\"Twinkie\\" Clark-Terrell (b. 1954), Dorinda Clark-Cole (b. 1957), and Karen Clark Sheard (b. 1960). The Clark Sisters are the daughters of gospel musician and choral director Mattie Moss Clark. They are credited for helping to bring gospel music to the mainstream and are considered as pioneers of contemporary gospel. The Clark Sisters were born and raised in Detroit, Michigan. They each began singing at an early age, and by the late 1960s they were all performing together in church services, usually singing songs written and arranged by their mother. A few years later, Dr. Mattie Moss Clark turned over control of the group to Twinkie, who would then go on to write, arrange, conduct, and produce all of the Clark Sisters' recordings. In 1973, the sisters recorded their first album, Jesus Has A Lot To Give, on their uncle's local label Billesse Records. The following year, Dr. Mattie Moss Clark Presents The Clark Sisters was released and people around Detroit began to take notice of the group. The Clark Sisters signed to Sound of Gospel Records in 1974. Under this association, the group released albums such as Unworthy, Count It All Joy, and He Gave Me Nothing to Lose. It was not until the early 1980s that The Clark Sisters began to become more widely known. Their popularity soared with the release of the live recording Is My Living In Vain. The first live recording by The Clark Sisters spent an entire year at number one on Billboard's Gospel Music chart. Opening with the bluesy title track, each sister vocally declares that their dedication to Christ is not a useless effort. The innovative \\"Hi ya\\" was funky enough to find its way into a Tonex produced track over two decades later. Karen Clark's lead on \\"Speak Lord\\" expresses deep faith while the call to worship is raised on \\"Now Is The Time\\". Another hit from this release, \\"Expect Your Miracle\\", is still a staple in black churches across the country. Their next release You Brought the Sunshine would prove to be a monster hit via the title track. Reminiscent of Stevie Wonder's \\"Master Blaster (Jammin'),\\" the song became a hit in church houses and on dance floors, including New York's Studio 54. \\"Sunshine\\" was picked up from its original independent gospel record label Sounds of Gospel and distributed by both Westbound Records and Elektra Records. In 1983, the song peaked at #16 on the Black Singles chart, #27 on the Club Play Charts, and #80 on the Hot R&B Charts driving the album to Gold sales. This album continues to display Twinkie's signature blend of scripture with unprecedented vocal and musical arrangements on biblically based songs like \\"Psalms 31.\\" The album's other songs include the sincere prayer found within the lyrics of both \\"Center of Thy Will\\" and \\"Endow Me,\\" featuring a young but already vocally mature Karen, as well as \\"Overdose of the Holy Ghost\\", showcasing Dorinda's vocal dexterity. The disco-inspired \\"He Keeps Me Company\\" is noted for its bubbly syncopation. The sisters delivered another progressive effort in 1982, Sincerely, which included \\"Name It And Claim It\\" and the politically charged \\"World.\\" Though its success was overshadowed by the previous hit \\"You Brought The Sunshine\\", the album received a Grammy nomination.","response":"This text is about the Clark Sisters, an American gospel vocal group consisting of five sisters: Jacky Clark Chisholm, Denise Clark Bradford, Elbernita \\"Twinkie\\" Clark-Terrell, Dorinda Clark-Cole, and Karen Clark Sheard."},{"question":"heyyy im at da COMPUTER ROOOM heyyy lmfao FOLLOW ME HAHAHAHAH!!! huh SAYRA LMFAo + What is the sentiment of this tweet?","response":"To analyze the sentiment of this tweet, we can break it down into its individual components and examine the emotions and intentions behind it.

Aquaman is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Created by Paul Norris and Mort Weisinger, the character debuted in More Fun Comics #73 (November 1941). Initially a backup feature in DC's anthology titles, Aquaman later starred in several volumes of a solo comic book series. Aquaman's adventures continued to be published in Adventure Comics through the 1940s and 1950s, as one of the few superheroes to last through the 1950s in continuous publication. Starting in the late 1950s, new elements to Aquaman's backstory were introduced, with various new supporting characters added and several adjustments made to the character, his origins, his powers, and persona. The first of these elements was the story \\"Aquaman's Undersea Partner\\" in Adventure Comics #229 (October 1956), where his octopus sidekick, Topo, was first introduced. This and subsequent elements were later, after the establishment of DC's multiverse in the 1960s, attributed to the Aquaman of Earth-One. In Adventure Comics #260 (May 1959) and subsequent Silver Age comics, it was revealed that Aquaman was Arthur Curry, the son of Tom Curry, a lighthouse keeper, and Atlanna, a water-breathing outcast from the lost, underwater city of Atlantis. Due to his heritage, Aquaman discovers as a youth that he possesses various superhuman abilities, including the powers of surviving underwater, communication with sea life, and tremendous swimming prowess. Eventually, Arthur decided to use his talents to become the defender of the Earth's oceans. It was later revealed that he had, in his youth, adventured as Aquaboy and on one occasion, met Superboy, Earth's only other publicly active superpowered hero at the time. When Arthur grew up, he called himself \\"Aquaman\\". It was later revealed that after Atlanna's death, Tom Curry met and married an ordinary human woman and had a son named Orm Curry, Aquaman's half-brother. Orm grew up as a troubled youth in the shadow of his brother, who constantly bailed him out of trouble with the law. He grew to hate Aquaman not only for the powers that he could never possess but also because he believed that their father would always favor Aquaman. Orm disappeared after becoming an amnesiac and would resurface years later as Aquaman's nemesis, Ocean Master. Aquaman's ability to talk with fish eventually expanded to full-fledged telepathic communication with sea creatures even from great distances. He also retroactively developed a specific weakness akin to Superman's vulnerability to kryptonite or Green Lantern's vulnerability to the color yellow: Aquaman had to come into contact with water at least once per hour, or he would die. Prior to this story, Aquaman could exist both in and out of water indefinitely. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: what other powers did he have?","response":"Apart from surviving underwater and communication with sea life, Aquaman also possessed tremendous swimming prowess as part of his superhuman abilities."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Information: - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän. - Denmark is a Scandinavian country in Europe. The southernmost and smallest of the Nordic countries, it is south-west of Sweden and south of Norway, and bordered to the south by Germany.

Some clubs and resorts do have caddy programs, although benefits are rarely offered. Particularly in Europe, the vast majority of clubs do not offer caddies, and amateur players will commonly carry or pull their own bags. - Fanny Sunesson born in Karlshamn , Sweden is a retired professional golf caddy , who is most noted as being the caddy for Nick Faldo from 1990 to 1999 . - A golf course is the grounds where the game of golf is played.

This same sort of simple informational advertising is still used.Examples are the roadside signs that tell travelers that they can buy fresh corn just down the road or that there is a restaurant in the next town. The Industrial Revolution,in the 18th and 19th centuries,brought a new kind of advertising.Large factories took the place of small workshops and goods were produced in large quantities. Manufacturers used the newly built railroads to distribute their products over wide areas.They had to find many thousands of customers in order to stay in business.They couldn't simply tell people where shoes or cloth or tea could be bought---they had to learn how to make people want to buy a specific product.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: The Devil Wears Prada Context: Andrea \\"Andy\\" Sachs (Anne Hathaway), an aspiring journalist fresh out of Northwestern University, lands the magazine job \\"a million girls would kill for\\": junior personal assistant to icy editor-in-chief Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), who dominates the fashion world from her perch atop Runway magazine. She puts up with the eccentric and humiliating requests of her boss because, she is told, if she lasts a year in the position she will get her pick of other jobs, perhaps even the journalistic position she truly craves.At first, she fits in poorly among the gossipy fashionistas who make up the magazine staff. Her lack of style or fashion knowledge and fumbling with her job make her an object of scorn around the office. Senior assistant Emily Charlton (Emily Blunt), Miranda's senior personal assistant, is condescending to her. Gradually, though, with the help of art director Nigel (Stanley Tucci), Andrea adjusts to the position and its many perks, including free designer clothing and other choice accessories. She begins to dress more stylishly and do her job competently, fulfilling a seemingly impossible request of Miranda's to get two copies of an unpublished Harry Potter manuscript to her daughters.She also comes to prize chance encounters with attractive young writer Christian Thompson (Simon Baker), who helped her obtain the Potter manuscript and suggests he could help her with her career. At the same time, however, her relationship with her boyfriend Nate (Adrian Grenier), a chef working his way up the career ladder, and other college friends suffers due to the increasing time she spends at Miranda's beck and call.Shortly afterwards, Andrea saves Miranda from social embarrassment at a charity benefit when the cold-stricken Emily falters in reminding Miranda who an approaching guest is. As a result, Miranda tells Andrea that she will accompany her to the fall fashion shows in Paris, rather than Emily who had been looking forward to the trip for months, but is currently suffering from the flu. Miranda warns... Answer:","response":"Based on the provided context from the movie \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\", it's clear that early on Andrea \\"Andy\\" Sachs had a rocky start in her role as junior personal assistant to Miranda Priestly. Her lack of fashion knowledge and early struggles to adapt to her role made her an object of ridicule and scorn within the fashion-forward Runway magazine office. Her work quality at the beginning was clearly not satisfactory, and this likely made Miranda not-too-pleased with her performance. However, as Andy began to adapt to her role with assistance from Art Director Nigel, dressing more stylishly and utilizing the perks of her position, it indicated a significant improvement in her work. Notably, she navigated her way through a seemingly impossible task for Miranda, obtaining two copies of an unpublished Harry Potter manuscript. This was a significant accomplishment that would undoubtedly contribute positively to impressions of her work quality. Moreover, Andy saved Miranda from a potential social embarrassment at a charity benefit, demonstrating her a growing ability to effectively anticipate and respond to unexpected predicaments - a crucial trait for a personal assistant. This valuable assistance was pivotal to the point where Miranda chose Andy over Emily, the senior assistant, to accompany her to the fall fashion shows in Paris. This decision was significant, as Emily had anticipated and looked forward to the trip, which indicated a marked shift in Miranda’s recognition and validation of Andy's work. Miranda's decision to take Andy to Paris, along with other signs of her growing trust in Andy, indicates that although she may not have been explicitly “happy” and likely maintained high, demanding standards, she became more satisfied with Andy's work quality as compared to her initial performance. It's safe to infer that Miranda began to regard Andy as more competent, reliable, and useful - a clear improvement from her early days at Runway magazine. In conclusion, Miranda's sentiments towards Andy's work quality evolved from initial dissatisfaction to a more positive recognition of her abilities towards the later part of the context provided from the movie. Although not stated outright, it is reasonably interpretable that Miranda became more content with Andy's work output, given her enhanced responsibilities and growing trust in Andy's capabilities."},{"question":"Can we conclude from \\"A group of people eat a meal in a crowded outdoor location.\\" that \\"A group of people are surfing.\\"?

Militants failed to mount a single major attack anywhere in Afghanistan by the time polls closed, and voters lined up despite heavy rain and cold in the capital and elsewhere. “Whenever there has been a new king or president, it has been accompanied by death and violence,” said Abdul Wakil Amiri, a government official who turned out early to vote at a Kabul mosque. “For the first time, we are experiencing democracy.” After 12 years with President Hamid Karzai in power, and decades of upheaval, coup and war, Afghans on Saturday were for the first time voting on a relatively open field of candidates. Election officials said that by midday more than three and a half million voters had turned out — already approaching the total for the 2009 vote. The election commission chairman, Mohammad Yusuf Nuristani, said the total could reach seven million. “The enemies of Afghanistan have been defeated,” he declared. Photo But even as they celebrated the outpouring of votes, many acknowledged the long process looming ahead, with the potential for problems all along the way. International observers, many of whom had fled Afghanistan after a wave of attacks on foreigners during the campaign, cautioned that how those votes were tallied and reported would bear close watching. It is likely to take at least a week before even incomplete official results are announced, and weeks more to adjudicate Election Day complaints. Some of the candidates were already filing fraud complaints on Saturday. With eight candidates in the race, the five minor candidates’ shares of the vote made it even more difficult for any one candidate to reach the 50 percent threshold that would allow an outright victory. A runoff vote is unlikely to take place until the end of May at the earliest. Photo The leading candidates going into the vote were Ashraf Ghani, 64, a technocrat and former official in Mr. Karzai’s government; Abdullah Abdullah, 53, a former foreign minister who was the second biggest vote-getter against Mr. Karzai in the 2009 election; and Zalmay Rassoul, 70, another former foreign minister. Both Mr. Ghani and Mr. Abdullah praised the vote. “A proud day for a proud nation,” Mr. Ghani said. Still, a shortage of ballots at polling places was widespread across the country by midday Saturday, and some voters were in line when polls closed. More worrisome, the threat of violence in many rural areas had forced election authorities to close nearly 1,000 out of a planned-for 7,500 polling places, raising fears that a big chunk of the electorate would remain disenfranchised. Photo But when it came to attacks on Election Day, the Taliban’s threats seemed to be greatly overstated. Only one suicide bombing attempt could be confirmed — in Khost — and the bomber managed to kill only himself when the police stopped him outside a polling place. In three scattered attacks on polling places, four voters were reported killed. Two rockets fired randomly into the city of Jalalabad wounded eight civilians. One border policeman, in southern Kandahar Province, and another policeman in remote western Farah Province were confirmed killed in Taliban attacks, according to preliminary reports. Bad as all that was, it was a lower casualty toll than on a normal day in Afghanistan, let alone an election on which both the insurgents and the government had staked their credibility. Interior Minister Umar Daudzai said there were 140 attacks nationwide on Saturday, compared with 500 attacks recorded by the American military in 2009. In preparation for the election, the Afghan government mobilized its entire military and police forces, some 350,000 in all, backed up by 53,000 NATO coalition troops — although the Americans and their allies stayed out of it, leaving Afghans for the first time entirely in charge of securing their own election. Continue reading the main story Slide Show “Voting on this day will be a slap in the faces of the terrorists,” said Rahmatullah Nabil, the acting head of the National Directorate of Security, the Afghan domestic intelligence agency. Sensitive to concerns about potential fraud — more than a million ballots were thrown out in the 2009 presidential vote and then again in the 2010 parliamentary elections — the police were quick to report their efforts to crack down on Saturday. Among those arrested were four people in Khost who were caught with 1,067 voter registration cards. Several people, including an election official, were caught trying to stuff ballot boxes in Wardak Province. “This has been the best and most incident-free election in Afghanistan’s modern history and it could set the precedent for a historic, peaceful transition of power in Afghanistan,” said Mohammad Fahim Sadeq, head of the Afghanistan National Participation Organization, an observer group. Continue reading the main story Video Play Video In many places where voting was nearly impossible in 2009, the turnout was reported to be strong. One was Panjwai district, a once-violent haven of the Taliban just outside Kandahar City, where hundreds lined up to vote. “I left everything behind, my fears and my work, and came to use my vote,” said Hajji Mahbob, 60, a farmer. “I want change and a good government and I am asking the man I am going to elect as the next president to bring an end to the suffering of this war.” Even where the Taliban did manage to strike, voters still turned out afterward. A bomb set off at a polling place in the Mohammad Agha district of Logar Province killed two voters and wounded two others, according to the district governor, Abdul Hamid. “The explosion dispersed the voters who were holding their voting cards and waiting to vote,” said Zalmai Stanakzai, a car repair shop owner who was there. “Some of us left, the others stayed. I was concerned about our safety, but we considered voting our duty.” Insurgents set off a series of five blasts in the Shomali plain, just north of Kabul city, in the village of Qarabagh. “After the explosions, the polling stations reopened and people rushed to vote,” said Mohasmmad Sangar, 32, a used-car salesman there. “It was a great day today.” Nicholas Haysom, the United Nations’ top election official here, said: “We know that the Taliban have made a very explicit and express threat to disrupt it. The failure to disrupt the elections will mean that they will have egg on their face after the elections.” While there were reports of disrupted voting in troubled places like Logar Province and neighboring Wardak, in Helmand Province in the south and Nangarhar Province in the east, at the same time voters were showing up in unexpectedly high numbers in other places, like Zabul, Uruzgan and Kandahar Provinces in the south, and Kunar Province in the northeast, despite strong insurgent presences in those areas. In Uruzgan, election authorities had to open additional polling places to accommodate unexpected numbers, while in Daikundi they ran out of ballots in some remote districts and election authorities had to race new ones out to them. In northern Mazar-i-Sharif, voters were still lined up after dark. Continue reading the main story Advertisement Underwritten by 100 million from the United Nations and foreign donors, the election was a huge enterprise, stretching across extremely forbidding terrain. Some 3,200 donkeys were pressed into service to deliver ballots to remote mountain villages, along with battalions of trucks and minibuses to 6,500 polling places in all. The American military pitched in with air transport of ballots to four regional distribution centers, and to two difficult-to-reach provinces. Though many international observers left Afghanistan in the wake of attacks on foreigners, or found themselves confined to quarters in Kabul, years of expensive preparations and training of an army of some 70,000 Afghan election observers were expected to compensate, according to Western diplomats and Afghan election officials. “We have so many controls now, it’s going to be much safer this time,” said Noor Ahmad Noor, the spokesman for the Independent Election Commission. The American ambassador, James B. Cunningham, called the elections a “really historic opportunity for the people of Afghanistan to move forward with something we’ve been trying to create together with them for several years now.” Still up in the air is the question of whether an American troop force will remain in Afghanistan after 2014. Mr. Karzai’s refusal to sign a long-term security deal to allow that presence was a major point of tension between the American and Afghan governments. Each of the leading candidates has agreed to sign the deal once in office, though inauguration day may not take place until well into the year. The election on Saturday was notable also for how many Afghan women were taking part. More female candidates than ever before are on provincial ballots, and two are running for vice president, the first time a woman was ever put up for national office here, which has generated a great deal of enthusiasm, especially in urban areas. At the women’s polling station in the Nadaria High School, in Kabul’s Qala-e-Fatullah neighborhood, among those lining up to vote was a young mother, Parwash Naseri, 21. Although wearing the blue burqa that is traditional here, she was still willing to speak out through the privacy mesh covering her face. She was voting, for the first time, for her children and for women’s rights, she said, speaking in a whisper. “I believe in the right of women to take part just as men do, to get themselves educated and to work.” ||||| KABUL/KANDAHAR, Afghanistan (Reuters) - Afghanistan's presidential election closed on Saturday amid relief that attacks by Taliban fighters were fewer than feared for a vote that will bring the first-ever democratic transfer of power in a country plagued by conflict for decades. It will take six weeks for results to come in from across Afghanistan's rugged terrain and a final result to be declared in the race to succeed President Hamid Karzai. This could be the beginning of a potentially dangerous period for Afghanistan at a time when the war-ravaged country desperately needs a leader to stem rising violence as foreign troops prepare to leave. \\"Today we proved to the world that this is a people driven country,\\" Karzai, wearing his trademark green robe and a lambskin hat, told his nation in televised remarks. \\"On behalf of the people, I thank the security forces, election commission and people who exercised democracy and ... turned another page in the glorious history of Afghanistan.\\" One of the eight candidates will have to score over 50 percent of the vote to avoid a run-off with his nearest rival. The Taliban threat to wreck the vote through bombings and assassination failed to materialize, and violent incidents were on a far smaller scale than feared. Turnout was seven million out of 12 million eligible voters, or about 58 percent, according to preliminary estimates, election commission chief Ahmad Yousuf Nuristani told reporters. That was well above the 4.5 million who voted at the last election in 2009 which was marred by widespread fraud. \\"I am here to vote and I am not afraid of any attacks,\\" said Haji Ramazan as he stood in line at a polling station in rain-drenched Kabul. \\"This is my right, and no one can stop me.\\" In Washington, President Barack Obama congratulated the Afghan people on the elections. \\"We commend the Afghan people, security forces, and elections officials on the turnout for today's vote - which is in keeping with the spirited and positive debate among candidates and their supporters in the run-up to the election,\\" Obama said in a statement. \\"These elections are critical to securing Afghanistan's democratic future, as well as continued international support, and we look to the Afghan electoral bodies to carry out their duties in the coming weeks to adjudicate the results - knowing that the most critical voices on the outcome are those of Afghans themselves,\\" Obama said. The United States could point to the advance of democracy in one of the world's most violent countries as a success as it prepares to withdraw the bulk of its troops this year. It has spent 90 billion on aid and security training since helping Afghan forces to topple a strict Islamist Taliban regime in 2001, but U.S. support for Afghanistan's fight against the Taliban has faded. As U.S. troops get ready to go home, the Taliban threat and uncertainty over neighbor Pakistan's intentions leave the worry that Afghanistan could enter a fresh cycle of violence, and once again become a haven for groups like al Qaeda. The United States has been at odds with Karzai who has refused U.S. entreaties to sign a bilateral security agreement that would permit about 8,000 U.S. troops to remain in the country after the formal U.S. withdrawal at the end of the year. U.S. officials are keeping open the option of leaving behind a troop contingent for training Afghan forces and for a counter-terrorism mission if an agreement can be signed later this year by Karzai's successor. \\"The United States remains ready to work with the next president of Afghanistan. We will continue to stand with the people of Afghanistan as they work to build a democratic future,\\" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said in a statement. During Saturday's election, there were dozens of reports of minor roadside bombs, attacks on polling stations, police and voters. In the eastern province of Kunar alone, two voters died and 14 were wounded, while 14 Taliban militants were killed. Interior Minister Umer Daudzai said nine policemen, seven soldiers, 89 Taliban fighters were killed in the past 24 hours across the country, adding that four civilians were also killed. Dozens died in a spate of attacks in the preceding weeks. A veteran Associated Press photographer was killed and a senior correspondent of the same news agency was wounded on Friday when a policeman opened fire on the two women in the east as they reported on preparations for the poll. KABUL SEALED OFF Most people had expected the election to be better run than the chaotic 2009 vote that handed Karzai a second term. The constitution barred Karzai from seeking another term. But, after 12 years in power, he is widely expected to retain influence through politicians loyal to him. Former foreign ministers Abdullah Abdullah and Zalmay Rassoul, and former finance minister Ashraf Ghani were regarded as the favorites to succeed Karzai. More than 350,000 Afghan troops were deployed, guarding against attacks on polling stations and voters. The capital, Kabul, was sealed off by rings of roadblocks and checkpoints. In the city of Kandahar, cradle of the Taliban insurgency, the mood was tense. Vehicles were not allowed to move on the roads and checkpoints were set up at every intersection. Hamida, a 20-year-old teacher working at a Kandahar polling station, said more than a dozen women turned up in the first two hours of voting and added that she expected more to come despite the threat of an attack by the Taliban. \\"We are trying not to think about it,\\" she said, only her honey-brown eyes visible through her black niqab. Raising questions about the legitimacy of the vote even before it began, the election commission announced that at least 10 percent of polling stations were expected to be shut due to security threats, and most foreign observers left Afghanistan in the wake of a deadly attack on a hotel in Kabul last month. In some areas of the country voters complained that polling stations had run out of ballot papers. The interior ministry said six officials - including an intelligence agent - were detained for trying to rig the vote, and elsewhere several people were arrested for trying to use fake voter cards. RISK OF DELAY If there is no outright winner, the two frontrunners would go into a run-off on May 28, spinning out the process into the holy month of Ramadan when life slows to a crawl. A long delay would leave little time to complete a pact between Kabul and Washington to keep up to 10,000 U.S. troops in the country beyond 2014. Karzai has rejected the pact, but the three frontrunners have pledged to sign it. Without the pact, far weaker Afghan forces would be left on their own to fight the Taliban. The election is a landmark after 13 years of struggle that has killed at least 16,000 Afghan civilians and thousands more soldiers. Nearly 3,500 members of the U.S.-led coalition force have died since deployment in the country over a decade ago. Karzai's relations with the United States became increasingly strained as Afghan casualties mounted. He also voiced frustration with Washington over a lack of pressure on Pakistan to do more to stop the Taliban based in the borderlands. Although his departure marks a turning point, none of his would-be successors would bring radical change, diplomats say. \\"Whether the election will be the great transformative event that everybody expects is, I think, delusional.\\" Sarah Chayes, a South Asia expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace told a media briefing on the eve of the vote.

Passage: On 8 June 1856, the next settlement began on Norfolk Island. These were the descendants of Tahitians and the HMS Bounty mutineers, including those of Fletcher Christian. They resettled from the Pitcairn Islands, which had become too small for their growing population. On 3 May 1856, 193 persons left Pitcairn Islands aboard the \\"Morayshire\\". On 8 June 194 persons arrived, a baby having been born in transit. The Pitcairners occupied many of the buildings remaining from the penal settlements, and gradually established traditional farming and whaling industries on the island. Although some families decided to return to Pitcairn in 1858 and 1863, the island's population continued to grow.

Antibiotics do not work against viruses; they are specifically designed to target and eliminate bacterial infections. Since the flu is caused by a virus, receiving an antibiotic shot would not have any direct effect on the viral infection. Therefore: - The flu virus still has receptors on its surface. - These receptors continue to lock onto target cells using their chemical receptors. - The flu virus still enters the target cells. - The flu virus continues to use the cell like a factory. - The virus continues to make thousands or millions of copies of new viruses. - The copies come streaming out of the cell. - The copies continue to infect other cells or escape from the body and infect new victims. As a result, the antibiotic shot has no effect on the flu virus in terms of preventing more cells from being damaged.

Mrs. Kinsolving (Rosemary Murphy) is cold to Francesca, questions whether she is actually pregnant with her son's baby, and tells Francesca she wants nothing to do with her or her baby in the future. It soon becomes clear that Francesca cannot leave that night as a blizzard has made the roads impassable. Francesca is forced to stay in the Kinsolving mansion for a few days. She soon begins to suspect that something is amiss due to inconsistencies in information between what her late husband (Matthew) told her and Mrs. Kinsolving's statements to her. While Matthew never mentioned he had a sister, Mrs. Kinsolving claims that the mentally challenged and non-verbal Kathleen (Sian Barbara Allen) is Matthew's sister. After Mrs. Kinsolving retires for the night, Francesca sneaks around and discovers in the family Bible that Matthew's mother (Maria) died eleven days after Matthew was killed in the Vietnam War, that Mrs. Kinsolving is actually Maria's sister in law, Katherine, who is Kathleen's mother and the mother of Kenny (Richard Thomas), a serial rapist and murderer who is hiding somewhere in the Kinsolving mansion. Francesca goes into labor, but Mrs. Kinsolving refuses to call for an ambulance. She sedates Francesca heavily. When the baby is born, Mrs. Kinsolving announces it is dead and hands the baby over to Kathleen to bury. That night, Kathleen rouses Francesca and takes her to the attic where she finds Kathleen has hidden her baby (who is actually very much alive) in a picnic basket.

However, it should be noted that this hypothesis is specific to the context and situation mentioned in the premise and may not be universally applicable. The premise suggests that the person speaking has experience with older computers, likely suggesting that they have a good understanding of the technology and its potential issues. They mention that line 54 should be examined along with the output, implying that there has been an observation or historical precedent identifying that errors usually occur around that particular line of code. However, it is essential to bear in mind that while examining line 54 and the output simultaneously might aid in identifying a possible issue, it might not be the sole cause or might not cover all potential problems. There can be multiple factors contributing to the problem, some of which may lie outside of line 54 or the output being analyzed. Furthermore, the relevance of this hypothesis may vary depending on the specific computer program or hardware component being discussed. In conclusion, the hypothesis can be considered true within the context and based on the experience of the speaker. However, it should not be assumed as a comprehensive solution to diagnosing issues across all computers and programming environments. A more systematic and holistic approach is necessary when addressing various technical problems. Always consider additional factors, lines of code, and potential hardware malfunctions that may contribute to the issue being experienced."},{"question":"Given the following passage \\"Ideas for affirmative action came as early as the Reconstruction Era (1865-1877) in which a former slave population lacked the skills and resources for sustainable living. In 1865, General William Tecumseh Sherman proposed to divide the land and goods from Georgia and grant it to families of color which became the \\"Forty acres and a mule\\" policy. The proposal was never widely adopted due to strong political opposition. Nearly a century later (1950s-1960s), policies to assist classes of individuals reemerged during the Civil Rights Movement. The civil rights guarantees came through the interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. The decisions came to be known as affirmative action in which mandatory, as well as voluntary programs, affirmed the civil rights of people of color. Furthermore, these affirmative action programs protected people of color from the present effects stemming from past discrimination. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy became the first to utilize the term \\"affirmative action\\" in Executive Order 10925 to ensure that government contractors \\"take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin.\\" This executive order realized the government's intent to create equal opportunities for all qualified people. This executive order was eventually amended and superseded by Lyndon B. Johnson's Executive Order 11246 which prevented discrimination based on race, color, religion, and national origin by organizations which received federal contracts and subcontracts. In 1967, the order was amended to include sex as well. The Reagan administration was opposed to the affirmative action requirements of Executive Order 11246, but these contemplated changes[which?] faced bi-partisan opposition in Congress.\\", answer the following question.

However, there is no mention of how the heat is generated to cause the water to boil. Because heat is not spontaneously generated, the oven must be turned on to generate the heat necessary to boil the water in the tank above it. This act of turning on the oven is a necessary first step in the process. To boil water, we need a source of heat. Without this initial heating, the entire process cannot continue as described - the water wouldn't boil, the steam wouldn't be created, and the pistons wouldn't move.

Now, I suppose the first question everyone would ask is: what exactly is human memory? W: Well, like so many easy questions, the answer isn't very simple. Basically, human memory is a compartment in people's brains where they store images rather like the hard disc drive in a computer. And like a hard disc drive, our memories can become infected or even wiped out by accidents. But the comparison breaks down when we consider that we can train our memories to expand and work better which computers can't manage yet. M: When you talk about memory being infected, do you mean by a disease? W: Yes. For instance, people suffering from a physiological disease like Alzheimer: forget things that happened in the past. And they also forget how to perform simple tasks like tying their shoelaces. The good news is that brain exercises can help keep the brain young. Research has shown that people who have better educations and more mentally active jobs have a lower risk of developing the disease. M: And how can someone exercise his brain? By thinking a lot? W: In a way, yes. But you can also practice using your memory which not only exercises your brain but also improves you ability to remember things. Unfortunately, a lot of devices in modern life are designed to make sure we don't forget things which can make our brains more idle and weaken our memories.

What majors are they looking for? Which would be a better option DTU pct or USIT IT? Choose your answer. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? Choose your answer from: A. no; B. yes;","response":"A. No The two questions asked are not paraphrases of each other as they address entirely different topics. The first question asks about recruitment practices of Chemical Financial. Specifically, it wants to know the universities where this financial institution commonly recruits new graduates from and what majors it is interested in for its recruitment efforts. This type of information would be useful for someone interested in working for Chemical Financial or researching companies that hire specific majors. To answer this, I would have to do some research because the information can change based on the output/targets of Chemical Financial at any given time. Generally, financial institutions like Chemical Financial typically recruit from universities with strong business and finance programs. They might also look for graduates with majors in areas like accounting, economics, and business administration. Also, Chemical Financial could be interested in graduates with IT and computer science backgrounds given the increasing relevance of technology in financial services. The second question appears to be asking which option would be better between DTU PCT (Delhi Technological University - Polymer and Chemical Technology) and USIT IT (University School of Information, Communication and Technology - Information Technology). This decision may depend on the individual's interests, career goals, and the specific strengths of each program. For example, someone might choose DTU PCT if they have a keen interest in the chemical industry and want to combine it with technology. On the other hand, a person who prefers a more generalist approach to IT might opt for USIT IT. Each program may offer different opportunities and benefits, so it would take some research and personal reflection to determine the better option. Hence, these two questions do not have the same meaning, discuss the same topic, or can be used interchangeably in any context. Therefore, they are not paraphrases of each other."},{"question":"Tweet: @HollieSargeant I knw they got up and left probs cz we were soo annoying and loud.

The tweet reads: \\"@HollieSargeant I knw they got up and left probs cz we were soo annoying and loud.

The user is somewhat self-reflective in this statement, acknowledging that their actions might have caused discomfort for others. Furthermore, the user mentions that \\"Geez, they really woulda hated us,\\" which implies that they feel those who left were left with a negative impression of their group. Taking all the context and language into consideration, it is reasonable to conclude that the sentiment of this tweet leans toward negative. This is due to the user's acknowledgment of their potentially disruptive behavior and the assumption that they left a negative impression on others.

Sir Henry Joseph Wood (3 March 1869 – 19 August 1944) was an English conductor best known for his association with London's annual series of promenade concerts, known as the Proms. He conducted them for nearly half a century, introducing hundreds of new works to British audiences. After his death, the concerts were officially renamed in his honour as the \\"Henry Wood Promenade Concerts\\", although they continued to be generally referred to as \\"the Proms\\". Born in modest circumstances to parents who encouraged his musical talent, Wood started his career as an organist. During his studies at the Royal Academy of Music, he came under the influence of the voice teacher Manuel Garcia and became his accompanist. After similar work for Richard D'Oyly Carte's opera companies on the works of Arthur Sullivan and others, Wood became the conductor of a small operatic touring company. He was soon engaged by the larger Carl Rosa Opera Company. One notable event in his operatic career was conducting the British premiere of Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin in 1892. From the mid-1890s until his death, Wood focused on concert conducting. He was engaged by the impresario Robert Newman to conduct a series of promenade concerts at the Queen's Hall, offering a mixture of classical and popular music at low prices. The series was successful, and Wood conducted annual promenade series until his death in 1944. By the 1920s, Wood had steered the repertoire entirely to classical music. When the Queen's Hall was destroyed by bombing in 1941, the Proms moved to the Royal Albert Hall. Wood declined the chief conductorships of the New York Philharmonic and Boston Symphony Orchestras, believing it his duty to serve music in the United Kingdom. In addition to the Proms, he conducted concerts and festivals throughout the country and also trained the student orchestra at the Royal Academy of Music. He had an enormous influence on the musical life of Britain over his long career: he and Newman greatly improved access to classical music, and Wood...

The Peace Conference required all the defeated powers to pay reparations for all the damage done to civilians. However, owing to economic difficulties and Germany being the only defeated power with an intact economy, the burden fell largely on Germany. Austria-Hungary was partitioned into several successor states, including Austria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia, largely but not entirely along ethnic lines. Transylvania was shifted from Hungary to Greater Romania. The details were contained in the Treaty of Saint-Germain and the Treaty of Trianon. As a result of the Treaty of Trianon, 3.3 million Hungarians came under foreign rule. Although the Hungarians made up 54% of the population of the pre-war Kingdom of Hungary, only 32% of its territory was left to Hungary. Between 1920 and 1924, 354,000 Hungarians fled former Hungarian territories attached to Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia. The Russian Empire, which had withdrawn from the war in 1917 after the October Revolution, lost much of its western frontier as the newly independent nations of Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland were carved from it. Romania took control of Bessarabia in April 1918. The Ottoman Empire disintegrated, with much of its Levant territory awarded to various Allied powers as protectorates. The Turkish core in Anatolia was reorganised as the Republic of Turkey. The Ottoman Empire was to be partitioned by the Treaty of Sèvres of 1920.

Throughout the film, John reveals that he has taken on different identities throughout history, such as Jacques Borne, a friend of Van Gogh, and has lived in various civilizations, including Sumerian, Babylonian, and as a disciple of Gautama Buddha. He has not aged, which is why he moves on periodically to avoid people noticing his lack of aging."},{"question":"Write a dialog about anything you want","response":"Child: Why do we need to eat fruits and vegetables? Helpful Assistant: Fruits and vegetables are like superheroes for our body. They are colorful, tasty, and have special powers to help us grow strong and stay healthy. They have vitamins and minerals that help us fight bad bugs and make our body feel good. Child: Are all fruits and vegetables the same? Helpful Assistant: No, they come in many different colors, shapes, and sizes. Each of them has its own set of superpowers! For example, oranges and strawberries can help keep you from getting sick, carrots can help you see better, and spinach can make your muscles strong.

Some are sweet, like strawberries, and some are a bit sour, like lemons. There are also flavors like bitter or salty. These different tastes make eating fruits and vegetables a fun and yummy adventure. Child: What if I don't like a fruit or vegetable? Helpful Assistant: That's okay! There are so many different fruits and vegetables to choose from. You can always try another one and maybe find a new favorite.

Possible answers: (a). as content; (b). as angry; (c). as upset; The answer is:","response":"It is difficult to determine the exact feelings of others in this specific situation without more context. However, I can provide an educated analysis for each possible response: (a) as content: If Cameron, the police officer, asked a question in a respectful and professional manner, others might feel content with the interaction. This feeling would come from trust and confidence in law enforcement doing their job. (b) as angry: If others believe the police officer's question was invasive, inappropriate, or harassing, they might feel angry towards Cameron. This can happen when people perceive the police's actions as an overreach of their authority. (c) as upset: Others might feel upset if they are concerned about their own safety, privacy, or feel victimized by the police officer's question. They may also be upset if they empathize with the person being questioned, feeling that the interaction is causing distress. In conclusion, without further context, it is hard to provide a definite answer. People's feelings depend on the specific circumstances, the manner in which the police officer asked the question, and their individual experiences and perceptions of law enforcement."},{"question":"Question: two buildings had different tenants.

He just thought he would like something but not too much to do, and the news-agency was ready-made. The business produced little enough for him, but Bill was a man who only wanted the simplicity and order and regularity of the job. He had been a long-serving sailor, and all his life had done everything by the clock. Every day he opened his shop at six a.m. to catch the early trade; the papers arrived on his door-step before that. Many of Bill's customers were city workers, and the shop was convenient for the station. Business was _ by 10 o'clock, so at eleven sharp Bill closed for lunch. It was hard luck on anybody who wanted a paper or magazine in the afternoon, for most likely Bill would be down on the river bank, fishing, and his nearest competitor was five kilometers away. Sometime in the afternoon, the evening paper landed on the doormat, and at 4 o'clock Bill reopened. The evening rush lasted till seven, and it was worthwhile. He lived in a flat above the shop, alone. Except in the very bad weather, you always knew where to find him in the afternoon, as I have said. Once, on a sunny afternoon, I walked home along the river bank from a shopping trip to the village. By my watch it was three minutes past four, so I was astonished to see Bill sitting there on his little chair with a line in the water. He had had no luck, I could see, but he was making no effort to move. \\"What's wrong, Bill?\\" I called out from the path. For answer, he put a hand in his jacket and took out a big, golden object. For a moment I had no idea what it could be, and then it suddenly went off with a noise like a fire engine.

Reasoning: The answer \\"it is not possible to tell\\" is justified because the universe is vast and constantly expanding, which makes it difficult to pinpoint the exact number of stars in it. Additionally, there are many factors that can affect our ability to observe and count stars, such as their distance from Earth, their brightness, and our current technological limitations. Astronomers have provided estimates for the number of stars, but these are based on extrapolation and assumptions, not on a direct count. Furthermore, new stars are constantly being born, while others die; this continuous cycle of stellar birth and death contributes to the uncertainty in the exact number of stars in the observable universe."},{"question":"Q:Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Who are the four people whose wedding receptions are being held in the same hotel?

Last sentence: Less than an hour later, they're stomping around again.","response":"Once upon a time, in a quiet small town, there lived a young girl named Susie. Susie was an adrenaline enthusiast who thrived on adventure and always sought out something new and thrilling. While Susie's schoolmates busied themselves with the usual kid stuff, playing video games, and chatting on social media, Susie was out exploring the wilderness and the many hidden treasures found within its vast embrace. One weekend, Susie decided to gather her best friends – Clara, Benny, and Lou – together for an exploration trip to the legendary Whispering Woods. According to the tales their grandparents related to them, these woods were home to an ancient cave with a mysterious, magical fountain hidden deep inside. It was said that whoever dared step into the cave would embark on a fantastical adventure. The four friends, excited to unravel the century-strong mystery, put on their sturdy boots and packed their knapsacks with the necessary supplies: flashlights, water, food, and maps. Their parents, trusting in Susie's ingenuity and leadership, gave them their blessings and waved goodbye as the youngsters made their way to the Whispering Woods. At first, the woods seemed like any ordinary woodland—filled with towering trees, rustling leaves, chirping birds, and the occasional scampering squirrel. But as they ventured deeper, a hushed, mystical aura enveloped the woods, and the friends couldn't help but feel they were on the cusp of discovering something truly extraordinary. They walked for a while, watching as the landscape changed around them, nature weaving intricate stories untold to human eyes. Finally, they stumbled across the entrance to the cave hidden behind a cascade of glittering water. With elation pumping through their veins, they paused for a moment before taking a deep breath and stepping inside. The cave was surprisingly well-lit, allowing them to traverse its depths without the aid of their flashlights. The walls were adorned with beautiful crystals, shimmering with the absorbed light and reflecting a myriad of colors. As they journeyed deeper into the cave, they suddenly found the source of the light – the magical fountain that laid at the very heart of the cave. As they approached, they heard soft, melodic whispers caressing each traveler's ears – a voice that was both comforting and wise. The fountain's sparkling water seemed to glow with an ethereal light, and the voice urged them to reach in and touch the mystical liquid. One by one, they stepped forth, dipping their hands into the fountain's waters, feeling an instant surge of power coursing through their bodies. Suddenly, the walls of the cave began to shift, and the friends found themselves transported to a fantastic realm of towering mountains, vibrant forests, and peaceful streams. For the remainder of the day, they encountered magical creatures and shared incredible adventures, from soaring through the skies on the backs of dragons to aiding a kingdom of talking animals in a great battle. As the sun dipped below the horizon, the enchanting realm began to fade away, and the exhausted, yet fulfilled friends found themselves back in the cave. Murmuring their thanks to the magical fountain, they left the cave, its entrance gracefully shutting behind them, leaving no trace of what had just occurred. As the four friends began their journey home, they found a renewed appreciation for the beauty of life and the world around them. But while they were grateful for their newfound wisdom and the friendships they had forged, their spirits were restless, as the call of adventure still had a hold on their hearts. Less than an hour later, they're stomping around again, eager to find the next great adventure that awaited them."},{"question":"Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context? Context: Peep Show is a British sitcom starring David Mitchell and Robert Webb. The series follows the lives of two men from their twenties to thirties. Mark Corrigan (Mitchell), who has steady employment for most of the series, and Jeremy \\"Jez\\" Usbourne (Webb), an unemployed would-be musician, are the main characters of the show. Hypothesis: Peep Show is a drama","response":"Based on the provided context, it is not accurate to draw the hypothesis that Peep Show is a drama. The context clearly states that Peep Show is a British sitcom, meaning it is a comedy, not a drama. The genre of sitcom, which stands for \\"situational comedy,\\" typically focuses on humor derived from characters and their interactions in particular situations, rather than dramatic storytelling techniques or complex character studies. In the case of Peep Show, the comedy arises from the characters Mark and Jeremy, as well as their peculiar circumstances as they navigate life through their twenties and thirties. To further understand the difference between a drama and a sitcom, it's essential to examine each genre's unique characteristics: Drama: 1. Dramas aim to engage viewers by presenting realistic characters, settings, and situations. 2. The storylines typically revolve around deep emotions, personal struggles, relationships, and moral dilemmas. 3. The plots are often more intricate, and character development plays a significant role in the overall narrative. 4. Dramas can tackle serious subjects such as social issues, political conflicts, and historical events. 5. The tone of a drama is often serious or intense, aiming to evoke emotions like empathy, sadness, or suspense. Sitcom (Situational Comedy): 1. Sitcoms primarily aim to make viewers laugh through humorous situations and character interactions. 2. The storylines are usually light-hearted and centered on everyday, relatable situations. 3. The plot structure often follows a recurring theme throughout the series, and the narrative is driven by comedy rather than intricate storylines. 4. Sitcoms can include a diverse range of subjects, but the focus remains on humor and amusing situations. 5. The tone of a sitcom is generally lighthearted, aiming to evoke emotions like amusement, enjoyment, and laughter. Given these distinctions, it is clear that Peep Show aligns more closely with the characteristics of a sitcom rather than a drama. The show revolves around the amusing and often ridiculous lives of two men, with its humor derived from their contrasting personalities and the situations they encounter. The context provided indicates that the main focus of the show is on the comedic aspects of the characters Mark and Jeremy, rather than the emotional depth or dramatic storytelling commonly found in a drama."},{"question":"Please answer this question: the crisis in 1958 that brought the final end of france's fourth republic occurred in?","response":"The crisis in 1958 that brought the final end of France's Fourth Republic occurred in a place called Algeria.

Before the Norman invasion of 1169, Gaelic Ireland comprised the whole island. Thereafter, it comprised that part of the country not under foreign dominion at a given time. For most of its history, Gaelic Ireland was a \\"patchwork\\" hierarchy of territories ruled by a hierarchy of kings or chiefs, who were elected through tanistry. For most of the Gaelic period, dwellings and farm buildings were circular with conical thatched roofs (see roundhouse). Square and rectangle-shaped buildings gradually became more common, and by the 14th or 15th century they had replaced round buildings completely. In some areas, buildings were made mostly of stone. In others, they were built of timber, wattle and daub, or a mix of materials. Most ancient and early medieval stone buildings were of dry stone construction. Some buildings would have had glass windows. Among the wealthy, it was common for women to have their own 'apartment' called a grianan (anglicized \\"greenan\\") in the sunniest part of the homestead. The dwellings of freemen and their families were often surrounded by a circular rampart called a \\"ringfort\\". There are two main kinds of ringfort. The rath is an earthen ringfort, averaging 30m diameter, with a dry outside ditch. The cathair or caiseal is a stone ringfort. The ringfort would typically have enclosed the family home, small farm buildings or workshops, and animal pens. Most date to the period 500-1000 CE and there is evidence of large-scale ringfort desertion at the end of the first millennium. The remains of between 30,000 and 40,000 lasted into the 19th century to be mapped by Ordnance Survey Ireland. Another kind of native dwelling was the crannog, which were roundhouses built on artificial islands in lakes. There were very few nucleated settlements in Gaelic areas. However, after the 5th century some monasteries became the heart of small \\"monastic towns\\". By the 10th century the Norse-Gaelic ports of Dublin, Wexford, Cork and Limerick had grown into substantial settlements. It was at this time, perhaps as a response to Viking raids, that many of the Irish round towers were built. In the fifty years before the Norman invasion, the term \\"castle\\" (Old Irish: caistel/caislen) appears in Gaelic writings, although there are no surviving examples of pre-Norman castles. After the invasion, the Normans built motte-and-bailey castles in the areas they occupied, some of which were converted from ringforts. By 1300 \\"some mottes, especially in frontier areas, had almost certainly been built by the Gaelic Irish in imitation\\". The Normans gradually replaced wooden motte-and-baileys with stone castles and tower houses. Tower houses are free-standing multi-storey stone towers usually surrounded by a wall (see bawn) and ancillary buildings. Gaelic families had begun to build their own tower houses by the 15th century. As many as 7000 may have been built, but they were rare in areas with little Norman settlement or contact. They are concentrated in counties Limerick and Clare but are lacking in Ulster, except the area around Strangford Lough. In Gaelic law, a 'sanctuary' called a maighin digona surrounded each person's dwelling. The maighin digona's size varied according to the owner's rank. In the case of a boaire it stretched as far as he, while sitting at his house, could cast a cnairsech (variously described as a spear or sledgehammer). The owner of a maighin digona could offer its protection to someone fleeing from pursuers, who would then have to bring that person to justice by lawful means.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What did they replaced the round buildings with ?","response":"Square and rectangle-shaped buildings gradually became more common, and by the 14th or 15th century they had replaced round buildings completely."},{"question":"Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What were much more varied in later periods? Chinese imperial tombs are typically approached by a \\"spirit road\\", sometimes several kilometres long, lined by statues of guardian figures, based on both humans and animals. A tablet extolling the virtues of the deceased, mounted on a stone representation of Bixi in the form of a tortoise, is often the centerpiece of the ensemble. In Han tombs the guardian figures are mainly of \\"lions\\" and \\"chimeras\\"; in later periods they are much more varied. A looted tomb with fine paintings is the Empress Dowager Wenming tomb of the 5th century CE, and the many tombs of the 7th-century Tang dynasty Qianling Mausoleum group are an early example of a generally well-preserved ensemble.The complex of Goguryeo Tombs, from a kingdom of the 5th to 7th centuries which included modern Korea, are especially rich in paintings. Only one of the Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties has been excavated, in 1956, with such disastrous results for the conservation of the thousands of objects found, that subsequently the policy is to leave them undisturbed.The Lei Cheng Uk Han Tomb Museum in Hong Kong displays a far humbler middle-class Han dynasty tomb, and the mid-2nd-century Wu Family tombs of Jiaxiang County, Shandong are the most important group of commoner tombs for funerary stones. The walls of both the offering and burial chambers of tombs of commoners from the Han period may be decorated with stone slabs carved or engraved in very low relief with crowded and varied scenes, which are now the main indication of the style of the lost palace frescoes of the period. A cheaper option was to use large clay tiles which were carved or impressed before firing. After the introduction of Buddhism, carved \\"funerary couches\\" featured similar scenes, now mostly religious.

Answer the question and classify your answers into yes or no. Q: Is AUTHOR wrong in the post ? POST : I work part-time as a retail associate. I am currently 7 months pregnant. Before I started my job, I told my current boss in my working interview that I was 2 months pregnant, but wanted to continue working after having the baby. I also said that I was looking into daycares. Now, (1) after looking into daycares and (2) being 7 months pregnant, my perspective has changed. I have found that daycares are very expensive. I don't make a lot of money with my job. If I were to continue working after the baby was born and placed my baby in daycare, my wages would not cover daycare expenses plus the cost of gas driving to work and back. Also, I have never felt so tired in my life and people are telling me after the baby is born I will be even more tired. I feel guilty for changing my mind. My boss is a lovely person. She has kids of her own and started her own business to be able to spend more time with them. She has been very encouraging about my pregnancy and has even given my baby items that she no longer uses. But when I mentioned starting maternity leave, she appeared stressed/uncomfortable talking about it and mentioned how she worked up until her due date. My husband works at a job that covers all of our expenses, so I don't really need to work. We (my husband and I) don't live around family/friends that would be able to watch the baby after it's born. I was being honest with my boss when I told her that I wanted to continue working after the baby was born. But now, I don't want to because I don't think it makes sense for my family. AITA for changing my mind? A:","response":"In this complex ethical situation, it can be argued that AUTHOR is not necessarily wrong for changing their mind based on the changed circumstances and the financial and emotional factors that have come into play. It is important for AUTHOR to prioritize their own well-being and that of their family, especially considering the costs and energy associated with having a baby. However, it is also understandable that the boss may feel some disappointment or stress, as they have been supportive and accommodating of AUTHOR's situation. AUTHOR should be mindful of the potential effect on their relationship with their boss and try to handle the situation with as much communication and understanding as possible. In conclusion, the answer to the question \\"Is AUTHOR wrong in the post?\\" is NO. AUTHOR's shift in perspective is due to the realization of personal priorities and financial feasibility, and they have the right to change their mind based on what is best for their family's well-being. Nonetheless, it is crucial for AUTHOR to manage the situation with empathy and communication to maintain a positive relationship with their boss."},{"question":"Write a subject line for this message: Attached is a revised Credit Watch listing for the week of 5/14/01.

In 2008, Malik Obama peered into a tiny TV with a flickering CNN signal for an all-night vigil watching results come in. After a rain-soaked night that stranded more than a few reporters who had come to the village, Malik Obama emerged bleary-eyed but dancing. A crowd of supporters chanted his name. Kogelo is the birthplace of Barack Obama's father, Barack Obama Sr. Then-Sen. Barack Obama visited in 2006 and paid special homage to his grandmother, Sarah Obama (now universally known as Mama Sarah). It's not just Sarah and Malik, there is a whole wing of the Obama clan here: cousins, aunts and half-cousins. If 2006 was the start of the love affair, in 2008 it went full-blown. Everywhere there were Obama T-shirts, DVDs and cakes (a black forest cake with an edible picture of the president-to-be and Mama Sarah was a favorite). Things have certainly cooled down since then. To many Africans (and Americans, if polls are correct), Barack Obama's presidential campaign of \\"hope\\" and \\"change\\" hit a wall of reality when he came into office. Africans, in particular, saw great hope in the new American president with African roots. But after just one brief swing through Ghana in four years at the White House, many feel let down by Africa's \\"favorite son.\\" The administration contends that Africa is a priority, and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has been a regular fixture in Africa. But to Africans, and especially to Kenyans, it is not the same. \\"Under the circumstances with what he has had to deal with we understand,\\" said Malik Obama, \\"and we hope that circumstances will change. We hope he has the opportunity to come here and say hello.\\" Even without a visit from President Obama, Kogelo is still trying to make good use of the connection. Where there was once just a dirt track running through town, now a paved road is nearing completion. Electricity is connected to many houses. Water projects have increased. Simply put, President Obama's win put Kogelo on the map. Locals here say that charities flooded into Kogelo to get a bit of the \\"Obama cache.\\" With a tight race looming in 2012, many here are nervous. \\"I donÂ¹t know the other person who is contesting,\\" said Pastor Joseph Omundi of the Christian Life church in Kogelo, \\"but we know Barack Obama is the son of this land.\\" Omundi, a fiery preacher who delivers sermons with a translator in a staccato double act, said his congregation has been praying for \\"peace, the economy, and Barack Obama.\\" Everyone a CNN crew spoke to in Kogelo is for Obama: the fruit vendors; the commuters streaming by in matatu, or minibus, vehicles; and even the opinionated boda boda, or bicycle and motorcycle, drivers. Many just refer to Mitt Romney as \\"the other guy.\\" While Kogelo has changed, with a new recreation center and lodge for foreign tourists, it is still just a rural village some 260 miles (418 kilometers) west of Nairobi, the capital. The flood of foreign visitors predicted by the government hasn't materialized, and the much-touted road isn't quite finished. But Malik Obama stays positive. \\"Washington, D.C., is the capital of the United States, but Kogelo is the capital of the world, because everybody comes to visit,\\" he said. Highlights:","response":"1. Kogelo, Kenya experienced \\"Obama mania\\" in 2008 following Barack Obama's election win due to it being the birthplace of his father. 2. In 2006, then-Senator Barack Obama visited the village and paid homage to his extended family, sparking widespread local support. 3. Many Africans felt let down by Obama's limited engagement with the continent during his presidency, despite his African roots. 4. The village of Kogelo has benefited from infrastructure improvements and charity involvement since Obama's election. 5. Malik Obama, the president's half-brother, remains hopeful for greater future connection, calling Kogelo \\"the capital of the world.\\""},{"question":"Q:Combine facts and answer this: Vulpes qiuzhudingi is believed to be the ancestor of which small fox native to the Northern Hemisphere?

Article: Harriet Tubman was an AfricanAmerican woman who fought against slavery. She was born in 1820. She helped many people escape from slavery through the Underground Railroad. It was an organized effort to help slaves from the southern states to areas that banned slavery. Slaves could be sold freely. Families were often separated. Harriet married a free black man named John Tubman in 1844, yet she remained a slave. In 1849, the farmer who owned her died. Then she ran to the home of a white woman who had offered to help her. This woman told her how to reach another home where she could hide. Harriet Tubman went from place to place in this way. This was how the Underground Railroad operated. Finally,she went into the northern state of Pennsylvania. During the next ten years,she led an expanded Underground Railroad,and helped 300 slaves escape. Harriet Tubman found another way to fight against slavery during the Civil War. She went into the southern states to spy for the North. After the Civil War,Harriet Tubman settled in New York State.

In the course of a long and innovative career, he played a prominent role in the revival of interest in British folk music in the early years of the 20th century. Although much of his work was experimental and unusual, the piece with which he is most generally associated is his piano arrangement of the folk-dance tune \\"Country Gardens\\". Grainger left Australia at the age of 13 to attend the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt. Between 1901 and 1914 he was based in London, where he established himself first as a society pianist and later as a concert performer, composer and collector of original folk melodies. As his reputation grew he met many of the significant figures in European music, forming important friendships with Frederick Delius and Edvard Grieg. He became a champion of Nordic music and culture, his enthusiasm for which he often expressed in private letters, sometimes in crudely racial or anti-Semitic terms. In 1914, Grainger moved to the United States, where he lived for the rest of his life, though he travelled widely in Europe and in Australia. He served briefly as a bandsman in the United States Army during the First World War through 1917–18, and took American citizenship in 1918. After his mother's suicide in 1922, he became increasingly involved in educational work. He also experimented with music machines, which he hoped would supersede human interpretation. In the 1930s he set up the Grainger Museum in Melbourne, his birthplace, as a monument to his life and works, and as a future research archive. As he grew older, he continued to give concerts and to revise and rearrange his own compositions, while writing little new music. After the Second World War, ill health reduced his levels of activity. He considered his career a failure.

As their investigation deepens, Richard notices that they are constantly being watched and pursued by mysterious agents who will stop at nothing to keep their sinister plot and the existence of extraterrestrial life a secret. As the duo works together to unravel the truth, Richard's life begins to unravel—he loses his job, his reputation is tarnished, and his loved ones turn against him. The story explores Richard's determination to uncover the sinister events plaguing the town, putting his career and life on the line in pursuit of the truth. In the film's climax, Richard and Samantha manage to expose the government conspiracy and present the world with definitive proof of intelligent alien life that has been living among us undetected for decades. Just as it appears that Richard will finally regain the respect and admiration he once held, he realizes that by exposing the truth, he has unintentionally put humanity in grave danger. The film ends on a cliffhanger, leaving it open for a possible sequel, as Richard and Samantha must now work to prevent the impending alien invasion they have inadvertently triggered.

Please remove spaces between words.","response":"Inrealityitwasonlydifferentfractionsfightingeachother. The statement above, when deprived of spaces between words, becomes relatively more challenging to read and understand for a human reader. However, the statement itself seems to be pointing out a situation, likely a conflict, in which various factions or groups are fighting among themselves. These fractions may represent anything, from political or religious factions to diverse communities or organizations with opposing interests. It is evident that conflicts involving multiple factions tend to be quite complex and fascinating from various perspectives. This is because they depict different opinions, beliefs, and priorities, which influence different people to engage in these struggles. To gain better insights into such scenarios, it is important to analyze each of the fractions independently and understand the motivation behind their actions, as well as investigate the historical, cultural, and sociopolitical roots of the conflict. Moreover, it is essential to consider the strategies and goals of each fraction and assess the implications of their actions on the broader context of the conflict. This includes evaluating the chances of success or failure of each fraction's plans, as well as the potential consequences each of their actions may have on the overall scenario. Furthermore, understanding the power dynamics and alliances between different fractions can also provide valuable insights into the intricacies of the conflict. It is crucial to consider how these relationships could change over time, and how shifts in alliances, as well as the emergence or dissolution of fractions, can impact the ongoing struggle. Finally, seeking peaceful and sustainable solutions to conflicts involving multiple fractions often requires a deep understanding of not only the underlying causes and historical context but also the unique perspective and goals of each fraction involved. This allows for the development of well-informed approaches to resolving disputes, employing diplomacy and conflict resolution methods tailored to the specific conditions and circumstances of each case. To summarize, the phrase \\"in reality, it was only different fractions fighting each other\\" captures the essence of a multifaceted struggle in which diverse factions vie for power, control, or the realization of their goals. Analyzing, understanding, and ultimately resolving such conflicts necessitates a comprehensive examination of each fraction involved, as well as the broader historical and sociopolitical context in which the conflict is taking place."},{"question":"Triple: Big Hero 6 (film) DISTRIBUTOR Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures What is a sentence that describes this triple?","response":"The movie \\"Big Hero 6\\" is a fun and exciting film that was given to movie theaters and other places by a big group called Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures.

But his busy mind was not too occupied to return the salutes of the traffic policemen who cleared the way for him. Or, by some genius of memory, to recall the fact that it was on this morning young Spear was to be sentenced for theft. It was a charming morning. The spring was at full tide, and the air was sweet and clean. Mr. Thorndike considered whimsically that to send a man to jail with the memory of such a morning clinging to him was adding a year to his sentence. He regretted he had not given the probation officer a stronger letter. He remembered the young man now, and favorably. A shy, silent youth, deft in work, and at other times conscious and embarrassed. But that, on the part of a stenographer, in the presence of the Wisest Man in Wall Street, was not unnatural. On occasions, Mr. Thorndike had put even royalty— frayed, impecunious royalty, on the lookout for a loan—at its ease. The hood of the car was down, and the taste of the air, warmed by the sun, was grateful. It was at this time, a year before, that young Spear picked the spring flowers to take to his mother. A year from now where would young Spear be? It was characteristic of the great man to act quickly, so quickly that his friends declared he was a slave to impulse. It was these same impulses, leading so invariably to success, that made his enemies call him the Wisest Man. He leaned forward and touched the chauffeur's shoulder. \\"Stop at the Court of General Sessions,\\" he commanded. What he proposed to do would take but a few minutes. A word, a personal word from him to the district attorney, or the judge, would be enough. After reading the above, is \\"He usually went for it, but gave himself time to think first\\" the correct answer to the question \\"How does Mr. Thorndike act upon his impulse?\\"?","response":"No, \\"He usually went for it, but gave himself time to think first\\" is not the correct answer to the question \\"How does Mr. Thorndike act upon his impulse?\\" A more accurate answer would be \\"He acts quickly on his impulses and makes prompt decisions.\\" The text describes Mr. Thorndike as a person who acts quickly and tends to follow his impulses, which often lead him to success."},{"question":"A council is to include the title 'Mx' on its official forms to be more accommodating to the trans-community. Campaigners say that 'Mx', short for 'Mixter', is a gender neutral alternative to Mr, Mrs, Ms and Miss. Brighton and Hove city council's trans-equality panel previously pointed out that the gender part of forms allows people to say if they are male, female or other. It said the lack of options in the title field does not provide for people who do not identify as male or female. Brighton and Hove city council is to offer 'Mx' as a title option on official forms following a review of services for trans people. Yesterday the council's policy and. resources committee approved a series of measures, including the removal of the need for patients to choose from male or female options when they check in at electronic screens on arrival at a GP surgery. Other recommendations include ensuring. all councillors and police staff undertake trans awareness training and. introducing gender neutral toilets and changing rooms, suggested by the council's trans-equality scrutiny panel. Brighton has a gay, lesbian, bisexual and trans population of about 40,000. The recommendations will now be passed on to the full council. Ruth Rose, 79, of Newhaven, Sussex, who was born male, said: 'It can be difficult in GP surgeries - I am not recognised. 'If I put in female I am not found if I put in male - which I am not - I am not found. 'You have to decide between one sex or the other depending on what stage of your transition you are at. 'And in some situations, for example, when you are getting your bins collected, does it matter if you are male or female?' The recommendation follows the suggestions from Brighton and Hove city council to introduce gender neutral toilets and send councillors and police to trans awareness training. The report noted: 'The Trans Equality Scrutiny Panel was ground-breaking, being the first in the country to carry out, in a sensitive and effective way, a detailed investigation into the experiences and needs of trans individuals and community in the city. 'It provides a firm and clear foundation for all public services to build on in terms of improving their understanding of and service provision to the trans community. 'For example, during the panel process housing officers committed to commissioning trans awareness training and city services committed looking at the introducing more flexibility on honorific titles (such as Mr, Ms) within online forms.' The clinical commissioning group made up of GPs across the county said it would implement the changes. Green Party councillor Phelim MacCafferty, chairman of the trans-equality and scrutiny panel which was set up in May 2012, said: 'Our transgender community is one of the most disadvantaged and marginalised groups in Brighton and Hove. 'There has been inadequate awareness of lives of trans people for too long. 'The recommendations of our cross party panel will make the city a fairer place for trans people to live, work, study or visit here.' A clinical commissioning group spokesman said: 'We support the recommendations.' Write highlights for this article.","response":"1.

Though Las Vegas had developed a powerful local economy, few major outside investments were made in the city, due primarily to mob infiltration and its inherent ties to illegal activities. That would change dramatically with the 1966 arrival of billionaire Howard Hughes. A legitimate businessman, Hughes was nonetheless eccentric and dramatic, a style suited to the Las Vegas ethos. True to the myth, the reclusive Hughes immediately cloistered himself in the Desert Inn's penthouse. Several weeks later he was asked — then ordered — to vacate the room to make room for high rollers, whereupon he promptly bought the property and fired the management. Thus began Hughes' legendary three-year, 300-million Las Vegas buying spree. When it was over, Hughes owned six casinos, an airport, and an airline, along with numerous plots of land stretching from the Strip to the mountains. Hughes' actions would have beneficial repercussions, both immediate and lasting. Because of the new legitimacy Las Vegas acquired from Hughes' investments, established companies such as Hilton Hotels bought into the gaming business, and their influence helped draw a line in the desert sand between legitimate operations and mob casinos, where illegal skimming of profits was rampant. That, combined with the formation of the Nevada Gaming Control Board, would signal the beginning of the end for heavy mob influence in the city. Las Vegas with a Vision As corporations moved in and the mob was slowly pushed out, a new Las Vegas emerged. The legitimization of gambling led to its increased legalization across the US. What was once a sure thing became much more competitive. Casino operators had to reassess the nature of their business. The first to really do so was Steve Wynn, a Las Vegas resident and owner of the Golden Nugget. In the mid-1980s, Wynn began plans to reinvigorate Las Vegas with a new resort. He bought several Strip properties — the Silver Slipper and Castaways among them — and demolished them to make way for a new kind of resort — Mirage — which became an instant success.

The game started well for the Raiders; thanks to a muffed punt by Darren Sproles that was recovered by Hiram Eugene at the San Diego 18&#160;yard line, and set up a 9-yard rushing touchdown by Jason Campbell. Scoring continued in the first quarter with a 4-yard pass from Campbell to Jacoby Ford; and gave the Raiders an early 14-0 lead over the Chargers.

Henry petitions to be admitted (fully aware of the kind of life he had led), but there is some doubt as to his qualifications. To prove his worthiness (or rather unworthiness), he begins to tell the story of his dissolute life. Born in Manhattan on October 25, 1872, Henry is the spoiled only child of stuffy, clueless, wealthy parents Randolph (Louis Calhern) and Bertha (Spring Byington). His paternal grandmother (Clara Blandick in an uncredited role) is also doting and naive, although his down-to-earth grandfather Hugo Van Cleve (Charles Coburn), a self-made millionaire, understands Henry quite well. Henry grows up an idle young man, with a taste for attractive showgirls. One day, Henry overhears a beautiful woman lying to her mother on a public telephone.

Article: I used to think of myself as a person learned in books, but my bookshelves told a different story. Apart from a few Indian novels and an Australian book, my literature collection only consisted of British and American titles. Worse still, I couldn't ever found anything in translation. My reading was limited to stories by English-speaking authors. So, at the start of 2012, I set myself the challenge of trying to read a book from every country in a year to find out what I was missing. With no idea where to get those books, I was unlikely to find publications from nearly 200 nations on the shelves of my local bookshop, so I decided to ask the readers all over the world for help. I created a blog called A Year of Reading the World and put out an appeal for suggestions of titles that I could read in English. The response was amazing. People all over the world were getting in touch with me, offering ideas and book lists. Some posted me books from their home countries. In addition, several writers, like Turkmenistan's Ak Welsapar and Panama's Juan David Morgan, sent me unpublished translations of their novels, giving me a rare opportunity to read works unavailable in Britain. Even with such an extraordinary team of bibliophiles behind me, however, sourcing books was no easy task. With translations making up only around 4.5 per cent of literary works published in the UK, getting English versions of stories was tricky. One by one, the books from the countries on the list filled my heart with laughter, love, anger, hope and fear. Lands that had once seemed exotic and remote became close and familiar to me. At its best, I learned, reading makes the world real. Question: Which of the following is NOT the help from people around the world?

Using the adjective \\"meditative\\" to describe a movie implies that it is reflective, thought-provoking, and introspective, which are considered desirable qualities for a film by many viewers and critics. A meditative movie typically delves into deeper themes and emotions, often encouraging the audience to consider various aspects of life, human nature, or society. A film that is described as meditative may have slower pacing, subtle character development, and a focus on storytelling that prioritizes immersion in atmosphere and mood over fast-paced action or entertainment value. This type of narrative style is often appreciated for its ability to evoke a multitude of thoughts and reactions, as it challenges viewers to think critically about the content and stay engaged mentally, rather than passively consuming the film. The positive implications of the word \\"meditative\\" suggest that the critic appreciated these qualities in the movie, finding it meaningful and emotionally engaging. A movie that can evoke this kind of response is typically seen as a well-made and artfully constructed piece of cinema. It is likely that the critic appreciated the film's ability to provoke introspection and discussion, its attention to detail, and the overall thoughtfulness of its presentation. It is also possible that the critic found the movie to be an effective medium for expressing and exploring deeper themes and ideas. Meditative films often present complex narratives that rely on rich visual storytelling, evocative imagery, and thought-provoking symbolism. A critic who describes a movie as meditative may value these elements, recognizing how they contribute to a more enriching and profound cinematic experience. In conclusion, the use of the term \\"meditative\\" in the short movie review suggests that the critic had a positive opinion of the movie. They likely found it to be a thought-provoking and immersive experience that was marked by introspective, reflective storytelling and a focus on deeper themes."},{"question":"Instructions: An answer is given.

Question 2: Did Israel consider using nuclear weapons during the Yom Kippur War? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","response":"Yes, questions 1 and 2 are essentially asking the same thing: whether Israel considered utilizing nuclear weapons during the Yom Kippur War. I will proceed to answer this question more elaborately below. The Yom Kippur War, which took place from October 6 to October 25, 1973, was a conflict between Israel and a coalition of Arab states led by Egypt and Syria. The war began with a surprise attack by Egypt and Syria on the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur and continued for approximately three weeks before a ceasefire was reached. During this time, Israel faced serious challenges that pushed its military and political leaders to consider the possible use of nuclear weapons. The possibility of Israel using nuclear weapons in the Yom Kippur War has been a topic of considerable interest and debate among historians, military experts, and political analysts. While some argue that Israel was very close to deploying nuclear weapons, others suggest that this option was never seriously considered. In the early stages of the war, Israel faced significant setbacks as Arab forces advanced into the Sinai Peninsula and the Golan Heights. These actions caught Israel off guard, as it was not prepared for a major conflict. The rapid advancement of Arab forces and the inability of Israeli troops to hold them off caused panic among the Israeli population and its leaders. Military intelligence failures and the higher-than-expected casualties on the Israeli side have also been cited as reasons for the consideration of nuclear weapons. There are several accounts suggesting that Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir gave preliminary authorization for the assembly and preparation of nuclear warheads. According to some sources, Israeli planes loaded with nuclear weapons were even put on standby, ready for deployment if the situation continued deteriorating. However, this decision was not made public at the time, and the full extent of these preparations remains unclear. As the war progressed, Israel managed to turn the tide of the conflict, ultimately gaining the upper hand against the Arab coalition. This recovery, combined with diplomatic pressure and efforts from the United States and the Soviet Union to broker a ceasefire, helped diminish the likelihood of Israel resorting to nuclear weapons. Ultimately, Israel's tactical success on the battlefield and the successful ceasefire negotiations made it unnecessary for them to employ such a devastating means of warfare. While several sources suggest that Israel was indeed close to using nuclear weapons during the Yom Kippur War, it is important to maintain caution when interpreting these accounts. Many details surrounding Israel's nuclear program and decision-making process during the war remain classified, leading to a significant amount of speculation. Additionally, views on this subject may be colored by political and ideological biases. Hence, it is difficult to assess with certainty the exact distance Israel came to deploying nuclear weapons during the Yom Kippur War. However, it is clear that the possibility had been considered and that preparations were made to some extent."},{"question":"Give the rationale and then the answer.

It would also entail a practical component where the individual should visualize, manipulate, and interact with the real or simulated physical objects or environments. Let's design a task around building a gravity-based marble run or roller coaster. Step 1: Define the task The task will involve the person designing and building a marble run or roller coaster from a specific height to ground level. The run must include at least two loops or turns. The goal is to make the journey of the marble last as long as possible without stopping or going backwards. Step 2: Understand the key elements involved This task is testing elements of physics including speed, velocity, and the effects of gravity. By manipulating the angle and length of the path, and by adding loops or turns, different forces will act on the marble. Step 3: Illustrate the practicalities of the task The individual would need to understand how different slopes and turns affect the marble's speed. They need to consider the weight of the marble, the gravitational pull, and how friction can slow down the marble or even cause it to stop if the angles of the pathways are too steep or if the marble loses momentum in a loop. Step 4: Assess the task The success of the task can be measured by how well the marble completes the task, that is, whether it completes the path without stopping or rolling backward, and how long it takes the marble to complete the course. The person's reasoning can be evaluated by discussing or recording their explanations of their design choices and adjustments made during the process. Such a task would not only test for physical reasoning but also for problem solving, creativity, and perseverance."},{"question":"Please answer a question about the following article about Galicia (Spain): After the rupture of the wars with Portugal and Catalonia, the Junta changed its attitude, this time due to the exhaustion of Galicia, now involved not just in naval or oversea operations, but also in an exhausting war with the Portuguese, war which produced thousands of casualties and refugees and was heavily disturbing to the local economy and commerce.

However, there will still be opportunities for interactions between Trump and his Latin and North American counterparts at the two-day summit that begins April 13 in Lima, Peru. The gathering takes place as Trump finalizes plans to send the military to the U.S. border with Mexico and threatens to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA. In addition, Trump's recently imposed steel and aluminum tariffs have sparked criticism from many of the attendees at the summit, though some countries have received temporary exemptions. Despite all the turbulence, White House officials outlined a fairly traditional agenda for the summit. \\"A win for this president at this summit will be a strong speech focused on regional governance, leadership on Venezuela and promoting reciprocal trade,\\" a senior administration official said.

There is a long history of unsuccessful efforts to change people's attitudes. Nevertheless, Broockman and Kalla conducted a field experiment showing that Miami voters shifted their attitudes toward transgender individuals and maintained those changed positions for 3 months (see the Perspective by Paluck). Science, this issue p. 220; see also p. 147 ||||| Could prejudice be stopped by a quick chat? A new study looked at whether a 10-minute, face-to-face conversation can actually change someone's mind and make them less prejudiced. Interested in ? Add as an interest to stay up to date on the latest news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest The study, published today in the journal Science, had 56 canvassers visit 501 voters in the Miami area to discuss issues facing transgender people after an ordinance was passed to protect transgender people from discrimination. Those canvassing were from the Los Angeles LGBT Center and SAVE, a South Florida LGBT organization, and for the study were sent to see if they could find and counteract any backlash to the ordinance. To effectively reach residents, the canvassers went through training developed by the Los Angeles LGBT Center that uses techniques from cognitive behavioral therapy to engage with people. A similar study published in 2014 that received much public attention was retracted in May 2015 due to problems with the study's data first pointed out by the authors of this new study. The public attention and the subsequent retraction prompted much controversy at the time. The canvassers in the new study approached each subject by listening, sharing and prodding them to open up about their own lives. After meeting the resident, the canvassers identified themselves, explained voters could vote for a repeal of the nondiscrimination ordinance and then asked voters to explain their views on transgender people. The canvassers then attempted a new kind of persuasion to get the resident to reconsider transgender issues. They simply asked voters to talk about a time when they were judged negatively for being different. \\"The canvassers then encouraged voters to see how their own experience offered a window into transgender people’s experiences, hoping to facilitate voters’ ability to take transgender people’s perspectives,\\" the study authors wrote. \\"The intervention ended with another attempt to encourage active processing by asking voters to describe if and how the exercise changed their mind.\\" The entire interaction took just about 10 minutes, and lead study author David Broockman said about 70 percent of residents who opened their door finished the entire interaction. After three months, the voters who took part in the initial conversation about transgender issues were much more likely to exhibit \\"positive\\" feelings toward transgender people compared to a placebo's group response. The results were not measurably different if the canvasser they talked to was transgender or not. Broockman, an assistant professor at Stanford University Graduate School of Business, said the findings don't point to a \\"trick\\" at getting people to agree with you, but seem to show tapping into people's empathy can allow them to reconsider their position. \\"It’s not as easy as here’s a script,\\" Broockman told ABC News. \\"Similar to cognitive behavioral therapy, some of the ideas are if you ask the right questions and have [people] think through their own opinions and behaviors, that can help people lead them to change their own minds.\\" An accompanying perspective published in the journal reviewing Broockman's study said the research is a key step in taking social sciences out of the lab and into the real world to see how real people are affected by these experiments. \\"A face-to-face conversation is not minor when compared with other interventions used to influence political or social attitudes, like 1- to 2-minute mass media advertisements,\\" wrote Elizabeth Levy Paluck, associated professor of psychology and public affairs at Princeton University. \\"Considering both the absolute and relative importance of such a conversation, it seems plausible that a meaningful interaction could take place in a short period of time.\\" A similar study published in 2014, also in the journal Science, was later retracted over findings that the study sponsorship was falsified, survey incentives were misrepresented and statistical irregularities in the responses. Broockman and his co-author Joshua Kalla wrote that this new study helps \\"fill the void\\" by that retraction by showing with this work that prejudice may be combated with conversation. \\"Several patterns in the present study’s data renew confidence that advocates could productively deploy the intervention strategy that we report,\\" the study authors said. Broockman told ABC News that more research is needed to see if this small study can be scaled upwards to affect a larger swath of people. However, Broockman said he was optimistic about these practices being used on a wider scale to help reduce prejudice. ||||| However, in response to these victories, the movement for LGBTQ equality has come under some of the fiercest backlash in its history. Amid widely publicized resistance to marriage equality such as that of Kim Davis in Kentucky, SAVE fought back repeated attempts by Florida lawmakers to pass anti-LGBTQ bills during the 2015-2016 legislative session, including a proposal which would criminalize the use of restrooms by transgender Floridians as well as one which would legally sanction discrimination against LGBTQ Floridians. In response to -- and in anticipation of -- a legislative or electoral campaign to repeal nondiscrimination protections or curtail the human rights of LGBTQ people (and particularly people who are transgender), SAVE set out to find out how to best reach voters at a granular level in order to reduce the very biases in which anti-LGBTQ campaigns are grounded. In order to answer this question, the LGBTQ advocacy group, the foremost such organization in South Florida, teamed up to conduct a scientific study with the Los Angeles LGBT Center's Leadership LAB as well as researchers from Stanford and the University of California Berkeley. \\"We found that a single, approximately 10-minute conversation with a stranger produced large reductions in prejudice that persisted for at least the three months studied to date; were resistant to counterargument; and affected political attitudes,\\" said David Broockman, assistant professor at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. He and Joshua Kalla, PhD student at the University of California at Berkeley, co-authored the new study. Kalla added that \\"the decline in prejudice against transgender people is comparable to the prejudice reduction against gay and lesbian people that took more than a decade to achieve.\\" The groups achieving the reduction in prejudice, SAVE and the Los Angeles LGBT Center, welcomed the academics' independent measurement of the canvassing program and the publication of their findings. \\"Our ability to change voters' hearts and minds has been measured, this time for real,\\" said Dave Fleischer, director of the L.A. LGBT Center's Leadership LAB. Last year, when Broockman and Kalla were graduate students at the University of California, Berkeley, they uncovered data irregularities in a December 2014 Science article studying the Center's same innovative grassroots approach. That study was retracted after they (along with an additional colleague, Professor Peter Aronow of Yale) uncovered the study's flaws. Broockman, Kalla, and Aronow subsequently won a Leamer-Rosenthal Prize for Open Social Science for discovering the discrepancies. \\"Our new study's findings differ from those in the retracted article in an important way,\\" Kalla noted. \\"Unlike the original study which found only gay canvassers could lastingly reduce prejudice, we find both transgender canvassers and non-transgender allies were effective. Canvassers do not need to be members of an affected group to lastingly reduce prejudice against that group.\\" The new study by Broockman and Kalla measured the impact of a voter treatment developed by the L.A. LGBT Center called \\"deep canvassing.\\" A \\"deep canvass\\" conversation differs from a conventional canvass conversation in both length and reciprocity, with the conversations taking 10-15 minutes as the canvasser listens to voters' experiences and responds conversationally rather than reciting a script or talking points. From January through June 2015, the L.A. LGBT Center partnered with SAVE, South Florida's largest and longest-serving LGBT organization. Together, they canvassed voters in conservative neighborhoods in Miami six months after the Miami-Dade County Commission voted to include transgender people in the county's Human Rights Ordinance. The result: with a rigorous randomized trial -- just like a clinical trial -- Broockman and Kalla found that the deep canvass conversations changed roughly 1 in 10 voters' attitudes about transgender people. The researchers also found an impact on feelings towards transgender people comparable to the decline in prejudice against gay and lesbian people seen between 1998 and 2012. In repeated re-measurement, this impact persisted without decay for at least three months. This enduring effect stands in marked contrast to other published measurements of conventional attempts at voter persuasion and prejudice reduction through TV ads or mail or in standard phone or canvass conversations. Other research rarely tracks the long-term impact of such activities. When it does, it has found that these conventional tactics tend to have little or no impact; typically, their impact dissipates within days as voters return to their old points of view. Broockman and Kalla found that the conversations were broadly effective: Democratic and Republican voters, liberal and conservative voters, female and male voters, and voters who were Caucasian, Latino, and African-American all exhibited a profound shift. \\"The immediate practical value is that we know we are reducing anti-transgender prejudice here in Miami,\\" said Justin Klecha, director of campaigns at SAVE. SAVE has continued deep canvassing in its ongoing campaign to pass statewide non-discrimination protections and make Miami-Dade County a more accepting place for transgender people to live and work. \\"These conversations are a real game-changer for us here in Florida,\\" said Tony Lima, executive director at SAVE. \\"Because of these conversations and their impact, we're getting closer to being the first state in the South to pass statewide protections for LGBT people.\\" Commenting on the larger significance, Los Angeles LGBT Center CEO Lorri L. Jean said, \\"When our community faces anti-LGBT ballot measures, it has become abundantly clear we need more than 30-second ads to win. We've long believed that if LGBT people and our allies could meet and engage voters in heartfelt conversations, we could reduce their prejudice. It's exciting to have the data to prove that deep canvassing works, and gratifying to share this powerful new approach with LGBT leaders and progressive allies throughout the country.\\" The broader applicability of this approach to other issues is an area for future research. Nevertheless, Broockman and Kalla note that their findings suggest \\"it may be in campaigns' own best interest to place renewed emphasis on a personal exchange of initially opposing views, even regarding controversial issues and across partisan lines.\\" The independent study was made possible by the Gill Foundation, which provided grants for the data measurement costs incurred by Broockman and Kalla for the research published in Science, as well as significant funding for both SAVE and the Los Angeles LGBT Center to conduct the prejudice reduction canvassing. The participation of the Los Angeles LGBT Center was also made possible by generous support from the Walter and Evelyn Haas Jr. Fund and the William B. Wiener Jr. Foundation. Neither of the study's authors is affiliated with the Los Angeles LGBT Center or SAVE, nor did they receive compensation from them for the research. \\"The bottom line is that this new study shows we have discovered an important, first insight into how to reduce prejudice,\\" said Fleischer.

In December 2014, political scientist Michael LaCour published a paper in which he supposedly evaluated the Los Angeles LGBT Center’s canvassers and found that they strongly and persistently reduced prejudices against same-sex marriage. Five months later, it turned out that his data was fabricated. His paper, exposed as a sham, was swiftly retracted. The scandal was a huge blow to the LGBT Center—but the new study, published in the same journal, offers redemption. Their methods do work. And in an extra twist, the vindicating results come from the same researchers who uncovered LaCour’s fraud: David Broockman from Stanford University, and Joshua Kalla from the University of California, Berkeley. They evaluated the same deep canvassing technique, and found even stronger results. For example, Lacour claimed that the conversations only work if the canvassers are themselves gay; Broockman and Kalla (after, y’know, actually doing some science) found that both transgender and non-transgender canvassers could change minds. “This is something that other practitioners now know with confidence that they can adopt because they know it works,” says Broockman. * * * In November 2008, Californians voted to pass Proposition 8, an amendment that would stop same-sex couples from marrying. It was a huge blow for the LGBT community, not least because all the preceding polling suggested that the proposition would be defeated. “People had really expected to win,” says Dave Fleischer, now director of the Leadership Lab at the L.A. LGBT Center. “In the wake of it, people really wanted to do something, but they didn’t know what.” He decided, simply, to talk to the people who had voted for the proposition. “I felt really smart because it was a great idea,” he tells me. “And I felt like an idiot because I’m 61 and I’ve been on the losing side of many elections, but it had never occurred to me to do this before.” Over the next year and 13,000 conversations, Fleischer’s team of volunteers tried many strategies for swinging conservative voters to their side. Almost all of them failed. “One very popular idea was to tell our own stories; we thought that by itself would be enough,” he recalls. It wasn’t. “But when we tell a story and make ourselves vulnerable, it makes it easier for the voter to decide that we’re not going to judge them. And it makes it easier for us to elicit their story. That turns out to be by far the most important thing we do. Almost everything we do now is in service of getting the voter to honestly relive their experiences, recall it aloud, and reflect on it.” Fleischer was on to something; he knew it. His own internal assessments told him that they were changing opinion, but he didn’t know to what degree, or how long the changes would last. He wanted an independent scientist to evaluate their approach. Enter LaCour. He randomly assigned voters to be canvassed on either gay marriage or recycling, and he was to survey them before and after. But while the canvassers did their thing, LaCour did nothing. And he might have got away with it too, if it weren’t for Broockman and Kalla. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","response":"This article discusses how a 10-minute conversation can help reduce prejudice toward transgender people.

Let me separate the words and provide a clearer and more detailed response to the issue mentioned in the text: \\"RWia450.dll device can't work / No sound: Actually, in most cases, device problems are because of .sys files.\\" The problem described in the revised text appears to be related to the \\"RWia450.dll\\" device not working, which is resulting in no sound. Furthermore, the cause of such issues, as mentioned, is usually due to the .sys files. DLL files, such as RWia450.dll, are system files that contain small programs shared by multiple applications. As for .sys files, they are crucial system files that support the functioning of your Windows operating system. Both of these file types are vital for the smooth operation of your computer software and hardware. If you are experiencing an issue with the RWia450.dll device and no sound, I suggest you try the following solutions to resolve the problem: 1. Update Your Drivers: Drivers facilitate communication between your computer's hardware and software. Outdated or missing drivers might cause DLL or SYS file issues, so ensure that all your device drivers, particularly the sound drivers, are up-to-date. You can update them from the manufacturer's website or by using a third-party tool like \\"Driver Booster.\\" 2. Run Windows System File Checker: The System File Checker (SFC) is an in-built Windows utility that inspects and fixes corrupted or damaged system files. To perform a system file check, open the Command Prompt by typing \\"cmd\\" in the search bar, right-click \\"Command Prompt,\\" and choose \\"Run as administrator.\\" In the Command Prompt, type \\"sfc /scannow\\" (without the quotes), press Enter, and wait for the scan to complete. 3. Re-register the DLL file: If the specific DLL file is causing an issue, you can try re-registering it. Open the Command Prompt as an administrator, and type the command \\"regsvr32 /u RWia450.dll\\" (without the quotes) to unregister the DLL file. Then, input \\"regsvr32 /i RWia450.dll\\" (without the quotes) to re-register it. After executing these commands, restart your computer and check if the issue persists. 4. Repair or Reinstall the Affected Software: If the issue is limited to specific software or applications, try to repair or reinstall them. This process will restore any missing or corrupted DLL and SYS files associated with the software. 5. Perform a System Restore: If the problem started recently, you might want to revert your system to a previous state when everything was working correctly. Utilize the Windows System Restore feature for this purpose, but remember that any recent software installations or changes will be undone. If these solutions do not resolve the issue, you may require advanced troubleshooting or professional assistance. In such cases, consider seeking help from an IT professional or contacting your computer's manufacturer for further support."},{"question":"Which composee was born in Leipzig in 1813 and died in Venice in 1883? What is the answer?","response":"The composer born in Leipzig in 1813 and who passed away in Venice in 1883 was Richard Wagner. He was a highly influential German composer, theatre director, and conductor, best known for his pioneering work in the field of opera. Born into a theatrical family, Richard Wagner had early exposure to dramatic arts and music. He embarked on his musical career by studying composition and conducting in Leipzig. His first opera \\"Die Feen\\" was completed in 1833, but it remained unperformed until after his death. Throughout the mid-19th century, Wagner composed numerous operas, including \\"Rienzi,\\" \\"The Flying Dutchman,\\" \\"Tannhäuser,\\" \\"Lohengrin,\\" and the famous four-opera cycle \\"The Ring of the Nibelung.\\" Wagner was particularly known for his concept of Gesamtkunstwerk (Total Art Work), which aimed to create a unified and comprehensive art form that combined music, drama, and visual arts. In his operas, he sought to blur the lines between traditional aspects, like arias and recitatives, to create a continuous flow of drama and music. This groundbreaking approach later inspired many composers and artists of the 20th century. Wagner's music was groundbreaking in many ways; he expanded harmonic language, introduced chromaticism, and built immense structures with leitmotifs, which are recurring musical themes associated with specific characters, places, or emotions. The leitmotif technique has since been adopted by numerous composers, particularly in the film industry where it is used to connect elements of stories and emotions to the audience. In addition to his artistic accomplishments, Wagner often faced controversies for his political views and personal life. His essays contained anti-Semitic views, which later were adopted by the Nazis, significantly damaging his posthumous reputation. Moreover, several tumultuous relationships and affairs marred his personal life, including his long-standing affair with Cosima von Bülow, the wife of conductor Hans von Bülow, whom Wagner later married. Richard Wagner eventually settled in Bayreuth and went on to establish the Bayreuth Festival, a music festival that still exists today. It was there that he premiered his final and famed opera, \\"Parsifal,\\" in 1882. Wagner's influences can be felt throughout the music world, and his work continues to be celebrated for its dramatic depth and innovations."},{"question":"I heard that Casey soaked their hair around Carson and made sure it looked good to go out with. And I was wondering How would Carson feel as a result? Answer:","response":"As an AI, I cannot directly assess the feelings of a specific individual like Carson. However, taking a general perspective, if Casey made sure that Carson's hair looked good before going out, Carson might experience various emotions. These might include gratitude, happiness, and an increased sense of self-confidence. Carson could appreciate Casey's effort to help them look their best, which might strengthen their bond and trust with Casey. Additionally, Carson might feel more self-assured and comfortable while going out, as they would know that they present themselves well. However, the response of each individual can vary, and some people might not feel comfortable receiving help on personal matters like grooming or styling. In that case, Carson could potentially feel embarrassed or intruded upon. Ultimately, the specific emotions experienced by Carson would depend on factors such as their personal preferences, the nature of their relationship with Casey, and their individual perspective on receiving help in such situations."},{"question":"Q: What are the building blocks of life?

'' he nodded and gulped . \`\` that was the night i turned to","response":"Samuel for solace and understanding. You see, after our argument, I felt so lost and hurt, and I couldn't bear the thought of not having someone in my life to support me and help me navigate my feelings. I couldn't shake the image of you with that Englisch girl, and it made me question everything I thought I knew about us – about our love and our future together. Samuel, on the other hand, was always there for me, even before that fateful night. He was a constant source of comfort, understanding, and guidance whenever I struggled with something, be it a personal or a community issue. He seemed to possess a wisdom beyond his years, which is something I always admired about him. So, in that moment of weakness and confusion, I reached out to him, hoping that he could help me find clarity and solace once more. As I confided in Samuel about my fears, doubts, and emotions, I began to find that he provided not only a listening ear but also wise counsel and advice. His words seemed to resonate with me on a deep level, helping me to confront the insecurities that had plagued my mind since that night. Over time, we grew closer and our bond strengthened, and I found myself relying on him for emotional support more and more. However, as the days turned into weeks, I realized that my feelings for you never really went away. In fact, they only intensified, making it all the more painful whenever I thought about the possibility that you might not feel the same way about me anymore. I couldn't bear to imagine a future without you, but at the same time, I couldn't seem to let go of Samuel either. He had become such an important part of my life, and I found myself torn between the love I had for you and the comfort I derived from my friendship with Samuel. Eventually, I realized that I had to confront my feelings head-on and determine where my true loyalties and affections lay. It was a painstaking process, filled with moments of introspection, soul-searching, and brutal honesty with myself. The more I reflected on the situation, the more I understood that my heart belonged to you, and that whatever I felt for Samuel was merely a byproduct of the vulnerability and confusion I had experienced in the aftermath of that terrible night. In the end, it became clear to me that I needed to let go of Samuel and focus on rebuilding our love and trust. My relationship with him had served its purpose, helping me to grow and learn as a person, but the time had come for me to set that chapter of my life aside and move forward with you. I hope you can understand why I turned to him in the first place and that you can find it in your heart to forgive me for my actions.

Understand the meaning behind both statements. 2. Compare the statements based on their meaning and grammar. 3. Determine if the hypothesis can be concluded from the premise. Step 1: Understand the meaning behind both statements. - The premise, \\"Warn't no Apaches, that's for certain.\\" is a colloquial way of saying that there were no Apaches present, and it is certain. - The hypothesis, \\"It wasn't the Apaches, certainly.\\" asserts that the Apaches were not responsible, and this claim is made with certainty. Step 2: Compare the statements based on their meaning and grammar. - Both statements convey a sense of certainty and are associated with the absence of Apaches. - The premise focuses on the lack of Apaches being present, while the hypothesis primarily refers to the Apaches not being responsible for an unspecified action or event. Step 3: Determine if the hypothesis can be concluded from the premise. - While both statements involve the absence of Apaches and a sense of certainty, they are referring to slightly different aspects (presence vs. responsibility). - It can be reasoned that if there were no Apaches present, they could not be responsible for the action or event, leading to the conclusion that \\"It wasn't the Apaches, certainly.\\" is true.

Fifteen years ago, a cruise named Yashiromaru, built by the Yashiro group, sank while sailing. In the present, a new cruise, the Saint Aphrodite, was built by the Yashiro group and Conan and the rest were invited through Sonoko. Earlier, the husband of the CEO of the Yashiro family group, an established ship architect, had a heart-attack and drove his car down a cliff. On the second day of the cruise, the CEO herself was found murdered in her room. Later, her father, the President of the Yashiro group was also found missing. He had been thrown off the cruise into the ocean, seemingly by the same person. At the welcoming party, Kogorou shows off his deduction skills, and concluded that the sub-designer of the cruise, Akiyoshi, was the murderer. However, Conan has different ideas. Kusaka, a scriptwriter who worked in co-operation with Akiyoshi on a script, was the culprit. Kusaka reveals that the accident from 15 years ago was a scheme to sink the ship deliberately to get insurance. His father was murdered when he discovered the captain of the ship was drugged and left to die. Kusaka immediately set off bombs and escaped by sea and the Detective Boys gave chase. After they successfully took down the criminal, more bombs were ignited.

The premise highlights two specific areas where best practices can be applied: improving communications with management and using external advisors. Now, let us analyze the hypothesis: \\"Using external advisors is a best practice that is seldom utilized.\\" This statement suggests that incorporating external advisors is an effective strategy for boards, but it is not frequently implemented. To determine whether this hypothesis is entailed by the premise, we can examine the available evidence and logical reasoning behind both statements. 1. Recognition of value in best practices: The premise suggests that there is a clear understanding of the need for best practices to improve various aspects of board operations. This includes using external advisors as a means to optimize decision-making and resource allocation. Since the premise acknowledges the value of external advisors, it seems reasonable to assume that the hypothesis could be true, given that best practices center around proven methodologies for improving effectiveness. 2. External advisors leading to improved board operations: The premise implies that using external advisors as a best practice has a positive impact on board operations. In this context, external advisors can offer valuable advice, insights, or complementary skill sets that may not be available within the board's internal team members. Their specialized knowledge and expertise can help boards navigate through complex challenges, regulatory frameworks, and industry trends, resulting in more informed decision-making and better outcomes. 3. Seldom utilization of external advisors: The hypothesis suggests that despite the evident value of external advisors, most boards do not use them. There could be several reasons behind this, such as boards' unawareness of the benefits, a reluctance to share confidential information with external parties, concerns about additional costs, or a belief that internal resources are sufficient for meeting the board's needs. Based on the link between the premise and hypothesis, it appears that the hypothesis might be entailed by the premise, although it is not explicitly stated. While the premise acknowledges the value of using external advisors as a part of board best practices, the hypothesis points out that this particular practice is not frequently employed. Consequently, it serves as a critical observation of the current state of board operations and highlights a potential area for improvement. In conclusion, the hypothesis \\"Using external advisors is a best practice that is seldom utilized\\" can be seen as a logical extension of the premise provided. However, it is essential to note that the definitive accuracy of the hypothesis would depend on empirical evidence and real-world examples of board operations to confirm or refute the claim of external advisors being seldom utilized. So, while the hypothesis appears to be entailed by the premise, further research and data analysis would be necessary to substantiate this claim."},{"question":"Question: What name, also given to the space capsules used, was given to the US space programme that ran from 1959 to 1963 with the aim of putting a man in orbit?

The East Wenatchee City Council has entered into an Interlocal Agreement with the Wenatchee Housing Authority authorizing the Authority to purchase and maintain the Mobile Park Plaza mobile home park. Located just north of the Wenatchee Valley Mall, the park had been threatened with closure for more than a year. \\"We cannot say enough about how relieved we are that this is over,\\" said Manuel Luna, one of the residents of Mobile Park Plaza. \\"We were afraid that no solution would be found, and that our families would have no place to go. We are very grateful for the help of our attorneys. Without them, we would not have saved our homes. We are also thankful for the help of the Housing Authority, the City Council and Mayor Steve Lacy.\\" Formerly owned by local businessman Dan Jennings, Mobile Park Plaza had been home to 45 low-income families, many of them Latino farm workers. In October 2000 Jennings gave the park residents notice of his intent to close the park effective November 30, 2001. While some park residents decided to move, others, including 25 families, organized an informal association to relocate or save their homes. Unable to afford private legal counsel, the families asked for help from legal services attorneys at the Northwest Justice Project and Columbia Legal Services. In the succeeding months, these attorneys worked with representatives of the Greater Wenatchee Housing Authority, the state Office of Community Development, Chelan County, the City of East Wenatchee, state legislators, Jennings and others to secure funding and find a solution. \\"There seemed to be a never-ending set of obstacles,\\" said Patrick Pleas, an attorney with Northwest Justice Project. \\"Mr. Jennings had financial considerations, the City had growth and economic development considerations, and the State and Housing Authority had their own concerns.

I will review the film \\"The Shawshank Redemption.\\" Step 2: Introduce the movie and its context Begin the review by introducing the movie, its director, main cast, and a brief summary of the film's plot. This will provide readers with a clear context for the review. Review Introduction: The Shawshank Redemption, directed by Frank Darabont, is an inspiring and heartwarming tale of friendship, hope, and redemption. Released in 1994, the film stars Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne, a banker who is sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary for the murder of his wife and her lover, and Morgan Freeman as Ellis \\"Red\\" Redding, an inmate who befriends Andy and helps him navigate prison life. Adapted from Stephen King's novella \\"Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption,\\" the movie explores the theme of finding beauty and meaning in the most unlikely circumstances. Step 3: Discuss and praise the film's performances Highlight the performances of the main actors and the emotional depth they bring to their characters. Review Body (Performances): Tim Robbins delivers a masterful performance as Andy Dufresne, capturing the essence of a man grappling with the unfairness of his situation while remaining resolute and determined. Robbins portrays Andy's intelligence and resourcefulness with subtlety, allowing the character's actions to speak louder than words. Morgan Freeman's portrayal of Red is equally remarkable, providing a grounded, wise, and empathetic anchor to sustain the movie's emotional core. The chemistry between Robbins and Freeman is undeniable, and their authentic bond serves as the foundation for this powerful story. Step 4: Comment on the film's direction, writing, and cinematography Discuss the filmmaker's craft, the work of the screenwriter, and the visual appeal of the movie. Review Body (Direction, Writing, and Cinematography): Frank Darabont's direction does an exceptional job of bringing Stephen King's novella to life. His storytelling blends moments of intense drama with enough levity to allow audiences to breathe and balance their emotions. The dialogue in the film, written by Darabont himself, complements the visual storytelling with precision, ensuring that every spoken word carries weight and furthers the plot. Cinematographically, the movie is striking; the use of lighting, shadows, and color tinges conveys the oppressive nature of prison life, while still managing to find moments of beauty and hope in the darkness. Step 5: Discuss the film's themes and messages Elaborate on the broader messages of the film and how they resonate with audiences. Review Body (Themes and Messages): The Shawshank Redemption skillfully explores themes of friendship, hope, and redemption.

One box of pizza is worth 14, and a can of soda is worth 1.80. Hubert orders eight boxes of pizza and ten cans of soda. Ian buys ten boxes of pizza and fifteen cans of soda. How much do they spend in all? Your thoughts:","response":"To find out how much Hubert and Ian spend in all, we will first calculate the total cost for Hubert's and Ian's individual orders, and then sum them up. 1. Calculate the total cost for Hubert's order: - Hubert orders eight boxes of pizza at 14 each: 8 * 14 = 112 - Hubert orders ten cans of soda at 1.80 each: 10 * 1.80 = 18 - The total cost for Hubert's order is: 112 (for pizza) + 18 (for soda) = 130 2. Calculate the total cost for Ian's order: - Ian orders ten boxes of pizza at 14 each: 10 * 14 = 140 - Ian orders fifteen cans of soda at 1.80 each: 15 * 1.80 = 27 - The total cost for Ian's order is: 140 (for pizza) + 27 (for soda) = 167 3. Add the total cost of Hubert's and Ian's orders: - The total amount they spend is: 130 (Hubert's order) + 167 (Ian's order) = 297 So, Hubert and Ian spend a total of 297 for their pizza party."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: You will be given a summary of a story. You need to create a question that can be answered from the story.

As the stories are sometimes movie plots, they will contain actor names in parentheses. You should not use those names. Only use character names. Try to ask a question about all parts of the plot, not just the beginning. Problem: Although originally conceived as an extended puff for Harper artists, who were also personal friends, the book presents some general ideas about the relation between author and illustration, picture and text, as well as the advancing technology of illustration. Both in print and in the theater, James welcomes advances in the technology of realism, but complains if the visual dominates author and actor. He praises the black-and-white engravings of the illustrators for their tact and their illumination of settings, but criticizes elaborate modern stage scenery that overwhelms the actor's art. These essays, although slight, are illustrated with drawings of each other by the artist subjects, and is itself an example of what James extols, as well as being a rare extended essay by James on the unity of the arts. The illustrators of whom he wrote were an Anglo-American group, all personal friends, at a time when Harper was his principal publisher. They were known in the day for their summer gatherings at the village of Broadway in the Cotswolds, where for several years James joined them, and where Sargent gained his first footing among British artists. Among the artists in the group, Charles Reinhart illustrated some of James' own fiction, Alfred Parsons designed James's gardens at Lamb House, and the sets for James' play Guy Domville whose first, raucous performance he attended. Edwin Abbey and Sargent later collaborated on the enormous wall paintings for the Boston Public Library, and were among the leading artists of their day. James' treatment of his friend Honore de Daumier was a welcome effort on behalf of an artist many considered little more than a political cartoonist. James found an \\"impressive depth\\" in Daumier's portrayal of the peculiar and the (sometimes) ugly. Many of Daumier's subjects are now remembered only in his often slashing work, but that's appropriate because all art \\"prolongs...preserves...consecrates...raises from the dead.\\" In his essay on his prot g John Singer Sargent, James marvels at the painter's complete knowledge of his art and his unfailing technical proficiency. James particularly admires Sargent's portraits of women, such as Miss Burckhardt (not identified by name but illustrated in the magazine text of the article) and Madame X (called Madame G in the essay). \\"There is no greater work of art than a great portrait,\\" James concludes, and Sargent's portraits combine \\"quick perception\\" and \\"lingering reflection.\\" The essays on Daumier and Sargent have frequently been reprinted, but the book as a whole has been out of print since its first edition, in part because the black-and-white engravings that are its principal subject were so soon to be displaced by photographs and colored illustrations.

The statement provided clearly indicates that the speaker is acknowledging a significant passage of time since they last actively used a club for a specific purpose. Although they are not entirely precise in expressing the exact duration, the phrase \\"almost a year\\" still affirms that it has been close to a year since their last engagement with a club. The small hesitation expressed with \\"I guess\\" suggests that the person might be uncertain about the exact time frame, but the general idea remains the same; it has been an extended period since they last used a club.

It comprises the following five dimensions: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. Each dimension represents a continuum along which individuals can be placed based on their traits and characteristics. Drinking motives can indeed be associated with various aspects of an individual's personality, and personality traits can play a significant role in influencing drinking behaviors. It has been established through research that there are links between four of the five dimensions of the FFM and drinking motives: 1. Conscientiousness - Individuals with lower conscientiousness tend to exhibit a lack of self-discipline and are more prone to engage in risky behaviors, including problematic drinking or drinking due to various motives. 2. Extraversion - Highly extraverted individuals are more likely to engage in drinking for social motives, as they usually enjoy being around others, attending parties, and experiencing excitement. 3. Agreeableness - People with lower levels of agreeableness may drink to cope with difficult emotions or interpersonal conflicts, while highly agreeable individuals are less likely to use alcohol for such purposes. 4. Neuroticism - Those with higher levels of neuroticism may engage in drinking as a way of coping with anxiety, stress, or negative emotions, making them more susceptible to problematic drinking patterns. However, as stated in the initial quote, \\"Openness\\" is the only dimension of the Five-Factor Model that has not been found to demonstrate a significant association with drinking motives. Openness is characterized by an individual's willingness to experience new things, curiosity, and imagination.

Since the question does not provide any specific names to compare, I will select two well-known, retired quarterbacks who have had successful careers in the NFL to use in this article: Peyton Manning and Brett Favre. Step 2: Research and gather statistics on both quarterbacks Next, I need to research and gather the career passing yards statistics for Peyton Manning and Brett Favre from reliable sources like the NFL website or sports-specific media outlets like ESPN or Pro Football Reference. Upon research, I find out the following statistics: Peyton Manning's career passing yards: 71,940 Brett Favre's career passing yards: 71,838 Step 3: Analyze the data With the statistics in hand, I can determine which quarterback threw for more yards by comparing the two numbers directly. Step 4: Write the article, focusing on presenting the statistics and drawing a conclusion Title: Peyton Manning vs. Brett Favre: Who Threw for More Yards? Introduction: In the world of American football, Peyton Manning and Brett Favre are undoubtedly two of the most iconic and accomplished quarterbacks in the history of the game. With storied careers spanning a combined 38 years in the NFL, these two legends have staked their claims as some of the greatest to ever play the position. One question that often arises when comparing Manning and Favre is, \\"Which quarterback threw for more yards?\\" In this article, we will delve into the numbers and determine the answer to this question. Statistical Comparison: Firstly, let's examine each quarterback's career passing yardage. Peyton Manning, known for his sharp mind and pinpoint accuracy, spent 18 seasons in the NFL playing for the Indianapolis Colts (1998-2010) and the Denver Broncos (2012-2015). Over his illustrious career, Manning amassed a phenomenal 71,940 passing yards. Brett Favre, on the other hand, is remembered for his incredible durability and gunslinger mentality. Favre played in the NFL for an impressive 20 seasons, with his primary tenure as the Green Bay Packers' quarterback (1992-2007) before moving to the New York Jets (2008) and ultimately the Minnesota Vikings (2009-2010). Favre's career passing yards totaled an incredible 71,838. The Verdict: As we compare the passing yardage for both NFL legends, one can see how close the numbers are, with a mere difference of 102 yards. However, when answering the question, \\"Which quarterback threw for more yards?\\" the conclusion is clear: Peyton Manning edges out Brett Favre with 71,940 career passing yards as compared to Favre's 71,838. It's important to note that while Manning holds this distinction, both quarterbacks have left an indelible mark on the sport of American football and remain two of the greatest to ever play the game. After all, statistics only paint a part of the picture, and both players have left behind legacies that go beyond the sheer numbers."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: You are given an open-domain question from an open movie database.

A Sunday Times poll by YouGov suggests 66% of the public trust the police, down from 71% in August. 'Apology' The figures come after several controversies involving police over the last few years. In August the Metropolitan Police apologised to the family of Ian Tomlinson over his death at the G20 protests in London in 2009, with one officer using \\"excessive\\" force. Last year David Cameron apologised for a police cover-up over the Hillsborough disaster, in which 96 football fans died in 1989. And, on Wednesday, the chief constables of West Mercia, Warwickshire and West Midlands Police are due to appear before the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee to explain the handling of a meeting between officers and former government Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell. The MP resigned after he was accused of calling Downing Street police \\"plebs\\" when they prevented him from riding a bicycle through gates leading into Whitehall in September last year. The meeting with officers, working as representatives of the Police Federation, was held during the weeks following the claims. A transcript of a recording Mr Mitchell made shows that, while he admitted swearing, he denied using the word \\"pleb\\" or insulting the police. But, after the meeting, three senior police officers said he had refused to elaborate on what had happened and should quit, which he later did.

So, when facing that challenge, it is important to know how to reach your weight-loss goal. Of course, you have to decide you want to lose weight and be committed to doing so; then, you must stick to your guns and stay motivated or the goal will never be realized. There is no magic bullet, but there are two important tips that can help you reach your weight-loss goal. #1 – Take It a Week at a Time You must break your ultimate goal into smaller chunks and have bench marks that will indicate you are moving in the right direction. According to the Mayo Clinic, “Over the long term, it’s best to aim for losing 1 to 2 pounds (0.5 to 1 kilogram) a week.” When you have a realistic weekly weight-loss target, you will be more confident in your efforts and you will know exactly what you are going to measure at the end of each week. Your long-term goal may be 40 pounds, but take it “one week at a time” (1 to 2 pounds/week = 20 to 30 weeks) In addition to choosing a healthy diet that fits your lifestyle and current health conditions, plus a solid commitment to stay with it, don’t forget to get plenty of rest and exercise. . BUT . . . the primary target should be the number of pounds you plan to lose each week. That target should be clear – and realistic. If it is, you should be able to stick to your weight loss program and enjoy success week after week, after week. AND, feel good in the process. If you are not hitting your target, be willing to look closely at what you are doing, or not doing – and figure out why you are not reaching your weekly target. Maybe the target you set was not sensible or reasonable; or, maybe you are putting too much pressure on yourself. Honest introspection is a good way to see what you are really capable of doing and then, you can develop or choose a plan that is suitable for your unique lifestyle. According to the above context, answer the following question. After each week you should probably Answer:","response":"After each week, you should probably evaluate your progress towards your weekly weight loss target of 1 to 2 pounds (0.5 to 1 kilogram). Assess whether you have achieved your goal, and if not, consider why that might be and make any necessary adjustments to your diet and exercise routine. Reflect on your overall commitment and motivation, and ensure that your weekly target remains realistic and achievable. Celebrate your successes, learn from your setbacks, and maintain a positive attitude throughout your weight loss journey. Remember to prioritize healthy eating, exercise, and sufficient rest as you continue to take it one week at a time."},{"question":"Answer the following question: The answer to the question: Where were infant mortality rates as high as 80 percent during the late 19th century? is inside the article: In 1898 and again in 1899 Norman Heathcote visited the islands and wrote a book about his experiences. During the 19th century, steamers had begun to visit Hirta, enabling the islanders to earn money from the sale of tweeds and birds' eggs but at the expense of their self-esteem as the tourists regarded them as curiosities. It is also clear that the St Kildans were not so naïve as they sometimes appeared. \\"For example, when they boarded a yacht they would pretend they thought all the polished brass was gold, and that the owner must be enormously wealthy\\". The boats brought other previously unknown diseases, especially tetanus infantum, which resulted in infant mortality rates as high as 80 percent during the late 19th century. The cnatan na gall or boat-cough, an illness that struck after the arrival of a ship off Hirta, became a regular feature of life.By the early 20th century, formal schooling had again become a feature of the islands, and in 1906 the church was extended to make a schoolhouse. The children all now learned English and their native Scottish Gaelic. Improved midwifery skills, denied to the island by John Mackay, reduced the problems of childhood tetanus. From the 1880s, trawlers fishing the north Atlantic made regular visits, bringing additional trade. Talk of an evacuation occurred in 1875 during MacKay's time as minister, but despite occasional food shortages and a flu epidemic in 1913, the population was stable at between 75 and 80, and no obvious sign existed that within a few years the millennia-old occupation of the island was to end., can you guess it ?

Answer:","response":"The name of the ship of Captain Horatio Pugwash, the main character in the British children's animated television series \\"Captain Pugwash,\\" which first aired in 1957 and became popular in the 1960s, is called The Black Pig. The show was created by British cartoonist John Ryan, who was responsible for both the original illustrations and stories featured in the series. The Black Pig was a fictional pirate ship that was captained by the bumbling, yet endearing, Captain Pugwash. Sailing the high seas alongside his motley crew of misfits, Captain Pugwash embarked on various comical and exciting adventures while thwarting the plans of their enemies, particularly the eponymous Captain's arch-nemesis, Cut-Throat Jake. The crew members onboard The Black Pig included the intelligent and resourceful cabin boy Tom, the ship's cook Barnabas, helmsman Willy, the rotund and jolly shipmate Master Mate, and sometimes other characters who joined the crew on various escapades. Often, it was Tom's quick thinking and clever plans that saved the crew from peril, while Captain Pugwash took all the credit, blissfully unaware of his own incompetence. The Black Pig itself was designed with a traditional galleon-style appearance, complete with multiple masts and sails, and adorned with various pirate-themed elements such as the Jolly Roger flag and a painted skull and crossbones on its hull. The ship's layout included a captain's cabin, crew quarters, a galley for cooking, and a cargo hold for storing treasures and other items collected during the crew's adventures. The \\"Captain Pugwash\\" series was popular among children for its humorous storylines, colorful animation, and the memorable characters that inhabited its fictional universe. Although the show received some criticism due to its simplistic animation style and reliance on limited, pre-recorded cutout animations for the characters and sequences, it still remains a fond memory for many who grew up watching the program. In conclusion, the ship of 1960s UK TV cartoon pirate Captain Pugwash is named The Black Pig. This distinctive vessel was central to the adventures and escapades of the unforgettable crew, led by the hapless Captain Pugwash, as they navigated the high seas and encountered countless obstacles, adversaries, and humorous situations along the way."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Pacita Abad (September 5 1946 – December 7 2004) was born in Basco Batanes a small island in the northernmost part of the Philippines between Luzon and Taiwan.

Choices: - dirt - seeds - south africa - park - paradise The rationale to choose \\"dirt\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","response":"An apple tree, like any other plant, requires specific conditions and elements for it to grow and thrive. Although all of the given choices may have some connection to the growth of an apple tree, the most appropriate answer among these options is \\"dirt.\\" The rationale for choosing \\"dirt\\" as the answer lies in understanding the fundamental requirements for the growth of an apple tree. These requirements can be summarized as follows: 1. Soil (dirt): Healthy, well-draining soil is critical for the proper growth of an apple tree. Soil provides the necessary nutrients, minerals, and a stable base for the tree to establish a strong root system. Dirt acts as a medium for holding water and nutrients that the tree needs to grow. Soil also harbors essential microorganisms that help break down organic matter and convert it into nutrients that the tree can absorb. Different apple varieties may prefer specific soil compositions, but in general, apple trees grow well in loamy, fertile soil with a pH between 6.0 and 7.0. So, dirt is an essential component for the growth of an apple tree. 2. Seeds: Apple trees, of course, begin from seeds, which can be found inside the apple fruit itself. By planting an apple seed in the soil, a new tree can be grown. However, apple trees propagated from seeds take longer to produce fruit (up to ten years), and the resulting tree may not bear the same fruit characteristics as the parent tree due to genetic variations. Many apple trees are grown through grafting to ensure the desired fruit quality and to shorten the time to fruit-bearing. While seeds are essential for starting an apple tree, the mentioned \\"dirt\\" is a more fundamental requirement for the actual growth of any tree. 3. South Africa: This choice has a connection to apple tree growth as South Africa is a country known for its apple production. However, the geographic location does not directly correspond to an essential element required for the growth of an apple tree. Though apple trees may thrive in South Africa's climate, apple trees can be grown in many other parts of the world, under different conditions. 4. Park: A park can be a location where one might find an apple tree, especially if the park is designed to accommodate fruit trees. However, this choice is not crucial for the growth of an apple tree, as they can grow in various places, including home gardens, orchards, or even pots (for some dwarf varieties). 5. Paradise: This choice, in itself, does not pertain to the growth of an apple tree. Paradise, as a metaphor for favorable conditions, could mean that an apple tree needs good environmental conditions (such as adequate sunlight, temperature, and water) to grow. However, this term does not directly describe a fundamental requirement for an apple tree's growth. In conclusion, the rationale for selecting \\"dirt\\" as the answer lies in understanding the essential role it plays in providing a stable base, nutrients, minerals, and essential microorganisms required for an apple tree's growth. The other choices have connections to apple trees but do not directly encompass the basic requirements for an apple tree to grow and thrive."},{"question":"Based on the premise \\"Here was another page from the history books.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"The book was old.\\" is true (see options)?

Here are possible answers to this question: - new york - whorehouse - street corner - corner of two streets - brother I believe the correct choice is \\"whorehouse\\", here's why: Answer:","response":"While it is true that professional prostitutes may be found in various locations, the most likely place to find them would be at a brothel or a \\"whorehouse\\" as it is commonly referred to. Although some of the other choices mentioned, such as street corners, might also be correct to some extent, the reasons supporting \\"whorehouse\\" as the best answer are much stronger. Firstly, a brothel or whorehouse is an establishment specifically dedicated to providing services of a sexual nature, and this is where professional prostitutes are likely to be employed. These establishments are often situated in areas where sex work is legal or the laws are more relaxed, ensuring that both the workers and the clients can engage in the exchange more safely and securely. In contrast, street corners or the corners of two streets are not specifically intended for this purpose, and although there might be some sex workers who solicit clients in these areas, they usually fall into a category called \\"street prostitution.\\" This form of sex work is often more dangerous, less regulated, and not as well-regulated as brothel-based prostitution. As a result, the probability of finding professional prostitutes in these locations is comparatively lower. Moreover, in places like New York, you may find professional prostitutes working in brothels or escort agencies, which provide more safety, security, and overall structure for both the workers and clients. These environments facilitate a more controlled and safer environment for sex work, ensuring that the professionals working there can focus on providing their services without the fear of legal repercussions, violence, or exploitation. It's important to highlight that street-based prostitution may put sex workers at greater risk and are often more vulnerable to abuse, health risks, and legal consequences. Due to the various physical and emotional dangers posed by street-based sex work, many professionals may avoid such locations. Finally, using a term like \\"brothel\\" (instead of \\"whorehouse\\") would be more appropriate, respectful, and accurate when referring to a location where professional prostitutes work. The choice of words matters as it can contribute to the ongoing stigma and discrimination faced by sex workers. In conclusion, the most likely place to find professional prostitutes would be a brothel (or a \\"whorehouse\\") because it provides a safer, more controlled, and regulated environment for sex work when compared to locations like street corners. The primary goal of a professional prostitute is to engage in the exchange of sexual services in a secure and reliable setting, and establishments like brothels or escort agencies are designed specifically for this purpose."},{"question":"Here is a news article: Getty Images Former Lions offensive tackle and current ESPN analyst Lomas Brown made a startling confession in a radio interview on Friday: Brown said that he once purposely missed a block because he wanted the man he was supposed to block, Packers defensive end Sean Jones, to injure Lions quarterback Scott Mitchell. In an interview on ESPN Radio, Brown said that in a 1994 game, he purposely whiffed on Jones so that Jones could get a clean shot on Mitchell. Sure enough, Brown got his intended result, as Mitchell was knocked out of the game. “We were playing Green Bay in Milwaukee,” Brown said. “We were getting beat, 24-3, at that time and he just stunk up the place. He’s throwing interceptions, just everything. So I looked at Kevin Glover, our All-Pro center and I said, ‘Glove, that is it.’ I said, ‘I’m getting him out the game.’ . . . So I got the gator arms on the guy at the last minute, he got around me, he hit Scott Mitchell, he did something to his finger . . . and he came out the game. [Lions backup quarterback] Dave Krieg came in the game.” Host Ryen Russillo expressed shock that Brown would admit such a thing, but Brown showed no remorse. “As you can tell, I’m just not a big fan of Scott Mitchell. He’s just not on my Christmas list. He won’t be getting any Christmas presents from me this year,” Brown said. The Detroit Free Press notes that while Brown misremembered some of the details of the game, his basic description of what happened adds up: Jones drilled Mitchell with a hit that broke a finger on Mitchell’s passing hand, and Mitchell was replaced by Krieg. As Brown correctly recalled, Mitchell was having a terrible game, but Krieg played well in relief for the rest of that game and played well for the Lions the rest of the season. Brown seems proud of himself about being the one who caused the team to change quarterbacks, but he shouldn’t be. There’s never an excuse for a football player to step onto the field and not give his best effort, but to fail to give your best effort because you want one of your teammates to get injured is totally unacceptable. For Brown to laugh about it all these years later, as if he’s glad that his actions caused a teammate to suffer an injury, is disgraceful. And for Brown, who is suing the NFL because he says the NFL didn’t do enough to protect players from concussions, to celebrate the fact that he once stood by and allowed an opponent to take an injury-causing free shot at a teammate, is pitiful. ||||| The NFL is facing a seemingly endless stream of lawsuits from former players over safety and concussions, a considerable challenge for the league and its lawyers. Last week, however, the league did catch one break from a potential plaintiff that it might not mind cross-examining on a witness stand. Of all the questions that former Detroit Lion Lomas Brown is facing in the wake of admitting he once allowed an opponent to get a free shot on his own quarterback, Scott Mitchell, in the hope Mitchell would be injured, this might be the most uncomfortable: How does a player who admits he blatantly attempted to put his own teammate's health at risk continue to sue the NFL for putting its players' health at risk? Brown and his wife, Wendy, are part of a group that sued the NFL in April 2012 in Georgia state court seeking compensatory and punitive damages for \\"the NFL's failure to face the truth\\" about concussions and the violent nature of football. [Other NFL: More than playoff spot at stake for RG3? ] \\"This action seeks compensatory damages from the NFL to compensate Plaintiffs for their injuries; punitive damages to punish the NFL for its willful misconduct; and equitable relief for the detection and treatment of latent injuries,\\" the suit, filed in Fulton County demands. The complaint is a 48-page firebomb of direct accusations and attacks that assail the NFL for its wanton disregard for the health and safety of its players and its promotion of violence. It even cited the New Orleans Saints bounty scandal, including comments from former defensive coordinator Gregg Williams to show the league's opinion on player safety. \\"Williams deliberately encouraged his players to injure the 49ers,\\" the lawsuit rails. Of course, Brown didn't admit he deliberately allowed an opponent to run past him and potentially get a free hit on another player. \\"This gladiator mentality may have allowed the NFL to generate enormous profits, but it has left its players with serious life-altering injuries, including various degrees of brain damage,\\" the suit reads. Brown's attorney, Von DuMont, a partner with the Bondurant, Mixson and Elmore law firm that brought the lawsuit, did not respond to requests for comment Wednesday. [Yahoo! Sports Radio: Jason Cole on Giants' demise] * More View photos The issues that Brown raises in the lawsuit are legitimate and common – he is one of more than 1,000 players suing the league in various suits over concussion issues. At this point, however, he makes for a lousy plaintiff and, at the very least, the only one who has publicly admitted to sandbagging a blocking assignment in the hopes his quarterback got knocked out of the game. Brown spent 18 years in the NFL as an offensive tackle, including a stint with the Lions from 1985-1995. During the 1994 season, frustrated by the play of Mitchell, the Lions' quarterback, Brown said he decided to do his part to get a switch at signal-caller. \\"We were playing Green Bay in Milwaukee,\\" Brown told ESPN Radio. \\"We were getting beat [24-0] at the time and Mitchell just stunk up the place. He's throwing interceptions, just everything. So I looked at Kevin Glover, our all-pro center, and I said, 'Glove, that is it.' \\"I said, 'I'm getting him out the game.' So I got the gator arms on the guy at the last minute, he got around me, he hit Scott Mitchell, he did something to his finger … and he came out of the game. Dave Krieg came in the game.\\" ||||| Posted by Michael David Smith on December 27, 2012, 11:05 AM EDT Former Lions offensive tackle Lomas Brown, who boasted last week that he intentionally missed a block so teammate Scott Mitchell would get hurt, now says he regrets it. But Brown, who is now an ESPN commentator, didn’t quite come clean. “That was 1994, and I was extremely frustrated with the situation that was going on. And, you know, I didn’t try to get the guy hurt, but that’s what ended up happening,” Brown said on ESPN First Take today. Brown’s claim that “I didn’t try to get the guy hurt” doesn’t make any sense. He explicitly stated in a radio appearance last week that he purposely missed a block because he wanted Mitchell to suffer an injury, that he told a teammate that’s what he was doing, and that he was glad when Mitchell did, in fact, leave the game with an injury. Brown then boasted about the fact that backup quarterback Dave Krieg came in and played much better than Mitchell had, as if Brown deserved credit for forcing the Lions to make the switch. Brown’s claim also doesn’t make sense because in the next breath he expressed regret for what he did. “Do I regret it happened? Yeah, I regret it happened. Did I regret it happened then? No, I didn’t regret it then,” Brown said, later adding that he estimates he played 18,000 plays in his football career and, “It’s one play out of the 18,000 that I regret.” So Brown does regret what he did, and is acknowledging that he did it, even after he said he wasn’t trying to get Mitchell hurt. Mitchell said on Wednesday that he was stunned by Brown’s comments, noting that Brown had been a guest in his home and had always acted to his face like they were friends. Brown acknowledged being friendly with Mitchell. “Yeah, Scott did have us over to the house and everything, and I felt that I was a good teammate to Scott,” Brown said. “I expected Scott to react that way. That’s the way he should have reacted. I don’t blame him for reacting that way. But Scott knows a lot of things that went on, too, in Detroit. So I don’t know what I can say now. I’ve already said it, it’s out there. And like I said I expected him to react in that way. I probably, if the shoe had been on the other foot, I probably would have reacted that way too. No, not probably. I would have reacted that way — probably a little worse than that. So I don’t blame Scott, and hopefully we’ll talk about it.” Well, it’s good to know that Brown doesn’t blame Mitchell for Brown intentionally letting Mitchell get hurt. Brown also said that he wishes he had expressed himself differently on his radio appearance last week and not come across like he was bragging about letting Mitchell get hurt. “I should have been more tactful about how I said that,” Brown said. “It came off boastful. And I shouldn’t have said it that way. I said it, I can’t take it back, but I shouldn’t have said it the way I said it.” After those comments, First Take host Cari Champion closed the segment by telling Brown, “Well done, big fella.” Brown’s ESPN co-workers might be willing to let him off easy, but the rest of us don’t have to. What Brown did to Mitchell was despicable, and Brown has permanently damaged his reputation. ||||| Former Detroit Lions offensive lineman Lomas Brown has apologized for recent comments he made about Scott Mitchell, claiming he regrets intentionally missing a block decades ago that resulted in the quarterback suffering an injury. Brown, currently an NFL analyst for ESPN, admitted during a radio interview this past Friday that he allowed a defender to hit Mitchell because he was frustrated with the struggling quarterback when the two were Lions teammates in 1994. \\"We were playing Green Bay in Milwaukee,\\" Brown said on ESPN Radio's \\"SVP & Russillo\\" show. \\"We were getting beat 24-3 at the time, and (Mitchell) just stunk up the place, throwing interceptions, just everything.

He did something to his finger. I don't know what he did to it, but he came out of the game. Dave Krieg came into the game. We ended up losing that game 27-24.\\" Six days after the interview, Brown addressed his comments Thursday on ESPN's \\"First Take,\\" emphasizing that missing the block was an act of frustration. \\"I regret it happened,\\" Brown said. \\"Did I regret it happened then? No, I didn't regret it happened then. \\"For my 18-year career, they say you average probably about 1,000 plays or so per (season). So I know I've played well over 18,000 plays, excluding practice, in this league. It's one play out of the 18,000 that I regret.\\" Mitchell also has responded publicly since Brown's initial interview, expressing anger and astonishment at his former teammate's admission. \\"I was floored by that revelation,\\" Mitchell recently told USA Today Sports. \\"I had Lomas in my home. I fed him dinner. I gave him and other offensive linemen gifts. I'm dumbfounded that he would do such a thing. I mean, people get hurt playing this game. People have died playing football, and for him to allow someone to take a shot at a teammate, that's crazy.\\" Brown spent the first 11 seasons of his career with the Lions, starting in 163 games for Detroit from 1985 to 1995. The play Brown referred to occurred Nov. 6, 1994, during Mitchell's first season with the Lions. Mitchell suffered a broken finger on his passing hand when Packers defensive end Sean Jones hit him on the play. The Lions fell to 4-5 with the loss to the Packers that day but won five of their final seven games to make the playoffs. \\"That was 1994, and I was extremely frustrated with the situation that was going on,\\" Brown said Thursday. \\"I didn't try to get the guy hurt, but that's what ended up happening.\\" But Mitchell, who missed the rest of the 1994 season due to the injury, has publicly criticized Brown. \\"That was my first year in Detroit, so Lomas barely knew me,\\" Mitchell told USA Today. \\"If he had a problem with me, he could have come to me, man to man, and said so. ... To mess with someone's livelihood like that, to mess with their family and their health, that's reprehensible.\\" Mitchell also made similar comments during a recent interview on \\"The Dan Patrick Show\\" and has asserted that he doesn't intend to contact Brown to discuss the incident. But Brown stated Thursday that he plans to reach out to Mitchell. \\"I expected Scott to react that way,\\" Brown said. \\"That's the way he should have reacted. I don't blame him for reacting that way. But Scott knows a lot of things that went on, too, in Detroit. ... If the shoe had been on the other foot, I probably would have reacted that way, too. I know I would have reacted that way, probably a little worse than that.\\" Mitchell also told USA Today that he was \\"hurt and upset\\" by the fashion in which Brown made the comments during the initial interview. \\"How someone could do that to another person is inconceivable,\\" Mitchell told the newspaper. \\"The amount of hatred you must have to do something like that and then brag about it.\\" Brown acknowledged Thursday that he should have taken a different approach. \\"I'm not going to retract, I'm not going to sit here and make excuses,\\" he said. \\"I know America is looking at me and they're like 'Wow!' but I'm not going to make excuses. ... The one thing I can say is I should have been more tactful at how I said that. That was wrong on my part. I should have humbly said that.

Mitchell did not return, and the Lions lost 38-30. (Photo: AP file photo) Story Highlights Scott Mitchell played 12 years in the NFL, including stints with Miami, Detroit, Baltimore and Cincinnati He threw 95 career touchdown passes and 81 interceptions and had a career passer rating of 75.3 In 1995, he set single-season records for the Lions in touchdown passes (32) and passing yards (4,338) At his home and office in Utah, Scott Mitchell keeps memorabilia from his 14-year career as an NFL quarterback, including the cast from a broken right wrist he suffered in 1994, his first season with the Detroit Lions. He was glancing at it Wednesday while trying to understand why a former teammate, ex-Lions offensive lineman Lomas Brown, would gleefully tell a radio audience recently how he intentionally blew a block so Mitchell would take a hit that resulted in that broken wrist. BROWN CONFESSES: I got Scott Mitchell hurt It happened Nov. 6, 1994. Mitchell was 5-for-15 for 63 yards and two interceptions when Green Bay Packers defensive end Sean Jones hit him. Eighteen years later, it still stings. \\"I was floored by that revelation,\\" Mitchell told USA TODAY Sports. \\"I had Lomas in my home. I fed him dinner. I gave him and other offensive linemen gifts. I'm dumbfounded that he would do such a thing. I mean, people get hurt playing this game. People have died playing football, and for him to allow someone to take a shot at a teammate, that's crazy.\\" Brown said he intentionally missed the block, hoping Mitchell would suffer an injury that would force him out of the game, because, Brown said, Mitchell was playing badly. Here's how Brown, now an NFL analyst, described it on ESPN radio: \\"We were playing Green Bay in Milwaukee. We were getting beat, (24-0), at that time, and (Mitchell) just stunk up the place. He's throwing interceptions, just everything. So I looked at Kevin Glover, our all-pro center, and I said, 'Glove, that is it.' I said, 'I'm getting him out the game.' ... So, I got the gator arms on the guy at the last minute, he got around me, he hit Scott Mitchell, he did something to his finger ... and he came out the game. Dave Krieg came in the game.\\" Mitchell, a left-hander, remembers the play, a freakish, glancing blow on his extended non-throwing arm. \\"That was my first year in Detroit, so Lomas barely knew me,\\" Mitchell said. \\"If he had a problem with me, he could have come to me, man to man, and said so. Be a man about it. But to mess with someone's livelihood like that, to mess with their family and their health, that's reprehensible.\\" Mitchell said he hasn't spoken to Brown since the statements and doesn't intend to contact him. He said the remarks \\"really hurt and upset me. How someone could do that to another person is inconceivable. The amount of hatred you must have to do something like that and then brag about it ...\\" \\"I would never do that to a teammate,\\" Mitchell added. \\"That's a blatant disrespect for the game. Players at that level play hard every play. If Lomas doesn't think this is serious, if he thinks this is a joke, tell him to think about Mike Utley, his old teammate. Mike Utley spends his days in a wheelchair because of an injury he got playing this game.\\" Mitchell insisted he won't let Brown steal from him one of the greatest memories he has of the game -- the friendships he created with teammates. \\"I played with Barry Sanders in Detroit and Dan Marino in Miami during my first four years. I sat between Dan Marino and Don Shula in quarterback meetings,\\" Mitchell said. \\"How cool is that? I played with Ray Lewis and Rod Woodson. One of the best things about playing in the NFL is the relationships you make, not just with star players but everyone in the locker room. \\"I hope Kevin Glover wasn't involved in this, because he's one of my favorite teammates of all time. I remember when (Lions linebacker) Reggie Brown was seriously injured on the field (spinal cord contusion), and Kevin Glover ran the length of the field and through the tunnel to get the ambulance. \\"I don't even want to think that he was involved in any way.\\" This wasn't Brown's first shot at Mitchell. In a television appearance in November, Brown criticized Mitchell's tackling: \\"I played with a guy named Scott Mitchell, 6-5, 250 pounds,\\" Brown said. \\"And when he threw an interception, fetal position. ... And as a lineman, you throw it, I want you to come help me get this guy. Don't just lay in the fetal position and expect me to get it.\\" \\"As you can tell, I'm just not a big fan of Scott Mitchell,\\" Brown said last week. \\"He's not on my Christmas list.\\" The feeling is mutual. \\"I sleep well at night,\\" Mitchell said. \\"Does he?\\" ||||| Brown \\"We were playing Green Bay in Milwaukee. We were getting beat 24-3 [sic] at the time, and [Mitchell] just stunk up the place, throwing interceptions, just everything. I looked at Kevin Glover, our All-Pro center, and I said, 'Glov, that is it.' I said, 'I'm getting him out of the game.' \\"So I gave it the set out, but I got the gator arms on the guy at the last minute. He got around me. He hit Scott Mitchell. He did something to his finger. I don't know what he did to it, but he came out of the game. Dave Krieg came into the game. We ended up losing that game 27-24 [sic]. Now that man came in the game and got some work done. That man who came out of the game? I don't know what he was in there doing.\\" I don't know Lomas Brown, the former Detroit Lions offensive lineman who is now an ESPN analyst. Everything I know about him, however, reflects the classic lovable-giant persona he has cultivated in his post-playing career.\\"Santa Lomas,\\" is a term I've heard more than once to describe him.That's what makes Brown's startling admission this past Friday all the more surprising. If you missed it, Brown said on ESPN Radio's \\"SVP & Russillo\\" show that he had his own way of calling out quarterbacks.\\"Know how I did it?\\" Brown said. \\"Let the guy hit them. Just let the D-linemen get a shot at him.\\"In fact, Brown recalled a specific instance when he allowed a Green Bay Packers defender to hit Lions quarterback Scott Mitchell in 1994. Mitchell suffered a broken right hand and was replaced by backup Dave Krieg , who led a comeback from a 24-0 deficit in a game the Packers ultimately won 38-30 Brown had a few of the details wrong about the score, but as Kirkland Crawford of the Detroit Free Press notes, the basics line up. Brown said that \\"I'm not a big fan of Scott Mitchell\\" and made clear he wasn't joking. \\"He's just not on my Christmas list,\\" Brown said. \\"He won't be getting any Christmas cards from me.\\"Here's how Brown described what he did:Told of the gravity of his admission, Brown said: \\"I've been out of the game since '02. I don't think much can happen to me. Yes, America, yes, I did it.\\"It should go without saying that what Brown described runs counter to every intuition we have about being a teammate, about sportsmanship and fair play. Regardless of the sport, teams are built on the basic understanding that teammates are all on the same side, have the same goals and are working toward the common good. In football, the quarterback literally trusts his linemen to protect him -- and needs them to succeed in order to do his job.The ease with which Brown told the story suggests it happens in the NFL more often than any of us want to know. But, quite frankly, it doesn't seem like something to be proud of or to brag about. Some things are better left unsaid.There is no doubt Mitchell was having a terrible game -- five completions in 13 attempts for 63 yards and two interceptions -- and his tenure with the Lions was a tremendous disappointment. But there is no on-field crime that merits such twisted justice. Purposefully tanking on your job is a reflection of you and your character, not of the culpability you think your victim might have earned.We've all spent time this year discussing the New Orleans Saints ' attempts to intentionally injure players. What Brown admitted to -- doing his best to get his own teammate injured -- is worse. Everyone has a weak moment, and I don't think this should define Brown's career or his life. But in the context of a professional team game, it's as bad as it gets. ||||| A summary of this is?","response":"Lomas Brown, a former Lions offensive tackle and now an ESPN analyst, said in a radio interview that he once intentionally missed a block because he wanted his teammate, Lions quarterback Scott Mitchell, to get injured. Lomas Brown was frustrated with Scott Mitchell's bad performance in a 1994 game. However, Brown later said he regrets his action and wasn't trying to get Mitchell hurt. Mitchell expressed his anger and couldn't believe that Brown would do such thing to his own teammate."},{"question":"First question: What are real time application of virtual function?

Available options: (a). no; (b). yes;","response":"First question: What are real time applications of virtual function? A virtual function is like a special tool in a computer programming language that helps different parts of a program talk to each other more easily. Think of it like a magic wand that can change its shape depending on what we need it to do. Real time applications of virtual function are places where we use this tool to make programs work better. For example, imagine a zoo program with different animals like lions, birds, and fish. Each animal might have a unique action: a lion roars, a bird sings, and a fish swims. By using a virtual function, we can create a single magic wand that can act like a roaring stick, a singing stick, or a swimming stick, depending on which animal we are using it for. Second question: What are real time applications? Real time applications are programs we use every day that work as soon as we want them to. Imagine your favorite video game or video call app. When you push a button, things happen right away – that's because they are real-time applications. They react to your actions quickly so that you can enjoy using them. Are these two questions asking the same thing? Answer: (a). no; These two questions are not asking the same thing.

The deputy director for operations mentioned the Delta flight and concluded that \\"that would be the fourth possible hijack.\\" At 9:49, the commander of NORAD directed all air sovereignty aircraft to battle stations, fully armed. At 9:59, an Air Force lieutenant colonel working in the White House Military Office joined the conference and stated he had just talked to Deputy National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley. The White House requested (1) the implementation of continuity of government measures, (2) fighter escorts for Air Force One, and (3) a fighter combat air patrol over Washington, D.C. By 10:03, when United 93 crashed in Pennsylvania, there had been no mention of its hijacking and the FAA had not yet been added to the teleconference. The President and the Vice President The President was seated in a classroom when, at 9:05, Andrew Card whispered to him: \\"A second plane hit the second tower. America is under attack.\\" The President told us his instinct was to project calm, not to have the country see an excited reaction at a moment of crisis. The press was standing behind the children; he saw their phones and pagers start to ring. The President felt he should project strength and calm until he could better understand what was happening. The President remained in the classroom for another five to seven minutes, while the children continued reading. He then returned to a holding room shortly before 9:15, where he was briefed by staff and saw television coverage. He next spoke to Vice President Cheney, Dr. Rice, New York Governor George Pataki, and FBI Director Robert Mueller. He decided to make a brief statement from the school before leaving for the airport. The Secret Service told us they were anxious to move the President to a safer location, but did not think it imperative for him to run out the door. Between 9:15 and 9:30, the staff was busy arranging a return to Washington, while the President consulted his senior advisers about his remarks. No one in the traveling party had any information during this time that other aircraft were hijacked or missing. Staff was in contact with the White House Situation Room, but as far as we could determine, no one with the President was in contact with the Pentagon.

Uranium-235 has the distinction of being the only naturally occurring fissile isotope. Uranium-238 is fissionable by fast neutrons, and is fertile, meaning it can be transmuted to fissile plutonium-239 in a nuclear reactor. Another fissile isotope, uranium-233, can be produced from natural thorium and is also important in nuclear technology. While uranium-238 has a small probability for spontaneous fission or even induced fission with fast neutrons, uranium-235 and to a lesser degree uranium-233 have a much higher fission cross-section for slow neutrons. In sufficient concentration, these isotopes maintain a sustained nuclear chain reaction. This generates the heat in nuclear power reactors, and produces the fissile material for nuclear weapons. Depleted uranium (238U) is used in kinetic energy penetrators and armor plating. What can't be turned into plutonium-239 in a nuclear reactor? (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","response":"The question can be interpreted as asking what material cannot be turned into plutonium-239 in a nuclear reactor. In that context, any element or material that is not uranium-238 cannot be turned into plutonium-239 in a nuclear reactor. Uranium-238 is a fertile isotope, meaning it can capture a neutron and undergo nuclear transmutation, eventually forming plutonium-239. This process occurs through a series of reactions: 1. Uranium-238 captures a neutron and becomes uranium-239. 2. Uranium-239 undergoes beta decay, turning into neptunium-239. 3. Neptunium-239 undergoes beta decay again, finally forming plutonium-239. Other isotopes or elements, such as uranium-235, thorium-232, or any non-fertile material, will not follow this specific transmutation pathway to produce plutonium-239 within a nuclear reactor. Their nuclear properties and reactions with neutrons will differ, leading to different outcomes or byproducts."},{"question":"What is a question about this article?

Question: suppose less air available occurs happens, how will it affect less food is eaten. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","response":"C: No Effect Let's analyze the situation: less air available occurs, and we want to determine how this will affect the amount of food being consumed. To make an accurate assessment, we need to first understand the roles of both air and the process of digestion. Digestion involves the breakdown of food into simpler components that can be absorbed by the body. This process starts in the mouth and continues in the stomach and intestines. The role of air in the human body is primarily related to respiration, which is the process of obtaining oxygen from the atmosphere and releasing carbon dioxide. Oxygen is essential for cellular respiration, which generates energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) needed for various functions such as metabolism, cellular processes, and functioning of organs, including the digestive system. Now, let's consider the scenario where less air is available. This would inherently lead to a decreased availability of oxygen. The body would likely respond by prioritizing the delivery of available oxygen to vital organs (such as the heart and brain) and essential bodily functions. However, while the gastrointestinal system does require energy to function, oxygen's role in the actual process of digestion within the stomach and intestines is minimal. Digestion in the stomach primarily involves the churning of food and combining it with hydrochloric acid and enzymes to break it down into a thick liquid called chyme. This is an anaerobic reaction, meaning it occurs without the need for oxygen. Once the food enters the small intestine, the process of breaking it down into absorbable nutrients by enzymes and microbes is also an anaerobic process. Only a small amount of oxygen is needed to support the metabolism of these microbes. In conclusion, the availability of less air (and thus reduced oxygen) would not have a direct impact on the amount of food eaten. The digestion process itself within the stomach and intestines relies primarily on anaerobic reactions, which do not require oxygen. While a lack of oxygen could potentially lead to overall fatigue and decreased energy levels in an individual, it would not influence their food consumption or the effectiveness of the digestive system itself."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Here's a logic test: Jerry rubbed his hands together quickly, while ruby was able to rub hers even faster. Ferry had no gloves on but felt he'd created _____ while rubbing them Ruby in her slippery gloves. (A) more heat (B) less heat Choose the answer between \\"slippery gloves\\" and \\"bare skin\\". A:","response":"According to the given information, Jerry rubbed his hands together quickly, and Ruby was able to rub hers even faster. Ferry, on the other hand, had no gloves on but felt he'd created a certain amount of heat while rubbing them. Ruby was wearing slippery gloves. When comparing the heat produced between the \\"slippery gloves\\" and \\"bare skin,\\" we should consider two key aspects: friction and speed. Friction occurs when two surfaces come into contact, and it is one of the crucial factors in heat generation. In Ruby's case, she was wearing slippery gloves, which would generally result in reduced friction. Less friction would typically lead to less heat being generated when compared to rubbing bare hands together. Ferry, who was not wearing gloves, had direct skin contact. The friction generated from rubbing bare skin would usually be higher than that of Ruby's slippery gloves. However, Ruby was able to rub her hands even faster than Jerry, who was rubbing his hands together quickly. Speed is an essential aspect of heat generation; a faster speed can result in more heat being generated. With Ruby rubbing her hands faster than Jerry, it can be assumed that her overall speed was high and might have compensated for the reduced friction resulting from her slippery gloves. In conclusion, while it might be assumed that the \\"bare skin\\" would create more heat because of the higher friction, given the context and speed in this scenario, we cannot conclusively determine that \\"bare skin\\" always produces more heat than \\"slippery gloves.\\" However, Ferry felt that he had created a certain amount of heat while rubbing without gloves, and Ruby, with her gloves and faster speed, potentially generated comparable heat. The answer would be: It cannot be conclusively determined which one generated more heat, as both \\"slippery gloves\\" and \\"bare skin\\" might have the potential to generate a similar amount of heat based on different factors (friction and speed)."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: The exercise is to decide whether the question accepts the proposed suggestion as a correct answer.

This occurs in a type of glacier called a \\"valley glacier\\". As a glacier moves down a valley, friction causes the basal ice of the glacier to melt and infiltrate joints (cracks) in the bedrock. The freezing and thawing action of the ice enlarges, widens, or causes further cracks in the bedrock as it changes volume across the ice/water phase transition (a form of hydraulic wedging), gradually loosening the rock between the joints. This produces large pieces of rock called joint blocks. Eventually these joint blocks come loose and become trapped in the glacier. and the situation: Rob likes to visit high mountainous locations.

Twenty years after the episode aired in 1995, Homer’s dreams have come true. Shoppers visiting the new Rebecca Minkoff store in SoHo are greeted by a touch-screen wall that displays products, makes suggestions and — please join me in a Homeric squeal — takes orders for a free beverage, your choice of sparkling water, green tea, coffee, espresso or Champagne. I pressed the Coffee button and felt my pocket buzz. It was a text message alerting me that my order had been placed. A second message arrived, this time from a friend who had come along for the day and furtively snapped an iPhone photo of me staring open-mouthed and mesmerized at the wall, my face dumber than a bowl of custard. He sent it from a few feet away, laughing at my instant regression. Touch-screens can have that effect. A saleswoman materialized, gesturing at my phone. “Did you order coffee?” she asked. “Just checking to make sure it was a real order,” she said. “A lot of people have been requesting things by mistake.” That made sense. The wall interface was sleek enough that a few wrong pokes could send demands for bubbly racing through the system, scattering saleswomen in all directions for beverage distribution. My coffee arrived in six minutes, piping hot. The futuristic vending machine is part of a partnership with eBay on the new Minkoff store, which opened in November with the promise of delivering “the most advanced and cutting edge technology at the forefront of retail innovation,” as a news release put it. Items contain RFID tags that are detected when a visitor enters a dressing room; the items pop up on a mirror with suggested accessories and the option to summon a different size. Rather than hover at a register, saleswomen check customers out on iPad minis. There’s nothing high-tech about the clothes, which have a beachy-casual vibe that evokes patio brunches, Coachella, rompers, floppy hats and the phrase “bikini body.” Hayden Panettiere loves Rebecca Minkoff. So does Britney Spears. It’s the kind of place you can buy a 50 coin purse printed with What boyfriend?! in gold. I have never chased a woman down the street to ask where her bag was from and found out that it was Rebecca Minkoff. I did, however, find a pair of beautifully lunatic orange-and-white striped shorts (198) on a rack beyond the touch-screen wall. They looked like something a penniless aristocrat would wear to the beach in a 1938 Lubitsch film, with a bellybutton-high waist and a discreet elastic panel that could theoretically allow my weight to fluctuate by 40 pounds. I summoned my shopping companion to the dressing room. “You’re wearing clown underpants,” he said. The shorts were pretty and carefully constructed, with zero sex appeal. They were the Katy Perry of shorts. Other items crossed the line from devil-may-care to downright disobliging. A color-blocked tank (198) billowed inexplicably beneath the bust, suggesting a beer belly where none existed. (Yet.) A wall devoted to the much-loved Minkoff handbags highlighted a problem with other items I tried on, which is that many things looked much cheaper than they were. Not only in cost, but in quality: a fringed tote appeared ersatz but was made of real leather; a polyester-seeming blouse was actually pure silk. It’s worth experimenting with the Minkoff gear just to tinker with the dressing room lights, which can be adjusted by tapping the mirror. Five settings are available: Hudson River Sunset (blushing mimosa); Afternoon on the High Line (ivory-green) SoHo After Dark (violet) Brooklyn Morning (milky sunshine) and Default Average (cruel light of day). I toyed happily with the LEDs until a saleswoman gently rapped the door and ventured, “Everything all right in there, babe?” Rebecca Minkoff isn’t the first to give customers control over their lighting, but her rendition is the best I’ve seen. The branding — Hudson River Sunset — is a nice touch. It made me forgive the fact that my room contained one hook and no bench, which meant depositing my winter coat and purse on the floor. Shoes were on display in the back, including a coven of studded jellies that precisely replicated a Valentino sandal from seasons past. Same studs, same shape, same ankle strap, same PVC material. I admired the PVC (all summer shoes should be wipe-clean, for sanitary reasons) but not the choice of origin material, which by now has been copied by everyone from Steve Madden to Forever 21. It’s a dark day when Steve Madden beats you to the punch. And copycatting is an offense with a high rate of recidivism. The peril of a flashy knockoff is how quickly it pollutes the rest of a brand’s inventory. A visitor’s eyes narrow as they sweep the room.

Answer:","response":"Iceland is an independent country and does not belong to any other nation. It is a Nordic island nation with a rich history of viking heritage and unique geological features. Situated in the North Atlantic Ocean, Iceland is located between Greenland and Norway and northwest of the UK. Dating back to its early history, Iceland was first inhabited by Norse settlers around AD 874. In 1262, it entered into a union with the Kingdom of Norway, which was later followed by a union with the Kingdom of Denmark in 1380. It remained under Danish rule for several centuries, but due to socio-economic factors and a growing national identity, Iceland began to strive for independence in the 19th century. The journey towards independence was a gradual process. In 1874, Iceland was granted a constitution, and in 1904, it was allowed to have its own parliamentary government. The Act of Union, a 1918 agreement with Denmark, declared Iceland a sovereign state, named the Kingdom of Iceland, under a personal union with the Danish king. When Denmark was occupied by Nazi Germany during World War II, Iceland was cut off from the Danish government and consequently took steps to separate itself further. On May 17, 1941, the Icelandic government signed an agreement with the United States through what is known as the Aerial Agreement of 1941, giving the US control over military and aviation facilities in Iceland. This marked the beginning of Iceland's defense relationship with the United States, which has continued in various forms in the following years. The most pivotal event in Iceland's history happened on June 17, 1944. With the approval of the Icelandic people through a referendum, Iceland withdrew from the Danish Crown and declared itself a fully independent and sovereign republic. This date is now celebrated annually as Iceland's National Day. Since gaining independence, Iceland has become well-known for its focus on gender equality, environmental sustainability, and technological advancements. The country boasts a robust social welfare system, and it consistently ranks high in terms of quality of life and happiness. With a parliamentary democracy in place, Iceland is also recognized as one of the most politically stable countries in the world. In terms of international relationships, Iceland is a member of several international organizations, including the United Nations, the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), and the Schengen Agreement. While not a member of the European Union, Iceland cooperates closely with its fellow European nations and participates in the European Economic Area (EEA). In conclusion, Iceland is an independent and sovereign nation with a unique history and culture. It does not belong to any other country and maintains its own political and economic systems while engaging in relationships with other nations through various international organizations."},{"question":"Let's think step by step! Choose the sentence that goes against common sense. Options: - Sentence A: \\"I called the post office to report a crime.\\" - Sentence B: \\"I called the police to report a crime.\\"","response":"Step 1: Read both sentences carefully. Sentence A: \\"I called the post office to report a crime.\\" Sentence B: \\"I called the police to report a crime.\\" Step 2: Determine the purpose of each sentence. Sentence A is about reporting a crime to the post office. Sentence B is about reporting a crime to the police. Step 3: Identify which sentence goes against common sense. Reporting a crime is normally directed to the police since they are the ones responsible for crime-related matters. Reporting a crime to the post office doesn't make much sense as it's not their area of responsibility. Therefore, The sentence that goes against common sense is Sentence A: \\"I called the post office to report a crime.\\""},{"question":"Premise: You'd think instead of messing around with Winston, RJR would produce a brand it can market to old folks. Hypothesis: Everyone agrees that RJR should continue to adjust the Winston brand. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","response":"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise provided suggests a concern for the potential wastefulness of the current business approach of marketing the Winston brand, perceivably targeting a younger demographic. The posed concern, specifically, is that RJR could be wasting resources by not producing a brand that can be more effectively marketed to older adults. Meanwhile, the hypothesis argues that it is a unanimous agreement that RJR should continue to adjust, or mutate, the Winston brand rather than initiating a new or different brand. This assumes that the Winston brand, however, it's reformed would remain the focal point of the business efforts. The hypothesis may seem to stem from the premise; however, the premise and hypothesis prescribe different business strategies for RJR. The premise advocates for the production of a brand that can be marketed to a different demographic (older adults) whereas the hypothesis advocates for the continuous reforming of the Winston brand. Presumably, this refers to adjusting its marketing strategy, appeal, image, or some other characteristic for the Winston brand to be more successful in the market. This presupposes that the existing brand could be reformed in higher effectiveness than creating or marketing another brand to a different demographic. However, there is no suggestion in the premise that the Winston brand should continue to be revised or that there is a global agreement on this. The preference in the premise for marketing to a different demographic is independent of any notions about continuing current brand revision efforts. For these reasons, the premise does not empirically-or logically-imply the hypothesis. There is no evidence to support the hypothesis, nor does the premise lead to the conclusion proffered in the hypothesis. Therefore, the language and arguments presented in the premise and hypothesis are not inherently connected. In summary, the premise does not entail the hypothesis as it does not present any argument to support the idea that RJR should continue to adjust the Winston brand. Instead, the premise simply suggests that RJR might be missing a significant marketing opportunity by failing to target an older demographic. There is no mention or suggestion of a unanimous agreement that RJR should continue to adjust the Winston brand—in fact, the possibility of exploring new brand options targeting different demographics seems to challenge the concept of sticking with the existing brand exclusively. Therefore, the premise and the hypothesis stand as independent, non-mutually exclusive arguments."},{"question":"Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: WebCam<br>Tom was concerned about his online privacy.

The band did not intend for it to be the first single, and released it only when they could not decide on anything else. Haug said it being \\"a pretty inoffensive song musically\\" helped Powderfinger make that decision. \\"The Day You Come\\" spent nine weeks on the ARIA Charts, peaking at #25.The second single was the double a-side, \\"Don't Wanna Be Left Out/Good-Day Ray\\", released on 9 November 1998. \\"Don't Wanna Be Left Out\\", a song about a friend of Fanning's who had difficulty in social situations, was one of the roughest Powderfinger songs to date. 'Don't Wanna Be Left Out' could be comfortably ranked with other Powderfinger songs such as 'Lighten My Load' and 'Rise Up'. Drummer Jon Coghill described it as the most difficult Powderfinger song to play live at the time, because it was so \\"fast and offbeat\\". The music video for \\"Don't Wanna Be Left Out\\" was unpopular and drew criticism from band members. \\"Good-Day Ray\\" was dedicated to Australian television presenter Ray Martin and his public disagreements with former Media Watch host Stuart Littlemore. Its lyrics verged on punk, though Coghill denied that Powderfinger were a punk band. He also described the music video for \\"Good-Day Ray\\" as being one of the better videos the band had made.Internationalist's third single was \\"Already Gone\\", released on 12 February 1999. The song was a tribute to the Beatles and their influence on Powderfinger's music. The fourth and final single from the album was \\"Passenger\\", released on 9 August 1999. \\"Passenger\\" was influenced by Elvis Presley, and included a big horn section, as well as backing vocals from folk group Tiddas. \\"Passenger\\" won the ARIA Award for \\"Song Of The Year\\" in 1999. The song's music video was one of Powderfinger's first to feature computer graphics, and was produced by Fifty Fifty Films. \\"Passenger\\" spent 11 weeks on the ARIA Charts, peaking at #30.

The continuous actions by the Chechens to weaken the Russian garrison would cause ongoing trouble to the Russians until they ultimately withdraw in frustration."},{"question":"The Glory of Melaka: In the early days, if you were not a pirate or a mosquito, Melaka was not much of a place to live. The land was infertile, just a swampy plain, the river small and sluggish. But it had a sheltered harbor, protected from the monsoons by neighboring Sumatra. Later, the strategic location and deep-water channel close to the coast brought in the bigger vessels of the trade-wind traffic crossing the Indian Ocean. The first to realize the larger commercial potential, as so often throughout the country's subsequent history, were the Chinese. In 1409, under a new directive from Emperor Chu Ti to pursue trade in the South Seas and the Indian Ocean, a Chinese fleet of 50 ships headed by Admiral Cheng Ho called in at Melaka. They made Parameswara an offer he could not refuse: port facilities and an annual financial tribute in exchange for Chinese protection against the marauding Thais. In 1411, Parameswara took the money to Beijing himself, and the emperor gratefully made him a vassal king. Twenty years later, the Chinese withdrew again from the South Seas trade. The new ruler of Melaka, Sri Maharajah, switched his allegiance to the Muslim trading fraternity by marrying into the Muslim faith, wedding the daughter of a sultan in Sumatra. Islam won its place in Malaya not by conquest — as had been the case in North Africa and Europe — but by trade, dynastic alliances, and peaceful preaching. Bengali peddlers had already brought the faith to the east coast. In Melaka and throughout the peninsula, Islam thrived as a strong, male-dominated religion of individuality, offering dynamic leadership and preaching brotherhood and self-reliance — all qualities ideally suited to the coastal trade. At the same time, Sufi mystics synthesized Islamic teaching with local Malay traditions of animistic magic and charisma, though Islam did not become the state religion until Muzaffar Shah became sultan of Melaka (1446–1459). But the key figure in the sultanate was Tun Perak, bendahara (prime minister) and military commander. He expanded Melaka's power along the west coast and down to Singapore and the neighboring Bintan islands. He also had orang laut pirates patrolling the seas to extort tribute from passing ships. After Ailied district chiefs had repelled assaults from Thai-controlled armies from Pahang, Tun Perak personally led a famous victory over a Thai fleet off Batu Pahat in 1456. Choose from options: Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Melaka\\" correctly answer the question \\"What location is protected from monsoons and from which neighboring country?\\"? Choose your answer from: a). no; b). yes;","response":"b). yes; Melaka is the correct answer to the question \\"What location is protected from monsoons and from which neighboring country?\\" As mentioned in the passage, Melaka had a sheltered harbor protected from monsoons by neighboring Sumatra. This detail demonstrates that Melaka is the location being referred to, and it is protected from monsoons because of Sumatra."},{"question":"Bill loved riding his bike and did it all the time.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more oxygen in the environment happens, how will it affect more oxygen delivered to cells. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","response":"To analyze the perturbation hypothesis, let's consider the steps of the process and examine if the presence of more oxygen in the environment will have a direct or indirect effect on it. 1. Air enters the lungs through bronchial tubes: The amount of oxygen in the environment may affect the concentration of oxygen in the air that enters the lungs. With more oxygen in the environment, there would be a higher concentration of oxygen in the inhaled air. 2. Air enters bronchioles: This step mainly involves the physical transportation of air, so the presence of more oxygen should not directly affect this step. 3. Bronchioles have tiny air sacs called alveoli: The alveoli are where the gas exchange occurs. If there is more oxygen in the environment, the concentration of oxygen in the alveoli would also be higher. 4. Alveoli surrounded by small blood vessels: This step describes the structure around the alveoli. The presence of more oxygen in the environment would not directly affect this structural feature. 5. Oxygen absorbed by small blood vessels: The increased concentration of oxygen in the alveoli would lead to a higher pressure gradient for oxygen to diffuse across the alveolar membrane, causing more oxygen to be absorbed by the small blood vessels (capillaries). 6. Vessels deliver oxygen to every cell in the body: With more oxygen absorbed by blood vessels, the amount of oxygen carried by blood (oxygen saturation) would increase. This could lead to higher oxygen delivery to the cells. 7. Blood brings carbon dioxide back to lungs: The transportation of carbon dioxide might not directly be affected by the higher oxygen concentration; however, more efficient respiration in cells might enhance carbon dioxide production. 8. Carbon dioxide released when you exhale: Exhaling remains the same, but with potentially more efficient cellular respiration, there may be slightly more carbon dioxide being released. The supposed perturbation of more oxygen in the environment does indirectly affect the process as it increases the concentration of oxygen in the inhaled air, leading to increased absorption by small blood vessels and ultimately higher oxygen delivery to the cells. However, it is important to note that if oxygen levels were too high, it could potentially lead to oxygen toxicity or other negative consequences for the body."},{"question":"Write a negative tweet.","response":"Hi there!

Many of the herbicides, pesticides, and antibiotics used in commercial farming contain toxic elements. Though it is not conclusive, some research suggests that when ingested, these toxins act similarly to estrogen and can throw off your body’s hormone balance. To avoid this, purchase food items bearing a green “USDA Organic” seal whenever you can. Many cruciferous vegetables contain a large amount of indole-3-carbinol. Once inside the body, indole-3-carbinol will fight for the same space on your cells as a type of estrogen called estradiol, preventing further growth. Over time, indole-3-carbinol can help your body expel estrogen, leaving more room for testosterone growth. Common cruciferous vegetables include: Broccoli Brussels sprouts Cabbage Cauliflower Kale While many foods contain elements that mimic estrogen, some have enzymes like ellagitannin, naringenin, and apigenin that block the production or spread of the sex hormone. Depending on the specific food, this is done by actively preventing estrogen from binding to cell receptors or by mimicking aromatase inhibitors. Some foods that contain anti-estrogens are: Citrus fruits Dark berries Olive oil Oysters Pomegranates White mushrooms. and alcohol you consume. Coffee, soda, and similar caffeinated beverages can massively increase the production of estrogen in your body. Coffee in particular can cause your body to become more acidic, making it harder to balance your hormones. Beer, bourbon, and many other forms of alcohol contain phytoestrogen that, when consumed, can lead to a general increase of estrogen in your body. Soy beans and their associated by-products, including soy milk and tofu, contain high amounts of phytoestrogen. Just like with alcohol, this substance can increase the amount of estrogen present in your body.","response":"Avoid commercial farming products containing toxic elements, consume cruciferous vegetables and certain anti-estrogenic foods, and reduce intake of coffee, alcohol, and soy products to better balance hormones and boost testosterone levels."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Question: Where is Harvey's place of residence?

Movie title: Last Chance Harvey Context: Divorced American Harvey Shine writes jingles for television commercials, a job not in keeping with his one-time aspiration to be a jazz composer and pianist. His position at work is tenuous as he departs for London to attend his daughter Susan's wedding. Upon arrival at Heathrow Airport, he encounters Kate Walker, a single Londoner who collects statistics from passengers as they pass through the terminals. Tired and anxious to get to his hotel, Harvey brusquely dismisses her when she approaches him to ask questions. Harvey is upset to discover his ex-wife Jean rented a house to accommodate family and friends from the States but failed to include him. At the rehearsal dinner on the night preceding the wedding, it becomes increasingly clear Harvey is systematically being excluded from the clan around his ex-wife's new husband Brian and is treated as a mere guest. They fake their politeness towards him and make him feel embarrassed and uncomfortable. When Harvey tells Susan, with whom he has shared a strained relationship since his divorce, that he will be attending the ceremony but not the subsequent reception because he needs to return to the States for an important meeting, she informs him she has asked her stepfather Brian to give her away. Meanwhile, Kate is on a blind date that is not going well. When she returns to the table after taking yet another call from her neurotic mother Maggie, who is certain her Polish neighbor is burying bodies in a shed in his yard, she discovers her date has invited friends to join them. Feeling unwanted and excluded from the conversation, she eventually excuses herself and goes home. The following morning Harvey attends the wedding but quickly leaves for the airport without congratulating the married couple. But due to heavy traffic delays he misses his flight at Heathrow.

Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: Dracula Movie plot: In Whitby, England in 1913, Count Dracula (Frank Langella) arrives from Transylvania via the ship Demeter one stormy night. A sickly Mina Van Helsing (Jan Francis), who is visiting her friend Lucy Seward (Kate Nelligan), discovers Dracula's body after his ship has run aground. The Count visits Mina and her friends at the household of Lucy's father, Dr. Jack Seward (Donald Pleasence), whose clifftop mansion also serves as the local asylum. At dinner, he proves to be a charming guest and leaves a strong impression on the hosts, Lucy especially. Less charmed by this handsome Romanian count is Jonathan Harker (Trevor Eve), Lucy's fiancÃ©. Later that night, while Lucy and Jonathan are having a secret rendezvous, Dracula reveals his true nature as he descends upon Mina to drink her blood. The following morning, Lucy finds Mina awake in bed, struggling for breath. Powerless, she watches her friend die, only to find wounds on her throat. Lucy blames herself for Mina's death, as she had left her alone. At a loss for the cause of death, Dr. Seward calls for Mina's father, Professor Abraham van Helsing (Laurence Olivier). Van Helsing suspects what might have killed his daughter: a vampire. Moreover, he begins to worry about what fate his seemingly dead daughter may now have. Seward and van Helsing investigate their suspicions and discover a roughly clawed opening within Mina's coffin which leads to the local mines. It is there that they encounter the ghastly form of an undead Mina, and it is up to a distraught van Helsing to destroy what remains of his own daughter. Lucy meanwhile has been summoned to Carfax Abbey, Dracula's new home, and soon she reveals herself to be in love with this foreign prince and openly offers herself to him as his bride. After a surreal \\"Wedding Night\\" sequence (employing lasers and shot by famed James Bond title sequence designer, Maurice Binder), Lucy, like Mina before her, is now infected by Dracula's blood.

Their “Letter to Audit Committee Members” , issued privately right after the publication of the Lehman Bankruptcy Examiner’s Report in March of 2010, draws a line in the sand that will hopefully be debated in open court: EY’s last full audit was for the year ended November 30, 2007. Our opinion stated that Lehman’s financial statements for 2007 were fairly presented in accordance with US GAAP, and we remain of that view. We reviewed but did not audit the interim periods for Lehman’s first and second quarters of fiscal 2008. EY’s claim of an arbitrary cutoff for responsibility for the audit after the 2007 10-K is intended to fool the casual reader of media reports. Lehman remained an EY client until the bankruptcy in September 2008. This period included two more 10-Qs. The New York Attorney General’s (NYAG) complaint against EY makes the correct distinction between an “audit” and a “review” but doesn’t excuse EY for burying their heads in the sand for the sake of millions in fees. As Lehman’s auditor, E&Y signed off on each of Lehman’s annual disclosures, certifying their compliance with GAAP. Each Form 10-K included a “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm” signed by E&Y, representing: In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company….in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects the information set forth therein. Similarly, each quarterly disclosure (Form 10-Q) contained a “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm” signed by E&Y, stating that, based on a review of Lehman’s consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, “we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the consolidated financial statements referred to above for them to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.” (Page 25 of NYAG complaint) EY issued an actual report of their review of the 10-Qs for two quarters in 2008 that were included in Lehman’s regulatory filings. Jonathan Weil of Bloomberg was the first to mention this potential Achilles’ heel in EY’s defense. Although he originally used the term “opinion” to refer to EY’s reports of their review that were included in Lehman’s 10-Q’s, his theory that this may change the judgment of their liability for these reviews is essentially correct. Cases such as Lattanzio v. Deloitte & Touche LLP, 476 F.3d 147, 154 (2d Cir. 2007) make it clear that an explicit statement by the auditors is necessary to hold them liable. I have not been able to find any cases where auditor signed reports of their 10-Q reviews made the difference in holding auditors liable. It’s difficult to find case like this since so many complaints of malpractice against the auditors settle rather than go to trial. It seems Bloomberg’s Weil believes the provision of a report of the auditor’s 10-Q review may strengthen claims against EY for liability beyond the 2007 Lehman annual report. I agree, but recognize I have nothing but the hope for a reasonable judge to base this conclusion on. It’s an oddity that some investment banks insist on a report for the 10-Q review from their audit firms. A review is required. A report is not. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act gave auditors (and law firms) a way to escape liability for misstatements in quarterly reports because the firms generally do not make “explicit” statements. That is, their review is done in the background, they provide no written report, and the review is not technically, or in their opinion, an “opinion.” In spite of no legal requirement, EY and the other audit firms consented to inclusion of signed reports of their quarterly reviews (as opposed to an opinion which has a very strict definition in the standards and the law) in the 10-Qs of some other financial services firms. These reports are included in their regulatory filings. Auditors provide reports that document their 10-Q reviews for Goldman Sachs (PwC) and Morgan Stanley (Deloitte), two firms that did not fail but did receive bailouts and whose share price did drop during the crisis period. Deloitte provided reports of their 10-Q reviews for audit client Merrill Lynch prior to its absorption by Bank of America and for client Bear Stearns prior to its absorption into JPM Chase. Neither Merrill Lynch nor Bear Stearns filed for bankruptcy but were arguably illiquid if not insolvent at the time of their acquisition. The auditor’s report of their review for Bear Stearns’ 10-Q as of February 28, 2008 actually had a “going concern” warning from Deloitte, their auditors. Bear Stearns agreed to be bought by JPM Chase two weeks later. Notably, EY does not provide signed reports for their 10-Q reviews for audit client UBS. PwC does not provide signed reports for their 10-Q reviews of audit clients JPM Chase or Bank of America. KPMG does not do so for Citigroup. Write a one or two sentence summary.","response":"Ernst & Young (EY) may face more significant liability related to Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy than originally claimed, as their responsibility for auditing the firm may extend beyond the 2007 10-K.

We're consumed with sporting class: who has it, who doesn't have it, the right way to win and the wrong way to win. The latest \\"classless\\" wonder is Richard Sherman, a Stanford-educated cornerback who decided to use his postgame interview on FOX as an audition for the WWE. Sherman was brash, opinionated, angry, spiteful and full of histrionic aggression. In other words, he was an entertainer. Who, mercifully, did not suggest that Jesus was behind his accomplishments -- a sentiment that, if shared, would have stamped him as \\"classy.\\" In order to be classy, you have to be humble, genuflect at the altar of the meek. Essentially, you have to be the exact opposite of what's actually required to succeed at your chosen profession. We want athletes, entertainers and anyone else in the public eye to be \\"real,\\" but what we really mean is we want them to all act the exact same. We want them to utter the same banal cliches, put on a false face for television, talk as, simultaneously, everyone and no one actually does in real life. You ever wonder why 99 percent of athlete interviews sound the exact same? It's because everyone is acting, playing the role that countless athletes before them have played in their postgame interviews. It's been so long since someone was actually honest that none of us even knows what that looks like. And if you don't act that way -- a patently false way that no one truly resembles in actual life -- then you're classless. Personally, I wish Sherman had said with a straight face, \\"God really hates the 49ers. I can't believe He picked us over them, but I'm glad He did.\\" That's what I would say if I were interviewed in the postgame scrum. \\"I'm really excited to be going to the Super Bowl, I just wish God didn't hate (insert the team we just beat) so bad.\\" Then, I'd smile, wink and go celebrate. I'd revel in the uproar, delight in the anger. Mostly, though, I'd just enjoy flipping the cliche on its head, doing something different. The reaction to Sherman's interview, which you can watch here, was instantaneous on Twitter. Some loved it, some hated it, but millions took to social media to use it as the latest reflection of modern-American class. How could a football player behave this way? After all, football players -- grown men who make a handsome living trying to knock each other senseless for 60 minutes -- should know better than to comport themselves in such a manner. Oh, won't someone please think of their monocles and canes! Who will protect our children!? According to many, Sherman was -- wait for it -- \\"classless.\\" Or, if you aren't smart enough to spell \\"classless,\\" as many of Sherman's critics were not, then he was \\"not classy.\\" If you're ever bored one day, do a Twitter search for the terms \\"classy,\\" \\"classless\\" or \\"not classy.\\" Plug in any famous person in America and the words \\"classy,\\" \\"classless\\" or \\"not classy,\\" and you'll be stunned by how much reaction there is. Want to know why every celebrity in American life has the depth of a cardboard cutout? Focusing on how classy they are based on a two-minute interaction is a good place to start. Want to know why we're constantly surprised when these celebrities reveal themselves to be different from how they seemed in their \\"classy\\" interviews? Dive in to the real-time Twitter stream. Here's classy on Twitter right now. Every few seconds a new list of comments pops up, discussing what is or is not classy. This happens all day, every day, throughout the end of times. If nuclear war happened tomorrow and most of us were eliminated from the face of the Earth, when the American survivalists climbed out from their bunkers, the first thing they'd say would be, \\"That was not a classy way to have a nuclear war.\\" If the rapture actually happened, those left behind would survey their surroundings and take to Twitter: \\"I thought God was classier than this. To just snatch people up in the middle of the day? Not classy. #godsnotclassy\\" Being classy is a national fixation in all walks of life; sports just reflects this obsession. Of course, the class we focus on is the trivial, inconsequential kind. We avoid discussions of economic class or racial class or class that actually determines whether many of us have equal shots at making it in America today. Nope, those are difficult issues, ones that can't be analyzed immediately. Instead we focus on the low-hanging fruit, the easy target. And one of the great flaws of the social media era is its tendency to create tens of millions of pearl-clutching reactionaries and then give them a voice, leading to a cabal of caterwauling old maids. Somewhere along the way, \\"If you don't like it, don't watch it\\" has been turned into, \\"If I don't like it, you shouldn't be able to watch it, either.\\" Why shouldn't you be able to watch it? An obsession with class, above all else, reflects a society with plenty of time on its hands and nothing that consequential to worry about. There was a reason British aristocrats spent so much time focusing on class and comportment -- because they had nothing else to do. \\"Can you believe these colonies and their Declaration of Independence? Who do those classless colonists think they are?\\" Present-day America has reached that point as well: Let's focus on class. You know what else the British thought wasn't classy back in the day? I'm glad Twitter doesn't decide its fate.

And almost exactly 24 hours later, she was gone. I was devastated. 30.5 years of Happily Ever After turned into god fucking damn it all to hell! And when April 2 rolls around every year, I begin living those last 30 days of her life over again. I thought that after the third time in 2017 that I was about ready to let it go. I started really living again instead of just existing. But when April 2 came this year, I found that I was back in my memories. It was easier to deal with this time because of the way I had changed over the last year. I hung around with more friends and they helped distract me and one actually helped me turn May 2 into a celebration. And I love her for that. That's my story.

Question: What family of instrument did the harp belong to? Context: Typical stringed instruments of the early period include the harp, lute, vielle, and psaltery, while wind instruments included the flute family (including recorder), shawm (an early member of the oboe family), trumpet, and the bagpipes. Simple pipe organs existed, but were largely confined to churches, although there were portable varieties. Later in the period, early versions of keyboard instruments like the clavichord and harpsichord began to appear. Stringed instruments such as the viol had emerged by the 16th century, as had a wider variety of brass and reed instruments. Printing enabled the standardization of descriptions and specifications of instruments, as well as instruction in their use.

So having very little time and desperately in need of a pedicure I stopped in to Leo Orchid Nails. I am truly convinced that the two high marked reviews must have been planted or paid for... Or maybe the reviewers just have never had a quality pedi because my experience was something I would not wish on anyone. I wish I would have followed my gut and walked out half way through the pedi. I have to agree with Whitney the two men are just creepy! This place is cluttered and dirty... Disgustingly D-I-R-T-Y and the staff is extremely pushy and RUDE. How are you going to clean the tools in the dirty water that my feet have been soaking in and then put them back for the next person? Ewww! Gross! Let me tell you I came straight home and scrubbed my feet... still have the heebee geebees! There are way too many places where you can get a much better pedi for the same price. I have learned my lesson and will drive the extra miles and make the time to go to Ken's Nails from here on out! As a side note - this is the same people that used to be in the shopping center on Baseline between Lakeshore & Rural (between Big Lots and Classic Pizza Kitchen). Now located in the Walgreen's shopping center on McClintock and Southern. Had I realized that prior to sitting down I wouldn't have bothered... Last year I had gone to the old location once... Horrible pedi and I kid you not it lasted exactly 1 day... I wore closed toes shoes the next day to work and when I got home the polish had rubbed off of my toes... never had that happen before. I spoke to a friend who explained that it happens only when they use 1) cheap polish (I only pick OPI products) or 2) they thin the polish down too much. Either way... I know my money is better spent @ Ken's (Sorry I deviated Ken & Amy!)... sure hope the health dept shuts them down soon!","response":"To describe the sentiment of this review, we can follow these steps: 1. Identify the overall tone: The tone of this review is predominantly negative, as the reviewer has expressed dissatisfaction and frustration with their experience at Leo Orchid Nails. 2. Point out specific sentiments: Negative sentiments can be broken down into multiple aspects as follows: - The reviewer doubts the authenticity of the positive reviews and questions the reviewers' knowledge of a quality pedicure. - The pedicure experience was unpleasant, leading the reviewer to wish they had walked out halfway through. - The staff, particularly the two men, are described as creepy. - The cleanliness of the salon is criticized as dirty and cluttered, with a particular mention of poor hygiene concerning the tools. - The staff is described as pushy and rude. - The quality of the pedicure itself, including the polish, was disappointing and did not last. 3. Mention any positive sentiments or comparison for context: While the overall sentiment is negative, the reviewer does share some positive feedback about a different nail salon, Ken's Nails, where they feel their money is better spent and regret deviating from going there. In summary, the sentiment of this review is overwhelmingly negative, with criticisms about the salon's cleanliness, staff behavior, and the quality of the pedicure itself."},{"question":"Write a dialog based on this summary: Susan and Maya want to organize new year's eve party at Bob's house.

Here's the question: \\"What is the significance of the speed of light in a vacuum, and how does it influence our understanding of the universe and the laws of physics?\\" Answer: The speed of light in a vacuum is a fundamental constant of nature and has a significant impact on our understanding of the universe and the laws of physics. Denoted by the letter \\"c,\\" the speed of light is approximately 299,792 kilometers per second (186,282 miles per second) in a vacuum. One of the most important aspects of the speed of light is its role in Einstein's theory of relativity. According to his Special Theory of Relativity, the speed of light is always constant in a vacuum, regardless of the observer's speed or the source of light. This led to groundbreaking discoveries about the nature of time and space, connecting them in a single framework called spacetime. The constancy of the speed of light also means that no information or particle can travel faster than light; otherwise, it would violate the theory of relativity and the principles of causality. Moreover, understanding the speed of light has played a pivotal role in our perceptions of cosmic distances and the age of the universe. Astronomers use light-years (the distance light travels in one year) as a standard unit for measuring vast cosmic distances. For example, the Andromeda galaxy, the nearest major galaxy to the Milky Way, is about 2.537 million light-years away. Observations of light from distant stars and galaxies also give us a glimpse into the past because we see the light as it was when it left its source, not as it is now. Additionally, the speed of light aided in the development of a more accurate definition of the meter in terms of fundamental constants. In 1983, the international scientific community defined the meter as \\"the length of the path traveled by light in a vacuum during a time interval of 1/299,792,458 of a second.\\" The speed of light also has implications for particle physics and the nature of mass and energy. According to Einstein's famous equation, E=mc², energy (E) is equivalent to mass (m) times the speed of light squared (c²). This equation demonstrates that mass can be converted into energy and vice versa. This principle is at the core of nuclear reactions in stars, nuclear power plants, and atomic bombs. In summary, the speed of light in a vacuum plays an essential role in our understanding of the universe and the laws of physics. Its significance can be observed in the theory of relativity, measurements of cosmic distances, the definition of the meter, and the relationship between mass and energy."},{"question":"The parking lot for the Center for Addictions Treatment was in the back of the building, as was the front door.

Smoking was prohibited inside the building, a policy which grew increasingly unpopular with both the staff and the clients as the course of the year wore on. By December, Ray would have to do weekly fire drills around three a.m. as a way of politely reminding his anti-social and policy impaired population that any building more than a century old was actually little more than well formed kindling.

After their con is discovered, the two evade capture and hide aboard one of the ships to be led by HernÃ¡n CortÃ©s to the New World. During the trip, they are caught as stowaways and imprisoned, but manage to break free and take a rowboat with the help of CortÃ©s' horse, Altivo. Later, they land on an unknown shore at the edge of Mexico, and Miguel begins to recognize landmarks from the map, leading them to a totem marker near a large waterfall. Believing it to be a dead end, they suddenly encounter a native woman being chased by guards; when the guards see Tulio and Miguel riding Altivo as depicted on the totem, they escort them to a secret entrance behind the falls, along with the woman, and into a city truly made of gold, El Dorado. They are brought to the city's elders, kind-hearted Chief Tannabok and wicked high priest Tzekel-Kan. Tzekel-Kan, seeking to seize the city from Tannabok, insists that the two, mistaken as gods, demonstrate their powers. Tulio and Miguel bicker between themselves, while a nearby volcano begins to erupt. When Tulio yells at Miguel to stop pestering him, the volcano suddenly stops erupting, and the citizens take this as proof of their godhood. Celebrations are held, and the pair are given luxurious quarters to stay, along with charge of the woman, Chel. Chel is aware the two are conning the people but promises to remain quiet if they take her with them when they leave the city. The two are showered with gifts of gold from Tannabok, but disapproves Tzekel-Kan in sacrificing a civilian as the gods' ritual. Tulio convinces Tannabok to build them a vessel that will allow them to leave the city with all the gifts they've been given, which will take three days.

On one side stand those who see clothes dryers as a waste of energy and a major polluter of the environment.As a result, they are turning to clotheslines as part of the \\"what-I-can-do environmentalism.\\" On the other side are people who are against drying clothes outside, arguing that clotheslines are unpleasant to look at.They have persuaded Homeowners Associations (HOAs) access the U.S.to ban outdoor clotheslines, because clothesline drying also tends to lower home value in the neighborhood. This has led to a Right-to-Dry Movement that is calling for laws to be passed to protect people's right to use clotheslines.So far, only three states have laws to protect clothesline.Right-to-Dry supporters argue that there should be more. Matt Reck, 37, is the kind of eco-conscious person who feeds his trees with bathwater and reuses water drops from his air conditioners to water plants.His family also uses a clothesline.But on July 9, 2007, the HOA in Wake Forest, North Carolina, told him that a dissatisfied neighbor had telephoned them about his clothesline.The Recks paid no attention to the warning and still dried their clothes on a line in the yard.\\"Many people say they are environmentally friendly but they don't take matters into their own hands,\\" says Reck.The local HOA has decided not to take any action, unless more neighbors come to them. North Carolina lawmakers are saying that banning clotheslines is not the right thing to do.But HOAs and housing businesses believe that clothesline drying reminds people of poor neighborhoods.They worry that if buyers think their future neighbors can't even afford dryers, housing prices will fall. Environmentalists say such worries are not necessary, and in view of global warming, that idea needs to change.As they say, \\"The clothesline is beautiful.Hanging clothes outside should be encouraged.We all have to do at least something to slow down the process of global warming.\\" Question: Who are in favor of clothesline drying? Yes or no, is the answer \\"Environmentalists.\\"? A:","response":"Yes, environmentalists are in favor of clothesline drying. They believe that using clotheslines is a more eco-friendly and energy-efficient alternative to using clothes dryers, which consume energy and contribute to pollution.

The war dispersed the city's numerous Japanese-American businessmen due to the Japanese American internment. After the war, the local economy dipped. It rose again with Boeing's growing dominance in the commercial airliner market. Seattle celebrated its restored prosperity and made a bid for world recognition with the Century 21 Exposition, the 1962 World's Fair. Another major local economic downturn was in the late 1960s and early 1970s, at a time when Boeing was heavily affected by the oil crises, loss of Government contracts, and costs and delays associated with the Boeing 747. Many people left the area to look for work elsewhere, and two local real estate agents put up a billboard reading \\"Will the last person leaving Seattle – Turn out the lights.\\"Seattle remained the corporate headquarters of Boeing until 2001, when the company separated its headquarters from its major production facilities; the headquarters were moved to Chicago. The Seattle area is still home to Boeing's Renton narrow-body plant (where the 707, 720, 727, and 757 were assembled, and the 737 is assembled today) and Everett wide-body plant (assembly plant for the 747, 767, 777, and 787). The company's credit union for employees, BECU, remains based in the Seattle area, though it is now open to all residents of Washington. Another boom began as the city emerged from the Great Recession which commenced when Amazon.com moved its headquarters from North Beacon Hill to South Lake Union. This initiated a historic construction boom which resulted in the completion of almost 10,000 apartments in Seattle in 2017, which is more than any previous year and nearly twice as many as were built in 2016. Beginning in 2010, and for the next five years, Seattle gained an average of 14,511 residents per year, with the growth strongly skewed toward the center of the city, as unemployment dropped from roughly 9 percent to 3.6 percent. The city has found itself..., what would be the answer ? Answer:","response":"Based on the information provided in the article, it is difficult to directly determine the number of homeless people in the city with an unemployment rate of 3.6 percent. However, we can attempt to make an educated estimate by considering the factors mentioned in the article and available data on homelessness and unemployment. The article primarily discusses the history of Seattle, emphasizing the role of Boeing aircraft and the growth of the city following World War II. It further describes how Seattle experienced an economic boom after recovering from the Great Recession, resulting in a significant increase in construction and a drop in unemployment from 9 percent to 3.6 percent. According to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Annual Homelessness Assessment Report (AHAR) for 2020, there were 11,751 homeless individuals in Seattle/King County on a single night in January 2020. To determine the approximate number of homeless people in the city with an unemployment rate of 3.6 percent, we can utilize the ratios of homeless individuals to the overall population and the relationship between homelessness and unemployment. As per the article, Seattle gained an average of 14,511 residents per year between 2010 and 2015, and its population was strongly centered within the city itself. Assuming that the population growth rate and the concentration of people within the city remained consistent, we can estimate Seattle's current population. The population of Seattle in 2010 was approximately 608,660, and according to the article, Seattle gained 14,511 residents per year in the subsequent five years, which results in an estimated population of 680,615 by 2015. Next, we'll consider the relationship between homelessness and unemployment. While there isn't a one-to-one correspondence between unemployment and homelessness, it is reasonable to expect a higher unemployment rate to correlate with a higher rate of homelessness, and vice versa. The article mentions that Seattle experienced a drop in the unemployment rate from roughly 9 percent to 3.6 percent. Unfortunately, as we cannot establish a direct relationship between the unemployment rate and the number of homeless people, it is not possible to provide a precise answer. However, considering the information provided, we could expect that the number of homeless individuals in the city decreased as the unemployment rate dropped from 9 percent to 3.6 percent. In order to obtain an accurate estimate of the number of homeless people in the city with a 3.6 percent unemployment rate, it would be necessary to access updated and more comprehensive data on the relationship between homelessness and unemployment."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Combine facts and answer this: What year was the player born in that signed as a free agent with the San Antonio Spurs after the 2003–04 Seattle SuperSonics season?

Choices: - order - tiredness - neatness - pass out - invigorating The rationale to choose \\"tiredness\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","response":"The rationale to choose \\"tiredness\\" as the answer is based on the understanding that cleaning the house often involves a significant amount of physical effort and energy expenditure. When you engage in activities such as sweeping, dusting, scrubbing, and organizing, your muscles work and you burn calories, which may cause you to feel tired afterward. Additionally, the mental aspect of decision-making and strategizing while cleaning may also contribute to feelings of exhaustion. While some of the other choices may occur as a result of cleaning the house, they are not primarily what will happen to you. Here's an explanation for each of the other choices: - Order: Cleaning the house will indeed result in order, but this is an outcome for the house, not for you. The question asks what will happen to you after cleaning the house, and order refers to the environment being more organized and orderly, not directly affecting you as an individual. - Neatness: Similar to order, neatness is an outcome for the house after cleaning. The space will appear more neat and visually appealing, but this doesn't directly address what will happen to you as a person. - Pass out: While it's possible that someone may feel extremely exhausted after cleaning, to the point of passing out, this is not a common or expected outcome. For most people, tiredness would appropriately describe their state after cleaning, rather than passing out. - Invigorating: While some people might feel invigorated or satisfied after cleaning their house, this is more of an emotional response and not the primary physical outcome experienced by the majority of people. Generally, feelings of invigoration depend on personal preferences and attitudes towards cleaning, but tiredness remains a more universally applicable answer given the physical exertion involved in the process. In conclusion, \\"tiredness\\" is the most appropriate answer as it directly addresses what will happen to you, the individual, after cleaning the house, taking into consideration the physical and mental effort required by the activity."},{"question":"This is some data: Auburn, Alabama, country, United States; United States, language, English language.

Reasoning: Water is an essential component for life, and humans need it to maintain proper hydration, regulate body temperature, and carry out various other necessary functions, such as digestion and waste elimination.

On the east coast lies Mega-City One, a violent metropolis with 800 million residents and 17,000 crimes reported daily. There, an addictive new drug called \\"Slo-Mo\\" has been introduced, which slows the user's perception of time to 1% of normal. The only force for order are the Judges, who act as judge, jury and executioner. Judge Dredd (Karl Urban) is tasked by the Chief Judge (Rakie Ajola) with evaluating new recruit Cassandra Anderson (Olivia Thrilby), a powerful psychic who failed the aptitude tests to be a Judge.In Peach Trees, a 200-storey slum tower block, drug lord Madeline Madrigal, also known as \\"Ma-Ma\\" (Lena Headley), executes three rogue drug dealers (Travis Snyders, Chad Phillips) by having them skinned, infused with Slo-Mo and thrown down the atrium from the top floor. Dredd and Anderson are sent in to investigate and learn of a drug den, which they raid. They arrest a thug named Kay (Wood Harris), whom Anderson's mind probe reveals to be the one who carried out the drug dealers' execution. Dredd decides to take him in for questioning. In response, Ma-Ma's forces seize the tower's security control room and seal the building, using its blast shields under the pretence of a security test, preventing the Judges from leaving or summoning help.Ma-Ma orders Dredd and Anderson killed, and the Judges fight their way through dozens of armed thugs. Arriving at the 76th floor, the Judges are assaulted by Ma-Ma and her men with miniguns that rip through the walls, killing numerous residents.

The phrase \\"Víš, co děláš?\\" is in Czech and translates to \\"Do you know what you are doing?\\" in English. Here is a detailed and long answer explaining the translation: The Czech language belongs to the West Slavic branch of the Slavic language family, alongside Polish and Slovak. It is spoken primarily in the Czech Republic but also in various Czech communities across the globe. English, on the other hand, is a West Germanic language primarily spoken in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and several other countries throughout the world. To understand the translation of \\"Víš, co děláš?\\" to \\"Do you know what you are doing?\\" it is useful to break down the Czech phrase into its individual parts and examine how they translate to English: 1. \\"Víš\\" - This word is a verb in the second person singular form, derived from the Czech infinitive verb \\"vědět,\\" which means \\"to know\\" in English. \\"Víš\\" specifically translates to \\"you know\\" or \\"do you know\\" in English, as it is a question and not a statement. 2. \\"co\\" - This is a Czech pronoun meaning \\"what\\" in English. It is a simple but essential word used to ask questions or provide explanations about specific details or aspects within a situation. 3. \\"děláš\\" - This word is also a verb in the second person singular form, derived from the Czech infinitive verb \\"dělat,\\" which means \\"to do\\" or \\"to make\\" in English. \\"Děláš\\" specifically translates to \\"you do\\" or \\"you are doing\\" in English, again keeping in mind it is a part of a question. Putting these words together in the correct order in English, you get the phrase \\"Do you know what you are doing?\\" This sentence is an inquiry, asking the person if they are aware of their actions or if they possess the necessary knowledge or competence to perform a specific task or activity. In conclusion, the Czech phrase \\"Víš, co děláš?\\" translates to the English phrase \\"Do you know what you are doing?\\" The translation involves analyzing and understanding the individual components of the Czech phrase, including their grammatical forms and meanings, before accurately representing them in the target language, English."},{"question":"For this chain-of-thought reasoning and answer, what was the question?

Sentence 2: The 1940 San Diego State College football team represent San Diego State Aztecs during the 1940 College Football season . Do these two sentences convey the same information? Pick your answer from: [1]. no. [2]. yes.","response":"[2]. yes. Both Sentence 1 and Sentence 2 convey the same information, which is about the 1940 San Diego State College football team representing the San Diego State Aztecs during the 1940 college football season. Although the wording in the two sentences appears slightly different (e.g., the present tense \\"represented\\" in Sentence 1 vs. the present tense \\"represent\\" in Sentence 2), the core information they express is identical. In Sentence 1, with the use of the past tense verb \\"represented\\", it suggests that the team participated in the past, which is accurate since the season took place in 1940. Sentence 2, on the other hand, simply shifts the verb tense to the present tense \\"represent\\" but does not significantly change the intended meaning. Both sentences describe the same team and the same season, so they effectively communicate the same idea. In summary, the two sentences may have slightly different verb tenses, but both provide the same essential information about the 1940 San Diego State College football team's representation of the San Diego State Aztecs during the 1940 college football season. Therefore, the answer is [2]. yes, as both sentences convey the same information."},{"question":"Continue the following story. Kyle crowded in on Lawrence, trying to intimidate them with their size, because (a). Kyle was a pushover.. (b). Lawrence was a pushover..","response":"Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Kyle who was much bigger than his friend Lawrence. One day, they were playing together, and Kyle decided to stand very close to Lawrence, trying to make him feel scared. This is called \\"intimidating.\\" Now, let me explain what it means to be a pushover. A pushover is someone who is easily influenced or controlled by others. They might have a hard time saying \\"no\\" or standing up for themselves. In the story, Kyle was trying to intimidate Lawrence because he thought that Lawrence was a pushover. Kyle believed that since Lawrence was smaller, he could control him and make him do what he wanted. What Kyle didn't realize was that being smaller doesn't always mean being a pushover. It's important to remember that everyone has their own strengths, and size doesn't determine a person's heart or courage. In the end, Lawrence proved that he was not a pushover, and he stood up for himself. He told Kyle that it's not fair to try to control someone just because they're smaller.

Options: - yes - it is not possible to tell - no What is the step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the answer: it is not possible to tell?","response":"Step 1: Identify the statements Statement 1: \\"A stork flying low over the water.\\" Statement 2: \\"The stork is hunting for fish.\\" Step 2: Examine statement 1 \\"A stork flying low over the water\\" describes the action of a stork flying at a low altitude above a water body. However, it does not provide information about the intention or reasons behind this action. Step 3: Examine statement 2 \\"The stork is hunting for fish\\" suggests a specific reason for the stork's low flight, implying that it is searching for fish to catch and eat. Step 4: Comparison of the two statements While it is possible that the stork is flying low over the water to hunt for fish, there is no direct evidence in statement 1 to confirm this. We can consider other possibilities, such as the stork is flying low because it is tired, or it is avoiding predators. Step 5: Analyze the options Option 1: yes The answer \\"yes\\" suggests that statement 1 directly implies statement 2. However, based on our analysis in step 4, there is no direct evidence in statement 1 indicating that the stork is hunting for fish. Option 2: it is not possible to tell The answer \\"it is not possible to tell\\" acknowledges that there is no direct evidence in statement 1 to confirm whether the stork is hunting for fish or not. This option takes into account the possibility of multiple explanations for the stork's behavior. Option 3: no The answer \\"no\\" suggests that statement 1 contradicts statement 2. However, statement 1 does not provide any information that refutes the possibility that the stork is hunting for fish. Step 6: Choose the best answer Based on the comparison, evaluations of each option, and our step-by-step reasoning process, the best answer is \\"it is not possible to tell\\" because there is no direct evidence in statement 1 to confirm that the stork is hunting for fish."},{"question":"What is the answer to this question? when was part c of eahca passed into law?","response":"Part C of EAHCA, also known as the Early Intervention program, was passed into law on October 8, 1986.

Brzezinski died May 26 in Virginia. He was 86. In a statement, Carter called Brzezinski “a superb public servant” as well as “brilliant, dedicated and loyal.” Along with Henry Kissinger, Brzezinski helped shape U.S. foreign policy with a lasting impact, while also serving as an adviser to Presidents Lyndon Johnson and John F. Kennedy. One of his most well-known accomplishments came in 1978, when Brzezinski helped President Carter reach an agreement between Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat to secure the Camp David peace accords between the two countries. He also was involved in making other major U.S. foreign policy decisions during the Carter administration, including negotiating the Panama Canal Treaty, arming mujahedin in Afghanistan to fight the Soviet invaders and planning a failed mission to rescue 52 American hostages held in Iran. Alexander Vershbow, a former deputy secretary general of NATO and former U.S. ambassador to Russia, told VOA Brzezinski's wisdom also guided U.S. and NATO policy in the post-Cold War period. “On one hand, listening to the appeals of countries like Poland, like Czechoslovakia, like Hungary, to become part of the Western family, which they were denied 70 years ago ... but also reaching out to Russia, and trying to help Russia become an integral part of the European family, the common European house, as [former Soviet leader Mikhail] Gorbachev described it,” Vershbow said.

The children, Chase and Cole, don't know they were abducted, Patricia Hauser said. All they know is they were on an \\"adventure,\\" she said Thursday. The boys -- 2 and 4 -- appeared in front of reporters after Hauser spoke, smiling and showing off toys. \\"We have not asked the boys anything about the journey. We are just letting them tell us as things come out if they feel like talking,\\" said Hauser, who along with her husband was given legal custody of the children April 2. Police say their father, Josh Hakken, broke into the home where the boys were living with their grandparents a day later, tying up their grandmother before whisking the two children away. Authorities say they traveled to Cuba on a sailboat. Authorities reunited the boys with Hauser and her husband on Wednesday after Cuban authorities turned the parents and the children over to U.S. officials. Boys reunite with grandparents. Hauser thanked U.S. State Department and Cuban officials for their work to find the children and bring them back to Florida. \\"They called us from Cuba and let us talk to the boys before their plane even left,\\" she said. \\"Many tears were shed in that room from us.\\" She said the family would not have any more news conferences or interviews, and asked that the media and public respect their privacy. \\"We are trying very hard to shield the boys from media coverage, and we want them to get back to their normal everyday schedules and just be normal carefree boys again,\\" she said. According to search warrant documents released Thursday by Florida authorities, Hauser told investigators that Hakken and his wife, Sharyn, had \\"previously discussed suicide.\\" The documents, citing the boys' grandmother, also allege the boys' father tied her to a filing cabinet with plastic cable ties before abducting the children \\"with force.\\" Thursday night, an attorney for the Hakkens agreed to the prosecution's request that the Hakkens remain jailed without bond until trial. The next hearing is May 30. The judge also appointed a public defender to represent the couple after they said they wouldn't be able to pay for a lawyer on their own. Later, the state attorney's office filed formal charges against the Hakkens, including two counts of felony kidnapping. Given Florida sentencing guidelines, a conviction on the kidnapping charges could mean the Hakkens will spend the rest of their lives behind bars. Among the 11 counts, the couple was also charged with burglary, false imprisonment and child abuse. Police: Parents talked of 'journey to the Armageddon' The circumstances leading up to the ordeal began in June when the family was staying at a hotel in Slidell, Louisiana. Responding to a call, police officers found the parents \\"acting in a bizarre manner,\\" Slidell police said in a statement. Inside the room where the boys were, authorities found narcotics and weapons. \\"They were talking about 'completing their ultimate journey' and were traveling across the country to 'take a journey to the Armageddon,'\\" police said about the parents. Louisiana authorities took the children from their parents after that incident. About two weeks later, the father showed up at a foster family home with a gun and demanded the return of the boys, Slidell police said. He fled after the foster parents called 911. Over subsequent months, the parents \\"did not participate in the system,\\" said Sheriff David Gee of Hillsborough County. He did not offer details. \\"As a result of that, the authorities in Louisiana gave custody to the grandparents,\\" he said. That transfer became official on April 2, when a Louisiana judge terminated the suspects' parental rights. Early the next morning, Patricia Hauser told police, Josh Hakken entered her Florida home, tied her up and sped away with the children and the family dog in a silver 2009 Toyota Camry. They met up with Sharyn Hakken, sheriff's investigators said, and eventually ended up on a 25-foot sailboat named Salty. The boat's seller later tipped off authorities after word got out about the alleged abduction. It was at the Hemingway Marina just west of Havana, on Tuesday, that CNN found the family -- hunkered inside the boat, under the watch of Cuban security forces. That morning, U.S. officials in Havana told CNN that they were afraid the children could be in danger from their parents. Armed Cuban security agents watched over the family most of the day until the parents and children were led away peacefully that afternoon. Boys 'fine, happy and sleepy' on return to U.S. Cuba and the United States are divided by far more than the Straits of Florida. But this week, U.S. officials repeatedly expressed their appreciation for the Cuban government's \\"extensive cooperation.\\" The Cuban Foreign Ministry said the boat pulled into the marina in bad weather Sunday. The two governments shared information, which led to the return of the family and their dog to the United States.

The premise \\"Not what our grandmothers would call a proposal\\" suggests that what is being discussed is so far removed from traditional ideas of a proposal that it would not be recognized as such by our grandmothers. This statement holds some assumptions like: 1. Our grandmothers have relatively conservative or traditional views regarding proposals. 2. The idea being discussed deviates significantly from those traditional views. To explore the hypothesis \\"Our grandmothers would not call this a proposal or help you with a good one,\\" we can break it down into two main parts: A. Our grandmothers would not call this a proposal. B. Our grandmothers would not help you with a good one. Part A of the hypothesis aligns well with the premise, as both imply that our grandmothers would not recognize the non-traditional idea as a proposal. With this understanding, we can conclude that there is a strong connection between the premise and Part A of the hypothesis, making it highly likely that Part A is true. However, Part B of the hypothesis is not directly addressed or implied by the premise. There is no information provided on whether our grandmothers would be willing or able to offer assistance in crafting a more suitable proposal. This leaves room for interpretation and assumptions: 1. It could be assumed that our grandmothers, given their presumably more traditional views, would likely be able to provide guidance on crafting an acceptable proposal, but we cannot infer this conclusively based solely on the premise. 2. Alternatively, one could argue that, given their traditional views, our grandmothers might not want to be involved in any form of proposal that deviates from their beliefs, even if they are asked to help make it more traditional. This interpretation would support Part B of the hypothesis, but again, it cannot be conclusively confirmed based on the premise alone. In conclusion, the premise \\"Not what our grandmothers would call a proposal\\" clearly supports Part A of the hypothesis, \\"Our grandmothers would not call this a proposal.\\" However, the premise does not provide sufficient information to definitively confirm or refute Part B of the hypothesis, \\"Our grandmothers would not help you with a good one.\\" As such, we can only conclude that while the overall hypothesis is partly supported by the premise, it cannot be definitively verified as entirely true based solely on the given information."},{"question":"What is the solution? Solve 54*a = -1548 + 630 for a.","response":"Alright, let's solve the equation step by step, like we're helping a five-year-old understand! We have the equation: 54 * a = -1548 + 630 First, let's simplify the right side of the equation. We need to add -1548 and 630: -1548 + 630 = -918 Now, our equation looks like this: 54 * a = -918 To solve for 'a,' we need to get 'a' alone on one side of the equals sign. To do that, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 54, because 54 * a means 54 times a. So when we divide by 54, we get: (54 * a) / 54 = -918 / 54 On the left side, 54 divided by 54 equals 1 (54 / 54 = 1), so we are just left with 'a': a = -918 / 54 Now, let's divide -918 by 54: -918 / 54 = -17 So, the solution for 'a' is: a = -17"},{"question":"Read this and answer the question Countering Krugman, Peter J.

Answer:","response":"As an AI, I am unable to provide the current local time directly. However, I can explain how to find the current time in the United Kingdom. The local time in the United Kingdom is based on Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) or British Summer Time (BST), depending on the time of the year. During standard time, the UK follows GMT, and when daylight saving time is in effect (usually between the last Sunday of March and the last Sunday of October), the UK follows BST, which is one hour ahead of GMT. To find the current local time in the UK, you can follow these methods: 1. Check an online source: There are several websites that display the current local time in the UK with high accuracy. Some of these websites are: - www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/uk - www.worldclock.com/uk - www.thetimenow.com/uk 2. Use your smartphone or computer: Most smartphones and computers have the ability to display local time for different cities and countries. Check the settings on your device and add the UK as a location. The device will then show the current local time in the UK, automatically adjusting for daylight saving time if required. 3. Contact someone in the UK: If you know someone in the United Kingdom, you can give them a call or send them a message to ask for the current local time. Remember that the current local time in the UK will depend on the time difference between your location and the UK, and whether daylight saving time is in effect or not."},{"question":"I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it. Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"These limitations have caused problems. For example, before 2005, DST in Israel varied each year and was skipped some years. Windows 95 used rules correct for 1995 only, causing problems in later years. In Windows 98, Microsoft marked Israel as not having DST, forcing Israeli users to shift their computer clocks manually twice a year. The 2005 Israeli Daylight Saving Law established predictable rules using the Jewish calendar but Windows zone files could not represent the rules' dates in a year-independent way. Partial workarounds, which mishandled older time stamps, included manually switching zone files every year and a Microsoft tool that switches zones automatically. In 2013, Israel standardized its daylight saving time according to the Gregorian calendar.\\"?","response":"There could be several possible questions to test comprehension of the passage. Here are a few examples: 1. According to the passage, what problems were encountered due to the limitations of the Daylight Saving Time (DST) in Israel before 2005? Answer: The DST in Israel varied each year before 2005 and sometimes was skipped, leading to issues in software like Windows 95 and 98 because they were either based on 1995 DST rules or didn't recognize DST in Israel at all. As a result, Israeli users had to manually adjust their computer clocks twice a year. 2. How did the implementation of the 2005 Israeli Daylight Saving Law attempt to resolve these issues? Answer: The 2005 Israeli Daylight Saving Law established consistent, predictable rules for DST using the Jewish calendar. However, this didn't solve the problem completely because Windows zone files couldn't represent the rules' dates in a year-independent manner. 3. What workarounds were used to cope with the limitations in Windows operating system's handling of Israeli DST? Answer: Partial workarounds included manually switching zone files every year and using a Microsoft tool that switches zones automatically. However, these remedies were imperfect and could result in errors with older time stamps. 4. In which year did Israel standardize its daylight saving time according to the Gregorian calendar and why might this have been significant? Answer: Israel standardized its daylight saving time in 2013 according to the Gregorian calendar. The significance is not explicitly stated in the passage, but it can be inferred that this could make it easier for systems like Windows, which are likely based on the widely-used Gregorian calendar, to handle Israeli DST. 5. What problems did the limitations of Windows 95 and 98 present to Israeli users, according to the passage? Answer: Windows 95 only used DST rules from 1995 which became outdated in subsequent years, while Windows 98 did not recognize Israel as having DST at all. This forced Israeli users to manually change their computer clocks twice a year. These questions not only test fact recall from the passage, but also the ability to infer and interpret based on the given information.

Yes or no. A:","response":"No, that answer is not entirely correct. Although raster-to-vector conversion is related to raster images, your originally mentioned \\"raster wiki\\" seems to be referring to the term \\"raster graphics,\\" particularly in the context of computer graphics technology. Raster graphics, also known as bitmap images, are digital images that consist of a grid of pixels (picture elements), each with assigned colors or values. These images are resolution-dependent, meaning that when they are scaled or enlarged, they can lose quality and exhibit pixelation. Common raster image file formats include JPEG, PNG, GIF, and BMP. On the other hand, the raster-to-vector conversion process, which you mentioned in your query, is a technique for converting a raster image into a vector image. Vector graphics use geometric shapes or paths (e.g., points, lines, curves, and polygons) to represent images in computer graphics. These vector images are resolution-independent, allowing them to be scaled or enlarged without losing image quality. Common vector image file formats include SVG, AI, and EPS. In summary, while the answer you found is related to raster graphics, it does not directly address the core concept of raster graphics. Raster graphics are digital images made up of a grid of colored pixels, whereas raster-to-vector conversion is a technique used to convert raster images into vector images, which are made up of geometric shapes and paths."},{"question":"Un autre décret suprême, approuvé en avril 2002, permet d'obtenir gratuitement le certificat de naissance des enfants nés depuis janvier de la même année.

A: a bully B: an anime fan C: a nice person A:","response":"According to the context provided, Lee would best be described as a bully (Option A). This is because Lee made fun of Jan for wearing her favorite anime shirt to school, which shows a lack of respect and consideration for Jan's feelings and interests. Instead of quietly appreciating or just ignoring Jan's choice of shirt, Lee chose to ridicule her, demonstrating their inclination towards being a bully. Although one might suspect that Lee could potentially be an anime fan (Option B), there is no information in the context provided to suggest that this might be the case. It is more likely that Lee's behavior resulted from a desire to assert dominance or belittle Jan rather than sharing an interest in anime. Option C, describing Lee as a nice person, is the least fitting of all the descriptions given the circumstances. The act of making fun of someone for their interests or clothing choices is not a characteristic of a nice person. Instead, a nice person would respect and encourage others to embrace their interests, even if they do not share the same enthusiasm.

Soon afterwards, he became interested in the UK skiffle craze and developed a fervent admiration for the genre. In 1957, he co-founded his first band, the Eddie Clayton Skiffle Group, which earned several prestigious local bookings before the fad succumbed to American rock and roll by early 1958. When the Beatles formed in 1960, Starr was a member of another Liverpool group, Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. After achieving moderate success in the UK and Hamburg, he quit the Hurricanes and joined the Beatles in August 1962, replacing Pete Best. Starr played key roles in the Beatles' films and appeared in numerous others. After the band's break-up in 1970, he released several successful singles including the US number-four hit \\"It Don't Come Easy\\", and number ones \\"Photograph\\" and \\"You're Sixteen\\". In 1972, he released his most successful UK single, \\"Back Off Boogaloo\\", which peaked at number two. He achieved commercial and critical success with his 1973 album Ringo, which was a top-ten release in both the UK and the US. He has featured in a number of documentaries and hosted television shows.

As of 2015, Parkway Drive has released five full-length albums (\\"Killing with a Smile\\", \\"Horizons\\", \\"Deep Blue\\", \\"Atlas\\" and \\"Ire\\"), one EP, two DVDs, a split album and one book, titled \\"Ten Years of Parkway Drive\\". The band's latest four albums have reached the top 10 of the Australian ARIA Charts, with \\"Ire\\" reaching number 1 in October 2015. - Grindcore is an extreme genre of music that originated in the early to mid-1980s. It draws inspiration from some of the most abrasive-sounding genres including hardcore punk, thrash metal, crust punk, industrial, death metal and noise rock. Grindcore is characterized by a noise-filled sound that uses heavily distorted, down-tuned guitars, grinding overdriven bass, high speed tempo, blast beats, and vocals which consist of growls and high-pitched shrieks. Early groups like Napalm Death are credited with laying the groundwork for the style. It is most prevalent today in North America and Europe, with popular contributors such as Brutal Truth and Nasum. Lyrical themes range from a primary focus on social and political concerns, to gory subject matter and black humor. - Pantera was an American heavy metal band from Arlington, Texas. The group was formed in 1981 by the Abbott brothers drummer Vinnie Paul and guitarist Dimebag Darrell along with vocalist Terry Glaze. Bassist Rex Brown joined the band the following year, replacing the original unofficial bass guitarist Tommy D. Bradford. Having started as a glam metal band, Pantera released four albums during the 1980s. Looking for a new and heavier sound, Pantera replaced Glaze with Phil Anselmo in late 1986 and released \\"Power Metal\\" in 1988. With its fifth album, 1990's \\"Cowboys from Hell\\", Pantera introduced a groove metal sound. Pantera's sixth album, 1992's \\"Vulgar Display of Power\\", exhibited an even heavier sound. \\"Far Beyond Driven\\" (1994) debuted at number one on the \\"Billboard\\" 200. - Age of Ruin is an American metalcore band from Fairfax, Virginia. The group formed in 1998 and released a demo album the following year. The band's first full-length album was self-released in 2000. - Metalcore is a broad fusion genre of extreme metal and hardcore punk. The word is a blend of the names of the two genres. Among other genres blending metal and hardcore, such as crust punk and grindcore, metalcore is noted for its use of breakdowns, which are slow, intense passages that are conducive to moshing. Pioneering metalcore bandssuch as Integrity, Earth Crisis and Converge, all of which had formed by 1990are described as leaning more toward hardcore, with their style sometimes being called metallic hardcore, whereas later bandssuch as Killswitch Engage, All That Remains, As I Lay Dying, Bullet for My Valentine, and Parkway Drive are described as leaning more towards metal. Pantera (who influenced Trivium, Atreyu, Bleeding Through and Unearth) and Sepultura have been particularly influential to the development of metalcore in the 2000s, which saw many bands in the genre achieve considerable commercial success. - Bleeding Through was an American metalcore band from Orange County, California. Formed in 1999, the band blended influences stemming from modern hardcore punk, symphonic black metal, and melodic death metal. Although the band was often labeled as simply metalcore, when Brandan Schieppati was asked if he considered Bleeding Through a hardcore band, he said: \\"I think we're a hardcore band and I'll never say we are a metal band, we're all hardcore kids and we came from the hardcore scene. Ours is just a different version of hardcore, we're trying to do something which adds a different variety to the hardcore scene, which has been sounding the same way for so long.\\" - Alveran Records was a German-based independent record label, founded in 1995 by Sascha Franzen, which releases a diverse variety of bands with different musical styles. Mainly focused on everything between metal and hardcore, there are also rock, emo and punk bands who find their way to the label's roster. Alveran is also the European partner for the US-based labels Eulogy Recordings and Hand of Hope Records. In April 2006, Alveran became the official partner of Abacus Recordings in Europe, providing Alveran the opportunity to release selected titles from the Abacus Recordings catalogue in Europe as partners. - The Tides Of Tragedy is the second full - length album by American metalcore band Age of Ruin . It was released in the United States on June 22 , 2004 via Eulogy Records and in Europe on December 13 , 2004 via Alveran Records . - Extreme metal is a loosely defined umbrella term for a number of related heavy metal music subgenres that have developed since the early 1980s. It has been defined as a \\"cluster of metal subgenres characterized by sonic, verbal and visual transgression\\". The term usually refers to a more abrasive, harsher, underground, non-commercialized style or sound associated with the speed metal, thrash metal, death metal, black metal and doom metal genres. With the exception of doom metal, all of these genres are characterized by fast tempos, attesting to their roots in hardcore punk, which has also fused with extreme metal in the forms of crossover thrash, crust punk, grindcore, sludge metal and metalcore. Though many extreme sub-styles are not very well known to mainstream music fans, extreme metal has influenced an array of musical performers inside and outside of heavy metal. - Bullet for My Valentine, often abbreviated as BFMV or B4MV, are a Welsh heavy metal band from Bridgend, formed in 1998. The band is composed of Matthew Tuck (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Michael Paget (lead guitar, backing vocals), Michael Thomas (drums) and Jamie Mathias (bass guitar). Former members include Nick Crandle and Jason James; both were on bass. They were formed under the name Jeff Killed John and started their music career by covering songs by Metallica and Nirvana. Jeff Killed John recorded six songs which were not released; two of these tracks were reworked later in their career as Bullet for My Valentine. Financial difficulties dictated the name change, which was followed by a change in music direction. In 2002, the band secured a five-album deal with Sony BMG. The band has stated that their music is influenced by classic metal acts such as Metallica, Iron Maiden and Slayer. The band is part of the Cardiff music scene. - Hardcore punk (often abbreviated to hardcore) is a punk rock music genre that originated in the late 1970s. It is generally faster, harder, and more aggressive than other forms of punk rock. Its roots can be traced to earlier punk scenes in San Francisco and Southern California which arose as a reaction against the still predominant hippie cultural climate of the time and was also inspired by New York punk rock and early proto-punk. New York punk had a harder-edged sound than its San Francisco counterpart, featuring anti-art expressions of masculine anger, energy and subversive humor. Hardcore punk generally disavows commercialism, the established music industry and \\"anything similar to the characteristics of mainstream rock\\" and often addresses social and political topics. - Killswitch Engage is an American metalcore band from Westfield, Massachusetts, formed in 1999 after the disbanding of Overcast and Aftershock. Killswitch Engage's current lineup consists of vocalist Jesse Leach, guitarists Joel Stroetzel and Adam Dutkiewicz, bassist Mike D'Antonio, and drummer Justin Foley. The band has released seven studio albums and one DVD. Their latest album, \\"Incarnate\\", was released on March 11, 2016.

Richard Harris plays Quint.. I'm sorry, that's wrong, he plays Captain Nolan, a fisherman who catches sharks for a living, but is lured by the big catch, and tries to catch a killer whale. When the capture of a female killer whale goes awry (don't ask) it's mate (don't ask) goes on a rampage (don't ask) and starts STALKING Captain Nolan (Don't ask). Soon, Captain Nolan realizes that they have something in common (don't ask). Pretty amazing film-making here folks. I got to tell you though, the beginning (with the whale noises and nothing much else) is pretty haunting and the end credits (with the most godawful song) is pretty entertaining.","response":"The sentiment expressed in this review appears to be a mix of both positive and negative feelings toward the piece, leaning more towards the negative side. The author begins by describing the attempt to showcase the intelligence of Orcas as \\"fairly amusing,\\" which suggests a somewhat positive perception. However, they immediately follow this with criticism regarding the film's attempt to make the audience feel stupid through its ridiculous plot and execution. The reviewer continues to express their negative opinion, mentioning the portrayal of Richard Harris' character, Captain Nolan, as well as various aspects of the plot that they find to be implausible or nonsensical. The repeated use of the phrase \\"don't ask\\" implies that the author finds these elements to be absurd, further amplifying the negative sentiment. However, some positive aspects are acknowledged, such as the haunting whale noises at the film's beginning and the entertaining nature of the end credits song. These elements seem to provide some level of enjoyment for the reviewer, despite their overall negative perception of the film. In conclusion, the sentiment of this review can be described as predominantly negative with occasional positive aspects, resulting in a predominantly unfavorable opinion of the film. The author finds the film to be ridiculous and poorly executed but recognizes some aspects that they found entertaining or haunting."},{"question":"Write the next sentence in the following story.

Step 1: Break down the elements of the phrase. \\"toes the fine line\\" - This suggests that the subject is carefully balancing between two qualities. \\"cheese and earnestness\\" - 'Cheese' is generally used to describe something that is overly sentimental or cliched, which can be perceived negatively. 'Earnestness,' on the other hand, implies sincerity or seriousness, which can be perceived positively. \\"remarkably well\\" - This phrase has a positive connotation, meaning that the subject is doing something impressively or notably. Step 2: Analyze the combination of the elements in the context. Given that the subject is balancing between two qualities and doing it \\"remarkably well,\\" the phrase demonstrates that they have managed to find a good balance between the potentially negative quality (cheese) and the positive quality (earnestness). This balance is done skillfully, which adds a positive connotation. Step 3: Conclude whether the phrase is positive or negative. Considering the analysis, I would classify the phrase \\"toes the fine line between cheese and earnestness remarkably well\\" as positive, as it highlights a skillful balance between two qualities, with a greater emphasis on the positive aspect (earnestness)."},{"question":"Does the sentence \\"These activities enable the synchronization and integration of collection, processing, exploitation, analysis, and dissemination activities/resources to meet information requirements of national and military decision makers.\\" provide a valid answer to the question \\"What agency is in charge of intelligence requirements?\\"","response":"No, the given sentence does not provide a valid answer to the question “What agency is in charge of intelligence requirements?” The sentence talks about the process and purpose of intelligence activities rather than specifying a particular agency responsible for managing these requirements. To answer the question, one must discuss or identify specific agencies or organizations in charge of intelligence requirements, especially at the national level. In the United States, for example, there are several agencies responsible for various aspects of intelligence collection, analysis, and dissemination, which together make up the U.S. Intelligence Community (IC). Some of the main agencies within the U.S. Intelligence Community include: 1. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA): The CIA is an independent agency responsible for conducting intelligence and counterintelligence activities, focusing primarily on human intelligence (HUMINT) collection and analysis. 2. National Security Agency (NSA): The NSA is responsible for signals intelligence (SIGINT), which involves the collection, processing, and analysis of electronic communications and data. They also work towards protecting U.S. communications networks and information systems. 3. Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA): The DIA is a Department of Defense (DoD) agency that specializes in military intelligence. They support military planners and policymakers by providing information and analysis on foreign military capabilities, intentions, and activities. 4. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI): While the FBI is primarily a law enforcement organization, it also has an intelligence function, focusing on counterterrorism, counterintelligence, and cybersecurity. 5. Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI): The ODNI is responsible for overseeing the U.S. Intelligence Community and integrating the efforts of all intelligence agencies. It is also tasked with ensuring effective coordination of intelligence activities and setting the overall intelligence priorities. These are just a few examples of the many agencies that play a role in fulfilling the intelligence requirements of the United States. Other countries also have their intelligence agencies, such as the United Kingdom's Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) or Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR). In summary, the given sentence does not answer the question about which agency is in charge of intelligence requirements. To answer this question, it is necessary to discuss specific organizations and agencies that focus on intelligence collection, analysis, and dissemination."},{"question":"Sentence 1: Programs and state justice communities seek guidance on the intersection of race and poverty from national experts and focus on these issues in local, regional and state contexts.

POST : *names have been changed I recently left my job at a company I had been at for a number of years but stayed very close with my team. Last week my former boss, Susan, asked me to have lunch with her. We spent time chatting about different things, my new role, office drama pretty normal stuff. Then at the very end of the lunch she says to me “Did you know Rachel is getting married?”. I told her no, that I did not know &amp; she proceeded to tell me that she was getting married to a girl &amp; asks again if I knew she was a lesbian? Again, I told her no (I had suspected but never gave it much thought bc it’s not my business). Now, for context the reason I think she asked me was bc Rachel &amp; I were extremely close &amp; are still friends. To define close, we worked together frequently on projects &amp; interacted daily from both a work &amp; personal perspective. We would chat daily &amp; spend our lunch breaks walking around the city for at least an hour 3 or 4 times a week if not every day. During these walks we talked about everything both work &amp; our personal lives. I’d met her one sister multiple times &amp; knew her whole family by name. She knew everything about my personal life &amp; so on. Anyway, I would talk to her about my love life but she never mentioned hers much &amp; I never asked because anytime other people with bring it up she would just brush it off. No problem, it’s really not my place to ask anyway. Flash forward back to lunch with Susan, I was pretty surprised to hear this news, again, an engagement, wedding planning would be something I guessed we would have talked about. (When her sister got married I knew every detail!) Selfishly, of course I was a bit upset to hear since I would have LOVED to share in her joy, congratulate her &amp; celebrate with her.

Assuming that: Waves with shorter wavelengths have more energy. Answer:","response":"If Jimbo increases the wavelength of the soundwave he is generating, the energy carried by that soundwave will decrease. This conclusion can be drawn based on the given assumption that waves with shorter wavelengths have more energy. To understand this phenomenon, we need to consider the basic properties of sound waves and their relationship with energy. Sound waves are essentially mechanical waves that propagate through a medium, such as air or water, due to the vibration of particles. The energy carried by a sound wave can be described by its intensity or loudness, which in turn depends on two key properties: the amplitude and the frequency of the wave. The wavelength of a sound wave is inversely proportional to its frequency. This means that as the wavelength increases, the frequency decreases, and vice versa. Mathematically, this relationship can be expressed as: Frequency (f) = Speed of Sound (v) / Wavelength (λ) Considering the given assumption that waves with shorter wavelengths have more energy, the energy of a sound wave can be described as being directly proportional to its frequency: Energy ∝ Frequency Now, if Jimbo increases the wavelength of the soundwave, the frequency will decrease due to their inverse relationship. Consequently, the energy carried by the soundwave will also decrease, as the energy and frequency are directly proportional to each other. It's important to mention that the amplitude of a sound wave also plays a significant role in determining its energy. Higher amplitudes produce louder sounds, while lower amplitudes produce softer sounds. Nonetheless, the given assumption focuses on the relationship between wavelength and energy, implying that the amplitude remains constant in this scenario. In conclusion, when Jimbo increases the wavelength of the soundwave he is generating, the energy carried by that soundwave will decrease. This is due to the inverse relationship between wavelength and frequency, as well as the direct relationship between frequency and energy. Sound waves with longer wavelengths possess lower frequencies, which in turn carry less energy."},{"question":"Read the text and determine if the sentence is true (see options at the end): DMOZ (from \\"directory.mozilla.org\\", an earlier domain name) was a multilingual open-content directory of World Wide Web links.

Based on the preceding passage, answer the following question Why did he open the refrigerator ?","response":"In the preceding passage, the individual opened the refrigerator for multiple reasons. The primary goal was to retrieve some condiments for the hamburgers they were preparing. Condiments such as ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, pickles, or other potential toppings are often stored in the refrigerator to maintain freshness and extend their shelf life. Opening the refrigerator would be a typical action when searching for these items to complete the preparation of the hamburgers. Additionally, the person also wanted to obtain some cheese from the meat drawer. Cheese is another common ingredient in hamburgers that can enhance their flavor. Since cheese must be refrigerated to remain fresh and prevent spoilage, the meat drawer in a refrigerator is a suitable and expected place to store it. The meat drawer, generally designed for storing fresh meats and other perishable items, provides a suitable environment for cheese as these drawers are often engineered to preserve perishable items more effectively than other sections of the refrigerator. In summary, the individual opened the refrigerator to locate condiments and cheese to be used in combination with the hamburgers they were preparing, creating a flavorful and satisfying meal. The refrigerator and its compartments play a crucial role in preserving the quality, safety, and longevity of the ingredients used in cooking, which is why the person naturally sought these items within the refrigerator."},{"question":"Write an article based on this \\"Go to www.

The school, though, is owned by Delassalle's teacher wife, the frail Christina (Clouzot), and Delassalle flaunts his relationship with Nicole Horner (Signoret), a teacher at the school. Rather than antagonism, the two women are shown to have a somewhat close relationship, primarily based on their apparent mutual hatred of Michel, who is physically and emotionally abusive to both.Unable to stand his mistreatment any longer, Nicole devises a plan. Though hesitant at first, Christina ultimately consents to help Nicole. Using a threatened divorce to lure Michel to Nicole's apartment building in a remote village several hundred kilometers away, Christina sedates him. The two women then drown him in a bathtub and dump his body in the school's neglected swimming pool. When his corpse floats to the surface, they think it will appear to have been an accident. Almost everything goes according to their plans until the body fails to surface, and Michel's corpse is nowhere to be found when the pool is drained.Nicole sees in the paper that the police found the corpse. Christina goes to the morgue and learns it is not Michel's body. There she meets Alfred Fichet (Vanel), a retired private detective.

It is a six-minute suite, consisting of several sections without a chorus: an intro, a ballad segment, an operatic passage, a hard rock part and a reflective coda. The song is a more accessible take on the 1970s progressive rock genre. A rapid series of rhythmic and harmonic changes introduces a pseudo-operatic midsection, which contains the bulk of the elaborate vocal multi-tracking, depicting the narrator's descent into hell. While the underlying pulse of the song is maintained, the dynamics vary greatly from bar to bar, from only Mercury's voice accompanied by a piano to a multi-voice choir supported by drums, bass, piano and Timpani. The choir effect was created by having May, Mercury, and Taylor repeatedly sing their vocal parts, resulting in 180 separate overdubs. These overdubs were then combined into successive submixes. According to Roger Taylor, the voices of May, Mercury and himself combined created a wide vocal range: \\"Brian could get down quite low, Freddie had a powerful voice through the middle, and I was good at the high stuff.\\" The band wanted to create \\"a wall of sound, that starts down and goes all the way up\\". The band used the bell effect for lyrics \\"Magnifico\\" and \\"Let me go\\". Also, on \\"Let him go\\", Taylor singing the top section carries his note on further after the rest of the \\"choir\\" have stopped singing. Lyrical references in this passage include Scaramouche, the fandango, Galileo Galilei, Figaro, Beelzebub and Bismillah, as rival factions fight over the narrator's soul. The section concludes with a full choral treatment of the lyric \\"Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me!\\", on a block B major chord. Roger Taylor tops the final chord with a falsetto B in the fifth octave (B5). Using the 24-track technology available at the time, the \\"opera\\" section took about three weeks to finish. Producer Roy Thomas Baker said \\"Every time Freddie came up with another 'Galileo', I would add another piece of tape to the reel.\\" Baker recalls that they kept wearing out the tape, which meant having to do transfers. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: What was the meaning of the lyrics?","response":"The article does not explicitly provide the meaning of the lyrics in \\"Bohemian Rhapsody.\\" However, it mentions various lyrical references in the operatic passage, such as \\"Scaramouche, the fandango, Galileo Galilei, Figaro, Beelzebub and Bismillah, as rival factions fight over the narrator's soul.\\" This suggests that the lyrics describe a struggle for the narrator's soul with references to different cultural and historical figures to convey the story."},{"question":"You are given a sentence and a question in the input.

First, let's analyze them individually and then discuss the differences between them. Question 1: Is downloading torrents with no VPN safe? Downloading torrents without a VPN can be considered unsafe for a number of reasons. Torrents allow users to share files using a peer-to-peer (P2P) system, which requires users to connect directly to other users' devices. This exposes your IP address and makes it easy for third parties (such as hackers, copyright trolls, and government agencies) to track your activities. Using a VPN while downloading torrents provides an additional layer of security by masking your IP address and encrypting your online activities, on top of other benefits that help protect your privacy and anonymity. Here are some of the main reasons why downloading torrents without a VPN can be dangerous: 1. Privacy concerns: As mentioned earlier, your IP address is visible to other users in the P2P network, making it relatively easy for someone to track down your location and identity. A VPN hides your real IP address, thus preserving your privacy and making it harder for others to track you. 2. Legal issues: Downloading copyrighted material without permission is illegal in many countries. If you are caught downloading copyrighted content, you may face fines, legal proceedings, and even jail time. Using a VPN helps protect your identity and location, reducing the risk of being caught in such situations. 3. Security risks: Participating in torrenting activities exposes your device to potential malware and malicious files that can be disguised as legitimate torrent files. While VPNs cannot protect you from downloading infected files, they do provide an extra line of defense by encrypting your data and hiding your IP address, making it more difficult for hackers to launch targeted attacks against you. Question 2: Do you use a VPN while downloading torrents? This question seems to be asking for a personal preference and opinion on whether or not someone uses a VPN while torrenting. It's more about the individual's choice and understanding of the possible risks associated with torrenting without a VPN. Differences Between the Two Questions: The first question seeks an assessment of the safety of downloading torrents without using a VPN, while the second question asks for a personal perspective or behavior regarding the use of a VPN while participating in torrenting activities. In other words, the first question aims to learn about the risks and consequences of not using a VPN when torrenting, while the second question inquires about an individual's actions or preferences based on their understanding of these risks. To sum up, while both questions are related to torrenting and VPN usage, they differ in their focus and intent. The first question aims to explore the safety aspect, and the second question investigates personal usage patterns and preferences."},{"question":"The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the video that has the Tops of the Pops performance from the band that was featured on the Hype! documentary? , can you please find it? \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" was first performed live on April 17, 1991 at the OK Hotel in Seattle, Washington. The performance is featured on the DVD of the 2004 box set With the Lights Out, while shorter clips are included on the Nevermind Classic Albums DVD, as well as the documentary film Hype! As the song's lyrics had not yet been entirely written, there are notable differences between it and the final version. For example, the first performance started with \\"Come out and play, make up the rules\\" instead of the eventual opening of \\"Load up on guns, bring your friends\\". A recording of the earlier version appears on With the Lights Out and again on Sliver: The Best of the Box. A similar early live performance of the song is found in the documentary 1991: The Year Punk Broke, filmed during a 1991 summer tour in Europe with Sonic Youth. Nirvana often altered the song's lyrics and tempo for live performances. Some live performances of the song had the line \\"our little group has always been\\" changed to \\"our little tribe has always been\\", which can be heard on the 1996 live album From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah. Rolling Stone remarked that the Wishkah version of \\"Teen Spirit\\" \\"[found] Cobain's guitar reeling outside the song's melodic boundaries and sparking new life in that nearly played-out hit\\". A notable alternate performance of \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" occurred on BBC's Top of the Pops in 1991, during which the band refused to mime to the pre-recorded backing track and Cobain sang in a deliberately low voice and altered numerous lyrics in the song (for example, \\"Load up on guns, bring your friends\\" became \\"Load up on drugs, kill your friends\\"). Cobain later said he was trying to sound like former Smiths frontman Morrissey. When Top of the Pops was cancelled in 2006, The Observer listed Nirvana's performance of \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" as the third greatest in the show's history.

Conceptually, group theory can be thought of as the study of symmetry.t[›] Symmetries in mathematics greatly simplify the study of geometrical or analytical objects. A group is said to act on another mathematical object X if every group element performs some operation on X compatibly to the group law. In the rightmost example below, an element of order 7 of the (2,3,7) triangle group acts on the tiling by permuting the highlighted warped triangles (and the other ones, too). By a group action, the group pattern is connected to the structure of the object being acted on. Please answer a question about this article. If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\". What does group action do to the tiling?","response":"A group action, in the context of the (2,3,7) triangle group example in the article, performs an operation on the tiling by permuting the highlighted warped triangles, as well as all the other triangles. This means that the group action rearranges the triangles within the tiling according to the rules and structure given by the group. In this case, the element of order 7 of the triangle group acts compatibly with the group law and thus connects the group pattern to the structure of the tiling.

It works like this: someone posts a topic to their blog that is critical or controversial. This person can either be a community member, commentator, employee or otherwise; it doesn’t matter who the person is. Then what happens is a series of comments are posted to that blog entry from readers that are critical of the post, thus challenging the author on their views. The author then either deletes the blog entry or disables the comments based on the feedback. In other words, a viewpoint is shared, an invitation for comment is provided, but that invitation is then revoked when the author of the blog post is dissatisfied with the response from their readers. I have seen this happen countless times over the years and I don’t like this. I believe we should all be accountable for our words. Our words have the ability to inspire, to entertain, to challenge, but to also hurt. Actions have consequences, and so do words. As such, when I see someone openly share their thoughts on their blog and invite their readers to provide comments, I see that as a wonderful demonstration of accountability and engagement; debate is a beautiful thing when executed with politeness and respect. To then close that door, seemingly because people disagree with you, is in my mind the equivalent of walking out of a room in the middle of a debate. The excuse when folks are criticized of this behavior is typically “it is my blog and I can run it how I like“. This is true: it is your blog, and you can run it how you like, but the true measure of a person is not just in what they say, but also in the conversation and discourse that follows.

Nuh-uh, no way. Jackie Chan's not supposed to be wining and dining his lady friend and talking about marriage. He's supposed to be kicking butt! Like it or not, Chan is getting older (he'll be 56 in April) and perhaps those new wrinkles have him considering his career options for when he can no longer throw a punch. So he's taken a cue from fellow action heroes like Vin Diesel (think: \\"The Pacifier\\") and signed on for a family film -- the lackluster, so-corny-it's-painful \\"The Spy Next Door.\\" What's more difficult: busting Russian villains or endearing your girlfriend's three rambunctious kids to you? For retired spy Bob Ho, it's clearly the latter. When Gillian (Amber Valetta) goes out of town, Bob volunteers to play Mr. Mom. He can save the world from the Russians, who are scheming to take over the oil industry in a ridiculous subplot involving a thousand silly stereotypes, but he can't make oatmeal. \\"The Spy Next Door\\" is so hokey that I couldn't help but wonder if I was watching a campy sendup. It opens with \\"Secret Agent Man,\\" for god's sake! Everyone, from Chan to supporting spy Billy Ray Cyrus to the big, bad Russians, seems to be reading their terrible lines from somewhere just off camera. The dialogue, particularly Cyrus' cringeworthy Kentucky-fried idioms, is stilted, colorless and boring, even by kids' movie standards. Every Hallmark-wholesome \\"lesson\\" crammed into the movie, particularly those about the idea of family, just makes you squirm. Although Chan is no stranger to comedy, it's clear that he's grasping at straws with this pallid cornball. He's the only one, besides Will Shadley as Gillian's dorky son, Ian, who really, visibly tries to make \\"The Spy Next Door\\" less of a disaster. But pitting a big, strong man against wily, sugar-fueled children is a plot line that's been done to death, and \\"The Spy\\" does nothing to revitalize it. ||||| Originally published Thursday, January 14, 2010 at 3:01 PM Comments (0) E-mail article Print view Share In \\"The Spy Next Door,\\" Jackie Chan's physical grace and legendary stunt work aren't quite what they used to be, but he's still far more nimble than this crummy, family-movie vehicle in which he plays a spy baby-sitting his girlfriend's bratty kids. 'The Spy Next Door,' with Jackie Chan, Billy Ray Cyrus, George Lopez, Amber Valletta, Katherine Boecher, Magnús Scheving, Madeline Carroll, Will Shadley, Alina Foley. Directed by Brian Levant, from a screenplay by Jonathan Bernstein, James Greer and Gregory Poirier. 92 minutes. Rated PG for sequences of action violence and some mild rude humor. Several theaters; see Page 15. I wanted to begin this review of Jackie Chan's new family comedy, \\"The Spy Next Door,\\" by saying something along the lines of, \\"I liked this movie better the first time, when it was called 'The Pacifier.' \\" The latter, a sporadically lively comedy from a few years back starring Vin Diesel as a commando-type who becomes nanny to three brats, bears a striking resemblance to Chan's new movie, in which he plays a superspy baby-sitting his girlfriend's three obnoxious kids (Madeline Carroll, Will Shadley, Alina Foley). But something gets lost in the parallel because, well, \\"The Spy Next Door\\" makes \\"The Pacifier\\" look like \\"Citizen Kane.\\" A dreary, ill-advised production that frequently looks cheap and features a largely unappealing cast (Billy Ray Cyrus as an intelligence officer — somebody shoot me), \\"Spy\\" taxes one's patience from its opening scenes. Chan plays Bob, a Chinese secret agent on loan to U.S. intelligence and hiding in plain sight as a Clark Kent-ish pen salesman. Ready to retire from his secret life, Bob has been dating an attractive next-door neighbor, Gillian (Amber Valletta), a single mom raising a trio of monsters. Bob wants to tell Gillian the truth about himself and marry her, but the time is never right for his confession. Meanwhile, the children appear to have unlimited freedom to treat Bob like dirt for the crime of being boring, an attitude he hopes will change when Gillian leaves town for a few days, putting him in charge. Predictably, the kids run circles around Bob, though equally predictably, he slowly gets under their skin with his attentiveness and kindness. The exact same thing happens in \\"The Pacifier,\\" but it was more fun to watch. The militantly firm yet sympathetic hand supplied by Diesel's character was the right prescription his young wards needed to feel safe and be better-behaved. In \\"Spy,\\" Bob gets dissed and treated badly (locked out of the house with his arms full of bags, that kind of thing) over and over. The kids remain unlikable for most of the movie as a result. Danger looms for Bob's charges when one of them accidentally downloads plans for a high-tech weapon. Director Brian Levant (\\"The Flintstones\\") tries squeezing laughs out of an atmosphere of silliness surrounding the spy game, especially the crazy, Boris-and-Natasha-like antics of a pair of Russians (Katherine Boecher and Magnús Scheving). Comedian George Lopez, playing Bob's CIA boss, makes an interesting impression on screen, with that craggy, lived-in face of his. But none of those extras diminish the tediousness of \\"Spy.\\" The film might offer an aging Chan (now using more and more stunt doubles) a few opportunities to shine in his ongoing bout with the physical world. But it still raises the spectacle of an international superstar in another clunky, American movie. Tom Keogh: tomwkeogh@yahoo.com ||||| In a cruelly misguided tease, the opening-credits sequence in the grating Jackie Chan comedy The Spy Next Door show off his credentials in a montage of footage from a decade or two ago, when Chan was at the height of his powers. For a few minutes, audiences are reminded of what a unique talent he once was, an entertainer and martial artist willing to risk life and limb for a crazy stunt or a bit of slapstick. But once the credits are over, the film can’t paper over the reality that Chan is in his mid-50s, and while he’s exceptionally nimble for his age, he simply can’t pull off the kung-fu Buster Keaton shtick any longer. And as his physical skills have diminished, his mugging skills have sadly increased. A cynical hybrid of family-friendly blockbusters past—The Pacifier, Home Alone, and Spy Kids being the most prominent influences—The Spy Next Door stars Chan as a daredevil secret agent who lives in the suburbs and pretends to be a boring pen importer. He wants to take the next step with girlfriend Amber Valletta, but her three bratty kids haven’t warmed to his Clark Kent persona, partly because they’re still holding out for their father to return. When Valletta gets called away for a few days, Chan eagerly volunteers to look after the kids, but one of them accidentally downloads some highly coveted information. Soon enough, the four are fending off comically inept bad guys, Macaulay Culkin-style. The Spy Next Door follows Brian Levant’s long track record of pandering, PG-rated family comedies that look like bad TV (and sometimes are adapted from it): Problem Child 2, Beethoven, Jingle All The Way, both Flintstones movies, a straight-to-DVD live-action Scooby-Doo sequel. Casting Billy Ray Cyrus and George Lopez as the least and second-least likely secret agents imaginable says everything about Levant’s fidelity to demographic charts, but Chan’s anything-goes affability keeps the film from scraping bottom. Limited to a few minor parkour moves and an above-the-belt fighting style that’s more like John Saxon in Enter The Dragon than the Chan of old, he’s still giving 100 percent, even if that’s often way too much. ||||| On the ground or twirling in a stunt harness above it, Jackie Chan brings an air of determined good cheer to even the most metallic of clunkers. “The Spy Next Door” proves this. Chan’s new all-ages vehicle is smooth like oatmeal. It’s hard to imagine anyone being offended, except fans of good comedy. This is “True Lies” without the striptease or the Arab-maiming. On loan to the Central Intelligence Agency from the Chinese government, Bob Ho (Chan) is a superspy who, by day, masquerades as a mild-mannered pen importer. He is courting Gillian (Amber Valletta), a divorced mother of three whose serene under-reaction to her brats’ bratty brattiness is the plot’s biggest mystery. Sullen older daughter (Madeline Carroll) and aggravating, “Octopussy”-referencing son (Will Shadley) vow to get rid of the opposition, even though the younger daughter (Alina Foley) knows mom’s boyfriend is a fine fellow. Why are they so hard on Bob? Because he isn’t cool. Because there’s no story if they don’t. “The Spy Next Door” operates on familial bonding by way of humiliating pranks, which in better circumstances might go by the name of slapstick. Baby-sitting the kids while his sweetie’s away, Bob ends up getting roped into the pursuit of Russian badskis trying to control the world’s oil supply. Soon the kids are ensnared in the espionage and Magnus Scheving, who may be familiar to some of you as “Sportacus” on the TV show “LazyTown,” must retrieve a digital file accidentally downloaded by Gillian’s son. Billy Ray Cyrus plays the CIA’s least likely agent. George Lopez is Bob’s supervisor. The director is Brian Levant, whose drab visuals match the repartee. A little too much of the movie takes place inside Gillian’s suburban house. It’s a big deal when someone drives to an empty warehouse facility in this thing. Chan’s lines include the expected linguistic manglings (“You’re chopping my bust!” instead of “You’re busting my chops!”) and peculiar stress rhythms (“Why did you tell them! That I was your bodyguard!”). Now and then, the star executes a little something special — with a stunt bike or a folding chair, for example — and you think: Chan still has it. Even when the material conspires to take “it” away, he still has it. My son and his friend, both 9, liked the movie a lot, for the record. I chalk this up to Chan himself, whose kinetic athleticism may be less than it was a couple of decades ago, but honestly: isn’t yours? MPAA rating: PG (for sequences of action violence and some mild rude humor) Cast: Jackie Chan (Bob Ho); Billy Ray Cyrus (Colton James); George Lopez (Glaze); Amber Valletta (Gillian); Madeline Carroll (Farren); Will Shadley (Ian); Alina Foley (Nora); Magnus Scheving (Poldark); Katherine Boecher (Creel) Credits: Directed by: Brian Levant; written by Jonathan Bernstein, James Greer and Gregory Poirier; produced by Robert Simonds.

He claimed that he was treated unfairly and shared his experience with his 1.6 million followers. The tweet quickly spread like wildfire, and within a few hours, it caught the attention of the world. As a result, Southwest Airlines quickly sprung into action, issuing a public apology and offering Smith a full refund for his ticket. What makes this case impressive is the swift response it received from the airline. It demonstrated how social media platforms like Twitter could bring high-profile complaints to the forefront and force companies to address customer issues quickly. Social Media and Improving Customer Service The traditional methods of contacting airlines, such as calling and e-mailing their customer service departments, can often lead to long waiting times and unsatisfactory resolutions. In contrast, social media has emerged as a powerful platform for consumers to receive real-time responses from airlines, who are keen to protect their brand reputation in the digital domain. Social media platforms, particularly Twitter, have become the go-to channel for customers seeking immediate attention to their complaints. Acknowledging the importance of social media in helping them stay connected with customers, various airlines have established dedicated Twitter handles for customer care. This move is not only aimed at minimizing negative publicity but also focuses on offering quick solutions tailored to the needs of travelers, who may not have time to navigate complicated customer service phone trees. Tips for Consumers to Get Better Response on Twitter Here are some tips for travelers looking to use Twitter as a tool to get the desired feedback and resolution from airlines: 1. Be succinct: Present your complaint or query in a clear and concise manner to make it easy for airline representatives to understand and respond quickly. 2. Include relevant details: Adding relevant information, such as flight number, ticket number, or date of travel, can help the airlines to investigate the issue and provide a resolution quickly. 3. Use appropriate hashtags: Hashtags help airlines follow trending topics and ensure your tweet receives the right attention. 4. Remain courteous: Even though you may be frustrated, it is crucial to remain respectful and polite in your communication. Maintaining a civil tone increases the likelihood of receiving a satisfactory resolution. 5. Engage with the airline's customer service handle: Address your tweet directly to the airline's customer service handle to ensure it reaches the right department quickly. Conclusion Kevin Smith's complaint about Southwest Airlines not only led to a swift response but also paved the way for other customers to seek better feedback and solutions through social media platforms such as Twitter. By adhering to the tips mentioned in this article, travelers can improve their chances of getting a satisfactory response from airlines and resolve their issues quickly. Ultimately, the power of social media has opened up new channels for people to voice their grievances and obtain better customer service from companies, significantly benefiting both parties in the long run."},{"question":"Instructions: Given a sentence in Italian, generate a new Italian sentence by performing small changes on the sentence.

UPDATED:. 19:26 EST, 12 March 2013. Town and country: Sir Simon Jenkins, chairman of the National Trust, says the children of families in rural areas don't have a God-given right to live near their parents. Children raised in the countryside have no automatic right to live near their parents’ homes when they grow up, the chairman of the National Trust declared yesterday. Sir Simon Jenkins said the majority of new homes should be built in towns and cities, rather than in unspoilt rural areas. His comments are at odds with existing policies that encourage affordable housing to be built in villages for local families. Sir Simon said: ‘Somehow it is considered the right of people in the country to have their children living next door at public expense. I don’t understand it. ‘Are you going to say that people who have lived in the Windrush Valley [in the Cotswolds] for 100 years have a right to go on living there? No, I’m afraid they don’t. Sorry.’ Last night, some countryside groups attacked his comments, warning that villages without young families risked being turned into ‘little more than retirement ghettoes’. But Sir Simon, who owns homes in west London and rural Wales, even called for areas of the countryside to be listed to protect the most beautiful parts. He suggested introducing four different listed ‘grades’ of countryside – one of which could include a ‘presumption against development’. He said: ‘We should list the countryside as we list the town by virtue of its beauty.What it is that people want to retain. ‘We don’t want to pull down Belgravia. We don’t want to build housing estates in Hyde Park. We should adopt the same approach to the countryside.’ Picturesque: Sheepscome in the Cotswolds. Families who have lived in villages like this do not have a right to go on living there, says Sir Simon. He says the majority of new homes should be built in towns and cities. Idyll: The village of Snowshill in the Cotswolds. Many countryside groups say there is an urgent need for affordable homes in rural areas. But opponents warned that house prices will rise even higher in rural areas if new homes are not built there. The row comes at a time when the average home in the countryside costs around £200,000 – around £30,000 more than a town house. Under threat? Castle Combe in Wiltshire. A minister said Britain faces a situation where home ownership is the right of a privileged few unless more homes are built. The. Windrush is a river in the Cotswolds, which flows through the famously. picturesque village of Bourton-on-the-Water as well as the Prime. Minister’s constituency town of Witney. Prices of homes near the Windrush can be eye-watering, with bungalows in Bourton-on-the-Water selling for up to £645,000 in recent months. But Sir Simon, who was speaking in a. personal capacity, told the Home Builders’ Federation conference in. central London: ‘I want building to take place in towns on the whole. I. want there to be massive incentives to build in towns because it makes. more sense.’ He said there. will be many parts of the countryside – ‘on the whole, rather lovely. parts of the countryside’ – that ‘just don’t want to take large numbers. of more people.’ He singled. out the Cotswolds village of Stow-on-the-Wold, where he said many. residents are ‘seriously angry’ at proposals to build a large number of. new homes. Last night his comments were attacked by those who said more affordable rural homes were needed. Stewart Baseley, executive chairman of the Home Builders’ Federation, said: ‘We need to be providing homes across the country in places where people want to live. We should not be trying to just pigeon-hole people into living in towns where they might not want to live.’ Kate Houghton, from the Campaign to Protect Rural England, said: ‘We do agree that the bulk of new housing should be built in or near to urban areas, so people have more easy access to public transport, community facilities and essential services. Sir Simon said protecting villages like Bisley from major housing developments and concentrating new homes in towns and cities 'makes sense' ‘However, if we don’t make provision. for at least some affordable houses in rural areas, where it is clear. that there is need and people do want to stay, then our villages could. become little more than retirement ghettoes or commuter dormitories.’ At the conference, Malcolm Harris, chairman of house builders Bovis, accused Sir Simon of being ‘quite naïve’. He. said: ‘These are your children. These are people who already live in. the community. We have failed for year after year after year to provide. the housing. That is a real issue in Great Britain.’ In England, around 110,000 new homes are. built ever year, but this is way behind the rate at which new. households are being formed, estimated to be around 230,000 a year. A spokesman for Priced Out, the first-time buyers’ campaign group, accused Sir Simon of being ‘out of touch with the aspirations of hard-working young adults who have been priced out of a home in their local area.’ Housing Minister Mark Prisk, who spoke at the same conference, said home ownership remains the dream of the vast majority of Britons. He told builders that the quality of the homes they build is just as important as the quantity, calling on them to reject the stereotype of the ‘rabbit hutch’. Sir Simon’s intervention comes weeks after Planning Minister Nick Boles warned Britain will be dragged back to the 19th century when home-ownership was the preserve of the wealthiest unless more homes are built. He said: ‘We can pass by on the other side while working men and women in their twenties and thirties have to live with their parents or share bedrooms with friends. We can shrug our shoulders as home ownership reverts to what it was in the 19th century: a privilege, the exclusive preserve of people with large incomes or wealthy parents. ‘Or we can accept that we are going to have to build on previously undeveloped land and resolve that we will make these decisions locally.’ Summarize the highlights of this article.","response":"The article is centered around the comments made by Sir Simon Jenkins, chairman of the National Trust, who suggested that children raised in the countryside in the UK do not have an automatic right to live near their parents' homes when they become adults. He argued that the majority of new homes should be constructed in towns and cities, as opposed to being built in rural areas. Jenkins' viewpoint contradicts existing policies that promote affordable housing in villages for local families. He called into question the entitlement of countryside residents who expect their children to live nearby at the expense of the public. He also proposed the listing of different levels of countryside based on their beauty with the intention of preserving and protecting them from new developments. His comments incited backlash from several countryside groups, warning that without young families, villages face the risk of becoming 'retirement ghettoes'. Opponents also cautioned that halting new build in rural areas could sharply increase house prices there. The need for new homes in the rural areas was firmly advocated by several critics including Stewart Baseley, chairman of the Home Builders' federation, who stressed the need for homes across the country in places where people prefer to live. According to estimations, approximately 230,000 new homes need to be built each year to keep up with the formation of new households, but the current rate of construction is much lower, with only about 110,000 completed each year. Other commentators, like Housing Minister Mark Prisk, emphasized the importance of home ownership and the quality of homes built, referring to the stereotype of the 'rabbit hutch'. This debate comes following warnings by Planning Minister Nick Boles who stated that a shortage of homes risks turning home ownership into a privilege for the wealthy, mirroring conditions of the 19th century."},{"question":"Q:- clubs is rotherham loan -rrb- bridlington town united hull city york city → barnsley -lrb- - caps is 102 305 46 5 - position is winger - years is 0000 1975 -- 1976 -- 1960 1964 -- 1973 1973 -- 1975 - nationalyears is 1962 - youthclubs is rotherham united - youthyears is 0000 -- 1960 - birth date is 1 february 1944 - nationalteam is england youth - birth place is darton , england - goals is 27 66 2 1 Given the details above, guess who could this information be about.

Article: Have you ever wondered how your favorite NBA team received its famous name? All NBA teams have an interesting story or a history behind their names. Some of the names reflect the city's culture or history, others came from previous owners and many were selected through \\"Name the Team\\" contests. For teams like Los Angeles and Utah, the names were not always a reflection of the city. Even though Los Angeles has no lakes, the Laker name has been a city treasure for almost 40 years. Before going to Los Angeles, the team originated in Minneapolis, Minnesota. In 1948, team officials chose the name for its direct relationship to the state's motto, \\"The Land of 10,000 Lakes.\\" The team name went unchanged after moving to Los Angeles in 1960. Because Utah's team originated in New Orleans, Louisiana, it was called the Jazz. In 1974, New Orleans club officials chose the name to represent the city for its reputation as the \\"jazz capital of the world.\\" The name stayed with the team even after finding a new home in Salt Lake City, Utah in 1979. The Chicago Bull's original owner, Richard Klein, named the team the Bulls. He picked the name because a fighting bull is relentless, and never quits. Klein, who founded the club in1966, believed these qualities were necessary for a championship team and hoped his Chicago athletes would live up to the team name. A belief that Bulls----winner of the six NBA championships have definitely followed. In 1967, the Indian Pacers selected their team name in a different way from most other teams.

It’s not exactly a one-on-one conversation. on some of the members of Trump’s inner circle who’ve participated in the discussions with prospective candidates. One source said the interviews to date, which usually include Vice President-elect Mike Pence and one of his aides, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, Steve Bannon, Trump’s incoming chief strategist, and one or more of Trump’s adult children – Ivanka, Donald Jr., and Eric, as well as Kushner – can take on a circus-like atmosphere, with several people streaming in and out of the room. Hmm. Trump and Pence overseeing the interviews make sense, it’s not too surprising Priebus and Bannon would play a role. But I’d love to hear more about why “one or more” of Trump’s kids are included in conversations with would-be cabinet members.

On the surface, there’s at least some concern about Trump putting his kids in key positions of influence, but let’s not forget that the president-elect has ignored calls for creating a blind trust, instead deciding to put his adult children Asked soon after about control of the Trump Organization, Trump attorney Michael Cohen said Donald Jr., Ivanka, and Eric would take charge. “They’re really intelligent,” But when it comes to the public trust, their intellect and qualifications are not the relevant details.

The first siege , by the crusaders against the Muslim - held city , lasted from 21 October 1097 to 2 June 1098 . Antioch lay in a strategic location on the crusaders ' route to Palestine . Supplies , reinforcements and retreat could all be controlled by the city . Anticipating that it would be attacked , the Muslim governor of the city , Yaghi - Siyan , began stockpilling food and sending requests for help . The Byzantine walls surrounding the city presented a formidable obstacle to its capture , but the leaders of the crusade felt compelled to besiege Antioch anyway . The crusaders arrived outside the city on 21 October and began the siege . The garrison sortied unsuccessfully on 29 December . After stripping the surrounding area of food , the crusaders were forced to look farther afield for supplies , opening themselves to ambush and while searching for food on 31 December , a force of 20,000 crusaders encountered a relief force led by Duqaq of Damascus heading to Antioch and defeated the army . However , supplies dwindled and in early 1098 one in seven of the crusaders was dying from starvation and people began deserting in January . A second relief force , this time under the command of Ridwan of Aleppo , advanced towards Antioch , arriving on 9 February . Like the army of Duqaq before , it was defeated . Antioch was captured on 3 June , although the citadel remained in the hands of the Muslim defenders . Kerbogha began the second siege , against the crusaders who had occupied Antioch , which lasted from 7 June to 28 June 1098 . The second siege ended when the crusaders exited the city to engage Kerbogha 's army in battle and succeeded in defeating them . On seeing the Muslim army routed , the defenders remaining in the citadel surrendered . - Pope Urban II ( 29 July 1099), born Odo of Châtillon or Otho de Lagery, was Pope from 12 March 1088 to his death in 1099.

Turkey is a democratic, secular, unitary, parliamentary republic with a diverse cultural heritage. Turkey is bordered by eight countries: Greece to the west; Bulgaria to the northwest; Georgia to the northeast; Armenia, the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan and Iran to the east; and Iraq and Syria to the south. The Aegean Sea is to the west, the Black Sea to the north, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. The Bosphorus, the Sea of Marmara, and the Dardanelles, which together form the Turkish Straits, divide Thrace and Anatolia; they also separate Europe and Asia. Turkey's location has given it geopolitical and strategic importance throughout history. - Antioch on the Orontes (also Syrian Antioch) was an ancient Greco-Roman city on the eastern side of the Orontes River. Its ruins lie near the modern city of Antakya, Turkey, and lends the modern city its name. - The First Crusade (10951099) was the first of a number of crusades that attempted to capture the Holy Land, called by Pope Urban II in 1095. It started as a widespread pilgrimage in western Christendom and ended as a military expedition by Roman Catholic Europe to regain the Holy Land taken in the Muslim conquests of the Levant (632661), ultimately resulting in the capture of Jerusalem in 1099. - The Orontes () or Asi (\\"\\") is a northward flowing river starting in Lebanon and flowing through Syria and Turkey before entering the Mediterranean Sea. - Antakya (\\"Anky\\" from , \\"Aniokia\\" \\"Antiócheia\\"), is the seat of the Hatay Province in southern Turkey. - The Levant (Arabic: \\"\\") is an approximate historical geographical term referring to a large area in the Eastern Mediterranean.

The term \\"Levant\\" entered English in the late 15th century from French. It derives from the Italian \\"Levante\\", meaning \\"rising\\", implying the rising of the sun in the east. As such, it is broadly equivalent to the Arabic term \\"Mashriq\\", meaning \\"the land where the sun rises\\". - Jerusalem , is a city located on a plateau in the Judaean Mountains between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea. One of the oldest cities in the world, Jerusalem was named as \\"\\"Urusalima\\"\\" on ancient Mesopotamian cuneiform tablets, probably meaning \\"City of Shalem\\" after a Canaanite deity, during the early Canaanite period (approximately 2400 BCE). During the Israelite period, significant construction activity in Jerusalem began in the 9th century BCE (Iron Age II), and in the 8th century the city developed into the religious and administrative center of the Kingdom of Judah.

Context_2 : Jorge Guillermo Borges Haslam (24 February 1874 – 14 February 1938) was an Argentine lawyer and writer. He was the son of Colonel Francisco Borges Lafinur, an Argentine military officer of Uruguayan origins, and Frances Anne Haslam, an English native. In 1898, he married Leonor Acevedo Suárez with whom he had two children: writer Jorge Luis Borges and painter Norah Borges. Due to the failing eyesight that would eventually afflict his son, Borges Haslam eventually abandoned his law career law and the family moved to Geneva, Switzerland before World War I, where the young Jorge Luis was treated by an eye specialist. In 1921, the Borges family returned to Argentina. Context_3 : Días de odio, literally translated as Days of Hate, is a 1954 Argentine film. It is based on the short story \\"Emma Zunz\\" by Jorge Luis Borges.Días de odio is a film Argentina in black and white directed by Leopoldo Torre Nilsson scripted himself about the story of Jorge Luis Borges entitled Emma Zunz, which was included in the book The Aleph and first released in 1949. It was first performed the 3 of June 1954 and had as main protagonists Elisa Galvé , Nicolas Freguês, Raul del Valle, Enrique de Pedro, Duilio Marzio and Virginia Romay . The producer of the film was Armando Bó . Context_4 : Adrogué, con ilustraciones de Norah Borges (1977) is a volume of poetry by Jorge Luis Borges, illustrated by his sister Norah Borges, about the city of Adrogué. It was born from a lecture given by Borges about \\"Adrogué in his books\\" at the celebration of the first \\"Week of Culture\\" of the Almirante Brown Partido in 1977. Context_5 : Jorge Francisco Isidoro Luis Borges Acevedo {'1': \\", '2': \\", '3': \\", '4': \\"} ( ; ] ; 24 August 1899 – 14 June 1986) was an Argentine short-story writer, essayist, poet and translator, and a key figure in Spanish-language literature. His best-known books, \\"Ficciones\\" (\\"Fictions\\") and \\"El Aleph\\" (\\"The Aleph\\"), published in the 1940s, are compilations of short stories interconnected by common themes, including dreams, labyrinths, libraries, mirrors, fictional writers, philosophy, and religion. Context_6 : Borges on Martín Fierro concerns Argentinian Jorge Luis Borges's comments on José Hernández's nineteenth century poem \\"Martín Fierro\\". Like most of his compatriots, Borges was a great admirer of this work, which he often characterized as the one clearly great work in Argentine literature. Because \\"Martín Fierro\\" has been widely considered (beginning with Leopoldo Lugones's \\"El Payador\\", 1916) the fountainhead or pinnacle of Argentine literature, Argentina's \\"Don Quixote\\" or \\"Divine Comedy\\", and because Borges was certainly Argentina's greatest twentieth-century writer, Borges's 1953 book of essays about the poem and its critical and popular reception - \\"El \\"Martín Fierro\\"\\" (written with Margarita Guerrero) - gives insight into Borges's identity as an Argentine. Context_7 : Jorge Luis Borges and mathematics concerns several modern mathematical concepts found in certain essays and short stories of Argentinian author Jorge Luis Borges (1899-1986), including concepts such as set theory, recursion, chaos theory, and infinite sequences, although Borges' strongest links to mathematics are through Georg Cantor's theory of infinite sets, outlined in \\"The Doctrine of Cycles\\" (\\"La doctrina de los ciclos\\"). Some of Borges' most popular works such as \\"The Library of Babel\\" (\\"La Biblioteca de Babel\\"), \\"The Garden of Forking Paths\\" (\\"El Jardín de Senderos que se Bifurcan\\"), \\"The Aleph\\" (\\"El Aleph\\"), an allusion to Cantor's use of the Hebrew letter aleph (formula_1) to denote cardinality of transfinite sets. and \\"The Approach to Al-Mu'tasim\\" (\\"El acercamiento a Almotásim\\") illustrate his use of mathematics. Context_8 : Harto The Borges is a documentary film by Eduardo Montes-Bradley. \\"Harto The Borges\\" explores the narcissistic side of Jorge Luis Borges, the author of El Aleph, his frequent and often criticized comments to the press, his distinctive and gentle ironies. Harto The Borges had a theatrical release in Buenos Aires in September 2000, and was well received by the critics. Since then has been frequently exhibited at forums, campuses, and film festivals. On October 4, 2011, Harto The Borges was made available to the general audience in Argentina through the On Line version of Revista Cultura Ñ, (Diario Clarin) in Buenos Aires. The film was released alongside an article in which the director views the film ten years after its premier at the Cine Cosmos. The film is currently available in Vimeo . Context_9 : Wilhelm Reich (24 March 1897 – 3 November 1957) was an Austrian psychoanalyst, a member of the second generation of analysts after Sigmund Freud. The author of several influential books, most notably \\"Character Analysis\\" (1933), \\"The Mass Psychology of Fascism\\" (1933) and \\"The Sexual Revolution\\" (1936), Reich became known as one of the most radical figures in the history of psychiatry. Context_10 : A Bao A Qu is a legendary Mewar creature described in Jorge Luis Borges's 1967 \\"Book of Imaginary Beings\\". Borges claimed to have found it either in an introduction to the \\"Arabian Nights\\" by Richard Francis Burton, or in the book \\"On Malay Witchcraft\\" (1937) by C.C. Iturvuru. The Burton reference was given in the original Spanish, but it was changed to the Iturvuru reference in the English text, possibly to make it sound more exotic, or as a reference to Borges' friend C. C. Iturburu. The writer Antares conjectures that Borges's tale might be inspired by Orang Asli myth, and that \\"A Bao A Qu\\" is a slurring of \\"abang aku\\" meaning \\"my elder brother\\". fact_1 : Wilhelm Reich (24 March 1897 – 3 November 1957) was an Austrian psychoanalyst, a member of the second generation of analysts after Sigmund Freud. fact_2 : Jorge Francisco Isidoro Luis Borges Acevedo {'1': \\", '2': \\", '3': \\", '4': \\"} ( ; ] ; 24 August 1899 – 14 June 1986) was an Argentine short-story writer, essayist, poet and translator, and a key figure in Spanish-language literature.

Let's break down the sentence and analyze the information it provides to understand why it answers the question. The given sentence has two parts: (1) \\"The F-5's more complicated woodwork,\\" and (2) \\"also translates into a more expensive instrument.\\" 1) The first part of the sentence states that the F-5 mandolin has more complicated woodwork than its counterparts. \\"More complicated woodwork\\" may indicate that the F-5 model has higher craftsmanship, better quality materials, and a more intricate design. This information suggests that it requires more specialized skills, effort, and possibly better tools and machinery to produce a higher-level piece. 2) The second part of the sentence explicitly states the consequence of the more complicated woodwork, that is, it \\"translates into a more expensive instrument.\\" This statement essentially indicates that the higher level of craftsmanship, additional effort, and better-quality materials result in a higher price for the F-5 mandolin. Thus, based on this explanation, the sentence does provide a valid answer to the question \\"Why is the F-5 mandolin more expensive?\\" as it directly connects the more complicated woodwork to the higher price of the instrument. The increased complexity of the woodwork can result in additional costs due to labor, resources, and other associated factors. So, the single-select option \\"yes\\" would be the appropriate choice in this case."},{"question":"What is the answer for the question: What was the location of the structure that was built for Marquess of Annandale? from the following article ? Despite William Bruce's fall from political favour, and his intermittent imprisonment, he continued to practice. During the 1690s he completed Hill of Tarvit (1696), Craighall (1697–99) in Fife, and Craigiehall (1699) near Edinburgh. The latter, built for the Marquess of Annandale, still stands, and is used as the British Army's Scottish headquarters. From 1698 he was working on a new house for the young Charles Hope, later first Earl of Hopetoun. Hopetoun House, near Edinburgh, was completed in 1702, and represents Bruce's grandest country house design. The master mason was again Thomas Bauchop, and the inspiration was again Anglo-Dutch, with French rustication. The bulk of Bruce's work is now obscured by 18th-century remodelling, carried out by William Adam. Bruce was commissioned again by Hopetoun in 1708, to build a private aisle at Abercorn Kirk. The Hopetoun Loft overlooks the interior of the kirk, and connects to a retiring room with an oval \\"squint\\" giving a view of the pulpit.In 1702 Bruce was commissioned by the burgesses of Stirling to design a new tolbooth for the town. Bruce provided only sketch plans, which were executed by local masons between 1703 and 1705. Bruce's last country houses were Harden House (now known as Mertoun House), built for the Scotts in the Borders, and his smallest house, Auchendinny in Midlothian. His final work, in around 1710, was for Nairne House, for the Jacobite Lord Nairne. The house was not completed until two years after Bruce's death, and the extent of his involvement is unclear. Nairne House was demolished in 1760, although the cupola was retained and installed on the roof of the King James VI Hospital in nearby Perth.

Inside the box they discover artifacts belonging to Mater Lachrymarum (Moran Atias), the last surviving member of the Three Mothers; an ancient trio of powerful black witches. In particular, the box contains a magic cloak that, when worn by Mater Lachrymarum, increases her powers significantly. The urn is shipped to the Museum of Ancient Art in Rome where Sarah Mandy (Asia Argento), an American studying art restoration, works. Sarah is dating the curator Michael Pierce, a single father who is away from the museum that night. With help from the assistant curator, Sarah opens the box and finds the cloak, a dagger, and three statues representing the three witches. Sending Sarah to her office to retrieve tools to help her translate the text on the artifacts, the curator is promptly attacked by the demonic agents of Mater Lachrymarum. Sarah arrives too late to save her boss (who is being disembowelled by the monsters) and starts to flee the museum. Unfortunately, she is pursued by Mater Lachrymarum's familiar (a baboon) and is only able to escape when a disembodied voice magically throws open a series of locked doors keeping her trapped inside the museum.

Among the players the Bears faced was former returner and receiver Devin Hester, who had recorded 19 his NFL-record 20 return touchdowns with the team. Atlanta entered the game with the second-best passing offense in the league, with the receiver duo of Julio Jones and Roddy White having combined for 56 catches for 765 yards and five touchdowns. The former also led the league with 40 receptions and 552 yards. Hester, despite being 23rd in the NFL with 15.1 yards on 14 receptions, was one the Bears had to be prepared when he was used as a slot receiver. Among the goals the Bears' defense had was to rush Matt Ryan, who - despite being pressured often and tied with Jay Cutler with 130 pass attempts - was one of five quarterbacks with an average of eight yards per pass. Altogether, the Falcons had the third-best offense in yards gained, first in yards per play with 6.58, second in red zone touchdown percentage, and third with 29 points per game. However, the Bears offense could attack the Falcons' 28th-ranked rushing defense, which had been allowing 147.6 yards per game; the Bears had been recording 116 rushing yards each game. In addition, Atlanta had allowed a league-leading ten rushing touchdowns and six yards per play, while having the second-worst sacks per pass attempt with 2.47 percent, and was one of five teams allowing 400 yards per game. On special teams, Chicago would have to watch out for Hester, who recorded one of the league's four punt return touchdowns in 2014, while recording an average of 14.4 yards off eight punt returns, and was ranked eighth in the league with a kick return average of 24.2 yards. The Falcons were predicted by every CBSSports.com analyst to win, and were the -3.5 favorite. Brandon Marshall, Danny McCray, and Tim Jennings served as the Bears' captains, while Sherrick McManis, Ahmad Dixon, Shea McClellin, Lance Briggs, Jon Bostic, D. J. Williams, and Jermon Bushrod were inactive. After the Bears won the coin toss, elected to receive, and punted on the first drive, the Falcons scored on their first drive with Matt Bryant's 52-yard field goal. After the Bears punted again, Jones was stripped by Kyle Fuller, but recovered; the Falcons would also punt. On Chicago's next drive, Cutler, after spiking the ball, was drilled by Paul Worrilow, allowing the Bears to gain a first down at the Falcons' 14-yard line; the drive lasted into the second quarter, and ended with Robbie Gould's 25-yard field goal; the Bears extended the lead on their next drive via Cutler's three-yard touchdown pass to Josh Morgan. The Falcons would be forced to punt again, with Chicago scoring off Gould's 28-yard field goal, the final scoring play of the first half, the Bears leading 13-3. After receiving the ball in the second half, the Falcons drove to Chicago's 41-yard line, where Ryan threw a 41-yard touchdown pass to Antone Smith, and the Falcons tied the game on their next possession off Bryant's 54-yard field goal. On Chicago's drive, the Falcons failed to provide safety assistance at the right side of the field, leading to Cutler throwing a 74-yard pass to Alshon Jeffery, completing it to the Falcons' five-yard line, with Matt Forte scoring on the next run, though Gould's extra point would be blocked by Ra'Shede Hageman. Now down by six, the Falcons failed to score, and were forced to punt. In the final quarter, the Bears reached the Falcons' eight-yard line, where Cutler threw a touchdown pass to Jeffery. However, the score would be nullified by Jeffery stepping out of the endzone on the play. On the next play, Martellus Bennett fought to the nine-yard line, where Forte scored on the rushing touchdown. The Bears then scored on the two-point conversion with Cutler's pass to Bennett, putting the Bears up by 14 points, 27-13. On Atlanta's next drive, Jared Allen recorded his first sack as a Bear, and would later be forced to punt, and the Bears would also punt. Afterwards, Ryan's pass for Jones would be intercepted by Demontre Hurst, though the Bears would have to punt. The Falcons' final drive ended with a turnover on downs, and Cutler would kneel thrice to end the game. The Bears became the first team to win 750 total games. It took only 4 road games for the Bears to match their road win total from last season (the Bears were 3-5 on the road during the 2013 season). The 13 points allowed by the Bears were the fewest that they had ever allowed in a game under Marc Trestman. It was also fewest that they allowed in a game since Week 12 of the 2012 season when they held the Vikings to 10 points. When the Bears held a two-touchdown lead, Falcons fans began leaving the Dome, with Bears fans forcing the Falcons to utilize silent counts and had to call a timeout due to crowd noise and a ticking play clock.

Silver town was sustainable and didn't use any fertilizers or pesticides, while Gold town did. Which town caused fewer decomposers to use up all the oxygen in the water? A:","response":"A: Silver town caused fewer decomposers to use up all the oxygen in the water. To understand this answer, let's delve into the details of how each town approaches food production and their potential impact on the environment, particularly on water sources. Silver town practices sustainable agriculture, which means they do not use any synthetic fertilizers or pesticides. Sustainable agriculture aims to use natural methods and resources to achieve long-term productivity while minimizing adverse environmental impacts. Examples of sustainable agriculture practices include crop rotation, the use of compost and other organic matter to improve soil fertility, and integrated pest management using beneficial insects and organisms. Since Silver town refrains from using fertilizers and pesticides, there is less risk of these chemicals leaching into the water system, such as streams, rivers, and aquifers. It is essential to consider that synthetic fertilizers can contribute to an excess of nutrients, like nitrogen and phosphorus, in water sources, leading to a phenomena known as eutrophication. Eutrophication occurs when an overload of nutrients fuels the rapid growth of algae and other plants, which subsequently die, fall to the water body bottom, and decompose. The process of decomposition requires oxygen, which means decomposers use up massive amounts of oxygen dissolved in the water during this process. This oxygen depletion can lead to \\"dead zones\\" where fish and other aquatic life are unable to survive due to a lack of oxygen. On the other hand, Gold town uses conventional farming methods that rely on synthetic fertilizers and pesticides to increase crop yields. The excessive use of these chemicals can create environmental concerns as they have the potential to leach into water sources. As previously mentioned, this can lead to eutrophication, oxygen depletion in water bodies, and harm to aquatic ecosystems. Hence, given the differences in agricultural approaches used by Silver town and Gold town, the sustainable agriculture practiced by Silver town is less likely to cause decomposers to use up all the oxygen in the water. This is because the methods used in Silver town minimize the risk of nutrient-rich chemicals entering the water system, reducing the likelihood of eutrophication and subsequent oxygen depletion brought on by decomposers."},{"question":"What is the answer to this question? who plays alex on the tv show wings?","response":"In order to find the answer to this question, I'll search for the information on the internet.

But earlier this year, the FAA notified","response":"the airport that it would be receiving 800,000 in federal stimulus funds. These funds were intended to help improve the airport infrastructure and stimulate economic activity in the area. As an AI, my task now is to provide information and a step-by-step plan on how the airport can utilize these funds efficiently and productively. Step 1: Conduct a Needs Assessment To determine how best to allocate the 800,000, a comprehensive needs assessment should be done. This would entail evaluating the current state of the airport infrastructure, identifying necessary improvements, and determining any potential opportunities for growth. Some areas of focus may include runway maintenance, terminal building upkeep, and safety measures. Step 2: Develop a Budget Plan Once the needs assessment is complete, create a detailed budget plan, allocating funds to identified projects and improvements. This should include estimated costs, timelines for completion, and anticipated outcomes. It is important to prioritize projects based on urgency and community impact, while also considering the feasibility and benefits of each option. Step 3: Inform and Involve the Community In order to gain community support and ensure transparency, involve local stakeholders in the decision-making process. Share the budget plan and allow for feedback and suggestions. This will not only help prevent any potential disputes but also garner valuable input from those directly affected by the projects and improvements. Step 4: Seek Additional Funding Sources Given the limited funds provided by the stimulus grant, seek additional funding sources, such as public-private partnerships, local and state grants, or other federal assistance programs. This will help supplement the 800,000 and stretch the airport's budget further. Step 5: Implement Projects and Improvements With funding in place, proceed with the approved projects and improvements. This may involve hiring contractors, negotiating contracts, and beginning construction and maintenance work. Regularly update the community and stakeholders on the progress of these projects to maintain trust and support. Step 6: Evaluate Outcomes and Adjust Plans Once the projects are completed, assess their impact on the airport and local community. Determine whether the intended goals were met and if any adjustments or further improvements are needed. This will help guide future airport plans and potential development. By following these steps, John Murtha Airport can responsibly allocate and utilize the 800,000 in federal stimulus funds, resulting in improved infrastructure, increased economic activity, and a more vibrant airport for the surrounding community."},{"question":"Write the next sentence.

Their members were called Rederijkers (singular Rederijker), from the French word 'rhétoricien', and during the 15th and 16th centuries were mainly interested in dramas and lyrics. These societies were closely connected with local civic leaders and their public plays were a form of early public relations for the city. - Chrétien de Troyes (\\"Christian\\") was a late-12th-century French poet and trouvère known for his work on Arthurian subjects, and for originating the character Lancelot. This work represents some of the best-regarded of medieval literature. His use of structure, particularly in \\"Yvain, the Knight of the Lion\\", has been seen as a step towards the modern novel. Little is known of his life, but he seems to have been from Troyes, or at least intimately connected with it, and between 1160 and 1172 he served at the court of his patroness Marie of France, Countess of Champagne, daughter of Eleanor of Aquitaine, perhaps as herald-at-arms (as Gaston Paris speculated). - Lyric poetry is a formal type of poetry which expresses personal emotions or feelings, typically spoken in the first person. The term derives from a form of Ancient Greek literature, the lyric, which was defined by its musical accompaniment, usually on a stringed instrument known as a lyre. The term owes its importance in literary theory to the division developed by Aristotle between three broad categories of poetry: lyrical, dramatic and epic. - Thibaut de Blaison , Blason , or Blazon ( died after March 1229 ) was a Poitevin nobleman , Crusader , and trouvère from a noble family with lands in Blason and Mirabel . Eleven poems -- one contested and one definitely spurious -- have been ascribed to Thibaut in the chansonniers . Three further anonymous songs have also been attributed to him by Terence H. Newcombe , his modern editor . Thibaut was the seneschal of Poitou and his uncle was Maurice , Bishop of Poitiers . In 1214 Thibaut helped negotiate a truce between Philip II of France and John of England . In 1212 he was taking part in the Reconquista in Spain and he was among the Albigensian Crusaders besieging Toulouse in 1218 . He appears alongside the trouvère Amauri de Craon in a document of 1219 . He attended the coronation of Louis IX in 1226 , along with the trouvère Hue de la Ferté . Theobald I of Navarre , also a trouvère , dedicated the song De ma dame souvenir to Thibaut and also used Thibaut 's Amours , que porra devenir as a model for a religious poem of his own . Gautier d'Espinal also borrowed the melody of Amours for one piece . Thibaut himself borrowed from rhythms from the polyphonic repertoire of the day . He may have based his Bien font Amours lor talent on the conductus Quid frustra consumeris and Chanter et renvoisier seuil on Sol sub nube latuit . With the exception of three chansons that are restricted to a sixth -- Amours , que porra devenir , Chanter et renvoisier seuil , and Huimain par un ajourant -- and one , Li miens chanters ne puet mais remanoir , which is severely restricted in movement , most of Thibaut 's melodies move freely . They are all basically syllabic , with only Li miens chanters exhibiting more complex melisma . Compared to his melodies ( all recorded in bar form ) , his prosody is usually simple , though three songs -- Bien font Amours lor talent , Bon jour ait hui cele a cui sui amis , and Quant je voi esté venir -- exhibit some variety . The simplicity of Bien font Amours is more in keeping with Thibaut 's... - Trouvère, sometimes spelled trouveur , is the Northern French (langue d'oïl) form of the langue d'oc (Occitan) word \\"trobador\\". It refers to poet-composers who were roughly contemporary with and influenced by the troubadours (composers and performers of Old Occitan lyric poetry during the High Middle Ages) but who composed their works in the northern dialects of France. The first known \\"trouvère\\" was Chrétien de Troyes (\\"fl\\". 1160s-1180s) (Butterfield, 1997) and the \\"trouvères\\" continued to flourish until about 1300. Some 2130 \\"trouvère\\" poems have survived; of these, at least two-thirds have melodies. - Blason is a form of poetry. The term originally comes from the heraldic term \\"blazon\\" in French heraldry, which means either the codified description of a coat of arms or the coat of arms itself. The Dutch term is Blazoen, and in either Dutch or French, the term is often used to refer to the coat of arms of a chamber of rhetoric. - A troubadour was a composer and performer of Old Occitan lyric poetry during the High Middle Ages (11001350). Since the word \\"troubadour\\" is etymologically masculine, a female troubadour is usually called a trobairitz. - In heraldry and heraldic vexillology, a blazon is a formal description of a coat of arms, flag or similar emblem, from which the reader can reconstruct the appropriate image. The verb \\"to blazon\\" means to create such a description. The visual depiction of a coat of arms or flag traditionally has considerable latitude in design, while a blazon specifies the essentially distinctive elements; thus it can be said that a coat of arms or flag is primarily defined not by a picture but rather by the wording of its blazon (though often flags are in modern usage additionally and more precisely defined using geometrical specifications). \\"Blazon\\" also refers to the specialized language in which a blazon is written, and, as a verb, to the act of writing such a description. This language has its own vocabulary, grammar and syntax, or rules governing word order, which becomes essential for comprehension when blazoning a complex coat of arms. What is the relationship between 'thibaut de blaison' and 'poet'?","response":"Thibaut de Blaison, also known as Thibaut de Blason or Blazon, was a Poitevin nobleman, Crusader, and trouvère from the 12th and 13th centuries. A trouvère is a poet-composer in Northern French, similar to the Occitan troubadours who composed and performed lyric poetry during the High Middle Ages. In this context, the relationship between Thibaut de Blaison and 'poet' lies in his role as a trouvère. Eleven poems, some of them set to melodies, have been attributed to Thibaut de Blaison, showcasing his skill as a poet. His works were influential among his contemporaries, and he was connected to other notable poets of his time."},{"question":"- The animal eats large quantities of food that will be stored as fat - Winter comes and the animal finds a place to hibernate - Over a period of days, the animal&#x27;s heart rate and breathing rate drop slowly - Electrical activity in the brain almost ceases completely, though some areas remain active What might be the last step of the process?

The band sought to reinvent its sound and intended to incorporate drum loops and percussion experiments. Just as the sessions were due to begin in October, Berry decided, after months of contemplation and discussions with Downs and Mills, to tell the rest of the band that he was quitting. Berry told his bandmates that he would not quit if they would break up as a result, so Stipe, Buck, and Mills agreed to carry on as a three-piece with his blessing. Berry publicly announced his departure three weeks later in October 1997. Berry told the press, \\"I'm just not as enthusiastic as I have been in the past about doing this anymore . . . I have the best job in the world. But I'm kind of ready to sit back and reflect and maybe not be a pop star anymore.\\" Stipe admitted that the band would be different without a major contributor: \\"For me, Mike, and Peter, as R.E.M., are we still R.E.M.? I guess a three-legged dog is still a dog. It just has to learn to run differently.\\"The band cancelled its scheduled recording sessions as a result of Berry's departure. \\"Without Bill it was different, confusing\\", Mills later said. \\"We didn't know exactly what to do.

Hypothesis: The ptolemaic dynasty, sometimes referred to as the Lagids was an Ancient Egyptian royal family pick from the following. (1). Yes. (2). It's impossible to say. (3). No.","response":"(3). No. Although it is tempting to consider the Ptolemaic dynasty an Ancient Egyptian royal family due to their reign over Egypt, it is essential to understand the actual origins and affiliations of this dynasty to make an accurate conclusion. The Ptolemaic dynasty was a Macedonian Greek royal family, and they established the Ptolemaic Kingdom in Egypt during the Hellenistic period. This period emerged from the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC and lasted until the rise of the Roman Empire. The Ptolemies descended from a general of Alexander the Great, named Ptolemy I Soter. Instead of being of Egyptian origin, the family's roots were in Macedon, a kingdom in northern Greece. While ruling over Egypt, the Ptolemaic dynasty faced a turbulent relationship with native Egyptians. The Ptolemies sought to incorporate Egyptian culture into their own by adopting traditional practices, ceremonies, and even the ancient Egyptian religion. Despite these efforts to integrate, native Egyptians were generally treated as second-class citizens, and there were frequent uprisings throughout the dynasty's rule. The Ptolemaic dynasty ruled Egypt for 275 years, from 305 to 30 BC, serving as the last dynasty of ancient Egypt before the Roman conquest. However, due to their origins and cultural background, they should more accurately be identified as a Macedonian Greek royal family. In summary, although the Ptolemaic dynasty ruled Egypt for a significant period, they were not an Ancient Egyptian royal family. Instead, they were a Macedonian Greek royal family who took control over Egypt during the Hellenistic period."},{"question":"See the multi-choice question below: Sentence 1: The Illinois Supreme Court on Friday hiked attorney registration fees by 49 a year to boost both legal aid services and support for lawyers with drug and alcohol problems. Sentence 2: Last year, approximately 10% of lawyers faced serious drug and alcohol addiction problems. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true? OPT: -yes. -it is not possible to tell. -no.","response":"The answer to the question is: it is not possible to tell. The first sentence states that the Illinois Supreme Court increased attorney registration fees by 49 a year to boost legal aid services and support for lawyers with drug and alcohol problems. This information confirms that there is some level of concern for lawyers dealing with these issues; however, it does not provide any direct statistical evidence or correlation to determine the percentage of lawyers who actually face serious drug and alcohol addiction problems. The second sentence claims that last year, approximately 10% of lawyers faced serious drug and alcohol addiction problems. While this statement may or may not be true, we cannot confirm its accuracy based solely on the information provided in the first sentence. To determine the truthfulness of the second sentence, additional information, context, or data regarding the prevalence of drug and alcohol addiction amongst lawyers would be necessary.

Also known as a \\"conflux\\", it refers either to the point where a tributary joins a larger river, (main stem), or where two streams meet to become the source of a river of a new name, such as the confluence of the Monongahela and Allegheny rivers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania creating the Ohio River. - A drainage basin or catchment basin is an extent or an area of land where all surface water from rain, melting snow, or ice converges to a single point at a lower elevation, usually the exit of the basin, where the waters join another body of water, such as a river, lake, reservoir, estuary, wetland, sea, or ocean. Thus if a tributary stream joins a brook that in turn joins a small river which is a tributary of a larger river, there is a series of successively larger (and lower elevation) drainage basins. For instance, the Missouri and Ohio rivers are within their own drainage basins and also within the drainage basin of the Mississippi River. - A sea is a large body of salt water that is surrounded in whole or in part by land. More broadly, \\"the sea\\" is the interconnected system of Earth's salty, oceanic watersconsidered as one global ocean or as several principal oceanic divisions. The sea moderates Earth's climate and has important roles in the water cycle, carbon cycle, and nitrogen cycle. Although the sea has been traveled and explored since prehistory, the modern scientific study of the seaoceanographydates broadly to the British \\"Challenger\\" expedition of the 1870s. The sea is conventionally divided into up to five large oceanic sectionsincluding the International Hydrographic Organization's four named oceans (the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, and Arctic) and the Southern Ocean; smaller, second-order sections, such as the Mediterranean, are known as \\"seas\\". - Oka is a river in central Russia, the largest right tributary of the Volga. It flows through the regions of Oryol, Tula, Kaluga, Moscow, Ryazan, Vladimir, and Nizhny Novgorod and is navigable over a large part of its total length, as far upstream as to the town of Kaluga. Its length exceeds . The Russian capital Moscow sits on one of the Oka's tributariesthe Moskva River. - The Mississippi River is the chief river of the largest drainage system on the North American continent. Flowing entirely in the United States (although its drainage basin reaches into Canada), it rises in northern Minnesota and meanders slowly southwards for to the Mississippi River Delta at the Gulf of Mexico. With its many tributaries, the Mississippi's watershed drains all or parts of 31 U.S. states and 2 Canadian provinces between the Rocky and Appalachian Mountains. The Mississippi ranks as the fourth longest and fifteenth largest river in the world by discharge. The river either borders or passes through the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana. - Saint Petersburg is Russia's second-largest city after Moscow, with five million inhabitants in 2012, and an important Russian port on the Baltic Sea. It is politically incorporated as a federal subject (a federal city). Situated on the Neva River, at the head of the Gulf of Finland on the Baltic Sea, it was founded by Tsar Peter the Great on May . In 1914, the name was changed from Saint Petersburg to Petrograd, in 1924 to Leningrad, and in 1991 back to Saint Petersburg. Between 17131728 and 17321918, Saint Petersburg was the imperial capital of Russia. In 1918, the central government bodies moved to Moscow. - An estuary is a partially enclosed coastal body of brackish water with one or more rivers or streams flowing into it, and with a free connection to the open sea. - A waterway is any navigable body of water. A shipping route consists of one or several waterways. Waterways can include rivers, lakes, seas, oceans, and canals. In order for a waterway to be navigable, it must meet several criteria: - Novosibirsk is the third-most populous city in Russia after Moscow and St. Petersburg. It is the most populous city in Asian Russia, with a population of 1,473,754 as of the 2010 Census. It is the administrative center of Novosibirsk Oblast as well as of the Siberian Federal District. The city is located in the southwestern part of Siberia on the banks of the Ob River adjacent to the Ob River Valley, near the large water reservoir formed by the dam of the Novosibirsk Hydro Power Plant, and occupies an area of . - Eurasia is the combined continental landmass of Europe and Asia. The term is a portmanteau of its constituent continents. Located primarily in the Northern and Eastern Hemispheres, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and by Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Indian Ocean to the south. The division between Europe and Asia as two different continents is a historical and cultural construct, with no clear physical separation between them; thus, in some parts of the world, Eurasia is recognized as the largest of five or six continents. In geology, Eurasia is often considered as a single rigid megablock. However, the rigidity of Eurasia is debated based on the paleomagnet data. - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague. - Lama River ( Russian : ) is a river in the Moscow and Tver Oblasts in Russia , a tributary of the Shosha River . The river is 139 kilometres ( 86 mi ) long . The area of its drainage basin is 2,330 square kilometres ( 900 sq mi ) . The Lama River freezes up in November and stays under the ice until late March or early April . Historically , the river was a part of the important waterway from the Volga River to the Moskva River . The city of Volokolamsk that has been standing on the Lama River since the 12th century was previously known as Volok Lamsky ( literally - Drag of Lama ) after the process of a watercraft portage . - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - An ocean (the sea of classical antiquity) is a body of saline water that composes much of a planet's hydrosphere. On Earth, an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the World Ocean, which covers almost 71% of its surface. These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans. The word \\"sea\\" is often used interchangeably with \\"ocean\\" in American English but, strictly speaking, a sea is a body of saline water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land. - Canals and navigations are human-made channels for water conveyance (supply), or to service water transport vehicles. In the vernacular, both are referred to as 'canals', and in most cases, the engineered works will have a series of dams and locks that create areas of low speed current flow. These areas are referred to as\\" 'slack water levels',\\" often just called 'levels'. The main difference between them is that a navigation parallels a river and shares part of its waters, its drainage basin and leverages its resources by building dams and locks to increase and lengthen its long stretches of \\"deep enough\\" slack water levels while staying in its valley. In contrast, a canal cuts across a drainage divide atop a ridge (however humble), generally requiring an external water source above the highest elevation. Many canals have been built at elevations towering over valleys and others water ways crossing far below. Cities need a lot of fresh water and many canals with sources of water at a higher level can deliver water to a destination where there is a lack of water. The Roman Empire's Aqueducts were such water supply canals. - Volokolamsk is a town and the administrative center of Volokolamsky District in Moscow Oblast, Russia, located on the Gorodenka River, not far from its confluence with the Lama River, northwest of Moscow. Population: - The Volga is the longest river in Europe. It is also Europe's largest river in terms of discharge and watershed. The river flows through central Russia and into the Caspian Sea, and is widely regarded as the national river of Russia. - The Moskva River (\\"Moskva-reka\\") is a river of western Russia. It rises about west of Moscow, and flows roughly east through the Smolensk and Moscow Oblasts, passing through central Moscow. About south east of Moscow, at the city of Kolomna, it flows into the Oka River, itself a tributary of the Volga, which ultimately flows into the Caspian Sea. - Nizhny Novgorod, colloquially shortened to Nizhny, is a city in the administrative center of Nizhny Novgorod Oblast and Volga Federal District in Russia. From 1932 to 1990, it was known as Gorky, after the writer Maxim Gorky, who was born there. The city is an important economic, transportation, scientific, educational and cultural center in Russia and the vast Volga-Vyatka economic region, and is the main center of river tourism in Russia. In the historical part of the city there are a large number of universities, theaters, museums and churches. Nizhny Novgorod is located about 400 km east of Moscow, where the Oka empties into the Volga. Population: - Shosha River is a river in Zubtsovsky, Staritsky, Kalininsky and in Konakovsky Districts of Tver Oblast and Lotoshinsky District of Moscow Oblast in Russia. It is a right tributary of the Volga River. The length of the Shosha River is . The area of its basin is . The river flows into the Ivankovo Reservoir. The Shosha freezes up in November through early January and stays icebound until late March or early April. - A tributary or affluent is a stream or river that flows into a larger stream or main stem (or parent) river or a lake. A tributary does not flow directly into a sea or ocean. Tributaries and the main stem river drain the surrounding drainage basin of its surface water and groundwater, leading the water out into an ocean. - Ivankovo Reservoir or Ivankovskoye Reservoir, informally known as the Moscow Sea, is the uppermost reservoir on the Volga River, in Moscow and Tver Oblasts of Russia, located some 130 km north of Moscow. The dam of the reservoir is situated in the town of Dubna. The town of Konakovo is located on its southern coast. The reservoir is connected to the Moskva River by the Moscow Canal, and is the principal fresh water source for the city of Moscow. Its area is , and the area of its drainage basin is . - Russia (from the Rus'), also officially known as the Russian Federation, is a country in Eurasia. At , Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 140 million people at the end of March 2016. The European western part of the country is much more populated and urbanised than the eastern, about 77% of the population live in European Russia. Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara. - The Caspian Sea is the largest enclosed inland body of water on Earth by area, variously classed as the world's largest lake or a full-fledged sea. It is in an endorheic basin (it has no outflows) located between Europe and Asia. It is bound by Kazakhstan to the northeast, Russia to the northwest, Azerbaijan to the west, Iran to the south, and Turkmenistan to the southeast. What is the relationship between 'lama river' and 'ivankovo reservoir'? Answer:","response":"The Lama River is a tributary of the Shosha River in Moscow and Tver Oblasts in Russia. The Shosha River flows into the Ivankovo Reservoir. Therefore, the water from the Lama River ultimately ends up in the Ivankovo Reservoir."},{"question":"Translate \\"Spain will not change its position of refusing to recognise Kosovo's independence, according to the country's prime minister, Jose Luis Zapatero.\\" to Turkish?","response":"İspanya, Kosova'nın bağımsızlığını tanımama konusundaki tutumunu değiştirmeyecek, ülkenin başbakanı Jose Luis Zapatero'ya göre."},{"question":"Does the following review have a positive or negative opinion of the movie? makes the same mistake as the music industry Choose from: A). negative.

He is considered one of the most influential Jewish leaders of the 20th century. - The Rebbe the Messiah, and the Scandal of Orthodox Indifference is a book by Rabbi Dr. David Berger on the topic of Chabad messianism and the mainstream orthodox Jewish reaction to that trend. Rabbi Berger addresses the \\"Chabad-Messianic question\\", regarding a dead Messiah, from a halachic perspective. The book is written as a historical narrative of Berger's encounter with Chabad messianism from the time of the death of the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson in 1994 through the book's publication in 2001. The narrative is interlaced with Dr. Berger's published articles, written correspondences, and transcribed public lectures, in which he passionately appeals to both the leadership of the Orthodox and Chabad communities for an appropriate response to Chabad-Lubavitch messianism. - Private universities are not operated by governments, although many receive tax breaks, public student loans, and grants. Depending on their location, private universities may be subject to government regulation. This is in contrast to public universities and national universities.

At first only the highest members of the nobility were involved, although gradually a wider group of the population was affected. The major effects on the lesser Lithuanian nobility took place after various sanctions were imposed by the Russian Empire such as removing Lithuania from the names of the Gubernyas few years after the November Uprising. After the January Uprising the sanctions went further, and Russian officials announced that \\"Lithuanians are Russians seduced by Poles and Catholicism\\" and began to intensify russification, and to ban the printing of books in the Lithuanian language. Q: What did the russian officials announce as a sanction?","response":"The Russian officials announced several sanctions targeting Lithuania and its people as a response to uprisings. In the aftermath of the November Uprising and the January Uprising, they imposed stricter measures to suppress Lithuanian culture and identity. They began to intensify russification, pushing for the adoption of Russian language, culture, and customs in the region. One of the prominent sanctions was the removal of \\"Lithuania\\" from the names of the Gubernyas, an administrative division in the Russian Empire. This act effectively weakened the recognition of Lithuania's distinctiveness and historical ties. Additionally, Russian officials made a statement claiming that \\"Lithuanians are Russians seduced by Poles and Catholicism.\\" This view held that Lithuanian identity was merely a divergence from the true Russian identity resulting from Polish cultural influence and the adoption of Catholicism. This notion aimed to justify the russification process in Lithuania. Furthermore, as part of the sanctions, the Russian Empire banned the printing of books in the Lithuanian language. This measure gravely limited the spread of knowledge and preservation of Lithuanian culture, as well as undermining their distinct linguistic heritage. Overall, these sanctions sought to erase Lithuanian identity and assimilate the people into Russian society, thereby consolidating control over the region by the Russian Empire."},{"question":"I heard that Remy put Jan away to bed for the night and then turned off the lights.

Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2015, Athens was ranked the world's 29th richest city by purchasing power and the 67th most expensive in a UBS study. - A Midsummer Night's Dream is a comedy written by William Shakespeare in 1595/96. It portrays the events surrounding the marriage of Theseus, the Duke of Athens, to Hippolyta. These include the adventures of four young Athenian lovers and a group of six amateur actors (the mechanicals) who are controlled and manipulated by the fairies who inhabit the forest in which most of the play is set. The play is one of Shakespeare's most popular works for the stage and is widely performed across the world. - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction. - Discworld is a comic fantasy book series written by the English author Terry Pratchett (19482015), set on the fictional Discworld, a flat disc balanced on the backs of four elephants which in turn stand on the back of a giant turtle, Great A'Tuin. The books frequently parody or take inspiration from J. R. R. Tolkien, Robert E. Howard, H. P. Lovecraft, Charles Dickens, and William Shakespeare, as well as mythology, folklore and fairy tales, often using them for satirical parallels with current cultural, political and scientific issues. The series is popular, with more than 80 million books sold in 37 languages. - William Shakespeare (26 April 1564 (baptised) 23 April 1616) was an English :poet, :playwright, and actor, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist. He is often called England's national poet, and the \\"Bard of Avon\\". His extant works, including collaborations, consist of approximately 38 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright. - Robert Ervin Howard (January 22, 1906 June 11, 1936) was an American author who wrote pulp fiction in a diverse range of genres. He is well known for his character Conan the Barbarian and is regarded as the father of the sword and sorcery subgenre. - In Classical Greek mythology, Hippolyta (\\"Hippolyte\\") was the Amazonian queen who possessed a magical girdle she was given by her father Ares, the god of war. The girdle was a waist belt that signified her authority as queen of the Amazons. She figures prominently in the myths of both Heracles and Theseus. As such, the myths about her are varied enough that they may be about several different women. - The Carpet People is a fantasy novel by British writer Terry Pratchett. It was originally published in 1971, but was later re-written by the author when his work became more widespread and well-known. In the Author's Note of the revised edition, published in 1992, Pratchett wrote: \\"This book had two authors, and they were both the same person.\\" - Sir Terence David John \\"Terry\\" Pratchett, OBE (28 April 1948 12 March 2015) was an English author of fantasy novels, especially comical works. He is best known for his Discworld series of 41 novels. Pratchett's first novel, \\"The Carpet People\\", was published in 1971. The first Discworld novel, \\"The Colour of Magic\\", was published in 1983, after which he wrote two books a year on average. His 2011 Discworld novel \\"Snuff\\" was at the time of its release the third-fastest-selling hardback adult-readership novel since records began in the UK, selling 55,000 copies in the first three days. His final Discworld novel, \\"The Shepherd's Crown\\", was published in August 2015, five months after his death. - The Colour of Magic is a 1983 comic fantasy novel by Terry Pratchett, and is the first book of the \\"Discworld\\" series. The first printing of the British edition consisted of 506 copies. Pratchett has described it as \\"an attempt to do for the classical fantasy universe what \\"Blazing Saddles\\" did for Westerns.\\" - Lords and Ladies is the fourteenth Discworld book by Terry Pratchett . It was originally published in 1992 . Much of the storyline spoofs elements of Shakespeare 's play A Midsummer Night 's Dream . - A fairy tale is a type of short story that typically features folkloric fantasy characters, such as dwarves, elves, fairies, giants, gnomes, goblins, mermaids, trolls, unicorns, or witches, and usually magic or enchantments. Fairy tales may be distinguished from other folk narratives such as legends (which generally involve belief in the veracity of the events described) and explicitly moral tales, including beast fables. The term is mainly used for stories with origins in European tradition and, at least in recent centuries, mostly relates to children's literature. - Mythology refers variously to the collected myths of a group of people or to the study of such myths. Myths are the stories people tell to explain nature, history and customs. - Folklore is the body of expressive culture shared by a particular group of people; it encompasses the traditions common to that culture, subculture or group. These include oral traditions such as tales, proverbs and jokes. They include material culture, ranging from traditional building styles to handmade toys common to the group. Folklore also includes customary lore, the forms and rituals of celebrations like Christmas and weddings, folk dances and initiation rites. Each one of these, either singly or in combination, is considered a folklore artifact. Just as essential as the form, folklore also encompasses the transmission of these artifacts from one region to another or from one generation to the next. For folklore is not taught in a formal school curriculum or studied in the fine arts. Instead these traditions are passed along informally from one individual to another either through verbal instruction or demonstration. The academic study of folklore is called folkloristics. - Howard Phillips Lovecraft (August 20, 1890 March 15, 1937) was an American author who achieved posthumous fame through his influential works of horror fiction. Virtually unknown and published only in pulp magazines before he died in poverty, he is now regarded as one of the most significant 20th-century authors in his genre. Lovecraft was born in Providence, Rhode Island, where he spent most of his life. Among his most celebrated tales are \\"The Call of Cthulhu\\" and \\"The Shadow over Innsmouth\\", both canonical to the \\"Cthulhu Mythos\\". Never able to support himself from earnings as author and editor, Lovecraft saw commercial success increasingly elude him in this latter period, partly because he lacked the confidence and drive to promote himself. He subsisted in progressively straitened circumstances in his last years; an inheritance was completely spent by the time he died at the age of 46. - John Ronald Reuel Tolkien, (3 January 1892 2 September 1973), known by his pen name J. R. R. Tolkien, was an English writer, poet, philologist, and university professor who is best known as the author of the classic high-fantasy works \\"The Hobbit\\", \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", and \\"The Silmarillion\\". - Charles John Huffam Dickens (7 February 1812 9 June 1870) was an English writer and social critic. He created some of the world's best-known fictional characters and is regarded by many as the greatest novelist of the Victorian era. His works enjoyed unprecedented popularity during his lifetime, and by the twentieth century critics and scholars had recognised him as a literary genius. His novels and short stories enjoy lasting popularity. 'lords and ladies ' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'main subject'?

The rest are girls. Every boy in class gets an 80% on the math test. Every girl gets a 90%. What is the class average on the test? Think carefully first, then make a decision:","response":"To determine the class average on the test, we need to know the proportion of boys and girls in the class and average their scores.

Every boy gets an 80% on the test, while every girl gets a 90%. Now, we can use weighted average to find the class average on the test: (Class average) = (Percentage of boys * Boys average) + (Percentage of girls * Girls average) In this case: (Class average) = (0.4 * 80) + (0.6 * 90) Calculating further, we get: (Class average) = (32) + (54) (Class average) = 86 The class average on the math test is 86%."},{"question":"This text is missing some spaces, please add them: FLYBOL:LeftemptydwellingsbyRegion,rooms,useandresidencetimeinthehousing","response":"The given text appears to be a string of words without spaces, making it difficult to comprehend. Allow me to add spaces and provide a better understanding of the phrase: Text with spaces: FLYBOL: Left empty dwellings by Region, rooms, use, and residence time in the housing. Based on the revised text, it seems like this phrase could be a title or heading, or possibly a query for a database related to housing information. It suggests that the data being sought or presented is related to empty dwellings according to the specific parameters of region, room types, uses of the dwelling, and the time the dwelling has been a residence. Let's break it down further: 1. FLYBOL: This term might be an acronym, abbreviation, or code related to a specific organization or program that deals with housing data. Without more context, it's difficult to determine the significance of this term. 2. Left empty dwellings: This phrase refers to residential properties that are vacant or unoccupied. These dwellings can be houses, apartments, or other forms of residential spaces that are currently empty and available for rent, purchase, or temporary use. 3. By Region: This parameter indicates that the empty dwellings are categorized according to their geographical location. It could refer to regions within a country, across different countries, or even smaller geographical subdivisions, such as cities or neighborhoods. 4. Rooms: This could refer to the types or number of rooms within the empty dwellings. Information about rooms might include the total number of rooms, individual room sizes, or other specific details. Adding this parameter helps provide further insight into the characteristics of the empty dwellings. 5. Use: This aspect pertains to the purpose or function of the dwellings. It could encompass various types of residential usage, such as single-family homes, multi-family homes, vacation rentals, communal living spaces, or boarding houses. 6. Residence time in the housing: This parameter likely refers to the duration in which the property has been a residence or the period it has been unoccupied. This information can be useful for understanding the dynamics of the housing market, such as demand for properties or factors that contribute to vacancies. Overall, the phrase seems to be describing a data set or report that analyzes empty dwellings based on specific parameters to better understand regional housing patterns and trends. By considering factors such as location, room types, dwelling use, and residence time, it aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of unoccupied housing in a specified area."},{"question":"Instructions: You are given two sentences(Sentence1 and Sentence2).

The rescued party, having had its last contact with civilization in 1914, was unaware of the course of the Great War. News of Shackleton's safe arrival in the Falklands briefly eclipsed war news in the British newspapers on 2 June 1916. The expedition returned home in piecemeal fashion, at a critical stage in the war, without the normal honours and civic receptions. When Shackleton himself finally arrived in England on 29 May 1917, after a short American lecture tour, his return was barely noticed.Despite McNish's efforts in preparing and sailing on the James Caird voyage, his prior insubordination meant that, on Shackleton's recommendation, he was one of four men denied the Polar Medal; the others whose contributions fell short of Shackleton's expected standards were John Vincent, William Stephenson and Ernest Holness. Most of the members of the expedition returned to take up immediate active military or naval service. Before the war ended, two—Tim McCarthy of the open boat journey and the veteran Antarctic sailor Alfred Cheetham—had been killed in action, and Ernest Wild of the Ross Sea party had died of typhoid while serving in the Mediterranean. Several others were severely wounded, and many received decorations for gallantry. Following a propaganda mission in Buenos Aires, Shackleton was employed during the last weeks of the war on special service in Murmansk, with the Army rank of Major. This occupied him until March 1919. He thereafter organised one final Antarctic expedition, the Shackleton–Rowett Expedition on Quest, which left London on 17 September 1921. From the Endurance crew, Wild, Worsley, Macklin, McIlroy, Hussey, Alexander Kerr, Thomas McLeod and cook Charles Green, all sailed with Quest.Shackleton died of a heart attack on 5 January 1922, while Quest was anchored at South Georgia.

The ultimate aim was to increase the state revenues without damaging the prosperity of subjects to prevent the emergence of social disorder and to keep the traditional organization of the society intact.\\" Answer: A:","response":"To help the Ottomans reach their ultimate goal of consolidating and extending the ruler's power while maintaining the prosperity of their subjects and preventing social disorder, several key strategies can be considered: 1. Encouraging economic growth: Facilitating trade, supporting local industries and allowing innovation in areas such as agriculture, manufacturing, and commerce would help increase the wealth of both the state and the productive classes. 2. Equitable tax policies: Implementing fair and efficient tax policies that do not overly burden the productive classes, while still providing the state with sufficient resources to support its administrative, military, and social needs. 3. Fostering social harmony: Promoting education, religious tolerance, and cultural exchange would contribute to a more cohesive and stable society. This would make it easier to maintain the traditional organization of the society and prevent social unrest. 4. Expanding territorial control: Employing strategic diplomacy, alliances, and military campaigns, the Ottomans could expand their territory and incorporate new sources of revenue, as well as secure important trade routes and resources. 5. Strengthening centralized administration: Developing an effective administrative system, with a capable bureaucracy and a loyal military force, would enable the Ottoman ruler to maintain control over various regions and ensure the efficient collection and distribution of state resources. 6. Investing in infrastructure: Building, maintaining, and upgrading roads, bridges, and ports would facilitate trade, communication, and transportation, thereby boosting the economy and providing more revenue for the state. By adopting these strategies, the Ottomans would be better positioned to achieve their ultimate goal of consolidating and extending their ruler's power, while also fostering the prosperity, stability, and traditional organization of their society."},{"question":"Given the question: Build a movie plot around this: Did David Kiss Chloe?

Their history has been a constant quest for national identity: a conflict between strong regional loyalties and central authority. In about 2000 b.c. Celtic tribes — probably from eastern Europe — came looking for greener pastures in the areas that are now Franche-Comté, Alsace, and Bur­gundy. At the same time, migrants from the Mediterranean countries were trickling into the south. The first recorded settlement was the trading post set up by Phocaean Greeks from Asia Minor at Massalia (Mar­seilles) around 600 b.c. , followed by other ports at Hyères, Antibes, and Nice. But the Greeks developed few contacts with the interior beyond a little commerce in olives and wine with the Celts of Burgundy. When their position was threatened by Ligurian pirates at sea and warlike tribes from inland, the merchants of Marseilles called on Rome for help. From Gaul to France In 125 b.c. , the Romans came in force, conquered the \\"Gallic barbarians,\\" and set up a fortress at Aquae Sextiae (Aix-en-Provence). They took advantage of this new stronghold to create Provincia (now Provence), stretching from the Alps to the Pyrénées, in order to guarantee communications between Italy and Spain. When this province was endangered by fresh attacks from the north, Julius Caesar himself took charge, conquering practically the whole of Gaul by 50 b.c. Caesar drew Gaul's northeastern frontier at the Rhine, taking in present-day Belgium, and warned that the Ger­man­ic tribes across the river — the Franks (after whom France is named), Alamans, and Saxons — would always threaten the security of the frontier. The Romanization of Gaul sent the most energetic warriors to defend the outposts of the empire while their families settled down to work the land or build towns such as Lyon, Orange, Arles, and Nîmes, and the first great highways between them. At the same time, merchants built up a thriving trade with the rest of the Roman Empire. The pattern for the peasantry and bourgeoisie of France was thus established. Christianity was introduced into Gaul in the first century a.d. Question: \\"Where were France's first settlements?\\" Answer: \\"Provincia (now Provence)\\" Is this answer correct?","response":"No, the answer is not entirely correct.

Amy went to a psychic after the death of their father but Mary did not as Select from: [a]. Amy was very gullible.. [b]. Mary was very gullible..","response":"Amy went to a psychic after the death of their father, but Mary did not as Amy was very gullible. Amy always believed in the existence of supernatural forces that could provide some guidance and insight into the world beyond. Even though Mary respected her sister's beliefs, she was far more grounded in reality and dismissed these things as mere superstition. Amy's gullibility made her susceptible to scams, snake oil salesmen, and self-proclaimed psychics who claimed to have the ability to commune with the deceased. She often found herself spending her hard-earned money on services that had no basis in fact or evidence, and she was desperate for any sign or message from her father after his unexpected passing. Mary tried to reason with her sister, attempting to explain the fallacies in her beliefs and the danger of placing her trust in these charlatans. But Amy was steadfast in her convictions, clinging to the hope that one day she would find a true psychic who could help her make contact with her father. As the years passed, Amy's journey took her all over the country seeking out mediums, spiritualists, and anyone else who purported to possess a supernatural connection to the afterlife. Time and time again, her hopes would be dashed when she finally saw through the ruse or when someone else exposed the fraud. Yet despite these setbacks, she never stopped believing that a true psychic existed somewhere, waiting to share the knowledge she so desperately sought. Meanwhile, Mary immersed herself in her studies of science, psychology, and philosophy, seeking answers to life's mysteries within the realm of reason and logic. She was well aware of the vulnerability that stemmed from her sister's naivete and desperately wanted to shield her from these predatory individuals. However, she knew that her sister's beliefs were too deeply ingrained to be swayed by rational argument or evidence-based thinking, so she focused her energy on providing Amy with emotional support and love through her ongoing search for a legitimate psychic. Their contrasting worldviews sometimes led to arguments and hurt feelings between the sisters, but they always managed to find a way to come back together, reaffirming their love and commitment to their bond. Despite their differences, they respected each other's desire to find solace in their own unique ways. As the years turned into decades and their lives became intertwined with marriages, careers, and children, Amy continued to explore her spiritual journey. Eventually, she met a psychic who seemed more genuine than those she had encountered in the past. While still skeptical, Mary begrudgingly admitted that this individual seemed different from the others and, if nothing else, appeared to offer Amy a sense of comfort and closure she had long been seeking. In the end, it was Amy's unrelenting belief in the existence of an authentic psychic that led her down a winding path full of false prophets and deceit. Yet, through it all, she was able to forge her own understanding of the world beyond and eventually find a glimmer of the truth she sought, even if it didn't align with Mary's view of reality. Their bond, however, remained unbroken, a testament to the strength of sisterhood in the face of starkly divergent beliefs."},{"question":"Question: Generate a question that has the following answer: White House for the following movie plot: In this fifth Resident Evil film, picking up immediately after the events in the previous film (Resident Evil: Afterlife), Alice (Milla Jovovich) and the others on the Umbrella Corporation freighter Arcadia face an attack by a fleet of airships led by Alice's former ally, Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory), who's been brainwashed by Umbrella through a scarab device attached to her chest.

Like the Common raven , Thick - billed raven and Brown - necked raven , it is one of the larger raven species . The smaller raven species are the Australian raven , Forest raven , Little raven , Fan - tailed raven and Chihuahuan raven with the Thick - billed raven being the world 's largest raven species and the Chihuahuan raven being the smallest . - The forest raven (\\"Corvus tasmanicus\\", also commonly known as the Tasmanian raven) is a passerine bird in the family Corvidae native to Tasmania and parts of southern Victoria, such as Wilsons Promontory and Portland. Populations are also found in parts of New South Wales, including Dorrigo and Armidale. Measuring in length, it has all-black plumage, beak and legs. As with the other two species of raven in Australia, its black feathers have grey bases. Adults have white irises; younger birds have dark brown and then hazel irises with an inner blue rim. New South Wales populations are recognised as a separate subspecies \\"C. tasmanicus boreus\\", but appear to be nested within the Tasmanian subspecies genetically. - The Australian raven (\\"Corvus coronoides\\") is a passerine bird in the genus \\"Corvus\\" native to much of southern and northeastern Australia. Measuring in length, it has all-black plumage, beak and mouth, as well as strong grey-black legs and feet. The upperparts are glossy, with a purple, blue or green sheen, and its black feathers have grey bases. The Australian raven is distinguished from the Australian crow species by its throat hackles, which are prominent in adult birds. Older adult individuals have white irises, younger adults have a white irises with an inner blue rim, while younger birds have dark brown irises until fifteen months of age, and hazel irises with an inner blue rim around each pupil until age two years and ten months. Nicholas Aylward Vigors and Thomas Horsfield described the Australian raven in 1827, its species name highlighting its similarity with the carrion crow (\\"C. corone\\"). Two subspecies are recognised, which differ slightly in calls and are quite divergent genetically. - The Wilsons Promontory is a peninsula that forms the southernmost part of the Australian mainland and is located in the state of Victoria. It is known to the indigenous Gunai/Kurnai and the Boonerwrung Clans as Yiruk and Wammum respectively. - The Chihuahuan raven (\\"Corvus cryptoleucus\\") is a species of bird in the family Corvidae that is native to the United States and Mexico. It was formerly known as the American white-necked raven, and has the proportions of a common raven with a heavy bill, but is about the same size as a carrion crow, or slightly larger than the American crow (long). The plumage is all-black with a rich purple-blue gloss in good light. Like the forest raven, little raven, fan-tailed raven and Australian raven, it is one of the smaller raven species. The larger species of raven are the common raven, thick-billed raven, white-necked raven and brown-necked raven, with the common and thick-billed ravens being the world's largest raven species and the little and fan-tailed ravens being the smallest. The Chihuahuan raven is very similar in appearance to the Australian raven, although with dark brown irises and whiter feather bases. The nasal bristles extend farther down the top of the bill than in any other \\"Corvus\\" species to about two-thirds the length. The base of the neck feathers are white-ish (seen only when ruffled in strong wind). The bill, legs and feet are black. - The satin bowerbird (\\"Ptilonorhynchus violaceus\\") is a bowerbird endemic to eastern Australia. - Carrion (from the Latin \\"\\"caro\\"\\", meaning \\"meat\\") is the decaying dead flesh of an animal. Carrion is an important food source for large carnivores and omnivores in most ecosystems. Examples of carrion-eaters (or scavengers) include vultures, hawks, eagles, hyenas, Virginia opossum, Tasmanian devils, coyotes, and Komodo dragons. Many invertebrates such as the carrion and burying beetles, as well as maggots of calliphorid flies and flesh-flies also eat carrion, playing an important role in recycling nitrogen and carbon in animal remains. Carrion begins to decay the moment of the animal's death, and it will increasingly attract insects and breed bacteria. Not long after the animal has died, its body will begin to exude a foul odor caused by the presence of bacteria and the emission of cadaverine and putrescine. - Australasia, a region of Oceania, comprises Australia, New Zealand, the island of New Guinea, and neighbouring islands in the Pacific Ocean. Charles de Brosses coined the term (as French \\"Australasie\\") in \\"Histoire des navigations aux terres australes\\" (1756). He derived it from the Latin for \\"south of Asia\\" and differentiated the area from Polynesia (to the east) and the southeast Pacific (Magellanica). The bulk of Australasia sits on the Indo-Australian Plate, together with India. - The brown-necked raven (\\"Corvus ruficollis\\") is a larger bird (5256 cm in length) than the carrion crow though not as large as the common raven. It has similar proportions to the common raven but the bill is not so large or deep and the wings tend to be a little more pointed in profile. The head and throat are a distinct brownish-black giving the bird its English name, while the rest of the plumage is black glossed with purple, blue or purplish-blue. Like the Common raven, Thick-billed raven and White-necked raven, it is one of the larger raven species. The smaller raven species are the Australian raven, Forest raven, Little raven, Fan-tailed raven and Chihuahuan raven with the Thick-billed raven being the world's largest raven species and the Chihuahuan raven being the smallest. The feathers of this species often fade quite quickly to a brownish black (even the truly black feathers) and the bird can look distinctly brown by the time it moults. The feet, legs and bill are black. The dwarf raven was formerly considered a subspecies (\\"Corvus ruficollis edithae\\") but this bird now appears to be closer to the pied crow (\\"C. albus\\") than this species. - Mexico (, modern Nahuatl ), officially the United Mexican States, is a federal republic in the southern half of North America. It is bordered to the north by the United States; to the south and west by the Pacific Ocean; to the southeast by Guatemala, Belize, and the Caribbean Sea; and to the east by the Gulf of Mexico. Covering almost two million square kilometers (over 760,000 sq mi), Mexico is the sixth largest country in the Americas by total area and the 13th largest independent nation in the world. With an estimated population of over 120 million, it is the eleventh most populous country and the most populous Spanish-speaking country in the world while being the second most populous country in Latin America. Mexico is a federation comprising 31 states and a federal district that is also its capital and most populous city. Other metropolises include Guadalajara, Monterrey, Puebla, Toluca, Tijuana and León. - The American crow (\\"Corvus brachyrhynchos\\") is a large passerine bird species of the family Corvidae. It is a common bird found throughout much of North America. American crows are the new world counterpart to the carrion crow and the hooded crow. Although the American crow and the hooded crow are very similar in size, structure and behavior, their calls are different. The American crow nevertheless occupies the same role the hooded crow does in Eurasia. - A passerine is any bird of the order Passeriformes, which includes more than half of all bird species. A notable feature of passerines compared to other orders of Aves is the arrangement of their toes, three pointing forward and one back, which facilitates perching. Sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds, the passerines form one of the most diverse terrestrial vertebrate orders, with over 5,000 identified species. It has roughly twice as many species as the largest of the mammal orders, the Rodentia. It contains more than 110 families, the second-most of any order of tetrapods (after Squamata, the scaled reptiles). The passerines contain several groups of brood parasites such as the viduas, cuckoo-finches, and the cowbirds. Most passerines are omnivorous, while the shrikes are carnivorous. - The thick-billed raven (\\"Corvus crassirostris\\"), a corvid from the Horn of Africa, shares with the common raven the distinction of being the largest bird in the corvid family, and indeed the largest of the most diverse bird order, the passerines. The thick-billed raven measures in length and weighs on average. It has a very large bill that is laterally compressed and is deeply curved in profile giving the bird a very distinctive appearance. This bill is black with a white tip and has deep nasal grooves with only light nasal bristle covers. - Corvidae is a cosmopolitan family of oscine passerine birds that contains the crows, ravens, rooks, jackdaws, jays, magpies, treepies, choughs, and nutcrackers. In common English, they are known as the crow family, or, more technically, corvids. Over 120 species are described. The genus \\"Corvus\\", including the jackdaws, crows, and ravens, makes up over a third of the entire family. - A lyrebird is either of two species of ground-dwelling Australian birds that compose the genus, Menura, and the family Menuridae. They are most notable for their superb ability to mimic natural and artificial sounds from their environment, and the striking beauty of the male bird's huge tail when it is fanned out in courtship display. Lyrebirds have unique plumes of neutral-coloured tailfeathers and are among Australia's best-known native birds. - The carrion crow (\\"Corvus corone\\") is a passerine bird of the family Corvidae and the genus \\"Corvus\\" which is native to western Europe and eastern Asia. - The little raven (\\"Corvus mellori\\") is a species of the family Corvidae that is native to southeastern Australia. An adult individual is about in length, with all-black plumage, beak and legs and a white iris, as do the other members of the genus \\"Corvus\\" in Australia and some species from the islands to the north. Like those of the other two species of raven in Australia, its black feathers have grey bases. Although the little raven was first named by Gregory Mathews in 1912, it was only in 1967 that there was consensus to separate it from the Australian raven (\\"C. coronoides\\") as a distinct species. - Ants are eusocial insects of the family Formicidae and, along with the related wasps and bees, belong to the order Hymenoptera. Ants evolved from wasp-like ancestors in the Cretaceous period, about 99 million years ago and diversified after the rise of flowering plants. More than 12,500 of an estimated total of 22,000 species have been classified. They are easily identified by their elbowed antennae and the distinctive node-like structure that forms their slender waists. - The pupil is a hole located in the centre of the iris of the eye that allows light to strike the retina. It appears black because light rays entering the pupil are either absorbed by the tissues inside the eye directly, or absorbed after diffuse reflections within the eye that mostly miss exiting the narrow pupil. - The Horn of Africa (, \\"yäafrika qänd\\", \\"al-qarn al-'afrq\\") (shortened to HOA) is a peninsula in Northeast Africa. It juts hundreds of kilometers into the Arabian Sea and lies along the southern side of the Gulf of Aden. The area is the easternmost projection of the African continent. The Horn of Africa denotes the region containing the countries of Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Somalia. - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney. - The common raven (\\"Corvus corax\\"), also known as the northern raven, is a large all-black passerine bird. Found across the Northern Hemisphere, it is the most widely distributed of all corvids. There are at least eight subspecies with little variation in appearance, although recent research has demonstrated significant genetic differences among populations from various regions. It is one of the two largest corvids, alongside the thick-billed raven, and is possibly the heaviest passerine bird; at maturity, the common raven averages in length and in mass. Common ravens can live up to 21 years in the wild, a lifespan exceeded among passerines by only a few Australasian species such as the satin bowerbird and probably the lyrebirds. Young birds may travel in flocks but later mate for life, with each mated pair defending a territory. - New South Wales (abbreviated as NSW) is a state on the east coast of :Australia. It borders Queensland to the north, Victoria to the south, and South Australia to the west. It has a coast line with the Tasman Sea on its east side. The Australian Capital Territory is an enclave within the state. New South Wales' state capital is Sydney, which is also Australia's most populous city. , the estimated population of New South Wales was 7.5 million, making it Australia's most populous state. Just under two-thirds of the state's population, 4.67 million, live in the Greater Sydney area. Inhabitants of New South Wales are referred to as \\"New South Welshmen\\". - Tasmania (abbreviated as Tas and known colloquially as \\"Tassie\\") is an island state of the Commonwealth of Australia. It is located to the south of the Australian mainland, separated by Bass Strait. The state encompasses the main island of Tasmania, the 26th-largest island in the world, and the surrounding 334 islands. The state has a population of around 518,500, just over forty percent of which resides in the Greater Hobart precinct, which forms the metropolitan area of the state capital and largest city, Hobart. - The fan-tailed raven (\\"Corvus rhipidurus\\") is a passerine bird of the crow family native to Eastern Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Like the Forest raven, Little raven, Australian raven and Chihuahuan raven, it is one of the smaller raven species. The larger species of raven are the Common raven, Thick-billed raven, White-necked raven and Brown-necked raven with the Common and Thick-billed ravens being the world's largest raven species and the Little and Fan-tailed ravens being the smallest, in fact it is about the same size or slightly larger than the carrion crow (4751 cm) but with a much thicker bill, shorter tail and much larger wings.

This portrays a rugged range with the highest peak in the clouds. Ruisdael's subjects became unusually varied. The art historian Wolfgang Stechow identified thirteen themes within the Dutch Golden Age landscape genre, and Ruisdael's work encompasses all but two of them, excelling at most: forests, rivers, dunes and country roads, panoramas, imaginary landscapes, Scandinavian waterfalls, marines, beachscapes, winter scenes, town views, and nocturnes. Only the Italianate and foreign landscapes other than Scandinavian are absent from his oeuvre.The imaginary landscapes of gardens that Ruisdael painted in the 1670s actually reflect an ongoing discourse on the picturesque in circles of gardening aesthetes like Constantijn Huygens. Slive finds it appropriate that a windmill is the subject of one of Ruisdael's most famous works. Windmill at Wijk bij Duurstede, dated 1670, shows Wijk bij Duurstede, a riverside town about 20 kilometres (12 mi) from Utrecht, with a dominant cylindrical windmill. In this composition, Ruisdael united typical Dutch elements of low-lying land, water and expansive sky, so that they converge on the equally characteristic Dutch windmill. The painting's enduring popularity is evidenced by card sales in the Rijksmuseum, with the Windmill ranking third after Rembrandt's Night Watch and Vermeer's View of Delft. Windmills featured throughout Ruisdael's entire career.Various panoramic views of the Haarlem skyline and its bleaching grounds appear during this stage, a specific genre called Haerlempjes, with the clouds creating various gradations of alternating bands of light and shadow towards the horizon. The paintings are often dominated by Saint Bavo's Church, in which Ruisdael would one day be buried.While Amsterdam does feature in his work, it does so relatively rarely given that Ruisdael lived there for over 25 years.

In a deal with rebels that will pave the way for Nancy Pelosi's return as House speaker, she has agreed to limit her time in the role to a maximum of four years. \\"Over the summer, I made it clear that I see myself as a bridge to the next generation of leaders, a recognition of my continuing responsibility to mentor and advance new members into positions of power and responsibility in the House Democratic Caucus,\\" Pelosi said in a statement, per the Washington Post. She said she plans to stick to the deal whether or not it is approved by the House caucus in a vote next year. The deal limits House Democratic leaders to three terms when they are in the majority, or four if they win two-thirds support, Politico reports. It applies retroactively to 2007, meaning Pelosi deputies Steny Hoyer and Jim Clyburn can also serve no later than 2022 in their current positions. The deal immediately won the support of seven Democratic holdouts who had demanded an overhaul of House leadership, giving Pelosi enough votes to reclaim the gavel, the Hill reports. (Before the deal, the Jan. 3 vote had been seen as a \\"showdown.\\")","response":"Title: Nancy Pelosi Agrees to Term Limit for House Speaker Position, Paving the Way for New Democratic Leadership in 2022 Introduction: The Democratic Party has been facing pressure to take a new approach and find fresh leadership to usher in a new era of progressivism. This renewed direction appears to be on the horizon, as Nancy Pelosi has reached an agreement to limit her time in the role of House speaker. This move has been highly anticipated by the Democratic rebels, who have been pushing for the next generation of political leaders to make their way into the higher ranks of the party. The Deal: In a strategic move to appeal to the Democratic rebels and ensure her return as House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi has agreed to limit her tenure in the position to a maximum of four years. She has emphasized her decision stems from her commitment to acting as a bridge for the next generation of leaders. In a statement to the Washington Post, Pelosi shared, \\"Over the summer, I made it clear that I see myself as a bridge to the next generation of leaders, a recognition of my continuing responsibility to mentor and advance new members into positions of power and responsibility in the House Democratic Caucus.\\" The agreement Pelosi made not only impacts her term in the House Speaker position, but also her deputies' time in their current roles. The deal places limits on House Democratic leaders, allowing for three terms when in the majority or four if they win two-thirds support. Furthermore, the terms apply retroactively to 2007, which means that Pelosi, Steny Hoyer, and Jim Clyburn can serve in their current positions no longer than 2022. Impact on Democratic Party and Pelosi's Support: The announcement of Pelosi's decision has immediately garnered the support of seven Democratic holdouts, who have been campaigning for an overhaul of House leadership for some time. This newfound support has allowed Pelosi to accumulate enough votes to reclaim the role of House Speaker, which was initially predicted to be a showdown during the January 3rd vote. Now Pelosi has agreed to the term limits, her approval by the House caucus in a vote next year may become a reality. Conclusion: The agreement made by Nancy Pelosi to limit her term as House Speaker addresses the concerns of Democratic rebels, advocates for the rise of new leadership in years to come, and guarantees Pelosi a position in the role. With the newfound support of holdouts, Pelosi is expected to reclaim and maintain her position until 2022, acting as a bridge for the next generation of Democratic leaders. This key move serves to revitalize the party and work towards their goals of progressive change in the United States."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What recording did Gramophone magazine vote the greatest recording of all time in 1999? Solti recorded throughout his career for the Decca Record Company. He made more than 250 recordings, including 45 complete opera sets. During the 1950s and 1960s Decca had an alliance with RCA Victor, and some of Solti's recordings were first issued on the RCA label.Solti was one of the first conductors who came to international fame as a recording artist before being widely known in the concert hall or opera house. Gordon Parry, the Decca engineer who worked with Solti and Culshaw on the Ring recordings, observed, \\"Many people have said 'Oh well, of course John Culshaw made Solti.' This is not true. He gave him the opportunity to show what he could do.\\"Solti's first recordings were as a piano accompanist, playing at sessions in Zurich for the violinist Georg Kulenkampff in 1947. Decca's senior producer, Victor Olof did not much admire Solti as a conductor (nor did Walter Legge, Olof's opposite number at EMI's Columbia Records), but Olof's younger colleague and successor, Culshaw, held Solti in high regard. As Culshaw, and later James Walker, produced his recordings, Solti's career as a recording artist flourished from the mid-1950s. Among the orchestras with whom Solti recorded were the Berlin Philharmonic, Chicago Symphony, London Philharmonic, London Symphony and Vienna Philharmonic orchestras. Soloists in his operatic recordings included Birgit Nilsson, Joan Sutherland, Régine Crespin, Plácido Domingo, Gottlob Frick, Carlo Bergonzi, Kiri Te Kanawa and José van Dam. In concerto recordings, Solti conducted for, among others, András Schiff, Julius Katchen, Clifford Curzon, Vladimir Ashkenazy and Kyung-wha Chung.Solti's most celebrated recording was Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen made in Vienna, produced by Culshaw, between 1958 and 1965.

From Reichenau, the Alpine Rhine flows east, passing Chur and turning north, forms the border between the canton of St. Gallen of Switzerland on the left, west side and first Liechtenstein and then Vorarlberg, Austria on the right, east side. The Swiss-Austrian border follows the historical bed of the Rhine, but today the river follows an artificial canal within Austria for the final . The Rhine Valley in this area extends to about . Its upper third has the character of an Alpine valley, enclosing a bottom plain of about across. Downstream of Vaduz, the valley widens considerably, developing into a broad plain, measuring some across at its lower end along the southern shores of Lake Constance. From the point of the Rhine's emergence from Lake Constance, it is known as High Rhine. - The Alps are the highest and most extensive mountain range system that lies entirely in Europe, stretching approximately across eight Alpine countries: Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Slovenia, and Switzerland. The mountains were formed over tens of millions of years as the African and Eurasian tectonic plates collided. Extreme shortening caused by the event resulted in marine sedimentary rocks rising by thrusting and folding into high mountain peaks such as Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn. Mont Blanc spans the FrenchItalian border, and at is the highest mountain in the Alps. The Alpine region area contains about a hundred peaks higher than 4000 metres (just over 13,000 feet). - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe.

The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux. - A principality (or princedom) can either be a monarchical feudatory or a sovereign state, ruled or reigned over by a monarch with the title of prince or by a monarch with another title within the generic use of the term \\"prince\\".

Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - A constitutional monarchy (also known as a parliamentary monarchy) is a form of monarchy in which the sovereign exercises their authorities in accordance with a written or unwritten constitution. Constitutional monarchy differs from absolute monarchy (in which a monarch holds absolute power), in that constitutional monarchs are bound to exercise their powers and authorities within the limits prescribed within an established legal framework.

The authorities also evacuated an arts center in the city. In a statement released Sunday, the Swedish Security Service said that the four men were arrested with the help of the National Task Force, which is deployed in urgent situations like those involving terrorism or hostages. There was no evidence that the case was connected with the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks, and the Security Service said that “there currently is no cause for public concern.” The authorities did not raise the threat level and declined to provide further information about the continuing investigation. Officials around the world are on high alert because of the anniversary. The arrests in Sweden were a reminder of the anger provoked in Scandinavia over drawings of the Prophet Muhammad, first in Denmark and then by the Swedish artist Lars Vilks in 2007. The daily newspaper Expressen reported that the Roda Sten art center in Goteborg was evacuated and that the surrounding area was cordoned off on Saturday night because of a “serious risk to human life.” Mia Christersdotter Norman, the managing director of the arts center, said by telephone on Sunday that about 400 people were celebrating the opening of the Goteborg International Biennial for Contemporary Art when the police asked her to inform the guests that they needed to gather their belongings and leave the building. “There was no panic,” Ms. Christersdotter Norman said, describing an orderly evacuation. The police called her early Sunday and said that they had searched the entire building and had not found anything. “They didn’t say what it was, just that there was a serious threat,” she said. The center, located in an old boiler house at the foot of the Alvsborg Bridge, is a landmark. Prosecutors have three days to charge the four people arrested. In a statement published on the Swedish Prosecution Authority’s Web site, Agneta Hilding Qvarnstrom, a prosecutor who is leading the preliminary investigation, said it was not possible to give any specifics about the case. “At this point, I can’t say when there will be more information,” she said. Magnus Ranstorp, a terrorism expert at the Swedish National Defense College who testified before the Sept. 11 commission, said the police and prosecutors had been unusually mum about the arrests. “They are surprisingly tight-lipped. Nothing is leaking out,” he said. “Whether it’s a Breivik, Al Qaeda-related or coming from the left, we don’t know,” he said, referring to Anders Behring Breivik, who admitted to killing 77 people in Norway in July. “It can be anything, but the fact that this happens so rarely and that it happened now,” on the eve of Sept. 11, Mr. Ranstorp said, “is a huge coincidence. You can’t rule out anything.” Sweden was the target of a terrorist attack in December when a suicide bomber, Taimour Abdulwahab al-Abdaly, an Iraqi Swede who had studied in Britain, killed himself and wounded two others in the heart of Stockholm’s city-center shopping district two weeks before Christmas.

Always be ready to leave through a window into the garden by making sure you can open it if necessary. If you should be on holiday in a tall building or hotel, make sure you know where the fire escape is . When you can't find any way out, try to find pieces of cloth and make a rope to get out of a window to safety. If you smell burning in your home, get out right away. If you can't breathe properly because of smoke on your way out, crawl on your hands and knees because smoke rises and the air will be cleaner near the floor. Smoke is a killer and more people have died from breathing it in than actually being burnt. Fire in a cinema, hall or public place often means people pushing to reach a door. Keep your head up with arms up in front of your chest .This protects your chest and gives you the best chance to breathe. Above all, don't get frightened! Question: In a room filled with smoke ,you'd better crawl on the floor because _ . Yes or no, is the answer \\"there is less smoke near the floor\\"? Answer:","response":"Yes, the answer is \\"there is less smoke near the floor.\\" When a fire occurs, smoke naturally rises due to its heat and lower density compared to cooler, fresher air. This creates a layer of smoke at the higher levels of a room while the air closer to the floor remains clearer for a longer period of time. Therefore, if you find yourself in a smoke-filled room, it's safer to stay low and crawl on your hands and knees to escape. This position puts you in the area with the least amount of smoke and gives you the best chance to breathe cleaner air as you find your way to safety. This technique is an essential part of fire safety protocol. It's not only advised for escaping from fires in residences, but is also applicable in larger, commercial buildings such as hotels or movie theaters. By staying low to the ground, you increase your chances of a successful escape with minimal smoke inhalation. It's important to note, however, that this strategy should be used in conjunction with other fire safety measures such as identifying multiple escape routes, having a well thought-out evacuation plan, knowing the location of fire escapes, and attempting to alert others to the presence of the fire, all while avoiding panic which can exacerbate the situation."},{"question":"Q:Generate a question about the following movie plot: British secret agent Harry Palmer (Michael Caine) is sent to Berlin by his superior Colonel Ross in order to arrange the defection of Colonel Stok (Oskar Homolka), a prominent Soviet intelligence officer. Palmer is sceptical but links up with Johnny Vulkan (Paul Hubschmid), an old German friend and former criminal associate, who now runs the Berlin station for British intelligence. Palmer makes a rendezvous with Stok in the Soviet zone of the divided city and finds him eccentric and likeable. Stok asks for the defection to be managed by Otto Kreutzman, a West German criminal who has organised a number of recent escapes. When Palmer returns to the western sector he meets a model who calls herself Samantha Steel (Eva Renzi), with whom he spends the night. Suspicious at the forward manner in which she approached him, he has his police contacts establish her identity the following day and arranges for a criminal to burgle her apartment, where several different false passports are discovered. Meanwhile, Palmer arranges a deal with Kreutzman to bring Stok across the wall for Â£20,000. Palmer then returns to London to report. Ross is convinced that Stok's defection is genuine and dismisses Palmer's suspicions that the model he met in Berlin was a spy. Ross gives full authorisation for Palmer to return to Berlin to complete the deal, with documents and money provided by a man at Intelligence headquarters named Hallam (Hugh Burden). The plan devised by Kreutzman is to arrange a burial and bring the Colonel across the border in a coffin. When Palmer again meets Samantha, she admits that she is a Mossad spy and that she is in Berlin to hunt down a war criminal named Paul Louis Broum - now operating under an alias - who stole millions of pounds of gold during the Second World War. Kreutzman goes over to the east to supervise the defection personally in view of its importance.

The texts discovered therein have shed light on the history of the Hebrew Bible, the beliefs and practices of the ancient Jewish sects, the evolution of Judaism, as well as the context in which Early Christianity arose. Below is a detailed account of the contents found within the Dead Sea Scrolls. 1. Biblical Texts: The Dead Sea Scrolls include the earliest copies of the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) ever discovered, dating from approximately 250 BCE to 68 CE. Nearly every book of the Old Testament was accounted for in the Dead Sea Scrolls. Notably, the only book not found within the discovered texts was the Book of Esther. The discovered texts included the Books of Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Deuteronomy, Samuel, Ruth, Kings, Micah, Joel, Jeremiah, Psalms and many others. This has helped understand the textual tradition of the Hebrew Bible and made substantial contributions to the field of biblical studies. 2. Apocryphal or Pseudepigraphical Texts: These are documents that were not included in the standard version of the Hebrew Bible. Some of these texts are preserved in the Septuagint and other ancient Bible versions. They include numerous manuscripts preserving parts of such books as Jubilees, Enoch, Tobit, Sirach, additional psalms, etc. 3. Sectarian Texts: Many of the texts discovered in the Dead Sea Scrolls seem to represent a specific religious sect from the Second Temple period (538 BCE to 70 CE), likely the Essenes. These scrolls contain unique theological ideas and regulations, biblical commentaries, works on Jewish law, as well as liturgical texts (e.g., Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice). Other significant documents include the \\"Community Rule\\" (defining regulations for membership within the sect), \\"War Scroll\\" (depicting a future apocalyptic war), and the \\"Temple Scroll\\" (containing rewritten and reorganized sections of the Old Testament concerning the operation of the Temple). 4. Calendars and Astronomical Texts: These documents provide a fascinating insight into the different systems used to keep track of time in the Second Temple period. They include calendrical documents (such as the Book of Jubilees) as well as \\"horoscopes\\" and other astronomical texts. 5. Texts of Unknown Classification: There are some texts within the Dead Sea Scrolls that do not readily fit into any of the aforementioned categories. They reflect on broader Jewish literary and historical tradition, personal and business related documents. The discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls has provided scholars with vital insights into Judaism's early history and the historical context of Jesus of Nazareth. The scrolls have also informed the understanding of scribal practices and religious thought during the Second Temple Period and have lead to improved translations of our current Bible."},{"question":"Write a tweet that is positive.","response":"🌞Good morning, beautiful souls!🌻 Today, let's remember that every sunrise brings a new beginning, another chance to embrace life and spread love.

Additionally, have you thought about what the colder weather would mean for your lifestyle? Nick: It's true, I'd miss my friends and the sunshine down here. Cold winters make me skeptical about moving up north. I'm also worried about the potential for a higher cost of living. Jerry: Florida's real estate market has been hit hard by recent storms, but it might give you a chance to buy properties at a discount and expand your business even further. I know that's not a guarantee, but it's something to consider. Nick: You make some good points, Jerry. I still have a lot to ponder. Jerry: Take your time and think it over, Nick.

Bees play a crucial role in pollination, which is an essential process in the growth and reproduction of plants. Moreover, bees contribute to our food system as numerous crops rely on them for pollination. The sudden disappearance of bee colonies, often referred to as Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD), has been attributed to various factors, including habitat loss, pesticide exposure, pathogens, and climate change. Hypothesis: The decline in bee populations can be significantly slowed or even halted through a holistic approach, combining various conservation efforts to improve bee habitat, reduce pesticides, and help bees adapt to climate change. This hypothesis posits that if different stakeholders, such as governments, researchers, agricultural communities, and beekeepers, collaborate to implement an integrated approach to bee conservation, it would be possible to slow down or even stop the decline in bee populations. This multi-faceted approach would include the following strategies: 1. Habitat restoration and creation: Improving the quality and quantity of bee habitats by planting bee-friendly plants, such as native wildflowers, and protecting existing natural landscapes to provide the necessary resources for the bees to thrive. 2. Reduction of pesticide use and development of safer alternatives: Minimizing the use of harmful pesticides, especially those known to have detrimental effects on bees, such as neonicotinoids. Encouraging research and development of alternative pest management strategies, which are less harmful to bees and other pollinators. 3. Disease control and management: Regular monitoring of bee colonies for early signs of disease and parasites, such as the Varroa mite, with timely interventions to prevent the spread of pathogens. Sharing knowledge and best practices among beekeepers and researchers to improve overall hive health. 4. Climate change adaptation: Supporting research to better understand how climate change is affecting bee populations and their behavior, and implementing measures to help bees adapt to changing weather patterns. This could include creating additional food sources during periods of prolonged drought, ensuring access to water, and providing shade in warmer temperatures. 5. Public education and outreach: Raising awareness about the importance of bees and other pollinators, and encouraging the public to participate in conservation efforts by planting pollinator-friendly gardens, avoiding the use of harmful pesticides, and supporting local beekeepers. By combining these strategies and fostering collaboration among stakeholders, it is possible to make significant progress in mitigating the global decline in bee populations. This would not only have a positive impact on the environment, but also help to secure the future of our food systems that rely so heavily on these essential pollinators."},{"question":"It soon became the focus for state occasions, such as the return of the ex-emperor's own remains from St. Helena in 1840 and the funeral of Victor Hugo in 1885.

To understand how this happens, let's look at each step of the process: 1. Air enters the lungs through bronchial tubes: Pollutants in the air can cause inflammation and swelling of the bronchial tubes, making it more difficult for air to pass through and reach the alveoli. 2. Air enters bronchioles: As the polluted air travels further into the respiratory system, it can cause further irritation and damage to the bronchioles as well. 3. Bronchioles have tiny air sacs called alveoli: The alveoli are where the vital exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide occurs. Air pollution can damage the delicate membrane lining the alveoli, making it harder for oxygen to be absorbed into the bloodstream and for carbon dioxide to be released. This creates a direct impact on the efficiency of the oxygen exchange process. 4. Alveoli are surrounded by small blood vessels: When the blood vessels near the alveoli are damaged or inflamed due to pollutants, it can hinder the oxygen-rich blood from being transported efficiently to the rest of the body. 5-8. These steps are not directly impacted by the air pollution but are affected indirectly by the compromised efficiency of the oxygen exchange process caused by damage to lung tissues, alveoli, and blood vessels in the preceding steps. In summary, heavy air pollution can indirectly impact several steps of the process by which oxygen is delivered to the bloodstream. This occurs primarily through the damage and inflammation caused by pollutants in the respiratory system, resulting in a smaller amount of oxygen being delivered to the blood and ultimately to the body's cells."},{"question":"You're given a fill-in-the-blank question where the answer is PersonX.

They trace much of their heritage to groups of Brittonic speakers who immigrated from southwestern Great Britain, particularly Cornwall and Devon, to expand their territory onto the continent. They also descend in some parts from Vikings. They migrated in waves from the 3rd to 9th century (most heavily from 450-600) into Armorica, which was subsequently named Brittany after them. In the late 4th century, large numbers of British auxiliary troops in the Roman army may have been stationed in Armorica. The 9th-century Historia Brittonum states that the emperor Magnus Maximus, who withdrew Roman forces from Britain, settled his troops in the province. Nennius and Gildas mention a second wave of Britons settling in Armorica in the following century to escape the invading Anglo-Saxons and Scoti. Modern archaeology also supports a two-wave migration. It is generally accepted that the Brittonic speakers who arrived gave the region its current name as well as the Breton language, Brezhoneg, a sister language to Welsh and Cornish. There are numerous records of Celtic Christian missionaries migrating from Britain during the second wave of Breton colonisation, especially the legendary seven founder-saints of Brittany as well as Gildas. As in Cornwall, many Breton towns are named after these early saints. The Irish saint Columbanus was also active in Brittany and is commemorated accordingly at Saint-Columban in Carnac. In the Early Middle Ages, Brittany was divided into three kingdoms -- Domnonee, Cornouaille (Kernev), and Bro Waroc'h (Broerec) -- which eventually were incorporated into the Duchy of Brittany. The first two kingdoms seem to derive their names from the homelands of the migrating tribes in Britain, Cornwall (Kernow) and Devon (Dumnonia). Bro Waroc'h (\\"land of Waroch\\", now Bro Gwened) derives from the name of one of the first known Breton rulers, who dominated the region of Vannes (Gwened). The rulers of Domnonee, such as Conomor, sought to expand their territory, claiming overlordship over all Bretons, though there was constant tension between local lords. Bretons were the most prominent of the non-Norman forces in the Norman conquest of England. A number of Breton families were of the highest rank in the new society and were tied to the Normans by marriage. The Scottish Clan Stewart and the royal House of Stuart have Breton origins. Alan Rufus, also known as Alan the Red, was both a cousin and knight in the retinue of William the Conqueror. Following his service at Hastings, he was rewarded with large estates in Yorkshire. At the time of his death, he was by far the richest noble in England. His manorial holding at Richmond ensured a Breton presence in northern England. The Earldom of Richmond later became an appanage of the Dukes of Brittany. what were the historical origins of the bretons?","response":"The historical origins of the Bretons can be traced back to several sources, mainly involving migrations from Great Britain to the region of Brittany in present-day France. The key points in their history can be summarized as follows: 1. Brittonic speakers from southwestern Great Britain (particularly Cornwall and Devon) migrated to Armorica (now Brittany) in waves from the 3rd to 9th centuries, with the heaviest migrations occurring between 450 and 600. 2. In the late 4th century, many British auxiliary troops in the Roman army were possibly stationed in Armorica, and later settled there when the Roman forces were withdrawn by Emperor Magnus Maximus. 3. A second wave of migration occurred in the 5th and 6th centuries, driven by Britons seeking refuge from the invading Anglo-Saxons and Scoti. This wave is mentioned by early medieval historians like Nennius and Gildas, and is supported by modern archaeology. 4. These Brittonic speakers gave the region its name (Brittany) and the Breton language, Brezhoneg, which is closely related to the Welsh and Cornish languages. 5. Celtic Christian missionaries from Britain, such as the legendary seven founder-saints of Brittany and Gildas, played a significant role in the second wave of Breton colonization. 6. During the Early Middle Ages, Brittany was divided into three kingdoms - Domnonee, Cornouaille (Kernev), and Bro Waroc'h (Broerec) - which were later incorporated into the Duchy of Brittany. 7.

It is unlikely that I will ever own a (genuine) Chanel handbag. However, a Chanel nail polish was definitely attainable. Whilst they are ridiculously expensive compared with most other nail polishes (AU39), they are still much more affordable than the AU1,000,000,000 a handbag costs (or so I estimate as I have never actually priced one). After seeing swatches of Peridot online, I knew that baby would one day be mine. The other two polishes in the collection - Quartz and Graphite - did not excite me the way Peridot did. That was until I read this review of Graphite on the Polish Police. Suddenly, Graphite was on my radar. It was stuck in my head like an ear worm; another baby, soon to be adopted. I argued with myself for about a month on whether to get these polishes or not. Could I really spend nearly 80 on nail polish. It did seem rather excessive to me. Then, Myers sent me a 10 voucher for my birthday and I got a 30 voucher for doing a survey so the decision was made. For 38 of my own money (less than the cost of two OPI's!) I became the proud owner of Peridot and Graphite. Here is my review of Graphite. Graphite is the most stunningly intriguing nail polish I have ever owned. In the bottle it looks a little bit dull and boring - grey and bland. But on the nail it is completely different. In some lights it is silvery, others a more gun metal grey, and in others it has almost a goldish tone to it. It is super sparkly, yet is not a glitter polish - though in saying that it appears more glitter than shimmer. It is quite opaque. Two coats and you can't see the nail line.

(August 2014) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In 1792, Spain reels amid the turmoil and upheaval of the French Revolution. Francisco Goya (Stellan SkarsgÃ¥rd) is a renowned painter, who, among others, does portraits for the royal family as the Official Court Painter to the King and Queen. The Spanish Inquisition is disturbed by part of Goya's work. Brother Lorenzo Casamares (Javier Bardem) is hiring Goya to paint a portrait and defends him, saying that his works are not evil, they just show evil. He recommends the Church step up the fight against anti-Catholic practices. He requests and is put in charge of intensifying the Inquisition. When posing in Goya's studio, Lorenzo asks Goya about a young model he uses, InÃ©s (Natalie Portman), daughter of a rich merchant, TomÃ¡s BilbatÃºa (JosÃ© Luis GÃ³mez) who also has a son named Ãngel (Unax Ugalde). InÃ©s is spotted by Inquisition spies (trained by Lorenzo) declining a dish of pork in a tavern. The Holy Office of the Inquisition orders InÃ©s to come to the office. There she is arrested and accused of \\"judaizing\\", i.e. spreading Jewish rituals, because she did not eat pork the other evening. She is stripped naked and tortured by strappado (\\"put to The Question\\"), confesses, and is imprisoned. Naturally, the Inquisition's archives had already revealed that one of her father's ancestors had converted from Judaism to Christianity in 1624 upon arrival in Spain from Amsterdam. TomÃ¡s begs Goya for help, who in turn asks Lorenzo to find out about InÃ©s's situation. Lorenzo visits InÃ©s in prison telling her that he is going to help her and will pass a message to her family if she wishes.

To do that in this case, we can combine like terms (the constants, specifically). 0 = -3*z - 13 + 4 Now, we can combine -13 and 4: 0 = -3*z - 9 Step 2: Isolate the variable (z) Now we need to isolate the variable (z) to one side of the equation. To achieve this, we will add +9 to both sides of the equation to eliminate the constant term on the right side of the equation. 0 + 9 = -3*z - 9 + 9 Solving the equation, we get: 9 = -3*z Step 3: Solve for z To solve for z, we will now divide both sides of the equation by -3 to get z isolated: 9 / -3 = (-3*z) / -3 Which simplifies to: -3 = z So, the solution to the equation 0 = -3*z - 13 + 4 for the variable z is: z = -3 This means that when z is equal to -3, the given equation holds true and equals 0."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer.

What is most important is to reflect on these situations and learn from them to make more informed ethical decisions in the future."},{"question":"Make use of the article to answer the questions. Many early 19th-century neoclassical architects were influenced by the drawings and projects of Étienne-Louis Boullée and Claude Nicolas Ledoux. The many graphite drawings of Boullée and his students depict spare geometrical architecture that emulates the eternality of the universe. There are links between Boullée's ideas and Edmund Burke's conception of the sublime. Ledoux addressed the concept of architectural character, maintaining that a building should immediately communicate its function to the viewer: taken literally such ideas give rise to \\"architecture parlante\\". The baroque style had never truly been to the English taste. Four influential books were published in the first quarter of the 18th century which highlighted the simplicity and purity of classical architecture: Vitruvius Britannicus (Colen Campbell 1715), Palladio's Four Books of Architecture (1715), De Re Aedificatoria (1726) and The Designs of Inigo Jones... with Some Additional Designs (1727). The most popular was the four-volume Vitruvius Britannicus by Colen Campbell. The book contained architectural prints of famous British buildings that had been inspired by the great architects from Vitruvius to Palladio. At first the book mainly featured the work of Inigo Jones, but the later tomes contained drawings and plans by Campbell and other 18th-century architects. Palladian architecture became well established in 18th-century Britain. 1. What didn't the English like? 2. Who influenced their architecture? 3. What was written about British architecture? 4.
