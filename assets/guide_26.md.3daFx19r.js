Firearm Violence Articles from the JAMA Network ||||| High sugar consumption may double the chance of dying from heart disease, according to a study that adds to evidence that high levels of the sweetener in processed foods and drink is bad for a person’s health. People whose sugar intake is about a quarter or more of their total daily calories had twice the risk of dying from heart disease than those who whose intake was 7 percent, according to the research today in JAMA Internal Medicine. For those whose intake of added sugar was about 19 percent, their risk of dying from heart disease was about 38 percent higher. Today’s study is the first to link on a national level the amount of sugar American adults eat to their risk of dying from heart disease after taking into account weight, age, health, exercise and diet, said lead study author Quanhe Yang, an epidemiologist at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Research has already linked sugar consumption to diabetes, weight gain and obesity. “Too much sugar can make you fat; it can also make you sick, sick from diseases like cardiovascular disease, which is the No. 1 killer in America,” said Laura Schmidt, a school of medicine professor at the University of California at San Francisco, in a telephone interview. “Small amounts of sugar are fine. It’s consuming massive amounts of sugar that’s a growing problem in America.” The study also found that regular consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, seven servings or more each week, was linked to an increased risk of dying from heart disease. 600,000 Deaths Heart disease, which can cause heart attack, chest pain and heart failure, is the leading cause of death worldwide for both men and women and kills more than 600,000 Americans each year, according to the Atlanta-based CDC. There is no specific national guideline for sugar consumption. The Institute of Medicine recommends sugar be less than 25 percent of total calories, the World Health Organization recommends less than 10 percent, while the American Heart Association suggests limiting sugar to less than 150 calories a day for men and less than 100 calories a day for women, the authors wrote. ‘The majority of us are consuming more added sugar than the recommendations,’’ Yang said in a telephone interview. About 37 percent of added sugar in U.S. diets comes from sugar-sweetened beverages, while the rest comes from grain-based desserts, fruit drinks, dairy desserts and candy, the authors said. Sugar from fresh fruits and vegetables isn’t considered added sugar. Better food labels would help people identify their sugar intake, said Schmidt, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study. Sugar Effects Scientists don’t have a clear understanding why sugar may raise the risk of dying from heart disease, Yang said. Sugar may increase blood pressure and weight gain, both risk factors for heart disease, or it may raise bad cholesterol and triglycerides and lower good cholesterol. Sugar may also increase insulin resistance, a factor in diabetes, or increase fat accumulation in the liver, he said. Researchers in the study looked at data from several National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys, which provides nationally representative information on U.S. adults. They found that U.S. adults consumed about 14.9 percent of daily calories from added sugar in 2005-2010, down from 16.8 percent in 1999-2004. For most U.S. adults, added sugar made up 10 percent or more of their daily calories during 2005-2010 and for 10 percent of people, sugar made up 25 percent or more of their daily calories. Today’s findings support recommendations to limit intake of sugar-added foods and drinks, Yang said. “We are in the midst of a paradigm shift in research on the health effects of sugar, one fueled by extremely high rates of added sugar overconsumption in the American public,” Schmidt said in an editorial accompanying the study. To contact the reporter on this story: Nicole Ostrow in New York at nostrow1@bloomberg.net To contact the editor responsible for this story: Reg Gale at rgale5@bloomberg.net ||||| A summary of this is?","response":"In a study published in JAMA Internal Medicine, researchers have found a link between high sugar consumption and an increased risk of death resulting from heart disease.

The research also found a correlation between the regular intake of sugar-sweetened beverages (seven servings or more each week) and increased risk of heart disease-related death. This study is the first to connect the amount of sugar consumed by American adults to their risk of dying from heart disease while accounting for weight, age, health, exercise, and diet.

He is best remembered as their lead guitarist, as the youngest brother of bandmates Brian and Dennis Wilson, and as the group's de facto leader in the early 1970s. He was also the band's musical director on stage from 1965 until his death. Influenced by the guitar playing of Chuck Berry and the Ventures, Carl's initial role in the group was that of lead guitarist and backing vocals, but he performed lead vocals on several of their later hits, including \\"God Only Knows\\" (1966), \\"Good Vibrations\\" (1966), and \\"Kokomo\\" (1988). Context: By the early 1980s the Beach Boys were in disarray; the band had split into several camps. Frustrated with the band's sluggishness to record new material and reluctance to rehearse, Wilson took a leave of absence in 1981. He quickly recorded and released a solo album, Carl Wilson, composed largely of rock n' roll songs co-written with Myrna Smith-Schilling, a former backing vocalist for Elvis Presley and Aretha Franklin, and wife of Wilson's then-manager Jerry Schilling. The album briefly charted, and its second single, \\"Heaven\\", reached the top 20 on Billboard's Adult Contemporary chart. Wilson also undertook a solo tour to promote the album, becoming the first member of the Beach Boys to break ranks. Initially, Wilson and his band played clubs like The Bottom Line in New York City and the Roxy in Los Angeles. Thereafter, he joined the Doobie Brothers as opening act for their 1981 summer tour. Wilson recorded a second solo album, Youngblood, in a similar vein, but by the time of its release in 1983 he had rejoined the Beach Boys. Although Youngblood did not chart, a single, the John Hall-penned \\"What You Do To Me\\", peaked at number 72, making Wilson the second Beach Boy to land a solo single on the Billboard Hot 100. Additionally, the song cracked the top 20 on Billboard's Adult Contemporary chart. Wilson frequently performed that song and \\"Rockin' All Over the World\\" (from the same album), as well as \\"Heaven\\" from the 1981 album, at Beach Boys' concerts in the 1980s. \\"Heaven\\" was always announced as a tribute to brother Dennis, who drowned in December 1983. Question: How long was he a solo act? Answer:","response":"Carl Wilson officially became a solo act in 1981 when he took a leave of absence from the Beach Boys. During this time, he released his first solo album, \\"Carl Wilson,\\" and embarked on a solo tour to promote the album. In 1983, he released his second solo album, \\"Youngblood.\\" Although the exact duration of his solo career might be debated, it can be said that he was a solo act for about two years from 1981 to 1983, after which he rejoined the Beach Boys. However, Wilson continued to perform some of his solo songs during Beach Boys concerts throughout the 1980s."},{"question":"Given this review: \\"Takes up all storage space\\" Would you recommend this app to a friend? Not at all, No, Maybe, Yes, or Definitely?","response":"To determine whether I would recommend this app to a friend, let's analyze the review and consider the factors affecting the recommendation: 1. Analyzing the review: The reviewer states that the app \\"Takes up all storage space.\\" This is a negative statement, indicating that the app consumes a significant amount of device storage, which can be a crucial deciding factor for many users, especially those with limited storage capacity on their devices. 2. Factors to consider: - Storage usage: Since the review mentioned storage space as the primary concern, it means that the app might not be suitable for users with low storage capacity devices or who prioritize storage space. - App performance and features: Although the review does not mention anything about app performance or its features, they play an important role in deciding whether to recommend the app or not. - Personal preferences: People have different priorities and preferences; some may be willing to sacrifice storage space for a useful app, while others might prioritize storage over app functionality. Based on this analysis, and without any further information on app performance and features, I would classify my recommendation as \\"Maybe\\". The reason for choosing this option is that storage space might not be a significant concern for everyone, and app features might outweigh the storage issue for some users. However, it also acknowledges that the problem may be a deal-breaker for others, so I would not confidently suggest that a friend should download the app without considering their individual preferences and needs."},{"question":"Produce a detailed sentence about a restaurant using the following words: name = The Waterman, eatType = pub, food = English, priceRange = high, customer rating = average, area = riverside, familyFriendly = yes","response":"The Waterman is a family-friendly pub located by the riverside, offering a range of high-priced authentic English cuisine, and has an average customer rating."},{"question":"Write the next sentence.

The forecast “consensus” of experts for November was for 85,000 net new jobs—a poor performance if it had happened—but with the East Coast devastated by Hurricane Sandy, it was logical to expect a worse performance than October (138,000 revised down from 171,000). Instead, the BLS reported 147,000 net new jobs with no discernible Sandy effects. Really? But it is not the first time this year that the BLS numbers have confounded analysts and seemed to contradict information from other reliable sources. It’s been crazy enough to get Jack Welch to come out of retirement to express his consternation. All this has been amplified by the politics, with each camp spinning the numbers to suit their goals. When the unemployment rate falls, one side will cite it as evidence that things are improving; the other will point out that it fell because people gave up looking for work and dropped out of the labor force, and that the number of long-term unemployed is exceptionally high. The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) conducts monthly surveys of a random sample of its 350,000 members. The November survey provides clear evidence that the employment situation in eight states on the East Coast (excluding western New York and western Pennsylvania, not reached by Sandy), deteriorated significantly. During November, owners in the Sandy states increased employment half as frequently as their counterparts in the rest of the U.S. and reduced employment more frequently. Job openings were 4 points lower and, although the same percentage of owners plan to increase employment (create new jobs), nearly one in five plan reductions in employment compared to only 12 percent in the rest of the country. In 2013, this will improve in Sandy states, as cleanup and new construction and repair needs will increase the demand for workers. But both sets of numbers are “recession readings,” so even without Sandy, the numbers were not good. If the BLS November number is really correct (it will be revised next month), would we have had a very good employment month if Sandy had not joined the party? But that would be inconsistent with just about every regional Federal Reserve report on jobs and the ISM Index. Owner optimism plunged in November (10th lowest reading in 37 years of NFIB survey history), and except for the labor market differences discussed above, Sandy owners were just as bummed out as their counterparts elsewhere in the U.S. Consumer confidence faded in the second half of November and plunged in the first half of December. Pessimistic consumers don’t spend as much and that means employment growth will remain sluggish. Looking ahead to 2013, there is one bright light for employment: new construction. We do produce more GDP today than at the peak in 2007, yet we employ four million fewer workers. Some might attribute that to improved productivity, and the most recent report indicated productivity rising at a 2.9 percent rate, well above historical trends. But the real explanation is a change in the mix of GDP. Housing starts fell from a two million unit annual rate at the end of 2006 to only 500,000. This is a very labor intensive business and that blew a hole in the employment numbers. The missing housing (and related activities) was replaced with manufacturing and agricultural output (the dollar was cheap, exports grew), great for our economy, but not much of a job producer. The population grows by three million every year, and they need a place to live. Housing starts have already recovered to the 900,000 level and will reach well past a million units next year, providing a nice boost to employment. That’s something to build a recovery on, if Washington can just convince us that they will not squander the opportunity and scuttle growth with more bad management decisions. What are the most important parts of this news article?","response":"The news article discusses the confusing and seemingly contradictory government employment statistics and the debate surrounding the true state of the job market. The key points of the article can be summarized as follows: 1. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported a higher number of net new jobs (147,000) for November than what was forecasted by experts, despite the impact of Hurricane Sandy on the East Coast. This has caused confusion and skepticism among analysts. 2. The interpretation of the employment numbers has been influenced by political agendas, with each side citing the statistics to support their particular argument. 3. The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) surveyed its members and found that the employment situation in eight East Coast states significantly deteriorated in November, due to Hurricane Sandy. However, the situation is expected to improve in the coming year as construction and repair efforts increase the demand for workers. 4. The BLS November numbers contradict other regional Federal Reserve reports on jobs and the ISM Index, raising doubts about their accuracy. 5. The article highlights the role of construction, especially housing construction, as a potential source of employment growth in the future. The recovery in housing starts can create more jobs, provided that the government does not interfere negatively with the market. The main takeaway from the article is the uncertainty surrounding the true state of the job market, the skepticism surrounding government employment statistics, and the potential for growth in the construction sector as a source of future employment opportunities."},{"question":"Es mag verwundern, daß die Kommission diesen Tätigkeitsbericht überhaupt schon in einem so frühen Stadium ohne ausreichende Angaben erstellen wollte.

And the sad truth is that \\"clothing mismatches\\" on the job can ruin the day of the person who is wearing the inappropriate attire --and the people with whom he or she comes in contact. Offices vary when it comes to dress codes. Some businesses have very high standards for their employees and set strict guidelines for office attire, while others maintain a more relaxed attitude. However, it is always important to remember that no matter what your company's attitude is regarding what you wear, you are working in a business environment and you should dress properly. Certain items may be more appropriate for evening wear than for a business meeting, just as shorts and a T-shirt are better suited for the beach than for an office environment. Your attire should reflect both your environment and your position. A senior vice president has a different image to maintain than that of a secretary or sales assistant.

Seeing the value in critical feedback and the lessons that failure can offer is a tough pill to swallow. For those confident in their capabilities, their social standing (in their companies/communities etc), and their abilities, the pill goes down a little easier. For those who experience imposter syndrome, feel insecure about their work, or are new in their careers, it is more difficult. Here’s the thing: these are not binary personalities. While some people are overly confident about themselves, and some people are overly insecure about themselves, most people have a blend of both. As such, even the most confident people can feel the sting when they get critical feedback or screw something up. This is a guide with some things I have learned over the years about how to turn feedback and failure to your advantage. In my not-so-humble opinion, the perfect blend of a human being is confidence in their ability to execute and accomplish their goals, but with a healthy dose of awareness of their current limitations. Let’s face it, overly confident people are often not just at risk of being swallowed up by ego, but can also lack the empathy to understand other folks they need to work with who don’t share the same confidence. An understanding of our current limitations is healthy. When we understand we are not great at something, but we are eager to learn and improve, it opens us up to counsel and tuition. The confidence piece plays an important role in helping us to remember: “I might suck now, but I am going to learn and get better”. When we have this in our heads it makes the journey more palatable: we know that our failure to succeed right now is temporary and it will improve. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

This can include poor service, disappointing food quality, and an unpleasant atmosphere. To make the review believable, I will provide specific examples from the experience. Step 3: Be honest and fair While writing a negative review, it's essential to be honest and fair about the experience. Exaggerating the negatives or inventing complaints can damage the credibility of the review.

The menu boasted a wide variety of dishes, so we were excited to try several options, hoping for a delightful meal. When our food finally arrived, not only was it lukewarm, but the portions were surprisingly small compared to the price we paid. I ordered the grilled salmon, which was overcooked and lacked any seasoning. My partner had the pasta, and it was drowning in a bland, watery sauce. The side salad consisted of wilted lettuce and barely any dressing. The atmosphere did not redeem the poor food quality either. The lighting was too dim to comfortably read the menu, and the noise level from the crowded tables made conversation difficult.

PRMT5 was inhibited by AMI-1 (a small molecule inhibitor of PRMTs) or small interference RNA (siRNA). The proliferation of HCC cells was tested by Cell Counting Kit-8, cell migration was evaluated by Transwell assay and cell cycle and apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry. The effect of AMI-1 on HCC in vivo was examined by mouse xenograft model.', 'PRMT5 expression was markedly upregulated in HCC tissues, and correlated inversely with overall patient survival. Knockdown of PRMT5 significantly reduced the proliferation of HCC cells, but did not affect the growth of normal liver cells. Furthermore, β-catenin was identified as a target of PRMT5. Silencing PRMT5 significantly down-regulated the expression of β-catenin and the downstream effector Cyclin D1 in HCC cells. AMI-1 strongly inhibited HCC growth in vivo, increased the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2, and led to apoptosis and loss of migratory activity in several HCC cells. Meanwhile, AMI-1 decreased the expression levels of symmetric dimethylation of H4 (H4R3me2s), a histone mark of PRMT5.

He made a historic trip to the country in 1966 during his presidency, which lasted from 1963 to 1969. This visit marked a significant event in the diplomatic history between Australia and the United States, reflecting the strengthening alliances and growing cooperation between the two nations. Lyndon B. Johnson became the 36th president of the United States following the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in November 1963. He was subsequently elected for a full term in 1964. President Johnson was known for his policies on civil rights, education, and healthcare, as well as for his aggressive strategy in the Vietnam War. The primary purpose of his visit to Australia was to bolster support for the US-led war efforts in Vietnam and to discuss the strategic alliance between the US and Australia as part of the 1951 ANZUS (Australia-New Zealand-United States) Treaty. Both countries were united in their efforts to stop the spread of communism in Southeast Asia. At the time, Australia, under the leadership of then Prime Minister Harold Holt, had already committed troops to the Vietnam War alongside US forces. During his brief visit, which took place from October 20th to 23rd, 1966, President Johnson visited several cities in Australia, including Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra, and Brisbane. He met with government officials, military representatives, and local citizens, delivering speeches and receiving a warm welcome from the Australian public. President Johnson's visit cemented the bilateral relationship between the United States and Australia.

Choices: - glands - tremors - Shaking - contractions A: A:","response":"Contractions Step 1: Analyze the question The question is asking what helps push the fetus from the uterus during the process of birth. Step 2: Evaluate the choices a) Glands: Glands are responsible for secreting various substances/hormones in the body, but they do not help push the fetus from the uterus. b) Tremors: Tremors refer to involuntary muscle movement and are not responsible for the process of childbirth. c) Shaking: Shaking indicates uncontrolled and random movements, which is not a helpful or safe factor in childbirth. d) Contractions: Contractions involve the coordinated, rhythmic tightening and relaxation of the uterine muscles which help push the fetus from the uterus and is a key process during birth. Step 3: Determine the correct answer From the evaluation of each choice, it's clear that contractions are the most relevant and accurate factor that helps push the fetus from the uterus during birth."},{"question":"\\"The Bat People\\" is a really bad film that deserved the MST3K treatment just as well like that other film \\"The Creeping Terror.\\" In it, we are in some sort of mountainous terrain full of bats.

Kevin is confident and charming and is dating his long-term girlfriend, Vicky Lathum (Tara Reid); Oz is a laid-back member of the high school lacrosse team; Jim is socially awkward and sexually naïve and suffers pressure and questionable advice from his father (Eugene Levy); while Finch is a cappuccino-drinking sophisticate who plays golf and wears sports jackets. The four have very differing personalities, but share a common characteristic; they are all virgins, in sharp contrast to popular lacrosse player and arrogant jock Steve Stifler (Seann William Scott), whose wild, extravagant house parties they are regularly invited to.While at one of Stifler's such parties, the four each attempt to score with various girls at the party with very limited success. Oz is humiliated by an older girl, Finch is too late for the party and Jim attempts to talk to Czechoslovakian exchange student Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth), but fails completely.

The original sentence, \\"Two Dobermans fighting or playing together on a lawn,\\" does not provide enough specific information to determine if the statement, \\"Two dogs are playing tug of war,\\" is true.

What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","response":"The first step in the process of fossil formation, as described, is the decomposition of the soft tissue. When an organism dies, its body begins to decompose due to various factors, such as exposure to the elements and the action of microorganisms. During this stage, the soft tissues of the organism, including its internal organs, muscles, and skin, gradually break down and decay. This process is facilitated by a combination of factors including bacteria, fungi, and other microorganisms that consume and break down the organic matter. As the soft tissues decompose, the more resilient parts of the organism, such as the bones, remain intact for a longer period. These bones are typically more durable due to their mineral composition and structure, which makes them resistant to immediate decay and able to withstand various environmental conditions. Once the soft tissue has decomposed, the next step in the process involves the scattering of the bones by external forces. Scavengers, such as carnivorous animals and birds, may feed on the carcass and move the bones elsewhere as they consume the remaining tissue. In addition, natural forces like wind and rain can also displace the bones, causing them to be scattered over a wider area. Eventually, this leads to the bones being buried by sand, soil, and other sediments, which is an essential step in the fossilization process. As time passes, the buried bones undergo further changes, such as the replacement of proteins with minerals dissolved in the surrounding soil. This process, known as permineralization, causes the bones to become infused with various minerals and gradually transform into a rock-like substance. The end result is a fossil, which is a preserved remnant of the original organism that has essentially turned to stone. Over time, the layers of soil and sediment that cover the fossil may be worn away through natural erosion caused by water and wind. This exposes the fossil, making its discovery possible by paleontologists and other researchers who study ancient life. In some cases, this process can take millions of years, as geological forces gradually reveal fossils that have been hidden deep within the Earth's crust. Upon discovery, these fossils provide valuable insights into the history of life on Earth, offering a glimpse into the biology, behavior, and ecology of extinct organisms."},{"question":"Teacher:Given a sequence of actions to navigate an agent in its environment, provide the correct command in a limited form of natural language that matches the sequence of actions when executed.

Answer:","response":"The best answer would be \\"heightened\\". Reptiles, such as snakes and lizards, have evolved to compensate for their supposedly poor eyesight by having heightened other senses, and one of these is their sense of smell. A heightened sense of smell implies that the ability to detect scents or odours is significantly enhanced. This enhancement is particularly crucial in hunting prey, avoiding predators, recognizing territory, and seeking mates. Reptiles primarily use two types of olfactory (smell-related) organs: the nostrils and the Jacobson's organ, also called the vomeronasal organ. These are connected to the mouth and nose and enable reptiles to detect chemical stimuli in their environment. When the tongue flicks out, it collects microscopic particles, then retracts and presses these particles against these organs. Through this process, reptiles can 'smell' their environment, even if they cannot 'see' it clearly. For example, snakes flick out their forked tongues to sample the microscopic particles in the air. The collected particles are then analyzed by the Jacobson's organ, providing a directional sense of smell. Being able to smell 'in stereo' helps snakes localize the source of a particular scent. Now, why would the answer not be any of the other options given? - \\"Dangerous,\\" \\"positive,\\" and \\"critical organs\\" are not associated with how a sense of smell might change given another impaired sense. - \\"Lowered,\\" \\"decreased,\\" or \\"improve\\" indicates a reduction in smelling ability, an improvement in smelling ability, or just a general change which doesn't acknowledge that eyesight is poor. These are not as perfect fits because they do not correctly specify how the sense of smell changes when eyesight is impaired. - Lastly, \\"smelled\\" isn't relevant because it's the past tense of smell and doesn't describe the state of the ability to smell. Therefore, given that most reptiles have poor eyesight and a keen sense of smell, and if someone has bad eyesight, the sense of smell is heightened, the best answer would indeed be \\"heightened\\"."},{"question":"Answer the following question: who hit the most homeruns in a single season?","response":"To find out who hit the most homeruns in a single season, I will follow these steps: 1.

Identify the key terms in the question. 2. Perform research to gather information about the key terms. 3. Synthesize the information gathered. 4. Produce the answer based on the synthesized information. Step 1: The key terms in the question are \\"bousillage,\\" \\"region of the US,\\" and \\"exploration.\\" Step 2: Perform research: - Bousillage: A construction material made of clay and Spanish moss, often used in the southern United States, particularly in Louisiana. - Region of the US: The question is referring to the area where bousillage was historically used, which is Louisiana and the surrounding region. - Exploration: In this context, it means the discovery and settlement of the area where bousillage was used. Step 3: Synthesize the information gathered: Bousillage was used primarily in Louisiana, so we need to identify the explorers who made significant contributions to the exploration and settlement of this region. Step 4: Produce the answer: French explorer Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, is one of the most notable figures in the exploration of the Louisiana territory. He claimed the Mississippi River Basin, which includes present-day Louisiana, for King Louis XIV of France in 1682. Spanish explorers also had an influence in the region.

They fit like the old 505 Regular's and are of equal quality (although I prefer five belt loops a la the 505s rather than seven). And the current price is 35 vs. a minimum of 40 for comparable 505s. I guess the extra 5 buys you the \\"Levi\\" label. I just don't think it's worth it any more. Answer:","response":"The mentioned review would likely decrease the chances of you buying the product.

This invasion of privacy has led to charges against the former editor, for conspiring to hack phones. The affair between Blunkett and Fortier, which took place in 2004, was exposed by the editor, leading to significant personal and political fallout for the involved parties. While Coulson now admits his wrongdoing and expresses regret for his treatment of the Labour politician, the damage has been done, and the ongoing trial aims to shed light on the extent of the unethical practices employed by the editor and his accomplices. The admission of guilt by Coulson plays an essential role in understanding the prevalence of phone hacking among media professionals, and the invasion of privacy undertaken in the pursuit of stories. The case raises questions about the ethical responsibilities of journalists and media organizations and serves as a sobering reminder that the thirst for sensationalism can sometimes lead to severe consequences for both the subjects of news articles and the reporters responsible for them. As the trial continues, more details are expected to emerge, painting a clearer picture of the extent to which personal information was accessed and used to fuel the media's appetite for scandal and expose.

These clementines — a hybrid of oranges and mandarins — grow in the fertile soil around the gulf of Taranto, particularly around the town of Palagiano (also known as “the city of clementines” — they celebrate the symbol of their city with a sagra, a food festival, every December) and the delicate fruit is harvested by hand. We don’t get these in Florence, it was my only chance to taste them – they are small with very few, if any, seeds, and they are very sweet.

Translate to English English:","response":"Old Fortress and New Fortress. The Old Fortress and New Fortress refer to two historical fortifications that have played significant roles in the defense and development of certain regions throughout history. These fortifications, as their names suggest, represent different time periods and architectural styles. The Old Fortress, or Ancient Fortress, typically refers to historical structures that may date back to antiquity. They were often constructed by various ancient civilizations and empires, such as the Romans, Greeks, Byzantines, and other prominent powers of their respective eras. These fortifications were primarily built with stone and other locally available materials, and their defensive designs were influenced by the military technologies and strategies at the time. They were vital for protecting the communities, territories, and resources they encircled from potential invaders, as well as for serving as administrative centers and symbols of authority. Examples of famous ancient fortresses include the Acropolis of Athens, Masada in Israel, and Castel Sant'Angelo in Rome. The New Fortress, on the other hand, refers to more recent fortifications that showcase the advancements in military engineering, technology, and tactics made since the end of the Renaissance. They were often built during periods of rapid transition, such as the Industrial Revolution and the development of the modern nation-state. The designs of these fortifications were heavily influenced by the changing nature of warfare, including the advent of gunpowder, the introduction of firearms and artillery, and other innovations in military technology. These new forts featured more sophisticated defenses, such as bastions, star-shaped designs, and more extensive systems of walls, moats, and other barriers. Additionally, they were constructed using advanced engineering techniques and materials, such as iron, steel, and concrete, making them more resistant to the increasing firepower of their enemies. Examples of well-known new fortresses are the Palmanova Fort in Italy, the Fortress of Luxembourg, and the star forts of the Netherlands, France, and Germany. In summary, the terms Old Fortress and New Fortress represent two distinct phases in the evolution of military architecture and technology. The Old Fortress usually refers to ancient structures that served as strongholds and symbols of power, while the New Fortress refers to more recent fortifications that showcase the advancements in military engineering, technology, and tactics. These two classifications of fortresses not only indicate their chronological difference but also emphasize the varying purposes, designs, and materials used in their construction throughout history."},{"question":"is gutted my mate had to come home from htid in the sun early women+raving=not good lol no offence to the good ones out there Select your answer from the options.

Almost the entirety of the country's West has experienced significantly warmer than average temperatures across December and January, while parts of the East Coast, including New York and Boston are continuing to be battered by a freezing storm system. In this month alone thousands of warm weather records have been broken as high temperatures across the western states contributes to what is now the country's sixth-warmest winter on record. The West is experiencing temperatures which have contributed to the country's sixth-warmest winter on record. Pictured is Lake Success, near East Porterville, California, where drought conditions are worsening. A horse grazes in a Temecula, California, pasture surrounded by palm trees in this photo taken late December. Meanwhile residents in Boston (pictured) are bracing themselves for more than 16inches of snowfall. Pictured is the snow covering the homes of residents in South End, Boston. An Air Force officer walks through the snow after Obama departed Air Force One in a motorcade following his trip to California at the weekend. The East Coast storm system - which follows a weekend storm that dumped a staggering 16.5 inches of snow on Boston - is set to hit the South. So far this month there have been 4,074 records set for warm temperatures across the West, USA Today reported. This includes hot weather records in Seattle, San Jose, Las Vegas, Reno and Salt Lake City. Remarkably, the average February temperature in Salt Lake City is 16.4degrees above average, while Boise is up 12.2degrees and Phoenix 8degrees. Last month, the West, Rocky Mountains and Northern and Central Plains were all warmer than average, with many maintaining hot temperatures that placed the month among their top ten warmest averages. Incredibly, San Francisco had no measurable rainfall during January, while the state of California itself had its fourth-driest ever January. As well as remaining unseasonably warm, much of the West continues to suffer drought conditions. Nearly all of Hawaii was drier than average, with drought expanding to 46.6per cent of the state, according to the National Climatic Data Center. And although the drought improved in parts of the Southern Plains and Southwest, it worsened in the West and Midwest. A dog walks across the receding shoreline of Folsom Lake, California, in November, where the drought shows no sign of letting up. While storms in early December gave farms in California a boost, temperatures across the state remain unseasonably high. Temperatures forecast for Thursday show the blizzard hitting parts of the East while the West remains warm. The dry area spans California, Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Texas and Oklahoma and other parts of the region, directly affecting more than 64 million people. In contrast to the big dry in the West, Winter Storm Octavia - which follows a weekend storm that dumped 16.5 inches of snow on Boston over the weekend - is now set to pummel the South. Residents in Boston have battled through 16.5 inches of snow while New Yorkers are preparing for another six inch-dumping. In the early hours of Tuesday morning, Washington DC was bracing for between four to eight inches of snow, according to USA Today. Mayor Muriel Bowser told CNN's 'The Situation Room' that the weather was 'dangerous cold'. Federal government offices in the area will be closed on Tuesday. Father south, up to a foot of snow was forecast in Roanoke and Richmond, Virginia, where Governor Terry McAuliffe declared a statewide emergency. Residents have been advised to avoid non-essential travel, while thousands of children in the region are missing school for a second day running.

You can walk around the streets looking as though you just smelled something disgusting, your face a permanent rictus of distress and revulsion aimed at a world that seems to be closing in around you, a mile-deep locust swarm of sex and debauchery, strange drugs and tight yoga pants, expensive artisanal coffee and gay people smooching in the street. You can cling to musty dogma, to strict, outdated codes of conduct and belief, all dictated by very scared, very dead old men who lived many hundreds of years ago and in such a state of abject misunderstanding of the world, and God, and sex, and women, and love, and spirit, and life itself, they might as well have written a big, terrible book about it. Oh wait, they did. Here is the Bible, a numbingly tedious tome written (and re-re-rewritten) by multiple paranoid power-mongers obsessed with genealogy, real estate, women, weird curses, genitalia, shellfish, the blood of sacrificial animals and how to appease a schizophrenic deity who loves you like sunshine one day and covers your body in painful, oozing boils the next. Stamps are terrifying. Just ask God. The Bible! Don’t forget the parts about rape, incest and the chopping off of hands! And the infanticide! And the slavery! And the murder! And the crappy family planning! It can get sort of bad. You can become a bit closed off, limited, so terribly myopic and small that it will soon feel like there’s nowhere left to go, nothing you can buy, no one to talk to, no service you can use that isn’t somehow tainted with or ruined by the sins of the slippery, jacked-up, indecipherable modern world. What do you do? How do you handle it when, for example, every major corporation, tech startup, first-world country, habitable city, educated human and friendly coffee shop in the land supports gay rights and women’s choice, immigration and health care reform, gun bans and climate science? How do you purchase anything at all – food, a home, a cellphone, a car, Xanax – when every grocery store and manufacturer in America supports causes and civil rights you are supposed to detest to the point of shouting in the streets and crumbling in fear? In short, what do you do when the reality of the civilized world doesn’t match up with your agonizingly pinched demands of same? You have to be careful. You have to watch that your life doesn’t shrivel down to near-meaninglessness, to a thin running joke, down to the size of, say, a postage stamp – such as the one recently released by the United States Postal Service, that well-known bastion of sodomy, depravity and all that’s wrong with the world. I mean, right? They must be, given how their new stamp features the historic, grinning mug of SF’s own beloved supervisor, gay rights activist and Sean Penn Academy Award, Harvey Milk. Did you miss the announcement about the new Milk stamp? You night have, given how the USPS announcing a new stamp is like IBM announcing a new Selectric typewriter. Sweet, sad and sort of quaint, all at once. But did you also miss the tiny hiss of outrage about the Milk stamp, too? Did you read about the even more quaint pulings of the members of backwater Christian fundamentalist clan known as the American Family Association? Because it’s something special indeed: Honoring predator Harvey Milk on a U.S. postage stamp is disturbing to say the least. Harvey Milk was a very disreputable man and used his charm and power to prey on young boys with emotional problems and drug addiction. He is the last person we should be featuring on a stamp. … is what they sneered, in a press release, to anyone who would listen, which was almost no one. The AFA, in case you forgot and why wouldn’t you, is a Bush-era remnant of hyper-paranoid Christian dread. Like Focus on the Family and the American Heritage Foundation et al, the AFA opposes pretty much everything: abortion, gay marriage, good porn, religious freedom, books with polysyllabic words, foreign films, Jews, intellectuals, single malt scotch and candy flipping at Burning Man at sunrise. It’s no surprise, then, that the AFA was none too happy about this new stamp. So they did what any good, God-fearing cult would do. They banned that sucker forever. Yes! Take that, gay rights! Children! Here is your cautionary tale, writ small and weird and desperately out of touch. Ready? Come on. Harry Potter stamps? FAR more terrifying. When your life is reduced to announcing that you will hereby refuse any and all postal mail sent your way if upon said piece of mail is stuck a tiny, 1″ depiction of a slain gay activist, civic leader and Medal of Freedom recipient, when you openly revolt against the staid, conservative USPS – whose two subsequent, post-Milk stamps have commemorated Hot Rods and Nevada’s statehood – well, it might be time to take a step back. Regroup. Slap yourself upside the soul. Ask yourself, “Really? It’s come down to this? I’m actually expending part of my life, my prana, my finite number of breaths and heartbeats rejecting bits of paper mailed to me because they might honor a rather amazing human who fought for love in another part of the country nearly 40 years ago? And won?” Of course, asking these questions would imply a certain level of self awareness and complexity of thought not normally attributed to conservative groups, or homophobes, or anti-philatelists. It would also imply that you and your fundamentalist friends might not have yet realized the battle – and soon the war – against gay marriage, and progress, and love, have essentially been lost.

Dupré later wrote that Messiaen, having never seen an organ console, sat quietly for an hour while Dupré explained and demonstrated the instrument, and then came back a week later to play Johann Sebastian Bach's Fantasia in C minor to an impressive standard. From 1929, Messiaen regularly deputised at the Église de la Sainte-Trinité, Paris, for the organist Charles Quef, who was ill at the time. The post became vacant in 1931 when Quef died, and Dupré, Charles Tournemire and Widor among others supported Messiaen's candidacy. His formal application included a letter of recommendation from Widor. The appointment was confirmed in 1931, and he remained the organist at the church for more than sixty years. He also assumed a post at the Schola Cantorum de Paris in the early 1930s. In 1932, he composed the Apparition de l'église éternelle for organ. He married the violinist and composer Claire Delbos also in 1932. Their marriage inspired him to both compose works for her to play (Thème et variations for violin and piano in the year they were married) and to write pieces to celebrate their domestic happiness, including the song cycle Poèmes pour Mi in 1936, which he orchestrated in 1937. Mi was Messiaen's affectionate nickname for his wife. In 1937 their son Pascal was born. The marriage turned to tragedy when Delbos lost her memory after an operation towards the end of World War II. She spent the rest of her life in mental institutions.In 1936, along with André Jolivet, Daniel-Lesur and Yves Baudrier, Messiaen formed the group La jeune France (\\"Young France\\"). Their manifesto implicitly attacked the frivolity predominant in contemporary Parisian music and rejected Jean Cocteau's 1918 Le coq et l'arlequin in favour of a \\"living music, having the impetus of sincerity, generosity and artistic conscientiousness\\".

Options: - Sentence A: \\"it's good for the environment to walk on the grass\\" - Sentence B: \\"it's good for the environment to keep off the grass\\" Let's solve this gradually.","response":"To determine which sentence is not logical, let's take a closer look at each sentence and its potential impact on the environment. Sentence A: \\"it's good for the environment to walk on the grass\\" Walking on the grass can have several effects, both positive and negative. One positive impact could be that, by walking on the grass instead of paved surfaces, you may help reduce the urban heat island effect. However, constant foot traffic on grassy areas may cause the soil to become compact, which can make it difficult for grass to grow and reduce its ability to absorb water and support other plant life. In such cases, walking on the grass may not necessarily be good for the environment. Sentence B: \\"it's good for the environment to keep off the grass\\" Keeping off the grass can have benefits for the environment too. By avoiding walking on the grass, you may help prevent soil compaction and protect the root system of the grass and other plants. Additionally, staying off the grass can give plants a chance to grow and flourish, potentially supporting biodiversity. Based on the analysis above, we can conclude that Sentence A (\\"it's good for the environment to walk on the grass\\") is less logical compared to Sentence B since it ignores the negative impact that walking on the grass can have on the environment."},{"question":"Write a sentence about the following things: appear, magazine, model","response":"The enchanting model, who had been diligently working towards her dreams, finally made a stunning appearance on the cover of the renowned fashion magazine, captivating the hearts and minds of readers with her astonishing beauty and poise."},{"question":"Here is a goal: Banana exfoliating scrub Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","response":"Alright, let's imagine we're making a yummy banana exfoliating scrub for our skin!

He won the Pulitzer Prize for his novel \\"The Store\\" in 1933, which was part of his trilogy that also includes \\"The Forge\\" and \\"Unfinished Cathedral.\\" Stribling's works provided a critical analysis of the social issues prevailing in the Southern United States during his time, touching on subjects like race, class, and gender. He was born in Clifton, Tennessee, and spent most of his life in the Southern region of the United States. In summary, both Robert Frost and Thomas Sigismund Stribling were American authors who made significant contributions to the literary world, particularly in poetry and fiction, respectively.

The factory, which opens as the computer chip business is in a slump, is a costly and risky move for IBM. But it is also an expression of confidence by the company that it can remain a technology leader in the highly competitive global semiconductor industry, and a commitment that the best place to execute that strategy is in upstate New York. IBM is an exception among computer makers in that it still invests heavily in research to advance the design, manufacture and materials used in semiconductor chips. It is spending more than 500 million a year on semiconductor research and development. The factory will produce a wide range of specialized semiconductors used in everything from the largest mainframe computers to cell phones and video-game consoles. The new plant is part of IBM's push to gain a strong lead in chip-making beyond the personal computer business, where Intel and East Asian chip producers hold the advantage. \\"The core of our strategy is to lead in technology and attack the high-performance segments of the market,\\" said John Kelly, senior vice president in charge of IBM's technology group. An advantage to having the semiconductor fabricating factory here, Kelly explained, was that it was very close to its research laboratories in nearby Westchester County, N.Y. To stay ahead in advanced chip technology, he said, moving innovations out of the labs and into the factory as fast as possible is crucial. \\"What we call the lab-to-fab time should be as close to zero as possible,\\" Kelly said. \\"If our strategy were anything but to be on the leading edge, we'd have put the plant in Asia.\\" The new factory, which will begin normal production early next year, will employ about 1,000 people.

Options: - walk - jump several feet - swim - hop - leap Reasoning process:","response":"To determine how a frog would travel a short distance on land, we can eliminate options that do not make sense or apply to the scenario, and then analyze the remaining options for their feasibility. 1. Walk: Although frogs have legs, their anatomy is not well-suited to walking. Their limbs are built to support a leaping or jumping motion. Thus, walking is an unlikely choice. 2. Jump several feet: Frogs are known for their ability to cover significant distances by jumping, which can help them either catch prey or escape from predators. Jumping several feet could be a potential way for frogs to travel on land. 3. Swim: This option can be eliminated as the question is about traveling on land, and swimming is not applicable in this case. 4. Hop: Hopping is a small jumping movement that would involve the frog's legs pushing off the ground in quick, successive motions. This is a possible method as it enables the frog to use its long limbs to traverse the short distance. 5. Leap: Leaping is similar to jumping, but may involve a greater degree of force and distance. A leap usually covers more significant distances compared to a hop. Given the options, the most likely ways a frog would travel a short distance on land are \\"jump several feet,\\" \\"hop,\\" or \\"leap.\\" However, considering the short distance, \\"hop\\" would be the most reasonable answer as it generally covers shorter distances compared to leaps and jumps. Therefore, if a frog has to travel a short distance on land, it will most likely hop."},{"question":"Produce a long descriptive sentence that uses all these words: Baked Alaska, country, United States.

Do they have the same meaning?","response":"To determine if these two sentences have the same meaning, let's break down and compare their key components step-by-step. 1. Tropical Storm Claudette: Both sentences mention Tropical Storm Claudette, so they are discussing the same weather event. 2. Direction and location: Sentence 1: \\"continued its slow churn toward the Texas coast\\", \\"to make landfall as a hurricane by early Tuesday.\\" Sentence 2: \\"headed for the Texas coast\\", \\"landfall early Tuesday.\\" Both sentences describe Tropical Storm Claudette moving toward the Texas coast and expect landfall on early Tuesday. They align in direction, location, and timing. 3. Speed and development of storm: Sentence 1: \\"forecasters expecting the plodding storm system\\". Sentence 2: \\"forecasters saying the sluggish storm system\\". Both sentences describe the storm system as being slow-moving (plodding and sluggish). In terms of speed and development, they align. 4. Hurricane strength: Sentence 1: \\"to make landfall as a hurricane by early Tuesday.\\" Sentence 2: \\"could reach hurricane strength before landfall early Tuesday.\\" Both sentences suggest that Claudette might reach hurricane strength before making landfall. However, Sentence 1 seems more confident in this prediction, while Sentence 2 implies that there is some uncertainty.

She has another 15 files to organize in the afternoon and the rest of the files are missing. How many files are missing?","response":"Step 1: Determine the number of files Edith organized in the morning. Since Edith finished organizing half of the 60 files in the morning, we calculate: Number of files organized in the morning = (1/2) * Total files Number of files organized in the morning = (1/2) * 60 Number of files organized in the morning = 30 Step 2: Determine the number of files she expects to organize in the afternoon. Edith has 15 more files to organize in the afternoon. Step 3: Calculate the total number of files organized and expected to be organized. Total organized files = Files organized in the morning + Files to be organized in the afternoon Total organized files = 30 + 15 Total organized files = 45 Step 4: Determine the number of missing files. Since there were 60 files in total and she has already organized or plans to organize 45 files, we can calculate the number of missing files. Missing files = Total files - Total organized files Missing files = 60 - 45 Missing files = 15 Final answer: There are 15 missing files."},{"question":"Translate \\"2 cups shredded or chopped cooked chicken\\" to Spanish.","response":"To translate \\"2 cups shredded or chopped cooked chicken\\" to Spanish, I will begin by identifying the main elements of the phrase and their corresponding translations.

Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Earths surface\\" correctly answer the question \\"What are ocean basins?\\"?","response":"No, the response \\"Earth's surface\\" does not correctly answer the question \\"What are ocean basins?\\" Based on the provided paragraph, ocean basins are defined as areas that extend from the edges of continents and include the ocean floor and Earth's deep ocean trenches. The term \\"Earth's surface\\" is more general and does not specifically refer to the ocean basins."},{"question":"Information: - The number and type of plants, how leafy they are, and how healthy they are. In places where foliage is dense and plants are growing quickly, the index is high, represented in dark green. Regions where few plants grow have a low vegetation index, shown in tan. The index is based on measurements taken by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASAs Terra satellite. Areas where the satellite did not collect data are gray. - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water. - The lion (\\"Panthera leo\\") is one of the big cats in the genus \\"Panthera\\" and a member of the family Felidae. The commonly used term African lion collectively denotes the several subspecies in Africa. With some males exceeding in weight, it is the second-largest living cat after the tiger. Wild lions currently exist in sub-Saharan Africa and in India (where an endangered remnant population resides in Gir Forest National Park). In ancient historic times, their range was in most of Africa, including North Africa, and across Eurasia from Greece and southeastern Europe to India. In the late Pleistocene, about 10,000 years ago, the lion was the most widespread large land mammal after humans: \\"Panthera leo spelaea\\" lived in northern and western Europe and \\"Panthera leo atrox\\" lived in the Americas from the Yukon to Peru. The lion is classified as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), having seen a major population decline in its African range of 3050% over two decades during the second half of the twentieth century. Lion populations are untenable outside designated reserves and national parks. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes of concern. Within Africa, the West African lion population is particularly endangered. - Solomon Islands is a sovereign country consisting of six major islands and over 900 smaller islands in Oceania lying to the east of Papua New Guinea and northwest of Vanuatu and covering a land area of . The country's capital, Honiara, is located on the island of Guadalcanal. The country takes its name from the Solomon Islands archipelago, which is a collection of Melanesian islands that also includes the North Solomon Islands (part of Papua New Guinea), but excludes outlying islands, such as Rennell and Bellona, and the Santa Cruz Islands. - A sovereign state is, in international law, a nonphysical juridical entity that is represented by one centralised government that has sovereignty over a geographic area. International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population, defined territory, one government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states. It is also normally understood that a sovereign state is neither dependent on nor subjected to any other power or state. - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east. - Wellington is the capital city and second most populous urban area of New Zealand, with residents. It is at the south-western tip of the North Island, between Cook Strait and the Rimutaka Range. Wellington is the major population centre of the southern North Island and is the administrative centre of the Wellington Region, which also includes the Kapiti Coast and Wairarapa. As the nation's capital city, the New Zealand Government and Parliament, Supreme Court and most of the civil service are based in the city. - Tasmania (abbreviated as Tas and known colloquially as \\"Tassie\\") is an island state of the Commonwealth of Australia. It is located to the south of the Australian mainland, separated by Bass Strait. The state encompasses the main island of Tasmania, the 26th-largest island in the world, and the surrounding 334 islands. The state has a population of around 518,500, just over forty percent of which resides in the Greater Hobart precinct, which forms the metropolitan area of the state capital and largest city, Hobart. - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney. - Afri (singular \\"Afer\\") was a Latin name for the inhabitants of Africa, referring in its widest sense to all the lands south of the Mediterranean (Ancient Libya). Latin-speakers at first used \\"afer\\" as an adjective, meaning \\"of Africa\\". As a substantive, it denoted a native of \\"Africa\\", i. e., an African. - Insects (from Latin ', a calque of Greek ['], \\"cut into sections\\") are a class of invertebrates within the arthropod phylum that have a chitinous exoskeleton, a three-part body (head, thorax and abdomen), three pairs of jointed legs, compound eyes and one pair of antennae. They are the most diverse group of animals on the planet, including more than a million described species and representing more than half of all known living organisms. The number of extant species is estimated at between six and ten million, and potentially represent over 90% of the differing animal life forms on Earth. Insects may be found in nearly all environments, although only a small number of species reside in the oceans, a habitat dominated by another arthropod group, crustaceans. - Madagascar, officially the Republic of Madagascar, and previously known as the Malagasy Republic, is an island country in the Indian Ocean, off the coast of Southeast Africa. The nation comprises the island of Madagascar (the fourth-largest island in the world), and numerous smaller peripheral islands. Following the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana, Madagascar split from the Indian peninsula around 88 million years ago, allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative isolation. Consequently, Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot; over 90% of its wildlife is found nowhere else on Earth. The island's diverse ecosystems and unique wildlife are threatened by the encroachment of the rapidly growing human population and other environmental threats. - Modern humans (\\"Homo sapiens\\", primarily ssp. \\"Homo sapiens sapiens\\") are the only extant members of Hominina tribe (or human tribe), a branch of the tribe Hominini belonging to the family of great apes. They are characterized by erect posture and bipedal locomotion; manual dexterity and increased tool use, compared to other animals; and a general trend toward larger, more complex brains and societies. - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America. As the world's fifth-largest country by both area and population, it is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of . It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection. - In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies. - Trichoceridae, or winter crane flies, of the order Diptera are long, thin, delicate insects superficially similar in appearance to the Tipulidae, Tanyderidae, and Ptychopteridae. The presence of ocelli distinguishes the Trichoceridae from these other families. There are approximately 160 known species. The adults can be found flying in the fall and the spring and some are active even in the winter, hence their common name. They form dancing, loose swarms of mostly males. Adults can also be found resting inside caves and hollow logs. Larvae occur in moist habitats where they feed on decaying vegetable matter. They are of no economic importance. - The Tanyderidae , or primitive crane flies , of the order Diptera , are long , thin , delicate insects with spotted wings , superficially similar in appearance to some Tipulidae , Trichoceridae , and Ptychopteridae . Most species are restricted in distribution . They are found in many parts of the world , including North America , South America , Africa , Australia , New Zealand , and various islands in the Pacific Ocean . Adults are usually found hanging from vegetation near streams . Larvae are found either in sandy stream margins or in wet , rotten wood . Fossil species are known . - A larva (plural \\"larvae\\" ) is a distinct juvenile form many animals undergo before metamorphosis into adults. Animals with indirect development such as insects, amphibians, or cnidarians typically have a larval phase of their life cycle. - The Sinai Peninsula or simply Sinai ('; ', ; \\"\\") is a peninsula in Egypt, situated between the Mediterranean Sea to the north and the Red Sea to the south, serving as a land bridge between Asia and Africa. It is the only part of Egyptian territory located in Asia. Sinai has a land area of about and a population of approximately 1,400,000 people. The bulk of the peninsula is divided administratively into two of Egypt's 27 governorates (with three more straddling the Suez Canal area). - Indonesia (or ; Indonesian: ), officially the Republic of Indonesia, is a unitary sovereign state and transcontinental country located mainly in Southeast Asia with some territories in Oceania. Situated between the Indian and Pacific oceans, it is the world's largest island country, with more than seventeen thousand islands. At , Indonesia is the world's 14th-largest country in terms of land area and world's 7th-largest country in terms of combined sea and land area. It has an estimated population of over 260 million people and is the world's fourth most populous country, the most populous Austronesian nation, as well as the most populous Muslim-majority country. The world's most populous island of Java contains more than half of the country's population. - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\". - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition. - The Ptychopteridae, phantom crane flies, are a small family (three extant genera) of nematocerous Diptera. Superficially similar in appearance to other \\"tipuloid\\" families, they lack the ocelli of the Trichoceridae, the five-branched radial vein of the Tanyderidae, and the two anal veins that reach the wing margins of the Tipulidae. They are usually allied with the Tanyderidae based on similarities of the mesonotal suture, this group being called the Ptychopteromorpha. - South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil). - Southern Cone is a geographic region composed of the southernmost areas of South America, south of and around the Tropic of Capricorn. Traditionally, it covers Argentina, Chile and Uruguay, bounded on the west by the Pacific Ocean, and south to the junction between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, which is the closest continental area of Antarctica (1000 km). In terms of social and political geography, the Southern Cone comprises Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Southern Brazil and sometimes Paraguay. - The North Island or Te Ika-a-Mui (\\"Mori\\") is one of the two main islands of New Zealand, separated from the slightly larger but much less populous South Island by Cook Strait. The island's area is , making it the world's 14th-largest island. It has a population of - Tonga (or ; Tongan: \\"Puleanga Fakatui o Tonga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Tonga, is a Polynesian sovereign state and archipelago comprising 169 islands of which 36 are inhabited. The total surface area is about scattered over of the southern Pacific Ocean. It has a population of 103,000 people of whom 70% reside on the main island of Tongatapu. - Auckland is a city in the North Island of New Zealand. It is the most populous urban area in the country. Auckland has a population of , which constitutes percent of New Zealand's population. It is part of the wider Auckland Regionthe area governed by the Auckland Councilwhich also includes outlying rural areas and the islands of the Hauraki Gulf, resulting in a total population of . Auckland also has the largest Polynesian population of any city in the world. The Mori language name for Auckland is or , meaning \\"Tmaki with a hundred lovers\\", in reference to the desirability of its fertile land at the hub of waterways in all directions. It has also been called karana, the Mori enunciation of \\"Auckland\\". - Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people. - Sexual reproduction is a form of reproduction where two morphologically distinct types of specialized reproductive cells called gametes fuse together, involving a female's large ovum (or egg) and a male's smaller sperm. Each gamete contains half the number of chromosomes of normal cells. They are created by a specialized type of cell division, which only occurs in eukaryotic cells, known as meiosis. The two gametes fuse during fertilization to produce DNA replication and the creation of a single-celled zygote which includes genetic material from both gametes. In a process called genetic recombination, genetic material (DNA) joins up so that homologous chromosome sequences are aligned with each other, and this is followed by exchange of genetic information. Two rounds of cell division then produce four daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes from each original parent cell, and the same number of chromosomes as both parents, though self-fertilization can occur. For instance, in human reproduction each human cell contains 46 chromosomes, 23 pairs, except gamete cells, which only contain 23 chromosomes, so the child will have 23 chromosomes from each parent genetically recombined into 23 pairs. Cell division initiates the development of a new individual organism in multicellular organisms, including animals and plants, for the vast majority of whom this is the primary method of reproduction. - Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), they are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix. - India, officially the Republic of India (\\"Bhrat Gaarjya\\"), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country (with over 1.2 billion people), and the most populous democracy in the world. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast. It shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. Its capital is New Delhi; other metropolises include Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad. - The Antarctic (US English , UK English or and or ) is a polar region, specifically the region around the Earth's South Pole, opposite the Arctic region around the North Pole. The Antarctic comprises in the strict sense the continent of Antarctica and the island territories located on the Antarctic Plate. In a broader sense the Antarctic region include the ice shelves, waters, and island territories in the Southern Ocean situated south of the Antarctic Convergence, a zone approximately wide varying in latitude seasonally. The region covers some 20% of the Southern Hemisphere, of which 5.5% (14 million km) is the surface area of the Antarctic continent itself. All of the land and ice shelves south of 60°S latitude are administrated under the Antarctic Treaty System. In a biogeographic sense, the Antarctic ecozone is one of eight ecozones of the Earth's land surface. - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. - An ocean (the sea of classical antiquity) is a body of saline water that composes much of a planet's hydrosphere. On Earth, an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the World Ocean, which covers almost 71% of its surface. These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans. The word \\"sea\\" is often used interchangeably with \\"ocean\\" in American English but, strictly speaking, a sea is a body of saline water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land.

If Bill and Dale eat 50% of their pizzas and Ann and Cate eat 75% of the pizzas, how many pizza pieces are left uneaten?. Explanation:","response":"Let's break down the problem step by step: 1. There are 4 people: Ann, Bill, Cate, and Dale. 2. Each person buys a personal pan pizza cut into 4 pieces. So, each person has 4 pieces of pizza for a total of 4 * 4 = 16 pieces. 3. Bill and Dale ate 50% of their pizzas. Since each of their pizzas has 4 pieces, they ate 50% of 4 pieces which is equal to 4 * 0.5 = 2 pieces each. Therefore, they consumed a total of 2 * 2 = 4 pieces. 4. Ann and Cate ate 75% of their pizzas. Since each of their pizzas has 4 pieces, they ate 75% of 4 pieces which is equal to 4 * 0.75 = 3 pieces each. Therefore, they consumed a total of 3 * 2 = 6 pieces. 5. To find out how many pieces are left uneaten, we should subtract the total number of pieces eaten from the total number of pizza pieces: Total pieces (16) - pieces eaten by Bill and Dale (4) - pieces eaten by Ann and Cate (6) = 16 - 4 - 6 = 6 pieces.

Real head into the match having won the European Cup a record nine times in their history and been runners-up on a further three occasions, whereas the only time Atletico have previously got this far was in 1974 when they lost to Bayern Munich. Real have also dominated the head-to-head record between the clubs in recent times, and were unbeaten against their arch-rivals for 13 years up until last season's Copa del Rey final, which Atletico won 2-1. Ready to go: Sergio Ramos and Luka Modric train ahead of the Champions League final. Training hard: Cristiano Ronaldo should be fit to play in the final. Good news: Ronaldo gives the thumbs up to the cameras. Atletico followed that up with a 1-0 league win at the Bernabeu in September, but since that match Real have won two of three meetings between the two while drawing the other. However, despite those records, Ramos believes it is Aletico who are favourites to lift the title in Lisbon this weekend after they pipped Barcelona and Real to the Primera Divison - their first since 1996. 'We are up against a great team in Atletico Madrid who, from my point of view, are the favourites,' the Spain international said on Tuesday. Good feeling: Gareth Bale is expected to play in the final. Letting it slip: Ramos and Madrid saw the title slide away. 'They are the deserved current league champions and deserve credit for reaching the Champions League final. 'But that doesn't mean they are going to be the champions of the Champions League.' Real may have won the competition a record amount of times but they have not been crowned champions since 2002 - something they are desperate to change this weekend. Ramos added: 'The final is for the fans. It's a competition which after so many years really excites both us and the fans. 'It's going to be a very hard-fought final. We're expecting a very physical match which will be won by whoever commits the fewest mistakes.'Â.","response":"In a soccer game, two teams called Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid will play against each other in a very important match called the Champions League final.

As one NBC commentator put it, \\"they're trying to get a Biles smile.\\" Biles may have made history when she won five medals at her very first Olympics (four gold and one bronze), but she was still a little nervous about carrying a flag that was about twice her size. \\"I'm afraid the flag is going to be too heavy for me,\\" Biles told reporters during a press conference ahead of the closing ceremony. \\"Because Michael Phelps is so much taller and he seemed to carry it so easily and I'm very short so I'm a little worried about that part but I think they'll guide me through it.\\" RELATED: Simone Biles Olympic profile So many people were trying to take a selfie with Biles that it was almost as if a \\"conga line,\\" was forming around her. Twitter users also didn't hesitate to praise Biles on not just her sportsmanship, but also her innate ability to keep on smiling.

General Jack Shepherd (Ed Lauter) decides to make a last stand with four of his best soldiers to allow the majority of his surviving troops to escape. The plan works and the soldiers escape, including Sergeant Dede Rake (Brenda Strong), psychic Lieutenant Pavlov Dill (Lawrence Monoson), Private Jill Sandee (Sandrine Holt) and her lover Private Duff Horton (Jason-Shane Scott), and Private Lei Sahara (Colleen Porch). Despite reaching relative safety, the team is whittled down by deadly storms and arachnid ambushesâincluding the only member of the platoon with a radio, Corporal Thom Kobe (Brian Tee). Lieutenant Dill is unable to command his soldiers as he receives traumatic visions of utter annihilation. He takes his anger out on Private Sahara, who is revealed to have been psychic but lost reliable control of her psychic abilities during puberty. The remaining refugees find themselves sheltering within Hotel Delta 1-8-5, an old and abandoned structure containing Captain V. J. Dax (Richard Burgi), a disgraced soldier who killed his commanding officer and was sealed in a furnace. As a deadly dust storm kicks up, they find themselves without communications or back-up for a lengthy period of time and protect themselves with an electric pulse fence. Dax takes command, to the annoyance of Dill, and the two develop enmity. Dax sees Dill as an incompetent commander, while Dill sees Dax as a traitor to the Federation.

Damon is not shown; instead, Etty illustrates the scene from Damon's viewpoint. By placing the audience in Damon's position, Etty aimed to induce the same reactions in the viewer as Damon's dilemma as described by Thomson; that of whether to enjoy the spectacle despite knowing it to be inappropriate, or to follow the accepted morality of the time and look away, in what art historian Sarah Burnage has described as \\"a titillating moral test for spectators to both enjoy and overcome\\".The pose of Musidora is based on that of the Aphrodite of Cnidus and the Venus de' Medici. It is possible that Etty was also familiar with Thomas Gainsborough's Musidora, which shares similar elements. Gainsborough's Musidora, his only large nude, was never exhibited in his lifetime and remained in private hands until 1847, but Etty was familiar with its then-owner Robert Vernon and may have seen it in his collection. The setting for the painting is a pool in the grounds of The Plantation, a house in the village of Acomb, near York. The Plantation was the home of his close friend and patron the Reverend Isaac Spencer, vicar of Acomb, and its grounds were a scene Etty had previously painted. In 1846 Etty bought a house in York for his retirement; Burnage speculates that Etty chose Acomb on the grounds that a view of York was quintessentially English.Although Etty had traditionally worked in the Venetian style of painting, with rich colours and detail, for Musidora he adopted a much softer and earthier palette, although his use of reflected light on flesh is derived from Venetian styles. He moved away from Rubens, who up to this time had been his greatest influence, and closer to the style of Titian. This is likely owing to the nature of the subject matter. Until then his history paintings had primarily been of themes of classical..., what would be the answer ? The answer is:","response":"William Etty is the artist whose history paintings had primarily been of themes of classical mythology. In the context provided, Etty's painting \\"Musidora\\" is discussed, and it is mentioned that until then, his history paintings had primarily been of themes of classical mythology."},{"question":"Data: Trane, location, Ireland; Trane, product, HVAC Sentence about the following data:","response":"Step 1: Identifying the key information The given data presents three key pieces of information: the company 'Trane', its location in 'Ireland', and its products, primarily 'HVAC' systems.

Many people are surprised when they find that the Internet was set up in the 1960s. At that time, computers were large and expensive. Computer networks didn't work well.

Which year were the animated films Mary and Max and Monsters vs. Aliens released?

Mary and Max is an Australian clay-animated black comedy-drama film written and directed by Adam Elliot, and was made at Melodrama Pictures.

The tale deals with various themes such as friendship, loneliness, depression, autism, and life's many challenges. It's a film renowned for its depth, emotion, and unique visual style.

His story is told in Livy's \\"Ab Urbe Condita\\" (written c. 27-25 BC). - The Second Punic War, also referred to as The Hannibalic War and (by the Romans) the War Against Hannibal, lasted from 218 to 201 BC and involved combatants in the western and eastern Mediterranean. This was the second major war between Carthage and the Roman Republic and its allied Italic socii, with the crucial participation of Numidian-Berber armies and tribes on both sides. The two states fought three major wars with each other over the course of their existence. They are called the \\"Punic Wars\\" because Rome's name for Carthaginians was \\"Poeni\\", derived from \\"Poenici\\" (earlier form of \\"Punici\\"), a reference to the founding of Carthage by Phoenician settlers. - Jugurtha or Jugurthen (c. 160 104 BC) was a King of Numidia, born in Cirta (modern-day Constantine). - The Numidians were the Berber population of Numidia (present day Algeria) and in a smaller part of Tunisia. The Numidians were one of the earliest Berber tribes to trade with the settlers of Carthage. As Carthage grew, the relationship with the Numidians blossomed. Carthage's military used the Numidian cavalry as mercenaries. Numidia provided some of the highest quality cavalry of the Second Punic War, and the Numidian cavalry played a key role in a number of battles, both early on in support of Hannibal and later in the war after switching allegiance to the Roman Republic. - Juba I of Numidia ( c. 85 BC -- 46 BC , reigned 60 BC -- 46 BC ) was a King of Numidia . He was the son and successor to King of Numidia Hiempsal II. - Hiempsal II was a king of Numidia. He was the son of Gauda, half-brother of Jugurtha, and was the father of Juba I. - The Massylii or Maesulians were a Berber federation of tribes in eastern Numidia, which was formed by an amalgamation of smaller tribes during the 4th century BC. They were ruled by a king. On their loosely defined western frontier were the powerful Masaesyli. To their east lay the territory of the rich and powerful Carthaginian Republic. Their relationship to Carthage resembled that of a protectorate. Carthage maintained its dominance over the Massylii by skillful diplomatic manoeuvering, playing off local tribal and kingdom rivalries. The principal towns of the Massylii were Cirta, Tébessa and Thugga. - Algeria (' \\"Dzayer\\"), officially the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria, is a sovereign state in North Africa on the Mediterranean coast. Its capital and most populous city is Algiers, located in the country's far north. With an area of , Algeria is the tenth-largest country in the world, and the largest in Africa. Algeria is bordered to the northeast by Tunisia, to the east by Libya, to the west by Morocco, to the southwest by the Western Saharan territory, Mauritania, and Mali, to the southeast by Niger, and to the north by the Mediterranean Sea. The country is a semi-presidential republic consisting of 48 provinces and 1,541 communes (counties). Abdelaziz Bouteflika has been President since 1999. - Numidia (202 BC 46 BC) was an ancient kingdom of the Numidians, located in what is now Algeria and a smaller part of Tunisia and Libya in the Maghreb. The polity was originally divided between Massylii in the east and Masaesyli in the west. During the Second Punic War (218-201 BC), Massinissa, king of the Massylii, defeated Syphax of the Masaesyli to unify Numidia into one kingdom. The kingdom began as a sovereign state and later alternated between being a Roman province and a Roman client state. It was bordered by the kingdom of Mauretania to the west, the Roman province of Africa (modern-day Tunisia) to the east, the Mediterranean Sea to the north, and the Sahara Desert to the south. It is considered to be the first major state in the history of Algeria and the Berber territories. What object entity has the relation of 'occupation' with the subject 'juba i of numidia'?

Low fades show off a hair's texture better and work with the hair's natural pattern. The longer the hair is on top, the lower the fade should be. If you want a cleaner, more buzzed style on the back and sides, go with the lowest clipper guard settings moving up to the temples. Try a high fade for a sleeker look. High fades work well with square or round face shapes because they lengthen the appearance of the face. Choose a pair of clippers with at least 3 guard lengths so you can blend the client’s hair as you go. Use clippers on the back, sides, and nape and styling scissors on the top. If you prefer a softer fade, you can also use styling scissors on the back and sides. However, keep in mind that this is an advanced technique, so do not attempt it unless you are very experienced with fades. Do not use household scissors to trim hair, as it can result in a blunt or uneven cut. Keep in mind that you can use clippers near the top of your head too if you like it shorter than {[convert|1|in|cm|abbr=on}}. Damp, clean hair is easier to work with while cutting fades. Wash the person's hair with shampoo, rinse it with water, and air or towel dry it until it is damp. The hair should be somewhat damp, not dripping wet, to make cutting it simpler. The client’s hair should not be so wet that it clumps together or you may end up cutting out chunks of it. What is a summary?","response":"A summary of the article is that when dealing with thick or wavy hair, it is recommended to perform a low fade below the ears and around the nape of the neck to showcase the hair's natural pattern and texture. For a sleeker look, use high fades, which are suitable for square or round face shapes. Use clippers with at least three guard lengths to blend the hair and styling scissors on the top. Advanced stylists can perform softer fades using styling scissors on the back and sides. Avoid using household scissors as they can result in uneven cuts. Clippers can also be used on top if shorter than 1 inch (2.54 cm) is preferred.

As a member of the New Hollywood gang, Francis Coppola is best remembered for The God Father series. His decision to cast Marlon Brando in the lead also met with fierce opposition from the studio bosses. Good sense became popular, and The God Father went on to become one of the most memorable movies ever. Critics may point out that he has become less creative after his seventies, but try as one might, no one can possibly take the place of this great director's work. Stanley Kubrick's movies focus on the themes like sci-fi, horror, dark humor and war. He used symbolism in most of his movies, giving us some wonderful screen visuals, as shown in 2001: A Space Odyssey. His actors in Hollywood complained about the endless number of retakes, but they appreciated the performance he milked out of them. People argue about films like Lolita, A Clockwork Orange and Paths of Glory, but these are now seen as classics. Steven Spielberg is a great success at the box office, and he is one of the world's most popular filmmakers today. As the creator of classics like Schindler's List, Jurassic Park, ET, Indiana Jones series, Jaws, Saving Private Ryan, no one can win his hold over the audience. His critics accuse him of being emotional and over the top, _ Woody Allen is a director who directs movies full of crime and hate. This comic genius has given us Annie Hall, Hannah and Her Sisters and Midnight in Paris, which have also become classical. His movies constantly include characters who arouse the audience's sympathy and laughter at the same time, as they set out on a journey of self-discovery. Hollywood star power has never fazed Allen.

Here is a hypothesis: Most awkward Dems enjoy talking a lot about why they don't talk about Lewinsky. Here are the options: Available choices: * yes * it is not possible to tell * no Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","response":"Based on the given premise and hypothesis, it is possible to analyze the relationship between the two and determine whether the hypothesis can be concluded if the premise is true. Let's break them down and examine the assumptions and connections. Premise: \\"The choice of more awkward Dems, this requires dismissing talk of Lewinsky, then talking endlessly about why you're not talking about her.\\" In this premise, we can gather the following assumptions: 1. The awkward Dems prefer a specific approach. 2. Their approach consists of dismissing the talk of Lewinsky. 3. This dismissal leads to talking endlessly about why they are not discussing Lewinsky. Now, let's look at the hypothesis: \\"Most awkward Dems enjoy talking a lot about why they don't talk about Lewinsky.\\" Here, we understand that: 1. Awkward Dems find pleasure in discussing the reasons why they avoid conversations about Lewinsky. To determine if the hypothesis is true based on the premise, we should find a connection between the assumptions of the premise and the hypothesis. In this case, there is a clear link between the third assumption of the premise and the hypothesis: both involve awkward Dems talking extensively about why they do not address the Lewinsky topic. Considering the relationship between the assumptions in the premise and the hypothesis, we can conclude that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is also likely to be true. The reason behind this assertion is that the premise itself implies that awkward Dems opt to discuss why they refrain from mentioning Lewinsky. Meanwhile, the hypothesis focuses on their enjoyment in having such conversations. Since the premise essentially outlines this behavior, we can infer that the hypothesis is valid if we accept the premise."},{"question":"Write a sentence that about [The Golden Curry eatType restaurant; The Golden Curry food Fast food; The Golden Curry customer rating low; The Golden Curry area city centre; The Golden Curry familyFriendly yes; The Golden Curry near Café Rouge].","response":"Step 1: Identify the main keywords - The Golden Curry - eatType restaurant - Fast food - customer rating low - city centre - familyFriendly yes - near Café Rouge Step 2: Formulate a sentence structure that includes all the keywords. \\"[The Golden Curry] is a [eatType restaurant] serving [Fast food] in the [city centre], with a [low customer rating].

During this period, the indigenous people lived in caves, hunting the mammals that gathered at the shoreline. The landscape of the valley changed dramatically over the next 200 centuries. The glaciers feeding the lake melted away and the lake evaporated. Fossils tell an obscure story of man's slow and sporadic development. Around 3000 b.c. , native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture. By this time, the valley was in much the same geographic state as it exists in today, with one exception — the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the surface in several areas. These springs fed a network of streams draining through the Las Vegas Wash to the Colorado River. The areas surrounding the springs were desert oases: sprawling collections of grasses, trees, and wildlife. Many springs lay in areas that would eventually become the center of the modern Las Vegas metropolis. For about 4000 years, the Archaics thrived in a culture that included many signs of early civilization. Signs of even more advancement appeared halfway through the first millennium a.d. , when the Anasazi Indians inhabited the valley. Far more progressive than the Archaics, the Anasazi utilized such formal agricultural techniques as irrigation to assist their harvest. This permitted the Anasazi to achieve a benchmark of advanced society — the ability to live in permanent shelters year-round without need to follow wildlife. Mysteriously, the Anasazi vanished from the valley around a.d.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more fuel used happens, how will it affect there will be more food for the owls. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","response":"The perturbation hypothesis you mentioned involves more fuel used. I assume you are referring to an increase in the use of fossil fuels, as they are the most common source of energy globally. The direct effect of increased fuel consumption is the release of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, which contribute to climate change. We can now analyze if and how this perturbation affects the process described, which involves an owl hunting and catching a mouse. Increased fuel usage and the subsequent effects of climate change can lead to changes in weather patterns, temperatures, and habitats. These changes can, in turn, affect the ecosystems and the food chain. In the case of our process, the owls and mice are both part of their shared ecosystem and can be influenced by these changes. Potential direct effects of increased fuel usage on the process are: 1. Changes in the geographical distribution of owls and mice: If climate change leads to unsuitable conditions for owls and mice in certain areas, they may be forced to migrate to new habitats. This could make it harder for owls to find adequate food sources if the mice population decreases in specific regions. 2. Decreased prey availability: Climate change can lead to a decline in the populations of some species, disrupting the food chain. For example, if the vegetation that mice feed on is affected, this may result in fewer mice for owls to prey on. Potential indirect effects of increased fuel usage on the process are: 1. Disruptions in mice breeding patterns: Changes in temperature or weather patterns can affect the breeding cycles of rodents such as mice. Smaller populations of mice can mean less food for owls. 2. Adverse effects on owl hunting skills: If climate change leads to less predictable weather patterns or more extreme conditions, this could potentially affect the owl's ability to hunt effectively. For instance, more intense storms or changing visibility could make it difficult for owls to locate and catch their prey. In conclusion, while the perturbation hypothesis concerning increased fuel usage does not directly impact the owl's hunting process, it can lead to indirect effects on the food chain and the ecosystem. This could potentially result in decreased food supply for the owls, making it more challenging for them to sustain and continue their hunting process."},{"question":"Question: Franklin wants to know how fast he runs different distances.

Estrogens are a group of hormones that play an essential role in the growth and development of female sexual characteristics and reproductive functions, including the menstrual cycle and breast growth. They are produced primarily by the ovaries, but also by the adrenal glands and by fatty tissues. Although estrogens are understood to be 'female hormones', they are not exclusively tied to females. They are also found in males but in smaller quantities, where they have different function. Male's primary sex hormone is testosterone, but estrogen is responsible for preventing a surplus of testosterone, controlling the growth of the long bones, and promoting sexual desire. Estrogen hormones collectively consist of estrone, estradiol, and estriol. Estradiol is the most active type of estrogen hormone in non-pregnant, premenopausal women, while estrone is the only estrogen hormone that remains in ample supply after menopause. Estriol levels rise during pregnancy when it becomes the predominant estrogen. These hormones exert their effects on cells by binding to the estrogen receptors present in some cells. They are in many ways the primary regulator of the growth, differentiation, and functioning of many different types of cells in the body. They also have a crucial role in bone health and mood regulation. It's important to note that any imbalance in the level of estrogen can lead to significant health issues. Insufficient levels can trigger hot flashes, night sweats, vaginal dryness, bone loss, certain mood changes, or other health problems. On the other hand, high levels of estrogen can increase the risk of endometrial cancer, breast cancer, or blood clots. In medical practices, estrogens are also used for hormone therapy, to help replace or supplement low estrogen levels, particularly around and after menopause, or in the treatment of conditions like hypogonadism and delayed puberty among girls. They are also used in some types of birth control and in the treatments of some cancers. Overall, estrogens serve a vital set of roles in the body. Their importance goes much beyond simply being a 'female hormone' and they are a fundamental part of many aspects of health for both men and women."},{"question":"Here is some data: The Phoenix food French; The Phoenix customer rating high; The Phoenix area riverside.

Foremost among these is the concept of the superpower, used to describe those nations with overwhelming power and influence in the rest of the world. It was first coined in 1944 by William T.R. Fox and according to him, there were three superpowers: the British Empire, the United States, and the Soviet Union. But by the mid-1950s the British Empire lost its superpower status, leaving the United States and the Soviet Union as the world's superpowers.[nb 2] The term middle power has emerged for those nations which exercise a degree of global influence, but are insufficient to be decisive on international affairs. Regional powers are those whose influence is generally confined to their region of the world. What is the answer to this question: What are middle powers?","response":"Middle powers are countries that hold a moderate degree of global influence and play a significant role in international affairs, yet their capabilities and presence are not large or dominant enough to be considered superpowers or great powers. These nations typically possess a sizable economy, maintain a stable political system, and have the ability to influence decisions and outcomes within their region and on the international stage to some extent. However, they lack the comprehensive reach, economic, military, and diplomatic dominance that the term superpower conveys. While middle powers may not possess overwhelming strength or control over global affairs, they often use their influence and resources to advocate for multilateralism, conflict resolution, and the promotion of international norms and values. For instance, middle powers are known to engage in diplomacy through international organizations, peacekeeping missions, and development aid, thereby fostering a rules-based international order. Their involvement in such activities illustrates their commitment to global stability and collaboration, even though they cannot singlehandedly shape the course of world events. Some examples of middle powers include countries like Canada, Australia, South Korea, Sweden, and Brazil. These nations actively participate in global affairs through membership in international organizations, promotion of diplomatic initiatives, and contribution to economic development and humanitarian aid. Their efforts and presence in the international arena not only enable them to maintain a degree of power and influence but also demonstrate their responsibility and commitment to the global community. In summary, middle powers are countries that exert significant influence in international affairs yet lack the widespread dominance of great powers or superpowers. These countries utilize their resources and capabilities to engage in diplomacy, conflict resolution, and the promotion of international norms and values, thus contributing to the overall stability and collaborative global environment."},{"question":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

The ruling comes days after presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump called to block non-citizen Muslims from entering the U.S. following the Orlando nightclub massacre. Even before the attack, Americans were divided, mostly along party lines, on the issue of refugees from war-torn countries in the Middle East. A survey conducted in late May by the Brookings Institution found of those polled, just 38 percent of Republicans supported taking in refugees from Syria and the Middle East, compared with 77 percent of Democrats. But among Trump supporters, an overwhelming 77 percent said they oppose taking in refugees. So who are these people who cause such a divide among Americans, triggering feelings of dread and suspicion in some and feelings of empathy and hospitality in others? Millions have been forced to flee the bloody conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Libya and other Middle Eastern nations. In 1951 the United Nation's Refugee Convention defined a refugee as someone who \\"owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality, and is unable to, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country.\\" By the end of 2014, there were 19.5 million refugees worldwide, according to the United Nations, 14.4 million of whom were under the mandate of the United Nations Human Rights Council.

Containing 498 shops, what shopping centre marks the beginning of the Westfield Sydney to Melbourne Ultramarathon?","response":"The shopping centre that marks the beginning of the Westfield Sydney to Melbourne Ultramarathon is the Westfield Parramatta. Westfield Parramatta is one of the largest shopping malls in Australia, with 498 shops. To fully appreciate the significance of this site, we can discuss a little more about the shopping center itself, the ultramarathon, and their roles in Australian culture. Westfield Parramatta is located in Parramatta, Sydney's second CBD. This large shopping center, encompassing over five levels, includes a range of premium and fast-fashion brands, dining outlets, entertainment facilities, and more. Retailers range from popular department stores like Myer and David Jones to smaller boutique stores. A versatile place for shopping, dining, and entertainment, it attracts a diverse group of visitors from the Sydney metropolitan area and beyond, highlighting its prominence in Sydney's commercial landscapes. The ultramarathon from Sydney to Melbourne is widely recognized for its strength and endurance demands. The race originated from the ambitious running endeavors of Cliff Young, an Australian potato farmer, and ultra-athlete. In 1983, at the age of 61, Young won the inaugural Sydney to Melbourne Ultramarathon, a race spanning over 875 kilometers. This demanding event was sponsored by the Westfield Group and thus was named the ‘Westfield Sydney to Melbourne Ultramarathon.’ The race's starting point at Westfield Parramatta adds another fascinating story to this shopping centre. Moreover, these two – the ultramarathon and the shopping center – are interconnected by more than location. They both reflect some characteristics of modern Australian society. The shopping center exemplifies today's consumer culture, where shopping is not just about purchasing goods but also about experience and entertainment. At the same time, the ultramarathon exemplifies the Australian spirit of endurance and resilience. In conclusion, Westfield Parramatta represents not only an essential retail and social hub in Sydney but also symbolizes the beginning of a test of human endurance, resilience, and determination embodied in the Westfield Sydney to Melbourne Ultramarathon. Both entities continue to make significant contributions to the cultural and social complexion of contemporary Australia."},{"question":"As of the census of 2010, there were 31,894 people, 13,324 households, and 8,201 families residing in the city.

Ask a question about this article.","response":"What does the population and demographic data from the 2010 Census tell us about racial makeup, housing units, and family structure within this particular city? The population and demographic data from the 2010 Census of this city provide a detailed snapshot of the social, ethnic, and economic fabric of the community at the time. This data serves as a useful resource for urban planning, public policy, and social research among other things. According to the 2010 Census, the city had a population of 31,894 people, distributed among 13,324 households. This indicates a relatively small- to medium-sized city. The number of family households, at 8,201, makes up a significant chunk of the total households and suggests that families constitute a large proportion of the city's population. Although the given data doesn't provide specifics regarding the population or household density, it does share that there were 14,057 housing units available in the city. Comparing this number with the number of households informs us about the level of housing supply during the period. It also provides the potential occupancy rate or the ratio of vacant units, which can be a critical piece of information for real estate market analysis or urban planning. In terms of racial makeup, the city was predominantly White, accounting for 93.9% of the population. This would suggest a relatively homogeneous racial composition. However, it should also be noted that the city was diverse in other ways. African Americans constituted 0.3%, Native Americans 1.7%, Asians 0.8%, and individuals identifying with two or more races made up 2.4% of the population. There were also other racial identities included but not specifically detailed in the given dataset. The city also had a small but significant Hispanic or Latino presence, accounting for 2.8% of the total population. This group could be of any race, suggesting that the city's ethnic makeup was more diverse than its racial makeup. In summary, the city, as depicted by the 2010 Census data, was made up of a relatively homogeneous population in terms of racial distribution but showed diversity in terms of ethnicity. Families played a significant part in the city's social structure, and the availability of housing units indicates a well-developed infrastructure. However, more data would be needed to make more detailed conclusions about socioeconomic status, age distribution, and other key demographic factors."},{"question":"In a car racing competition, Skye drove a 6-kilometer track.

For the remaining 1 kilometer, his speed was twice as fast as his speed on the first 3 kilometers. What is Skye's average speed for the entire race? Let's be accurate as possible.","response":"To calculate Skye's average speed for the entire race, we first need to find the total time it took him to complete the race, and then divide the total distance by the total time. For the first 3 km, Skye drove at 150 km/h. To find the time it took him to cover this distance, we use the formula: time = distance / speed For the first 3 km: time1 = 3 km / 150 km/h = 0.02 hours For the next 2 km, Skye's speed was 50 km/h more, which is 150 km/h + 50 km/h = 200 km/h. For the second part of 2 km: time2 = 2 km / 200 km/h = 0.01 hours For the last 1 km, Skye's speed was twice as fast as his speed on the first 3 km. So, it would be 2 * 150 km/h = 300 km/h. For the last 1 km: time3 = 1 km / 300 km/h = 0.00333 hours (rounded to 5 decimal places for accuracy) Now, we can find the total time it took Skye to complete the race: total time = time1 + time2 + time3 total time = 0.02 hours + 0.01 hours + 0.00333 hours = 0.03333 hours The total distance of the race is 6 km. To find Skye's average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time: average speed = total distance / total time average speed = 6 km / 0.03333 hours ≈ 180 km/h So, Skye's average speed for the entire race is approximately 180 kilometers per hour."},{"question":"Question: when did the us military first began hiring civilian employees??

Step 3: Analyze the information After reviewing the sources, I will identify the most consistent and relevant information to determine when the US military first started hiring civilians. Step 4: Provide the answer Upon analysis, it's clear that the US military has employed civilians in various capacities since its inception. However, it was during World War II that hiring civilians became more common. The War Department created the Civilian Personnel Division in 1942 to manage the increasing number of non-military workers. This led to a more systematic and organized approach to employing civilians in the military. Step 5: Justify the answer The increase in civilian employment during World War II can be attributed to the need for specialized skills and support services that were not readily available within the military. Civilians were also hired to fill positions left vacant by military personnel who were deployed overseas. The establishment of the Civilian Personnel Division in 1942 marked the formal recognition of the importance of civilian employees in the US military.

Griffin is 61 inches tall. How many inches tall is Gracie? Let's think first. Chain of thought:","response":"Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem: Gracie is 7 inches shorter than Grayson, Grayson is 2 inches taller than Griffin, and Griffin is 61 inches tall. Step 2: Find Grayson's height: Since Grayson is 2 inches taller than Griffin, we can find Grayson's height by adding 2 inches to Griffin's height (61 inches). Grayson's height = 61 inches + 2 inches = 63 inches. Step 3: Find Gracie's height: Gracie is 7 inches shorter than Grayson, so we can find Gracie's height by subtracting 7 inches from Grayson's height (63 inches). Gracie's height = 63 inches - 7 inches = 56 inches. In conclusion, Gracie is 56 inches tall."},{"question":"Question: What do most people have five years after becoming a parent? Options: - speak freely - school child - understand children - care for children - toddler Explain why a human would choose \\"school child\\" to answer the question above:","response":"A human would choose \\"school child\\" to answer the question above because it is the most accurate and logical option amongst the given choices. Five years after becoming a parent, most individuals would have a child who is about to enter the early stages of elementary education, thus being considered a \\"school child.\\" Here are the reasons why the other options may not be as accurate as \\"school child\\": Option 1 - Speak freely: Speaking freely is not specifically related to the stage or age of the child five years after becoming a parent. While communication does improve as children grow and develop, the betterment of communication skills is a gradual and continuous process rather than an accomplishment limited to a particular stage of a child's life. Option 3 - Understand children: Although understanding children is an important aspect of parenthood, this option does not directly address the time frame of five years, nor is it limited to a specific period in a child's development. Comprehending children is an ongoing learning process for parents that starts from birth and continues throughout the child's life. Option 4 - Care for children: Similarly, caring for children is a vital responsibility of parenthood, but this option does not accurately answer the question either. Caring for children begins the moment a child is born and spans their lifetime. This option is not exclusive to the five-year period specified in the question. Option 5 - Toddler: A toddler typically refers to a child between 12-36 months old, which corresponds to 1-3 years of age. This would not be an accurate choice for the question, given that the five-year mark would place the child beyond toddlerhood. In conclusion, the option of \\"school child\\" is the most accurate response to this question because it aligns directly with the given timeframe of five years after becoming a parent. This period is when the child is old enough to enter the education system, which signifies their progression from early childhood into a more structured learning environment."},{"question":"Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? it must be the end of the world : the best film so far this year is a franchise sequel starring wesley snipes .","response":"This phrase can be seen as both positive and negative.

However, this species is not originally from Australia but rather an invasive species that was introduced. For a truly native Australian wasp, the Hairy Flower Wasp (Scolia soror) is a suitable example. This wasp species is well-adapted to the Australian environment and plays an important role in the ecosystem. Here is a detailed overview of the Hairy Flower Wasp: 1. Appearance: Hairy Flower Wasps are large, robust, and brightly colored. They have a predominantly blue-black hue with distinctive yellow or orange markings on their body. As their name suggests, their bodies are covered in fine hairs that provide them with a somewhat fuzzy appearance. Adult Hairy Flower Wasps measure from around 20 to 30 millimeters in length. They have prominent wings that can be visibly folded lengthways and are either transparent or slightly smoky-colored. 2. Distribution: The Hairy Flower Wasp can be found throughout Australia, including Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania. They inhabit a variety of environments, including forests, grasslands, suburban gardens, and open areas. 3. Life cycle and habits: Hairy Flower Wasps are solitary creatures, with females often seen flying low to the ground, searching for nectar-rich flowers and the grubs of the scarab beetle. Unlike many other wasps who live in colonies, the Hairy Flower Wasp does not build paper nests. Instead, they burrow into the ground to locate their prey. 4. Diet and predation: Adult Hairy Flower Wasps are pollinators that primarily feed on nectar from flowers. However, the female wasps play a crucial role in controlling scarab beetle populations by hunting the beetle grubs. The female wasp will dig into the ground to locate the grub, then paralyze it by injecting venom through her stinger. After she lays an egg on the paralyzed grub, the wasp larva will hatch and consume the beetle grub as it matures before pupating and eventually emerging as an adult wasp. This predatory behavior helps to keep the beetle population in check in a natural and sustainable way. 5. Interaction with humans: Although Hairy Flower Wasps possess a stinger, they are not aggressive toward humans and only sting in self-defense or when provoked. Their sting can be quite painful, but it is not life-threatening unless the victim is allergic to wasp stings. These wasps are generally considered beneficial insects, as they help control pest populations and contribute to the pollination of flowers. On a broader note, Australia is home to an incredible diversity of wasp species, including the potter wasp, spider wasp, and various parasitic wasp species. Each of these native Australian wasps has unique habits and biological characteristics, making them an essential part of the continent's ecosystem."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

Movie plot title: Spartan Movie plot: Robert Scott is a former Force Recon Master Gunnery Sergeant, acting as a selection cadre member for Delta Force. While observing an exercise designed to evaluate Delta candidates, Scott meets a recruit, Curtis, as well as Sergeant Jacqueline Black, a knife-fighting instructor. Scott is drawn into a clandestine operation to find Laura Newton, the President's daughter, who is missing. Their search takes them to a bar where girls are recruited as prostitutes, and Scott's team follows a middleman to a bordello that funnels some of these girls to an international sex slavery ring. The madam gives them a contact number leading to a pay phone. Calls placed to the pay phone are traced back to Tariq Asani, a Lebanese national currently in federal prison. They plan to intercept Asani during a prisoner transport and gain information from him about the sex trafficking operation. When the car carrying Asani and another prisoner stops en route to its destination, Scott shows up and appears to kill the transport guard, then kills the other prisoner (who was on death row). He spares Asani when Asani says he can get them on a plane out of the country that night and confirms the sex slavery ring is based in Dubai. Scott stops at a convenience store to relay the information to the team. Curtis provides him with more ammunition, but Asani, waiting in the car, happens to spot the badge of another agent talking with Curtis and opens fire. Curtis is wounded and Scott has to kill Asani.

The postwar period also saw the beginning of Bush's 20-year involvement with grand opera, a genre in which, although he achieved little commercial recognition, he was retrospectively hailed by critics as a master of British opera second only to Britten. His first venture, Wat Tyler, was written in a form which Bush thought acceptable to the general British public; it was not his choice, he wrote, that the opera and its successors all found their initial audiences in East Germany. When eventually staged in Britain in 1974 the opera, although well received at Sadler's Wells, seemed somewhat old-fashioned; Philip Hope-Wallace in The Guardian thought the ending degenerated into \\"a choral union cantata\\", and found the music pleasant but not especially memorable. Bush's three other major operas were all characterised by their use of \\"local\\" music: Northumbrian folk-song in the case of Men of Blackmoor, Guyanese songs and dances in The Sugar Reapers, and American folk music in Joe Hill – the last-named used in a manner reminiscent of Kurt Weill and the German opera with which Bush had become familiar in the early 1930s.The extent to which Bush's music changed substantially after the war was addressed by Meirion Bowen, reviewing a Bush concert in the 1980s. Bowen noted a distinct contrast between early and late works, the former showing primarily the influences of Ireland and of Bush's European contacts, while in the later pieces the idiom was \\"often overtly folklike and Vaughan Williams-ish\\". In general Bush's late works continued to show all the hallmarks of his postwar oeuvre: vigour, clarity of tone and masterful use of counterpoint. The Lascaux symphony, written when he was 83, is the composer's final major orchestral statement, and addresses deep philosophical issues relating to the origins and destiny of mankind.

Article: In the atmosphere, carbon dioxide acts rather like a one-way mirror or the glass in the roof of a greenhouse which allows the sun's rays to enter but prevents the heat from escaping According to a weather expert's prediction , the atmosphere will be 3degC warmer in the year 2050 than it is today, if man continues to burn fuels at the present rate.If this warming up took place.the ice caps in the poles would begin to inch,thus raising sea level several meters and severely flooding coastal cities.Also.the increase in atmospheric temperature would lead to great changes in the climate of the northern hemisphere ,possibly resulting in an alteration of the earth's chief food growing zones. In the past,concern about a man-made warming of the earth has concentrated on the Arctic because the Antarctic is much colder and has a much thicker ice sheet.But the weather experts are now paying more attention to West Antarctic.which may be affected by only a few degrees of warming,in other words,by a warming on the scale that will possibly take place in the next fifty years from the burning of fuels. Satellite pictures show that large areas of Antarctic ice are already disappearing.The evidence available suggests that a warming has taken place.This fits the theory that carbon dioxide warms the earth. However, most of the fuel is burnt in the northern hemisphere,where temperatures seem to be falling.Scientists conclude,therefore ,that up to now natural influences on the weather have gone beyond those caused by man.The question is:Which natural cause has most effect on the weather?

There it would have ended, except one of my followers tweeted me a link to a screen replacement kit for Â£15 - much less than the Â£200 I was quoted at the Apple Store. I clicked, bought the replacement screen then realised I had committed to a mission to fix my own iPad. So I visited iFixit.com - a crowdsourced website packed with tutorials on how to fix equipment. The guide to how to fix an iPad 2 looked well laid out, but complicated and intricate. It was rated \\"very difficult\\". But I was determined that that wouldn't deter me. I'd spent Â£15 after all. Further research revealed tales of broken glass and an almost certain guarantee of breaking something. Not exactly encouraging. My next port of call was the Restart Project - a group of volunteers who give amateurs advice on how to extend the life of their gadgets. Since last year, the movement has expanded to more than 40 countries, and they now offer \\"lunch hour\\" clinics in the workplace as well as holding evening and weekend parties. They offer advice on how to fix broken kit - and attendees accept the obvious risks involved in DIY repair. Before we continue, some warnings: if you think you're covered by a warranty you'll probably want to take your broken gadgets back to where you bought them. And the damage can be more personal - there is potential for electric shocks and bleeding fingers from broken glass. I wasn't put off - after all, my iPad is ancient, so I popped into one of their London events. I didn't fancy doing a job like this unsupervised, plus they'd agreed to lend me a heat gun, which is like an industrial-strength hairdryer. I used the heat gun to soften the adhesive that sticks the device together. Once the glue softened, I used plastic and metal implements called spudgers to prise my much-loved gadget open. The first incision was terrifying. Francis, a \\"restarter\\", kept an eye on me to make sure I didn't hurt myself. I wore safety glasses, and used sticky tape to collect tiny broken glass fragments. But important preparation such as reading guides, watching videos and memorising the steps in advance could not prepare me for the horrible reality of gouging out my kit. It was a taxing combination of brutal heavy-handedness and a delicate, dexterous light touch. Tablet repair is not a task I would encourage anyone to try without careful consideration and a healthy disrespect for the warranty. Janet Gunter, co-founder of the Restart Project, wants more companies to think about people's ability to repair their own devices. \\"Stuff is getting more difficult to open and we're seeing that in the events that we're hosting. We're going to reach a point where it's going to be hard to help people fix things in a three-hour period. \\"People always beat up on Apple but the point is everything is becoming sleeker, smaller, more sealed together and more difficult to open.\\" I was determined - and finally removed the screen after three hours of prodding, poking, prying, scraping and applying heat. Everyone cheered. After removing the glass I undid four little screws and gently lifted the screen to reach the touchscreen connector behind it. I pulled out data cables, and prepared to do it all again - this time backwards. My tablet rebooted and connected to the web successfully. I had avoided the most common mistake - breaking the wifi/bluetooth antenna stuck to the glass next to the home button. But it was only a partial victory. During the removal of the glass, I'd severed the connection to one of the antennas at the top of the device. I couldn't consider it a complete repair, and was a little despondent. Alex Perjescu's company Lovefone repairs phones and tablets. He was at the event and was impressed that I'd even attempt a tablet screen repair, let alone try to replace the GPS antenna myself. He found me a replacement antenna and we arranged to meet at the next Restart party. The quest for a fully repaired tablet was back on! Alex told me it was normal to break something on the first fix. \\"The instructions you find online are great - but also [you need to know] those little tricks to get it right from the first try. And make sure you're confident with the instructions you've found.\\" Alex's professional tools were much more precise than the ones I'd bought online. I got right down to the logic board, removing the camera assembly, unpeeling tiny bits of tape, unscrewing tiny screws. An excruciating exercise indeed - but seven hours later I had finally done it - taking five hours longer than a competent professional. I was too tired to cheer, but immeasurably happy - and I am still happy as I'm writing this article on my self-refurbished device. The Restart Project aims to empower people to fix stuff themselves - and I certainly felt exhilarated after such a difficult repair. For me, after opening an iPad, nothing feels impenetrable. But crucially I was prepared to break my kit in order to understand it - and I'd advise anyone to think this way if they are considering DIY repair. Because sometimes it's not the winning - it's the taking apart that counts.

The Colts began the game on offense, driving down to the Broncos' 36 yard line. However, following a delay of game penalty, they were forced to punt. Peyton Manning led the Broncos' offense on a 16 play drive, but would settle only for a field goal, giving Denver a 3-0 lead. An Andrew Luck interception on the Colts' ensuing offensive possession set the Broncos up at midfield and would lead to a touchdown on a pass from Manning to Julius Thomas to give the Broncos a 10-0 lead. After a three and out from the Colts' offense, Manning and the Broncos again take advantage and drive 83-yard to score on another Thomas touchdown reception. Late in the second quarter, the Broncos again scored on a touchdown pass from Manning to Thomas and extended Denver's lead to 24-0 with two minutes remaining in the half. The Colts put together an 8 play, 80-yard drive to end the half and scored their first points on a 9-yard run from Luck, making the score 24-7 in favor of Denver at halftime. The Broncos' began the second half on offense, though they were eventually forced to punt. After driving into the red zone on their first offensive possession of the half, the Colts' failed to convert a fourth down on the goal line and turned the ball over on downs. The Colts' next offensive possession would again stall in the red zone, with the Colts settling for an Adam Vinatieri field goal, cutting the Bronco lead to 24-10.

His books on economic topics were bestsellers from the 1950s through the 2000s, during which time Galbraith fulfilled the role of public intellectual. As an economist, he leaned toward post-Keynesian economics from an institutionalist perspective. Galbraith was a long-time Harvard faculty member and stayed with Harvard University for half a century as a professor of economics. In February 1946, Galbraith took a leave of absence from his magazine work for a senior position in the State Department as director of the Office of Economic Security Policy where he was nominally in charge of economic affairs regarding Germany, Japan, Austria, and South Korea. He was distrusted by the senior diplomats so he was relegated to routine work with few opportunities to make policy. Galbraith favored detente with the Soviet Union, along with Secretary of State James F. Byrnes and General Lucius D. Clay, a military governor of the US Zone in Germany from 1947 to 1949, but they were out of step with the containment policy then being developed by George Kennan and favored by the majority of the US major policymakers. After a disconcerting half-year, Galbraith resigned in September 1946 and went back to his magazine writing on economics issues. Later, he immortalized his frustration with \\"the ways of Foggy Bottom\\" in a satirical novel, The Triumph (1968). The postwar period also was memorable for Galbraith because of his work, along with Eleanor Roosevelt and Hubert Humphrey, to establish a progressive policy organization Americans for Democratic Action (ADA) in support of the cause of economic and social justice in 1947. During his time as an adviser to President John F. Kennedy, Galbraith was appointed United States Ambassador to India from 1961 to 1963. His rapport with President Kennedy was such that he regularly bypassed the State Department and sent his diplomatic cables directly to the president. In India, he became a confidant of Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and extensively advised the Indian government on economic matters. In 1966, when he was no longer ambassador, he told the United States Senate that one of the main causes of the 1965 Kashmir war was American military aid to Pakistan. While in India, he helped establish one of the first computer science departments, at the Indian Institute of Technology in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh. Even after leaving office, Galbraith remained a friend and supporter of India. Because of his recommendation, First Lady of the United States Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy undertook her 1962 diplomatic missions in India and Pakistan. In autumn 1972 Galbraith was an adviser and assistant to Nixon's rival candidate George McGovern in the election campaign for the American presidency. During this time (September 1972) he travelled in to China in his role as president of the American Economic Association (AEA) at the invitation of Mao Zedong's communist government with the economists Leontief and Tobin and in 1973 published an account of his experiences in A China Passage. Galbraith wrote that there was \\"no serious doubt that China is devising a highly effective economic system,\\" \\"[d]issidents are brought firmly into line in China, but, one suspects, with great politeness,\\" \\"Greater Shanghai ... has a better medical service than New York,\\" and considered it not implausible that Chinese industrial and agricultural output was expanding annually at a rate of 10 to 11%. Did he write any books during this time?","response":"Yes, John Kenneth Galbraith wrote several influential books during his time as an economist, public official, and academic. Some of the most notable books that he wrote during this period include: 1. \\"American Capitalism: The Concept of Countervailing Power\\" (1952) - In this book, Galbraith argued that the American economy was managed by a handful of large corporations and unions, which had the power to manipulate market forces in their favor. 2. \\"The Great Crash 1929\\" (1955) - This book is a popular account of the Wall Street crash of 1929 and offers insights into the causes of the Great Depression. Galbraith detailed the speculative nature of stock markets and how irrational speculation led to the financial collapse. 3. \\"The Affluent Society\\" (1958) - In this book, Galbraith explored the economic conditions of the United States in the post-World War II era. He criticized the excessive focus on private consumption and argued that the United States needed to invest more in public infrastructure, education, and social welfare. 4. \\"The New Industrial State\\" (1967) - This book is an examination of the relationship between large corporations and the government. Galbraith argued that large corporations had immense influence over the government, often shaping policies and regulations in their favor, which could lead to economic imbalances and other negative consequences. 5. \\"Economics and the Public Purpose\\" (1973) - In this book, Galbraith advocated for an emphasis on social wellbeing as a measure of economic success, rather than focusing solely on growth and profits. He called for a more equitable distribution of income, better access to education and healthcare, and greater government involvement in ensuring social welfare. These books, along with several others, ensured Galbraith's status as a leading public intellectual and a significant thought leader in economics during the 20th century. He used these books as platforms to share his ideas on economic policy, social justice, and institutional reform, thus shaping the discourse around American liberalism and post-Keynesian economics."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Pick one category for the following text.

There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody). - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities.

Located almost entirely in Ohio County, of which it is the county seat, it lies along the Ohio River in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. Wheeling was originally a settlement in the British colony of Virginia and later an important city in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Wheeling was the first state capital of West Virginia.

A few years ago, Vegas was one of my “bucket list” places – one of those iconic cities that one should visit at least once in their life. For me, once was enough. This is now my 4th (I think?) trip to Vegas, and while the city has a lot to offer, it’s just not my cup of tea. For one thing, I’m not a gambler, like at all. I don’t have anything against it, I just don’t enjoy it. It either feels pointless or stressful to me. The city itself makes me a little sad – in some cases, it reeks of desperation. Last time I was there, my cab driver entertained me with stories of how she was working 3 jobs to save up enough to join some mega-massive bingo game. She won a small jackpot a few years back and that allowed her to work only one job for a few months. She was hoping to win again so she could cut back to 1 or 2 jobs. I wondered how many people do similar things – gambling their money away, in big or small chunks, in the hopes of that big score and in the process, putting themselves in a not-great financial situation. I suppose as long it makes them happy, then it’s all OK, but I can’t help but think someone like my cab driver might be happier overall if she only worked 1 job instead of 3, instead of working extra jobs to save up money to gamble her way to financial freedom. But that’s for her to decide, not me. The juxtaposition of extreme and in-your-face wealth and the homeless people on the Strip also makes me sad. It’s difficult to see people begging for food and sleeping on the street while all around you, millions of dollars are poured into creating a massive playground with every type of indulgence possible.

A sickly Mina Van Helsing (Jan Francis), who is visiting her friend Lucy Seward (Kate Nelligan), discovers Dracula's body after his ship has run aground. The Count visits Mina and her friends at the household of Lucy's father, Dr. Jack Seward (Donald Pleasence), whose clifftop mansion also serves as the local asylum. At dinner, he proves to be a charming guest and leaves a strong impression on the hosts, Lucy especially. Less charmed by this handsome Romanian count is Jonathan Harker (Trevor Eve), Lucy's fiancÃ©. Later that night, while Lucy and Jonathan are having a secret rendezvous, Dracula reveals his true nature as he descends upon Mina to drink her blood. The following morning, Lucy finds Mina awake in bed, struggling for breath. Powerless, she watches her friend die, only to find wounds on her throat. Lucy blames herself for Mina's death, as she had left her alone. At a loss for the cause of death, Dr. Seward calls for Mina's father, Professor Abraham van Helsing (Laurence Olivier). Van Helsing suspects what might have killed his daughter: a vampire. Moreover, he begins to worry about what fate his seemingly dead daughter may now have.

Croatia is the home country for the breed . The name translates into English as the Scenthound From The Sava Valley , but is usually translated as the Posavac Hound . - A carnivore meaning 'meat eater' (Latin, \\"caro\\" meaning 'meat' or 'flesh' and \\"vorare\\" meaning 'to devour') is an organism that derives its energy and nutrient requirements from a diet consisting mainly or exclusively of animal tissue, whether through predation or scavenging. Animals that depend solely on animal flesh for their nutrient requirements are called obligate carnivores while those that also consume non-animal food are called facultative carnivores. Omnivores also consume both animal and non-animal food, and apart from the more general definition, there is no clearly defined ratio of plant to animal material that would distinguish a facultative carnivore from an omnivore. A carnivore that sits at the top of the food chain is termed an apex predator. - A terrier is a dog of any one of many breeds or landraces of terrier type, which are typically small, wiry, very active and fearless dogs. Terrier breeds vary greatly in size from just to over and are usually categorized by size or function. There are five different groups with each group having several different breeds. - The gray wolf or grey wolf (\\"Canis lupus\\"), also known as the timber wolf or western wolf, is a canine native to the wilderness and remote areas of Eurasia and North America. It is the largest extant member of its family, with males averaging , and females . Like the red wolf, it is distinguished from other \\"Canis\\" species by its larger size and less pointed features, particularly on the ears and muzzle. Its winter fur is long and bushy, and predominantly a mottled gray in color, although nearly pure white, red, or brown to black also occur. , 37 subspecies of \\"C. lupus\\" are recognised by MSW3. - Croatia, officially the Republic of Croatia, is a sovereign state between Central Europe, Southeast Europe, and the Mediterranean. Its capital city is Zagreb, which forms one of the country's primary subdivisions, along with its twenty counties. Croatia covers and has diverse, mostly continental and Mediterranean climates. Croatia's Adriatic Sea coast contains more than a thousand islands. The country's population is 4.28 million, most of whom are Croats, with the most common religious denomination being Roman Catholicism. - A hunting dog refers to a canine that hunts with or for humans. There are several types of hunting dogs developed for various tasks. The major categories of hunting dogs include hounds, terriers, dachshunds, cur type dogs, and gun dogs. Among these categories further divisions can be made based upon the dogs' skill sets. - The Adriatic Sea is a body of water separating the Italian Peninsula from the Balkan peninsula and the Apennine Mountains from the Dinaric Alps and adjacent ranges. The Adriatic is the northernmost arm of the Mediterranean Sea, extending from the Strait of Otranto (where it connects to the Ionian Sea) to the northwest and the Po Valley. The countries with coasts on the Adriatic are Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Greece, Italy, Montenegro and Slovenia. The Adriatic contains over 1,300 islands, mostly located along its eastern, Croatian, coast. It is divided into three basins, the northern being the shallowest and the southern being the deepest, with a maximum depth of . The Otranto Sill, an underwater ridge, is located at the border between the Adriatic and Ionian Seas. The prevailing currents flow counterclockwise from the Strait of Otranto, along the eastern coast and back to the strait along the western (Italian) coast. Tidal movements in the Adriatic are slight, although larger amplitudes are known to occur occasionally. The Adriatic's salinity is lower than the Mediterranean's because the Adriatic collects a third of the fresh water flowing into the Mediterranean, acting as a dilution basin. The surface water temperatures generally range from in summer to in winter, significantly moderating the Adriatic Basin's climate. - A sovereign state is, in international law, a nonphysical juridical entity that is represented by one centralised government that has sovereignty over a geographic area. International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population, defined territory, one government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states. It is also normally understood that a sovereign state is neither dependent on nor subjected to any other power or state. - Zagreb is the capital and the largest city of Croatia. It is located in the northwest of the country, along the Sava river, at the southern slopes of the Medvednica mountain. Zagreb lies at an elevation of approximately above sea level. In the last official census of 2011 the population of the City of Zagreb was 792,875. The wider Zagreb metropolitan area includes the City of Zagreb and the separate Zagreb County bringing the total metropolitan area population up to 1,237,887. It is the biggest metropolitan area in Croatia, and the only one with a population of over one million. - The dachshund (or or ) is a short-legged, long-bodied, hound-type dog breed. - \\"Hound\\" is a synonym for \\"dog\\", also used in a more specific sense to refer to a type of dog used by hunters to track or chase prey. - Gun dogs, or bird dogs, are types of hunting dogs developed to assist hunters in finding and retrieving game, usually birds. Gun dogs are divided into three primary types: retrievers, flushing dogs, and pointing breeds. Some kennel clubs define a Gundog Group for gun dogs, while other kennel clubs include them in the Sporting Group. - A cur is a type of dog. CUR refers to: - Canis is a genus of canids containing multiple extant species, such as wolves, dogs and coyotes. Species of this genus are distinguished by their moderate to large size, their massive, well developed skulls and dentition, long legs, and comparatively short ears and tails. - The domestic dog (\\"Canis lupus familiaris\\" or \\"Canis familiaris\\") is a member of genus \\"Canis\\" (canines) that forms part of the wolf-like canids, and is the most widely abundant carnivore. The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa, with modern wolves not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated. The dog was the first domesticated species and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. - A mediterranean climate or dry summer climate is the climate typical of the lands in the Mediterranean Basin. The lands around the Mediterranean Sea form the largest area where this climate type is found, but it also is found in most of coastal California, in parts of Western and South Australia, in southwestern South Africa, sections of Central Asia, and in central Chile. - The domestic cat is a small, typically furry, carnivorous mammal. They are often called house cats when kept as indoor pets or simply cats when there is no need to distinguish them from other felids and felines. Cats are often valued by humans for companionship and for their ability to hunt vermin. There are more than 70 cat breeds, though different associations proclaim different numbers according to their standards. - Croats are a nation and South Slavic ethnic group at the crossroads of Central Europe, Southeast Europe, and the Mediterranean Sea. Croats mainly live in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, but are an officially recognized minority in Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Italy, Montenegro, Romania, Serbia, and Slovakia.

Here's the corrected version: \\"Remove the item 'Jordan' from the list of countries.\\""},{"question":"Knowing that \\"large fins can be used to move quickly through water\\", how would one answer \\"Fish move best through water when their fins are?\\"","response":"When addressing the statement, \\"Fish move best through water when their fins are?\\", one must consider several aspects of fish anatomy, hydrodynamics, the role of fins in propulsion and maneuverability, as well as the implications of different fin sizes and shapes on swimming performance. Fish move best through water when their fins are optimally adapted to their specific needs and ecological niches. Fins are essential for thrust generation, controlling and maintaining fish's position in water, and stabilization against rolling and yawing movements. The size, shape, and flexibility of fins vary across species and are fine-tuned according to the fish's locomotory requirements. Therefore, it's crucial to examine the relationship between various fin adaptations and the fish's overall swimming performance. Large fins are generally advantageous for fish that need to move quickly through water. By increasing the surface area of water displaced per unit time, large fins allow these fish to generate more thrust and subsequently achieve higher speeds. This is particularly beneficial for predators that rely on fast pursuit of prey or species that need to escape from predators. However, not all fish require large fins to move efficiently through water. For some species, smaller or differently shaped fins may be more advantageous. For example, fish living in more complex environments, such as coral reefs or aquatic vegetation, might benefit from more maneuverable, smaller fins, allowing them to navigate between narrow spaces and avoid obstacles. Anguilliform swimmers, such as eels, use their elongated, ribbon-like fins to produce undulatory movements along their bodies, propelling them through water. In such cases, large fins would not be necessary or even desirable for efficient movement, as it could cause excessive drag. Another aspect to consider is the different types of fins that fish possess. These include pectoral fins, dorsal fins, ventral fins, anal fins, and caudal fins. Each of these fins plays a specific role in fish locomotion, and their size, shape, and positioning can greatly influence the swimming performance of a given species. Therefore, it's essential to recognize the complexity and diversity of fin adaptations in fish to understand their overall locomotor abilities. In conclusion, fish move best through water when their fins are designed in a size, shape, and position that caters to their ecological niche, locomotory needs, and species-specific adaptations. While large fins are advantageous for some species that need to move quickly through water, other factors, such as the fish's environment and behavioral requirements, must be considered when assessing the effectiveness of different fin adaptations in swimming performance. Ultimately, it is the perfect balance between thrust production, maneuverability, and stability that determines which fin configurations will result in optimal swimming capabilities for each species."},{"question":"Lizzy: Martha needs 4 cups of berries and 2 cups of heavy cream to make 1 quart of ice cream.

How much will it cost her to make 1 quart of each ice cream?. Me: Hmmm, let me think. I think this is the detailed solution:","response":"To make 1 quart of strawberry ice cream, Martha needs 4 cups of strawberries and 2 cups of heavy cream. For the strawberries, she needs 2 packages of 2 cups each, which are priced at 3.00 per package: 2 packages x 3.00 = 6.00 To make 1 quart of raspberry ice cream, Martha needs 4 cups of raspberries and 2 cups of heavy cream. For the raspberries, she needs 2 packages of 2 cups each, which are priced at 5.00 per package: 2 packages x 5.00 = 10.00 For both types of ice cream, she needs a total of 4 cups of heavy cream. A 4 cup container of heavy cream costs 4.00. Since she only needs to buy one container for both ice cream types, the heavy cream cost stays at 4.00. To calculate the total cost of making 1 quart of each ice cream, strawberry and raspberry, you simply add up the costs: 6.00 (strawberries) + 10.00 (raspberries) + 4.00 (heavy cream) = 20.00 So, it will cost Martha 20.00 to make 1 quart of each ice cream."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Read the following article and select the best answer.

Christopher wasn't a wide person, and so his piece of conference table didn't have to be too big either, which also practically solved office space problems in the 0-1 Computer firm. It was Warm's secret that the majority of his time outside of the company, he also spent behind a desk. On his keyboard he typed various letters and numbers, which would become computer programs for the 0-1 Computer Associates company. While the Man Called Office Desk (MCOD, or simply Cod in an alternative version) was writing an intuitive program for the management of empty office desk space in software companies, a thing that nobody had ever expected to happen happened. Warm became fused with the chair. The staff at 0-1 Computer were disappointed, they had expected Cod to fuse with a desk. It would have been much more entertaining to watch, you could have laughed at him a little, and the nickname, given to him by the programmers' boss would have gotten a whole new meaning.

When we do that, it becomes: 0 = (677-651)*q - 156. Calculating the difference of 677 and 651, we get 26. So now the problem looks like this: 0 = 26*q - 156. We want to isolate \\"q\\" and find its value. To do that, let's add 156 to both sides of the equation. When we do that we get: 156 = 26*q. Now, we want to find out what q is. To do that, we need to divide both sides by 26. When we divide 156 by 26, we get the value 6. So, q = 6. And that's our answer! The value of \\"q\\" is 6."},{"question":"El presupune că autorităţile locale lucrează la un nou plan de ocupare care va fi anunţat în curând.

I do not deserve to be treated like an old toy that he can just throw back at my parents . I truly loved him and the way he is treating me shows that he does not and may never have cared for me . Question: What may be a fact about the speaker 's situation ?","response":"Based on the speaker's statement, it can be deduced that they feel deeply hurt and undervalued in their relationship. This feeling could have arisen from various factors, which could include trust issues, unmet expectations, poor communication, or even mistreatment. One possible fact about the speaker's situation is that they may have been involved in a romantic relationship where there was an imbalance of power and emotional investment. The speaker indicates that they \\"truly loved\\" their partner, which suggests a strong emotional attachment on their part. However, they also mention feeling like an \\"old toy,\\" which implies that they perceive themselves as treated without respect or care for their feelings. Another possible fact is that the speaker's partner has ended their relationship in a cold or dismissive manner, without providing the desired closure in the form of a face-to-face conversation. This might be a source of deep emotional pain for the speaker, as they feel discarded and abandoned. The mention of their partner \\"throwing them back at their parents\\" might indicate that the speaker's family could be involved in the situation, which could further exacerbate their feelings of embarrassment, humiliation or simply having been used or betrayed. Another fact that can be inferred from the speaker's statement is the existence of unresolved feelings and lack of closure in their relationship. The speaker clearly seeks answers and validation through a face-to-face conversation, a chance to address the issues and possibly rebuild their emotional connection. The fact that their partner seems unwilling or unable to provide this may further contribute to the speaker's feelings of hurt and betrayal. Additionally, the speaker's doubt about their partner's love and care for them might hint that this is not the first time their partner has dismissed their feelings or acted in such an indifferent manner. This could be a pattern of behavior in their relationship, with the speaker experiencing feelings of neglect or being taken for granted multiple times. In conclusion, based on the speaker's statement, it can be inferred that they are in a painful situation stemming from a disintegrated relationship, the absence of proper closure, and continuous disregard for their feelings by their partner. Their desire for a face-to-face conversation indicates an attempt to seek answers, clarity, and possibly healing from this emotionally distressing situation."},{"question":"Seeing someone open a gift after buying christmas presents causes what for the gift giver? - stress - understand themselves - pleasure - sense of joy - debt The best answer is Answer:","response":"sense of joy"},{"question":"Complete the passage.

They were trained to help soldiers, like Fred Dorr, stay safe in difficult places like the Vietnam jungle. Sarge, a smart German shepherd, was able to sense when something was wrong, even if it was a tiny little thing, like the wind making a different sound, or maybe even if the air smelled a little bit different. One day, Sarge noticed that his soldier friend, Fred, was walking in a dangerous direction. Sarge didn't want anything bad to happen, so he did something he had never done before: he looked at Fred and barked really loud to get his attention, then he sat down. This made Fred realize that there was a hidden trip wire nearby. Trip wires are like special strings that, when touched, make an explosive thing happen, which could hurt a lot of people. Because Sarge warned Fred, they were able to keep everyone safe, including themselves and the other soldiers who were walking with them. This shows how important and helpful scout dogs like Sarge were during that time. They were great at protecting their soldier friends and making sure they didn't accidentally walk into any danger."},{"question":"(CNN) -- A federal court jury in Florida convicted seven people of participating in a global child pornography trafficking enterprise, according to the Department of Justice. Jurors convicted the seven Wednesday of multiple counts of child exploitation, pornography and obstruction of justice. Members of the organization used Internet news groups to swap and share \\"illegal images and videos depicting prepubescent children, including toddlers, engaged in various sexual and sadistic acts,\\" prosecutors said. An indictment filed in the case detailed interactions between group members as they swapped and commented on images. \\"My thanks to you and all the others that together make this the greatest group of pedos to ever gather in one place,\\" Freeman wrote in response to one posting, according to the indictment. And a posting from Castleman, cited in the indictment, read, \\"Thanks to all for the wonderful material that has been posted.\\" An Australian constable who infiltrated the group in August 2006 was among 50 witnesses testifying at trial. He told the jury that the group traded more than 400,000 images and videos of child sexual abuse before being dismantled by law enforcement, according to the Justice Department statement. Each defendant faces a sentence of 20 years to life in prison, fines and the possibility of supervised release for the rest of their lives, authorities said. The seven will be sentenced April 14. During the six-day trial, evidence showed the seven participated in what prosecutors called a \\"well-organized criminal enterprise whose purpose was to proliferate child sex abuse images to its membership during a two-year period.\\" \\"This was a wide-scale, high-volume, international trafficking enterprise that used sophisticated computer encryption technology and file-sharing techniques,\\" Matthew Friedrich, acting assistant attorney general, said in the statement.

Decide on a safe word with your partner. Be attentive to your partner’s needs. Article:","response":"Title: How to Be a Good Dominatrix: A Simple Guide for Beginners Hey there, little buddy! I'm going to tell you a story about how to be a good dominatrix. A dominatrix is a person who likes to take the lead and be in charge during playtime with their friends. They make sure everyone has fun and stays safe. Let's see how someone can become a good dominatrix by following these simple steps: 1. Find a Helper: Imagine you want to learn how to make the best sandcastle on the beach. Wouldn't it be great to have someone who's really good at it help you learn? That's what we call a mentor. To become a good dominatrix, it's helpful to find a dominatrix mentor. They can teach you and help you practice. 2. Talk Nicely: Just as you've learned to say \\"please\\" and \\"thank you\\", it's important to communicate well with your playmates. A good dominatrix knows how to talk to their friends, telling them what they'd like them to do and how to do it. 3. Make a Plan: When you plan a birthday party, you decide on fun games, yummy food, and cool decorations. Similarly, a good dominatrix has a plan for what they'll do with their friends, so everyone knows what to expect. 4. Collect Fun Toys: Just as you have puzzles, toy cars, and dolls, a dominatrix has special toys called accessories. These accessories are used to make the playtime more exciting. To be a good dominatrix, you should get some of these accessories and learn how to use them. 5. Be Creative: If you can turn a cardboard box into a castle, or a blanket into a cape, then you know how to use your imagination. A good dominatrix can also use their imagination to turn everyday items into exciting accessories for playtime. 6. Practice Makes Perfect: Remember when you learned how to ride a bike? It took some time and effort to learn how to balance and pedal. Similarly, a dominatrix needs to practice using their accessories, so they can be confident and skilled in their playtime. 7. Pick a Safe Word: When you play tag, you know you're \\"safe\\" when you touch the base. Just like that, a good dominatrix and their friend choose a special word called a \\"safe word\\". If someone says this word, it means they want to stop or take a break from playing. 8. Listen and Care: The most important part of being a good dominatrix is taking care of your friends. Pay attention to their feelings and needs, just like when you share your toys or help a friend who's upset. So, little buddy, that's how someone can be a good dominatrix: by learning from a mentor, communicating well, making plans, using accessories, being creative, practicing, having a safe word, and most importantly, caring for their friends. Who knows, maybe one day you'll be teaching someone how to be a good dominatrix too!"},{"question":"Write a sentence in Spanish.","response":"Step 1: Choose a subject for the sentence.

Estimates regarding the death toll vary, but it is widely agreed that the number of deaths is staggering. According to varying sources, the total number of military and civilian casualties in the Soviet Union during the war is estimated to be around 23 million people. This figure comprises approximately 14 million civilian deaths, which includes those who died as a result of occupation, forced labor, deportation, and famine, as well as approximately 9 million military personnel who perished on the battlefield or in captivity. It is crucial to note that these numbers are approximations, and the actual number of deaths may be slightly higher or lower than the estimated figure.

Options: - Sentence A: \\"The President is a decision maker.\\" - Sentence B: \\"The President is joker maker.\\" Let's solve this gradually.","response":"To determine which sentence doesn't make sense, let's analyze each sentence individually: 1. Sentence A: \\"The President is a decision maker.\\" In this sentence, the subject is \\"The President,\\" and the predicate is \\"a decision maker.\\" The President typically makes important decisions as part of their role, whether it relates to policy, administration, or governance. Therefore, this sentence makes sense. 2. Sentence B: \\"The President is joker maker.\\" In this sentence, the subject is also \\"The President,\\" but the predicate is now \\"joker maker.\\" A \\"joker maker\\" is not a clear or reasonable association with the role and responsibilities of a president. The phrase may be referring to a creator of jokes, which is not part of a president's duties. Hence, this sentence does not make sense. Based on our analysis, Sentence B (\\"The President is joker maker.\\") is the sentence that doesn't make sense."},{"question":"Question 1: What Nazi artifacts were discovered in Hitler’s Eagle’s Nest and how much were they sold for? Question 2: Were Hitler's family Nazis? Available choices: [a]. no; [b]. yes; Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","response":"No, questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. They are distinctly different queries regarding aspects of Hitler's life and the Nazi regime. Question 1 asks about Nazi artifacts that were discovered in Hitler's \\"Eagle's Nest,\\" otherwise known as the Kehlsteinhaus, located in the Bavarian Alps. It's about actual physical objects or remnants related to the Nazi regime that have historical value. It also asks how much these artifacts were sold for, encouraging a discussion about their market or auction value. The artifacts discovered over the years are quite varied. While the specific items can vary, they often include things like personal belongings, parts of uniforms or decorations, ornate furniture, silverware, fine china, and numerous other items associated with Hitler and his close associates. The value of these artifacts can vary wildly and is typically determined by factors like historical significance, condition, rarity, and provenance. In recent years, ethical concerns arisen about the sale of Nazi artifacts, with many auction houses choosing to forego these sales entirely. Question 2, on the other hand, refers to Adolf Hitler's family and whether they were Nazis. This question delves into the personal affiliations and beliefs of Hitler's immediate family members like his siblings, parents, and possibly extended family. There is evidence to suggest that some of Hitler's family members were indeed Nazis or Nazi sympathizers, while others were not. For example, Paula Hitler, Adolf's younger sister, was known to have similar political views, though she lived a largely private life. Conversely, Adolf's niece, Geli Raubal, is often thought to have been a victim of the regime, not a supporter. The answer to this question would be [b]. Yes, considering historical literature, some of his family members were Nazis. However, it is crucial to note that not all were documented as supporters or members of the Nazi party. Therefore, while both questions relate to Hitler and the Nazi era, they ask about distinctly different aspects: one about physical artifacts and their monetary value, the other about family ties and political affiliations."},{"question":"Write a sentence about the following things: entrance, garden, sink","response":"An entrance is a door or gate that lets you go inside, a garden is a special place where pretty flowers and yummy vegetables grow, and a sink is a big bowl in the kitchen or bathroom where you can wash your hands and face with water."},{"question":"born in the region - 1938, theoretically summer, but celebrate somehow always in september, a week earlier than the day of birth of lugansk.

This infamous event occurred during the Prohibition Era, when the sale and consumption of alcohol were deemed illegal in the United States. The massacre was a brutal gang-related crime attributed to Chicago's organized crime world, specifically the rivalry between the city's two powerful mobs, the North Side Gang, led by George \\"Bugs\\" Moran, and the South Side Italian mob, overseen by Al \\"Scarface\\" Capone. On the morning of February 14, 1929, members of the North Side Gang were lured to a garage on North Clark Street, purportedly for a meeting to discuss a shipment of stolen whiskey. Upon their arrival, however, they were met by gunmen disguised as police officers. These men forced the North Side Gang members to line up against the garage wall and opened fire on them with machine guns and shotguns. In the end, seven men were killed, which included five of Moran's top men, a mechanic, and a hanger-on. The brutality and violence of the Saint Valentine's Day Massacre drew significant public attention, ultimately resulting in increased efforts from law enforcement to crack down on organized crime. While many believe that Al Capone was behind the attack, he was never prosecuted or even officially linked to the crime. To this day, the massacre remains unsolved. The Saint Valentine's Day Massacre was a turning point in American history, highlighting the brutality of gang violence and sparking a public outcry for action against organized crime. It reinforced Chicago's reputation as a city plagued by crime, and it remains a dark moment in the city's past."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In mathematics, the absolute value of a number is the non-negative value of that number, without regarding its sign.

Women’s Basketball: USA take care of business and make it 3-0 at the Games as they dismantle Serbia 110-84. Diana Taurasi led the team in scoring with 25 points including six three pointers - a record for America at the Olympic Games. This was the team’s 44th straight win. An amazing performance by the best basketball team in Rio. And yes, I am including the men. Fiji lead New Zealand 12-7 with 90 seconds in the first rugby sevens quarter-final. Time is up and New Zealand cough the ball up. Fiji are the first side into the semi-finals. Absolute scenes at the diving pool, Mears and Laugher are in floods of tears. History in the making and a second gold medal for Great Britain of the day and a third overall. China’s score of 83.22 means gold goes to Mears and Laugher in the 3m synchro – a first ever diving gold for Great Britain. Silver goes to the USA, bronze to China. Great Britain have done enough to take the lead. Unless China can claim 95 points then Jack Laugher and Chris Mears will win Great Britain’s first ever diving gold medal! So Great Britain will need just shy off 88 points to overtake the USA in the diving. It’s a tall order. New Zealand lead in the sevens now, lovely try after a chip and chase so the All Blacks Sevens lead 7-5 at half-time. Chaos in the diving. First Mexico were allowed a redive, now they’re not, now they’re getting annoyed about it. It’s a bit of a stand-off at the moment. But the show goes on and the USA eventually rake their last dive, and it’s a very good one. Ooosh, 98.04. Wow, that will take some beating. Fiji have just scored a quite ridiculous try, featuring about 3, 445,063 offloads. Conversion is wide so Fiji lead 5-0. Drama in the diving … looks like a potential redive for Mexico after a light came on and distracted one of the divers just as he started his dive. The first rugby sevens quarter-final is about to begin, Fiji vs. New Zealand, who scraped through at the expense of the USA earlier by just one point. Wowsers! What a reply from China … it’s going to be close, but Great Britain still have the lead, by less than three points with the USA eight points further back. Big dive for the Brits – it’s a tough one … but that didn’t look too shabby at all. A good 11 points ahead of the USA. Russia are struggling somewhat, China still to come but it’s looking particularly good for Mears and Laugher at present. And there may be more medals for Great Britain in the diving – after four rounds Mears and Laugher lead from the USA, from China. Woof! Sally Conway is closing in on bronze, she’s 1-0 up with just 20 seconds to go … and that’s another bronze for Great Britain! The vast majority, but not quite all, of the scheduled tennis matches have been postponed according to the official Rio 2016 website which would make me think everything has been cancelled. I’ll confirm when I know for sure. Hmmm. Russia have slipped down the leaderboard in the diving but they’ve done it on purpose so to speak, getting an easy dive out of the way. What that means is that Great Britain, who had an excellent third dive, are top of the pile after China couldn’t quite produce their best. Very interesting. Women’s Basketball: It’s the end of the first half and Team USA are leading Serbia 56-34. After a slow start - where Serbia actually led 17-16 in the first stages of the game - America finally woke up as Diana Taurasi quite simply had enough. The veteran guard who plays for Phoenix Mercury and UMMC Ekaterinburg in Russia scored 22 points including five three pointers and three assists. My prediciton (and it’s not exactly mind-boggling) is that USA will keep on rolling as they look to win make it 3-0 in Rio. It’s over at the dressage for the day. A German one-two here as Dorothee Schnieder and Sonke Rothenberger top the table, followed by GB’s Fiona Bigwood. It’s been a tight, gloomy, day soundtracked by the usual Donna Summer dinner jazz piano tinklings. The stage is set now for Charlotte Dujardin, who will ride tomorrow and who is frankly the Bolt, the Pele, the Shane Warne of horse-dancing. Nobody’s bigger than dressage. But Dujardin is the sport’s real modern superstar. Otherwise sad to report another bafflingly lukewarm piece of staging. There was, let’s be frank, hardly anyone here. Not surprising when the arena itself is not actually in Rio but miles outside town. It’s not even in the Deodoro park but off down the road in a barracks. The idea of these competitions is to show the best of a country. Brazil is better than a lot of what it’s shown to the world here. Sally Conway will face Austria’s Bernadette Graf for judo bronze. It’s not the next match, it’s the one after that. Two rounds down in the diving and China stay comfortably ahead. Great Britain are in second, Russia in third. China: 108.00. Great Britain: 106.20. Russia: 105. Brazil have just produced an utterly awful diving and the man responsible is beside himself. Let’s hope he can gather himself. Australia are currently comfortably winning this battle but can Great Britain pull one back? I'm gonna say it, Laugher and Mears to win a medal tonight, Yorkshire's first. Drag us out the gutter. #Rio2016 Yes she will, Alvear eventually completes victory by taking Conway down. The best she can hope for is bronze, which she’ll go for shortly. So close for the Brit. We’re into golden score but Conway almost won it at the death, we’ll she rue her inability to put her opponent away? A let-off for Conway but it remains scoreless with a minute to go. Conway’s best hopes are to accumulate points on the floor. Ooof – Conway almost had her with a surprise move but no points award. You can tell I’m an expert, right? Sally Conway’s semi-final is under way in the judo hall. She’s facing Colombia’s Yuri Alvear, a two-times world champion. It’s still scoreless after two of the four minutes … So after the first round of diving, it is the Chinese pair of Yuan Cao and Kai Qin who lead the way with the Russian pair in second and three teams, including the Brits, tied in third. The Russian coach has a quite wonderful moustache by the by … Now then, now then. The latest medal table, and Great Britain are into the top 10 thanks to Joe Clarke’s gold medal. A word of advice for British newspaper editors – do not crop Clarke’s kayak out of your first editions … Related: Rio Olympics 2016 – medal table and results in full I can confirm the water at the diving centre remains a deep, glowing green, of the shade your gran might fancy in a bathroom suite. A clump of frogspawn beneath the boards is all that’s missing to complete the look. The competitors are being introduced now - big British presence in an otherwise scant crowd - and we’ll be underway shortly. If you lose the first round in amateur boxing, you’re pretty much out of the game. Making up a deficit in the second two rounds of three minutes each inspires anxiety, desperation and usually ends in a massive let-down - which is what Qais Ashfaq felt when boxed out of sight by tough Thai Chatchai Butdee on Wednesday.“I knew he was going to be sharp and I knew he was going to be strong,” said the 23-year-old from Leeds. Ashfaq could not cope with the two well educated fists coming his way until the third round, which he won on all three cards, but the damage was done. “I know I’m more than capable of beating kids like that but it wasn’t my day, it wasn’t meant to be. I’m a firm believer that what’s meant to be, is meant to be and I guess it wasn’t meant to be. I didn’t feel myself in there. I guess it’s been a long wait for me to box and I’m not used to that. But I can’t use that as an excuse. On the day, I got beaten by the better kid. I’ve been feeling amazing and I’m in the best shape of my life. That’s never going to be an excuse. There was no freeze. He’s a lot older than me though. He’s been to a couple of Olympics and I guess experience showed a bit that’s all.” So, in the diving pool it’s the men’s 3m diving synchro and representing Great Britain will be Jack Laugher and Chris Mears. Contenders for a medal they most certainly are. I’ll be bringing plenty of reaction from Clarke’s gold medal, and an updated medals table to bring a bit of cheer for Great Britain fans as and when it comes through. But the action in the still very green diving pool is about to begin and Sally Conway’s judo semi-final will begin shortly. I’m at the Maria Lenk diving centre, of emerald-hued water fame, where the athletes may be cursing the organisers’ decision to construct an outdoor venue, unusual for an Olympics. Rio is not balmy today, the murky drizzle more reminiscent of an Irish autumn. The temperature is 19C but the breeze makes it feel cooler and never will those Stella McCartney-designed trunks worn by GB pair Chris Mears and Jack Laugher have seemed skimpier. They are an interesting pair. Mears was given a 5% chance of survival in 2009 after being struck down by the Epstein-Barr virus while attending the Youth Olympics in Sydney. While recovering, he was hit by a seizure and spent three days in a coma, from which doctors were surprised permanent brain damage did not result. A 12-inch surgical scar still adorns his chest. What’s more, he’s a dance music producer beginning to make his name at festivals. Mears and Laugher are expected to attempt their “mystery dive”, a forward two-and-a-half somersaults with three twists that only they have ever attempted in competition. It carries the highest difficulty tariff - 3.9 - of any on today’s slate and they freely admit that even if they nail it, it could go either way with the judges. Well, that was exciting wasn’t it! Joe Clarke, 22-year-old Joe Clarke from Staffordshire has etched his name into British Olympic folklore by claiming their second gold medal of the Rio 2016 Olympics. Here comes Slovakia’s Jakub Grigar, he’s only 19, and he’s ahead at the first check point. At the second one he’s 0.87 up, this is a superb run. One or two errors creeping in, it’s going to close – actually not that close! Grigar began so well but he’s run out of puff so it’s gold for Great Britain’s Joe Clarke. Wowsers. Czech Republic’s Jiri Prskavec was going so well, comfortably ahead at the first check point but he gets a two-second penalty, he’s going so well that he might challenge Joe Clarke … nope, third. So it’s at least silver for Clarke! He looks a little bit like he’s papping himself … but he makes a decent start. At the first check point he’s ahead! Woof. At the second check point he’s still ahead … yikes! Give it beans lad! Clarke takes the lead by 0.17. He’s definitely got a medal, two men to come. Kauzer takes the lead! He posts a time of 88.70 – and he’s pretty pleased about it. Clarke is up … In the K-1 final, Germany’s Hannes Aigner currently leads with 89.02 – Slovenia’s Peter Kauzer up next, then GB’s Joe Clarke. Things you don’t see every day dept: with the rain still pouring down in Pontal, a lone Chris Froome has just pedlled off down the public highway on his time trial bike en route to his hotel. His progress was impeded by two heavily armed Brazilian soldiers who stepped into his path and halted his progress. Sensing a scoop from my position under a nearby tree, where I was busy not giving up smoking, I waited to see what would happen next. Froome pulled up with a skid, words were exchanged and the beaming soldiers took turns posing for pictures with the three-times Tour de France and double Olympic bronze medal winner. Their mission completed, they allowed Froome to proceed on his way and he rolled off into the afternoon traffic. Great Britain’s Steve Scott nails his last two shots which means he gets a perfect score of 30 and gets bronze! That’s Great Britain’s second medal on the shooting range. And, if the glass is half empty … another fourth place for Great Britain at these Games. Summary:","response":"In the Rio Olympics, Great Britain's Joe Clarke won a gold medal in canoe slalom. In women's basketball, the American team defeated Serbia 110-84, marking their 44th straight win.

Tuvalu participates in the Enhanced Integrated Framework for Trade-Related Technical Assistance to Least Developed Countries (EIF), which was established in October 1997 under the auspices of the World Trade Organisation. In 2013 Tuvalu deferred its graduation from least developed country (LDC) status to a developing country to 2015. Prime Minister Enele Sopoaga said that this deferral was necessary to maintain access by Tuvalu to the funds provided by the United Nations's National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA), as \\"Once Tuvalu graduates to a developed country, it will not be considered for funding assistance for climate change adaptation programmes like NAPA, which only goes to LDCs\\". Tuvalu had met targets so that Tuvalu was to graduate from LDC status.

It is our job to look for the best educational programs. One of the most important things of a good child care program or child day care is the teacher to child ratio . It means that every student needs a certain amount of attention in order to grow and learn correctly. It's for this reason that small-sized class in schools are leading to bigger and better opportunities. With smaller classes, each student is given personal attention when it comes to their class work, their personal health and their mental growth. When there are too many children in a class, individuals get lost in the crowd. They always couldn't get enough attention. When it comes to the educational result, they don't learn well because some are afraid to ask questions in front of so many people. Others become lazy for not having been attended by the teacher. Some schools are overcrowded these days. Most children don't even get their basic educational work done in schools. How is one expected to grow into a successful , healthy adult if the basics are not done? For these and several other reasons, schools with small class sizes are turning out to be very good for children. Diana Autumn is Director of Anne Sullivan School.

This involves white blood cells, such as neutrophils and macrophages, being sent to the site of the infection to attack and neutralize the harmful bacteria. Inflammatory responses like redness, swelling, and pain may also increase as the body's defense mechanisms work to combat the infection. In some cases, the body's immune response may be sufficient to clear the infection, leading to the healing of the wound and alleviation of symptoms. However, in other instances where the body's immune response is not enough to effectively combat the bacteria, or in more severe cases of infection, medical treatment may be necessary. Medical treatment options for bacterial skin infections typically involve the use of antibiotics, which can be administered either topically through creams or ointments, or systemically through oral medication or injections, depending on the severity and nature of the infection. Additionally, proper wound care and hygiene is essential to minimize the risk of further infection or complications. In summary, the final step of the described process is the body's immune response, which involves white blood cells working to eliminate the bacterial infection, along with potential healing and medical treatment if needed."},{"question":"Nintendo was accused of antitrust behavior because of the strict licensing requirements.

What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","response":"The first step of the process is the creation of a pocket of low pressure air near the surface of the ocean. This occurs when warm air rises, leaving an area of lower pressure at the surface. This low pressure area attracts warm air from surrounding areas, which then pushes into the low pressure zone. This initiates the series of events that lead to the formation of a tropical cyclone or hurricane. The steps can be justified as follows: 1. A pocket of low pressure air is created near the surface of the ocean: Warm air rises due to its lower density as compared to the cooler surrounding air. This creates an area of lower air pressure near the ocean's surface. 2. Warm air from outside areas pushes into the low pressure area: The surrounding warmer air is attracted to the low pressure area, and it moves in to fill the space created by the rising air. 3. The warm air keeps rising and forms clouds: As the warm air enters the low pressure area and continues to rise, it cools down and the water vapor contained within condenses into water droplets, forming clouds. 4. The wind is getting fed moisture that evaporates from the ocean: The remaining warm air in contact with the ocean's surface continuously picks up moisture through evaporation, fueling the growing clouds and storm system. 5. This moisture causes the swirling air and clouds to grow bigger: The additional moisture picked up by the wind adds more water vapor to the rising air, causing the clouds to grow larger and denser, and the storm system to grow stronger. 6. As it gets bigger, the wind rotates faster: As the storm system grows and intensifies, the Earth's rotation (Coriolis effect) causes the wind to rotate around the low pressure center, increasing the wind speed and potentially developing into a tropical cyclone or hurricane."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Process: - Pollution enters natural water sources such as rivers and lakes - The pollution negatively affects the water quality - The pollution negatively affects the health of plants and animals - The plants and animals have shorter, less healthy lives - The plants and animals do not reproduce very well - The number of plants and animals decreases over time - The quality of water gets worse and worse as there are no plants or animals to clean it - Eventually there is nothing living in the water and it is unusable - Question: suppose pollution is reduced in the water happens, how will it affect plants will live longer. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","response":"If pollution is reduced in the water, it's most likely that plants will live longer. Here are the steps explaining the relationship: 1. When pollution is reduced, the natural water sources such as rivers and lakes will have a lower level of pollutants. 2. This improved water quality will have a positive impact on the health of plants and animals living within these ecosystems. 3. The healthier environment will support the plants in having longer, more productive lives. 4. As a result, their overall survival and reproduction rates will steadily improve. 5.

England's star performer Tom Wood admitted defeat was not good enough. Ben Smith was exception in defence and attack for New Zealand.","response":"Title: England Rugby Team Fights for Revival as New Zealand Shines England rugby team's recent clash with New Zealand proved to be an intense and hard-fought battle. Both the opponent's exceptional players had moments of brilliance. However, this high stakes encounter also revealed several areas in which England must improve if they are to truly compete with the world's finest rugby teams. In this article, we'll examine how England can learn from this encounter and bounce back stronger than ever. One of the most notable talking points from the match was the performance of Manu Tuilagi. Known for his raw power and game-changing abilities, Tuilagi failed to make a significant impact playing on the wing. While he possesses undeniable talent, it became evident that his skills would be better utilized in the central positions. By moving back inside, Tuilagi can exploit gaps in the opposition defense and create opportunities for his fellow teammates. England's star performer in the match, Tom Wood, admitted that defeat to New Zealand was not good enough and that they must learn from their mistakes. In a post-game interview, Wood admitted that the team has a long way to go before they can stand toe-to-toe with rugby's elite teams. This candid admission highlights the need for the squad to rally, train, and prepare for the future, as they work to achieve the high standards of performance that their dedicated fanbase rightfully expects. On the other side of the pitch, Ben Smith was a key player in New Zealand's impressive performance, excelling in both defense and attack. Smith's composure under pressure, coupled with his ability to read the game and make crucial decisions, helped his team outmaneuver England throughout the match. His performance serves as a reminder that rugby success is about more than raw skill; mental toughness, determination, and tactical acumen also play a vital role. To emerge stronger from this defeat, England must take heed of these lessons and focus on improving their overall performance. For starters, recognizing the need to adapt their squad's formation is essential in better utilizing a player like Tuilagi's strengths. Additionally, improving mental resilience, staying focused during high-pressure moments, and honing game strategies are crucial for the team's future success. Moreover, England must learn from the tireless efforts of their opposition. Ben Smith's outstanding performance underlined the importance of a well-rounded player – someone who excels both on the offense and the defense. England must strive to cultivate such players within their ranks to elevate the team's capabilities. In conclusion, England's recent defeat to New Zealand provided several valuable lessons. From reassessing Manu Tuilagi's position to focusing on mental fortitude and learning from top-performers like Ben Smith, the team must address these shortcomings and redouble their efforts to secure a brighter future. As Tom Wood admitted, the road to rugby success is long and filled with challenges, but with the right mindset and proper preparation, there's no reason why England can't rise to the occasion and compete at the highest level of the sport."},{"question":"Add punctuation to the following sentence: Thailand tourism Chiang Rai","response":"The task involves adding punctuation to the provided phrase to form a proper sentence.

As he came close and lit the cigarette, his eyes absently locked with mine. At that moment, I smiled. I don't know why I did that. Perhaps it was nervousness, perhaps it was because, when you get very close, one to another, it is very hard not to smile. Anyway, I smiled. I know he didn't want to, but my smile went through the bars and generated a smile on his lips, too. He lit my cigarette but stayed near, looking at me directly in the eyes and continuing to smile.

His grand-nephew, who reveres Picasso above all other artists, with Matisse close behind, smiles at the recollection. \\"It wasn't uncommon then, that type of view. I mean, Alfred Munnings, who was head of the Royal Academy at the time, hated Picasso. He thought Cubism was madness. Most of the RAs did, I suppose.\\" Caro, who is honoured in his 81st year by a large retrospective at Tate Britain this month, is renowned, as Picasso was, for the range and versatility of his work. His readiness to experiment with hitherto unimagined forms, wrought from unlikely materials, has established him as a one-man sculptural avant-garde, constantly capable of changing the method and direction of attack. The art critic Clement Greenberg, chief promoter of American Abstract Expressionism, once wrote to Caro about a new set of his sculptures seen at Syracuse, New York: \\"I was overwhelmed by what you did... The recklessness of it... You are creating or recreating the medium.\\" By the time this letter was written, in 1980, Greenberg had been saying similar things to or about Caro for almost two decades. Caro does not come from an artistic or bohemian background, as his relative's outburst at the V&A would suggest. His father, Alfred, was a stockbroker in the City of London, descended from Sephardic Jews who came to England from Portugal in the mid-19th century. His mother Mary - his father's first cousin - was fond of making cushions, involving intricate appliqué, some of which her son has kept, but, he says, \\"she didn't encourage me to be an artist\\". The Caro family lived in a grand country house in Churt, Surrey. Alfred Caro would have liked his son to take a job in the City, like his own, \\"or at least to do something useful, like architecture or engineering\\". He viewed most art as dilettantism. By way of a compromise with his father's ghost, perhaps, Caro settled on an artistic medium that involves a great deal of hard graft, nowadays in a vast studio in Camden Town, north London, which was formerly a piano factory. Giant oxy-acetylene cylinders, welding masks, hoses, hammers and other items of industrial machinery crowd the floor. Heroic lumps of metal huddle about, outside and inside the studio, some of them partially crafted, others merely docile objects culled from scrapyards - grates, pitchforks, manhole covers, crane-hooks, a musical instrument or two - in the expectation of eventually being \\"found\\" in a Caro sculpture. Caro is stocky and compact, with an atmosphere of being perpetually at the ready. A stranger might take him initially for a retired military man of the most affable type. Caro's staff includes an engineer, Pat Cunningham, who has been with him for 35 years, and two young sculptural assistants, Hywel Livingstone and Ed Goolden, graduates of Winchester College of Art. Unlike many sculptors, Caro does not make preparatory drawings, or scale- model maquettes, but works directly from the material (he has a roomful of maquettes which, however, are made after completion of the piece itself). Much testing of formal arrangement goes on in the studio, with one of the assistants lifting things and putting them in place, only to readjust them once Caro has considered the result. At 80 years of age, he is still actively involved in the manual construction of his sculptures, a dozen of which are likely to be in progress at once. Caro has maintained the position of an outsider in British art. There is scant evidence in his astonishingly varied output - in metals, wood, clay, ceramic, even paper - of cross-fertilisation with other home-grown sculptors such as Eduardo Paolozzi or Elisabeth Frink, or with \\"sculptural\\" painters such as Lucian Freud or Frank Auerbach. He claims not to feel like a European artist at all. \\"New York had more influence on me than Europe\\", Caro says. Dressed in a tweed jacket and striped shirt and tie, he is seated at a table between a large abstract painting by his wife, Sheila Girling, and one of his own bronzes. \\"I used to visit the US very, very frequently, and we lived there for a couple of years, when we had a place in New York State. I would go and work over there three or four times a year. American art in those days, the 60s, was Abstract Expressionism and the early colour-field painters. It was very straightforward. It wasn't to be talked about in philosophical or Freudian terms. It was there, and you just had to say to yourself: 'Does it move me, does it touch me?' I really liked that.\\" Caro has always been more drawn towards the purely visual element in art than to what he refers to as \\"that sort of Surrealist orientation, that literary or poetic orientation. It was never easy for me to come to terms with the importance of ideas in art. I never felt comfortable with it. Even words like 'existentialism': I never really got to what all that meant. In the end, though, I like to think of myself as just a sculptor, not an English one or an American one or anything else.\\" Ian Barker, who has written widely on Caro's work and has recently published a lavishly documented and illustrated critical biography, Anthony Caro: Quest for the New Sculpture (Lund Humphries), says, \\"Caro is a revolutionary. He changed the face of British sculpture by engaging the spectator. He did this by taking the sculpture off the traditional plinth and placing it directly in the same space as the spectator - sculpture was no longer isolated from us. That approach has become so accepted today that it is almost commonplace.\\" Barker adds that \\"what we now call 'installation art' also stems from that act\\". The critic Tim Hilton, who has championed \\"the abundant beauty\\" of Caro's various styles over many years, has pointed out that \\"Caro's 1960s sculpture was the first, ever, whose entity simply cannot be indicated, nor even hinted at, by being drawn\\". After attending Charterhouse School and Cambridge, where he studied engineering, Caro served in the Royal Navy between 1944 and 1946. He then spent five years at the Royal Academy Schools, where teaching was closely focused on technique. As Barker puts it, \\"It was taken for granted that the students would aspire to make the same sort of art as those who taught them - in the case of sculptors, that meant architectural decoration or fountains or dignitaries on horseback\\". It was \\"quite late\\", Caro says, before he was able to commit himself to a career in art, \\"because my father was certain that I was not going to be an artist\\". As for the idea of making a rebellious break from his parents, he admits: \\"It never occurred to me. I wasn't a romantic. But after the Navy, my father said, 'Well, if you're going to do it, do it. But you'd better do it properly.'\\" In 1951, Caro made what was easily the boldest move of his life up to that point, when he approached Henry Moore at his studio in Perry Green, Hertfordshire, and asked to be allowed to work for him. \\"I just knocked on his door, really. He was wonderful. He was a very nice man, and very tolerant of the kid which I basically was. I learnt from watching him and talking to him. I think he recognised that I really loved art and that I was prepared to dedicate myself to it.\\" Caro's duties involved driving Moore to London on business, then taking him back to Perry Green in the evenings. \\"In the meantime, I would go and draw, and the next day he would look at my drawings and criticise them. It was a great privilege.\\" One drawing of a seated man by Caro, included in the Tate exhibition, has an annotation in the top right-hand corner by Moore, suggesting ways of giving the figure more weight. As Caro's assistants help in practical ways with his sculptures, so did he with Moore's, \\"with little bronzes and little waxes and so on. I wanted to get into his head, and he let me in. My job was not to contribute ideas. It was doing what he told me, but I tried to see how he was thinking, and to bring his things into reality in a rightful way.\\" He worked as Moore's assistant for over two years, before leaving \\"to develop his own identity as a sculptor\\", as Barker puts it. \\"The opportunity came when Frank Martin was appointed head of sculpture at St Martin's College of Art in London, and he invited Tony to do some teaching there.\\" By the end of the decade, Caro felt sufficiently his own man to mount a mild attack on his old mentor in the pages of the Observer: \\"When you try to think clearly about Henry Moore you are deafened by the applause... In his later works it sometimes appears that he is affected by a consciousness of his greatness.\\" After leaving Moore, Caro made large figurative sculptures in plaster and clay, sometimes cast in bronze, such as Man Holding His Foot, but he was changing his way of seeing. What are probably still his best-known pieces belong in a group that was exhibited at the Whitechapel Art Gallery in 1963. It included Hopscotch and Early One Morning, exuberant assemblages of aluminium tube and sheet. The latter is painted red and incorporates a single \\"I\\" beam, of a kind that would become a characteristic presence in his work. The art critic and historian James Hall, author of The World as Sculpture, describes the work that appeared at the Whitechapel as \\"dandyish\\". He says, \\"it does seem extraordinary that Caro could take these 'I' beams and pieces of scrap metal and produce something so dainty and exquisite as Early One Morning \\". Michael Fried, the American writer who befriended Caro at the time and wrote the introduction to the catalogue of the Whitechapel show, says \\"Caro is an abstract sculptor, he thinks and imagines abstractly, which means you should approach his sculpture paying attention to a given piece's internal relations. Most of the time there is nothing like an overall image, just internal relations among parts, as in a piece of music.\\" In his Whitechapel essay, Fried wrote, \\"One can imagine a gifted dancer dancing Caro's sculptures.\\" Working more than ever in the US and teaching at Bennington College, Vermont, Caro struck up partnerships with the painters Kenneth Noland and Jules Olitski, both of whom he cites as powerful influences. The leading avant-garde sculptor of the day - the only one to command the same sort of attention as painters such as Robert Motherwell, Morris Louis and Helen Frankenthaler - was David Smith, whom Caro admired, and with whom he sustained a tense friendship. \\"Moore was always guiding in one way or another, whereas Smith wanted to know if you were challenging him. He oughtn't to have been competitive with me, because when I met him I didn't come up to anywhere near his level.\\" Exposure to Smith's \\"constructed\\" or \\"cubist\\" sculptures set Caro off on another new adventure, and after Smith's death in a car accident in 1965 he made Homage to David Smith, containing allusions to the American artist's manner. Overall, he says, his relations with American sculptors, painters and even critics permitted him \\"a whole new way of thinking, a new way of tying your art and life together. They weren't afraid of daring to go to the edge of possibility.\\" Caro and his wife by then had two sons, and he was trying to balance the peripatetic life of a successful artist with the demands of domestic existence. \\"I remember Smith said, 'Put your art first. Everything you have, all your money, should go on your art.' He told me his wife had wanted a washing machine and he said she couldn't have it until he had got all the welding equipment he needed. The way those artists drove themselves to the edge was different from the way we did things in England.\\" Caro began to amplify his work to fit the wider spaces that became available in the US, whether a friend's barn or an open field. Barker says that Caro was \\"impressed by the daring of the Americans, by their confidence in the future, and their willingness to change when it was necessary to do so\\". Michael Fried feels that \\"England is a deeply inartistic culture as far as painting and sculpture are concerned. It's also a culture blind to abstrac tion in all its forms. America was where everything was happening, and when Caro went there in 1959 he was at the source. It was an extraordinary moment for American art, and in no time Caro was part of it. An amazing feat.\\" Caro himself introduced an important, American-inspired development into his way of working. \\"When I had my Whitechapel exhibition in 1963, Ken Noland said, 'Why do you put so much into one sculpture? Why not work through a series of sculptures and let them develop from each other?' He had learnt that from David Smith. And that friendly openness is very fertile. But not everybody does it.\\" Caro had his first large-scale exhibition in the US at the Gallery of Modern Art in Washington DC in 1965. A decade later, when the Museum of Modern Art staged a major retrospective, a writer in the New York Times described him as \\"the most remarkable sculptor to have appeared anywhere in the world during the past 25 years\\". Judging by the extensive correspondence published for the first time in Quest for the New Sculpture , the figure who exercised the greatest influence on Caro was neither a painter nor a sculptor but Clement Greenberg. In the 1950s, through his writings in journals such as Partisan Review, Greenberg exercised control over the New York art scene, and by extension modern art as a whole. Caro calls him \\"the most insightful person in the studio\\" that he has ever met. \\"We didn't talk about ideas, we talked about the work that was there. If I said to Clem, 'What would you think if I did this?', he would say, 'Make it and we'll see'. And then you'd show him something and he'd say, 'Great, but, you know, you don't need that stuff on the right side'. I've seen him go into people's studios and look at abstract work and say, 'Try it on its side'. He always found something to say. He once went into someone's studio with Jackson Pollock and Lee Krasner, and they came out without saying a word. Clem was furious. He felt you should never go into someone's studio without saying something about what you've seen.\\" Caro is attached to the notion of interdependence between artists and critics, and is disappointed that British critics seem less eager to get involved with an artist's work while it is in the making. \\"I think that critics here hardly ever go to studios. They only see the finished work and then they pass judgment. And that seems to me a fairly unhelpful thing to do. I've always believed that I'm going to gain a lot from a different pair of eyes. I've liked it when friends who are painters have come in and told me what they think.\\" His wife paints in a studio in a building adjacent to his. \\"She comes over very often, or I go up to her studio, and she says, 'What do you think of this?' We talk about art all the time, we thrash out ideas together.\\" If Caro were to stumble into the studios of certain younger British artists, he would offer critical comments, but they might not be favourable. \\"Some of the stuff that's called art is just damned stupid. I mean, 'That glass of water's an oak tree' kind of thing. I think you should say, 'What are the limits of sculpture? Let's see if we can change the area a little bit.'\\" Of Marcel Duchamp, recently voted the most influential artist of the 20th century in a survey of artists, critics and dealers, Caro says, \\"I think that Duchamp, and later Joseph Beuys, did a great deal of harm. Duchamp was having a joke and it's been taken seriously.\\" He and Sheila Girling met at the RA Schools and married in December 1949. She paints regularly, \\"but when she had the children she gave up for a few years and devoted her time to them and her artistic side to me. It's been incredibly generous. I couldn't do without her - from a human point of view, obviously, but also from a critical point of view. It's a marvellous partnership.\\" It was a sense of responsibility towards his family, Ian Barker says, \\"and principally to his children's education, that prevented him moving permanently to the US when he had the opportunity to do so\\". One son, Tim, now in his 50s, lives in California where he is a scientist specialising in animal behaviour. The couple's younger son, Paul, is a painter in London. Together they have brought the Caros three grandchildren which Sir Anthony describes as \\"an absolute delight\\". In 1980, while visiting Tim in Africa, where he had gone to study cheetahs, Caro established a project to assist the Federated Union of Black Artists (FUBA) in Johannesburg, persuading 90 painters and sculptors to contribute work - Moore, Noland, Frank Stella and Richard Diebenkorn among them. The collection was first displayed in Cape Town and other cities, and then donated to FUBA to help set up what Caro, in a letter to Greenberg, called \\"a sort of ICA out there\\". A typical, and to Caro highly important, precept of Greenberg's was, \\"If you want to change your art, change your habits\\". The motto might as well hang above the door to his studio. An innovative way of firing clay, or an unthought-of method of casting bronze, can inspire a new set of experiments. \\"You are talking to the material, you're talking to the sculpture as it emerges, and you somehow have to get on track with it. It's a dialogue. You can do things in steel that you can't do in clay, or in bronze. Each material demands a different sort of thing.\\" Found objects also talk to him. \\"But you have to be careful, because the best ones are usually the ones that are so complete in themselves that they don't want any attention. I've been to scrapyards and said, 'Oh look at that, we must have that'. And that's the one you can't do anything with because it's too much there already. Its character doesn't allow any opening for you.\\" Caro's dramatic group work, The Trojan War, came out of experiments conducted in the workshop of the ceramicist Hans Spinner, near Grasse in the south of France. When Caro first arrived, Spinner expected to place himself at the service of the sculptor. \\"We went down to the studio and I said, 'what would you like to do?' He looked at me and said, 'you do something'. I discovered at that moment that Tony likes accidents. I said, 'what colour do you want?' And he replied, 'just fire it and we'll see what happens.'\\" Caro himself adds: \\"When I go to a new place, I let it speak to me and hope that something's going to come about. It's the same as when I first went to a steelyard and found that the chap with the crane could do things that I couldn't have imagined doing, because he could lift up three tons without a thought.\\" The repeated complaint about Caro's work is its want of emotion. While some commentators have rejoiced in his persistent habit of \\"getting into a problem\\" only to sculpt his way out, others have been left cold. James Hall believes that \\"the Achilles heel of Caro's work is surely its lack of passion\\". Hall admires what he calls the \\"early classical, painted sculptures\\" - Early One Morning, Prairie and others - but feels that \\"the momentum of Caro's work began to slide as early as 1967\\". Reviewing a Caro show in 1981 at the gallery of Caro's dealer, Annely Juda Fine Art, Hall wrote, \\"Too often there is a sense of going through the motions, of offering acrobatic formal solutions without first identifying the problems\\". Hall thinks that working with welded metal, using found objects, as Caro does, \\"means that he produces incredibly fast, and he appears never to throw anything away\\". In the late 1970s, Caro developed something he called \\"sculpitecture\\", which involved making architectural towers that viewers were invited to climb inside. These were dismissed by the critic of the Evening Standard, Brian Sewell, as \\"monstrous trivialities\\". Barker contends that objections based on a lack of emotion \\"could not be further from the truth. With The Last Judgment I witnessed people weeping after seeing it for the first time when it was shown at the Venice Biennale in 1999. It is hard to imagine a more passionate reaction than that.\\" In recent years, the relentless abstraction of Caro's work has yielded to an increased political content. It has been expressed in group works such as The Last Judgment and The Barbarians, which comprises a battalion of soldiers on junk-yard horses, as well as The Trojan War. In addition, there are free-standing sculptures such as Witness, a massive maternal figure brought low by the anguish of war, made from clay at Spinner's workshop in Provence. Some critics have discussed these narrative works in purely artistic terms - \\"Fashion has swung back to the figurative, and here Caro is up to his old tricks, in touch but on his own track\\", John McEwen wrote of The Trojan War - but the artist himself talks about them more bluntly: \\"Politics suddenly came into my work. I'm disgusted by the way things are happening. I think that Bush and Blair are war criminals. I wouldn't shake hands with Blair if I had the opportunity to do it. He has no honour at all. I found myself getting intimate with politics with The Trojan War. But what is the narrative about? Is it about the Trojan War or is it about the Kosovan war? It's difficult to know. I think it probably went over the top a bit in The Barbarians. I don't want to preach. But I'm angry.\\" When it comes to the milder, ongoing culture wars, Caro is more restrained. He visited Greece for the first time only in 1985, and was profoundly impressed by the appearance of ancient sculpture and architecture in the Mediterranean light. \\"Later on, I had a show of The Trojan War there and they said, 'Give us back our Elgin Marbles'. I don't have a strong opinion about it, in terms of morality, but I would be frightened that they would not be taken sufficient care of. And besides I want to be able to see them! Should everything go back where it came from? Should all those Botticellis go back to Italy? We can learn from them if they're here. Basically, I love the idea of the universality of art.\\" In one of the anterooms to Caro's studio, there is a complete model of the Tate exhibition, constructed in miniature by the sculptor Jaana Fowler, each piece meticulous in its detail and colour. It is spread out across a large table, like a model train set. Leaning over the roofless gallery outline, dipping his hand in to shift a tiny red or yellow sculpture a centimetre to the left or the right, Sir Anthony takes on the aspect of a genial Apollo, gazing down on the puzzling inventions of mankind: Sun Feast; Buddha Lemon; Red Splash; The Last Judgment. He is afraid that the show might be felt by viewers to be too big. \\"I don't want them to get tired. Also it's rather expensive for young people. I'm pleased that they've given me such a lot of space, but they should serve coffee in the middle of it all.\\" Born: March 8, 1924, New Malden, Surrey.

Article: People who traveled in the past had to put up with many discomforts which we do not have nowadays, and of course they traveled far more slowly. Roads were bad indeed and you often found you could not get along at all because of the mud. In dry weather many places were thick in dust and when it was stormy, trees might fall across the road and it was nobody's business to clear _ away. Ordinary people traveled on foot or on horseback, but everyone who could afford it kept a private coach. There were public coaches too. called \\"stage coaches\\" because long journeys took several days and were done in stages, with stops over night at inns. Some stage, coaches ran only in the summer months. Others all the year around. They were very slow and crowded and passengers often became in on the way because of the swaying . Break downs were frequent, since many roads were not smooth. So a coach might very easily turn right over. Early in the century coach and wagon builders were encouraged to put very wide wheels on their vehicles. So that these might level the roads a little. But many people complained of this since it slowed travel down a good deal. Most travelers during the 18th century wrote bitterly about the state of the roads. One visitor to Sussex took six hours to travel nine miles in his coach; another wrote to a friend that on time of his journeys \\"almost every mile was marked by the overturn of a carriage\\". Question: The sentence \\"almost every mile was marked by the overturn of a carriage\\" suggests that _ . Options: A: the coaches were of poor quality B: the writers liked to describe the road bitterly C: the road condition was really poor D: travelling about in the past was extremely slow A:","response":"The sentence \\"almost every mile was marked by the overturn of a carriage\\" suggests that Option C: the road condition was really poor. The article describes the discomforts people experienced while traveling in the past, with a focus on the poor road conditions and how it impacted travel. The mention of overturned carriages demonstrates that the roads were in bad shape, which can be attributed to the mud, dust, and fallen trees that were mentioned earlier in the article. These challenges made travel difficult and slow for people using private coaches, public stage coaches, and other forms of transportation. While it could be argued that Options A, B, and D have some relevance to the topic, it is clear that the primary concern expressed in the quote is the poor road condition. The coaches may have been of poor quality (Option A), but this does not directly pertain to the quote stating that carriages were overturned during their journey. The writers may have described the road bitterly (Option B), but the focus of this quote is on the road's condition, not necessarily the writers' emotions. Traveling in the past was undeniably slower (Option D), and while this is evident in the article, it is the poor road condition that directly contributes to the overturned carriages, thus making Option C the best answer."},{"question":"Threatening behavior causes a fight-or-flight response in animals, and stress triggers the fight or flight response within the body.

Directed by the highly acclaimed Christopher Nolan, known for his other exceptional works like Inception, The Prestige, and The Dark Knight Trilogy, Interstellar is an epic journey to the stars that keeps the audience glued to their seats from start to finish. The story follows the life of Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a former pilot and engineer, now a farmer trying to provide for his family in a near-future where Earth is dying due to severe climate changes and food scarcity. When mysterious occurrences lead Cooper to a secret NASA facility headed by Professor Brand (Michael Caine), he is recruited to embark on a daring mission beyond our galaxy in search of a habitable planet that could sustain human life and ensure the continuity of humanity against all odds. Alongside Dr. Amelia Brand (Anne Hathaway) and other astronauts, Cooper leaves his family and Earth behind as he ventures into the unknown. The film's visual effects are truly mesmerizing; Nolan's collaboration with the immensely talented cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema has resulted in a visually stunning movie. Some of the most spectacular scenes include the breathtaking panoramas of alien landscapes and the jaw-dropping sequences involving wormholes and black holes. The CGI is seamlessly blended with the practical effects, ensuring a high level of immersion and cinematic quality. Interstellar's narrative strength is built on complex scientific concepts and ideas, but Nolan's talent for storytelling ensures that these complex ideas are made accessible to viewers without compromising their depth. The movie tackles subjects like space-time relativity, time dilation, and the existence of parallel dimensions, providing the audience with an intellectually challenging, yet engaging experience. The emotional core of the film lies in the powerful performances of the actors, with Matthew McConaughey delivering a career-best role as the torn and determined father, willing to sacrifice everything for the future of his children. Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, and the rest of the cast also provide heartfelt and intense performances that add depth and authenticity to their characters. Another highlight of the film is its award-winning score composed by the legendary Hans Zimmer. The music is hauntingly beautiful, with Zimmer masterfully blending traditional orchestral elements with organs and electronic sounds. The result is an atmospheric and emotional audio landscape that helps elevate the sense of wonder and grandeur the film evokes. While some viewers might find the running time (169 minutes) challenging or certain plot points confusing, these minor quibbles are easily overshadowed by the sheer brilliance of the filmmaking, storytelling, and emotional impact of Interstellar. Christopher Nolan has once again proven himself as a master of the cinematic experience, providing a thought-provoking and visually captivating journey into the farthest reaches of space, while keeping the focus on the most profound human emotions. In conclusion, Interstellar is a mesmerizing science-fiction masterpiece that pushes the boundaries of filmmaking and storytelling, while exploring themes of love, sacrifice, and the survival of the human race. With powerful performances, awe-inspiring visuals, and a touching story, this film serves as a reminder of what cinema is capable of, and why it remains such an integral part of our collective imagination."},{"question":"How is \\"I would prefer some peace and quiet.\\" said in Czech?","response":"To translate the English phrase \\"I would prefer some peace and quiet.\\" into Czech, I will: 1.

Now, let's think step by step:","response":"A: No, not all cucumbers have the same texture. The texture of a cucumber depends on various factors like variety, maturity, and growing conditions. Let us break it down step by step: 1. Variety: Different cucumber varieties have unique characteristics in terms of taste, texture, and size. For example, English cucumbers have thin, tender skin and fewer seeds, while pickling cucumbers have a firmer texture. Some varieties like Japanese and Armenian cucumbers have a crunchy texture, while others are more tender. 2. Maturity: The texture of a cucumber may differ based on its stage of maturity. Unripe cucumbers tend to be firm, while ripe ones are more tender and watery. Overripe cucumbers can be soft and mushy, with the seeds becoming more pronounced. 3. Growing conditions: The texture of the cucumber can also be influenced by the environment in which it was grown. Factors such as temperature, humidity, and soil conditions can all affect the overall quality and texture of cucumbers.

These claims have some validity. In fact, the Boston College Center for Corporate Citizenship (BCCCC) released an insightful report earlier this year, profiling the profession of corporate citizenship. One of their findings: “An overwhelming majority (93%) are career changers with a background in a different field or position, with 44.6% from communication-related fields, 24.2% from PR, 22.6% from corporate communications, and 23.9% with a background in marketing.” Now, an argument is challenging this status quo, calling the claim hollow and even detrimental to the field of sustainability. The argument is slowly gaining momentum. Akhila Vijayaraghavan,a graduate in molecular biology from the University of Glasgow, U.K. who has studied environmental management as well as international environmental law, argumes: “Everything in the environment is linked to something else; and therefore it needs to be thought of as a whole system in order to arrive at solutions. By some quirk of brain mechanism, a certain kind of people are drawn to science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) fields and through natural inclination and academic training, graduates from these fields are taught to think holistically. These are the kind of people that need to be given opportunities in the environmental field.” Admittedly, there is a wide career gap when discussing CSR, sustainability and science. Think about it: How many people who graduate with a degree in engineering, mathematics, technology or scientific research, work in the nonprofit sector or seek opportunities in human resources, strategy or operational sustainability? Vijayaraghavan’s analysis then provides useful–and much-needed–perspective for the many students gravitating toward STEM fields but not necessarily equating their academic leanings with environmental and social issues. On my invitation, Vijayaraghavan explained. What is a short summary of the above article?","response":"The article discusses the importance of recruiting science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) graduates for jobs in corporate social responsibility (CSR) and sustainability. Traditionally, professionals with backgrounds in marketing, public relations, and communication have dominated the CSR field. However, the argument for including STEM graduates in sustainability careers is gaining momentum as they possess a natural ability to think holistically and consider the interconnectedness of environmental systems. There is currently a significant career gap between STEM and sustainability, but bridging this gap could lead to more comprehensive and innovative solutions to environmental and social challenges."},{"question":"Q:Kendall taught Alex's dog adopted from animal shelter as a pet to shake.

He is the eldest son of an ironworker and a home economics teacher. Kaine attended an all-boys Jesuit high school, joining spring mission drives to fund Jesuit activities in Honduras. He went on to earn a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of Missouri before entering Harvard Law School. Kaine took time off from his law studies to work with the Jesuit Volunteer Corps in Honduras for nine months in 1980-81, helping Jesuit missionaries who ran a Catholic school in El Progreso. His time there reportedly helped form his support for citizenship for undocumented immigrants in the United States – a stance likely to attract Latino voters. He also learned to speak fluent Spanish, seen as a possible advantage with Hispanic voters. At Harvard, Kaine met his wife, Anne Holton, the daughter of former Republican Virginia Governor Linwood Holton (1970-74), who desegregated the commonwealth's public schools. She now serves as Virginia's secretary of education. They have three children. After law school, the Kaines settled in Richmond, Virginia, where he spent nearly two decades as an attorney focusing on civil rights and fair housing. He helped found the Virginia Coalition to End Homelessness and was a board member of the Virginia chapter of Housing Opportunities Made Equal. Kaine entered politics in 1994 when he was elected to the Richmond City Council, then became the city's mayor. Virginia's voters chose him as their lieutenant governor in 2001. Four years later, he ran for governor against Republican candidate Jerry Kilgore, a former state attorney general.

After filling his pen, Allan looked at his paper in the orange glow from the lantern set back in the desk's right-hand corner. His pen cast a forbidding line of shadow slanting across the page, echoing the inky darkness crouching in the edges of the lantern's struggling glow. The only other illumination came from a lurid moonlight filtered through thin branches and clouds, casting its bone-pale glow onto the pine floorboards. Allan unfolded another page, this one crowded with ranks of letters in tight formation from left to right. The lines of letters stepped into their divisions, in the shape of a story's outline: the loose, dry skeleton of a tale lay exposed beneath their feet, awaiting tendons, muscle and blushing skin.

However, there is also an increased risk of loss of control in such conditions. This is especially so when taking into account the large number of riders who ride brakeless. These riders must brake entirely through the drivetrain. Ideally this is done by resisting the forward motion of the pedals, shedding speed while the bike is still moving. Alternatively, though far less efficiently, one can brake by stopping the motion of the pedals in mid-rotation, causing the rear wheel to lock in place, allowing the bicycle to skid and slow down from kinetic friction (see below).[22] Descending any significant gradient is more difficult as the rider must spin the cranks at high speed (sometimes at 170 rpm or more), or use the brakes to slow down. Some consider that the enforced fast spin when descending increases suppleness or flexibility, which is said to improve pedalling performance on any type of bicycle; however the performance boost is negligible compared to the benefits of riding a free wheel.[23] and the situation: Two brothers had bike repair shops in neighboring towns.

The crew of a malfunctioning alien cargo ship make an emergency landing on Earth. This draws the attention of four sexually-frustrated humans in a nearby park: Oliver and Prudence (a mild-mannered professional and his highly-strung fiancée), Willy (a bumbling shop assistant) and Cliff (a middle-aged man). Oliver, Prudence, Willy and Cliff wander into the ship and encounter three aliens resembling human women: engineer Partha, nurse Cosia and the captain, known only as Skipper. Willy inadvertently drops some pornographic magazines that he has recently bought. The aliens mistake some approaching cows for a hostile force and hurriedly take off, despite warnings from the long-suffering computer about the precarious state of the ship's systems. Resuming their original course, they study their guests in detail. Fascinated by the anatomy of the males, they decide to sell them to a zoo for exotic lifeforms on a distant planet. They also debate the significance of the acts depicted in Willy's magazines. Partha is particularly keen to emulate them and enthusiastically has sex with Cliff. Skipper, Cosia and Partha subject the males to a series of tests to learn more about their abilities. Oliver and Cliff fail miserably. However, Willy, looking for his magazines, beats Skipper's combat simulation by unknowingly evading her attacks, causing her to collapse with exhaustion and infer that he is a stronger being. While conducting a physical examination on Willy, Cosia discovers that his biology is more advanced than anything known to their species; encouraging Cosia with exaggerated claims about his sexual prowess, Willy loses his virginity to her. Later, he passes an intelligence test by a fluke and has sex with Partha.","response":"The men that fail the tests of the aliens in this article are Oliver and Cliff. Oliver is described as a mild-mannered professional who is engaged to Prudence, a highly-strung fiancée, while Cliff is a middle-aged man. Both of them, along with Willy, a bumbling shop assistant, encounter the aliens - Partha, Cosia, and Skipper - after wandering into the malfunctioning alien cargo ship that made an emergency landing on Earth. Fascinated by the human males' anatomy, the aliens decide to conduct a series of tests to learn more about their abilities, with the intention of selling them to a zoo for exotic lifeforms on a distant planet. The tests likely assess their intelligence, physical abilities, and perhaps some other characteristics that the aliens find intriguing or valuable. During the tests, Oliver and Cliff completely fail, which might indicate their inferior abilities or just plain bad luck when compared to Willy, who manages to fare better. Willy beats Skipper's combat simulation by unknowingly evading her attacks, passes an intelligence test by a fluke, and even has sexual encounters with the aliens as they explore the human sexuality depicted in the adult magazines. In conclusion, Oliver and Cliff are the men who fail the aliens' tests while aboard the alien cargo ship, which might put them at risk of being sold to the distant zoo for exotic lifeforms. Willy, on the other hand, seems to unwittingly impress the aliens both with his physical abilities and intelligence, which might lead to different outcomes for him."},{"question":"Complete the passage. By Hugo Gye PUBLISHED: 05:07 EST, 14 December 2012 | UPDATED: 09:53 EST, 14 December 2012 Will Self and Peter Hitchens clashed during an electric episode of Question Time last night as they expressed their strong views on the decriminalisation of drugs. The controversial author and former heroin addict told the Mail on Sunday journalist to 'take a chill pill' during their furious arguments on the BBC One programme. Mr Self, who once snorted heroin on the then-prime minister John Major's plane, argued that drug use should be legalised in order to focus on treating addicts. But Mr Hitchens responded that his claims were based on 'propaganda'. Mr","response":"Self, known for pushing societal boundaries through his writing and personal experiences, passionately advocated for the decriminalisation of drugs by drawing upon his own history as a former heroin addict. He reasoned that by legalising drug use, society would be able to better focus on treating addicts and addressing the root causes of addiction, rather than perpetuating the cycles of criminalisation and incarceration that are often seen with drug-related offences. Mr Hitchens, on the other hand, vehemently disagreed with Mr Self's assertions and claimed that such an approach would only serve to \\"normalize\\" drug use, leading to increased addiction rates and social decay. He accused Mr Self of basing his claims on \\"propaganda\\" spread by pro-drug groups, rather than on solid evidence or empirical research. As the debate continued to heat up, the sparks between Mr Self and Mr Hitchens grew even more intense. The live BBC One audience were captivated by the verbal battle, as both men presented their case. Mr Self argued that the current criminalisation of drugs only serves to create an illicit, underground market, which in turn leads to more crime, violence, and serious health consequences for users. He cited the successes of countries such as Portugal, which decriminalised drug possession and use in 2001, leading to a significant reduction in addiction rates, drug-related crime, and even drug-related deaths. By treating drug use as a public health issue, rather than a criminal one, Mr Self argued that society could focus on education, prevention, and rehabilitation, rather than relying on the punitive measures of the criminal justice system. In contrast, Mr Hitchens maintained that drug use is inherently destructive and that society must continue its efforts to prevent illegal drug use and punish those who choose to break the law. He cited examples of countries that maintain strict drug policies, such as Singapore, as evidence that a hardline approach can be effective in reducing drug use and the many social problems that come with it. As the heated discussion finally came to a close on that electric episode of Question Time, both Mr Self and Mr Hitchens demonstrated that although they might not agree on the issue of drug decriminalisation, their deep-rooted convictions and commitment to finding a solution for society's drug problem were undeniably powerful. Regardless of where one stands on this contentious issue, it was a debate characterised by intellectual rigor and fiery passion, sparking a much-needed conversation on how society can best address the longstanding and complex challenge that drug use and addiction present. As the polarising views of Mr Self and Mr Hitchens showed, finding a solution to this issue won't come easily, but it remains a critical area for policymakers and society to tackle in the ongoing pursuit of a safer, healthier, and more equitable world."},{"question":"If No, No. In all probability the young lady is with other relations.

Options: - asia - india - festival - arabia - istanbul Explain why a human would choose \\"festival\\" to answer the question above:","response":"In the United States, if someone were to refer to a bazaar, they are most likely to choose the term \\"festival.\\" This is because a bazaar, in its essence, is a marketplace or large gathering that showcases a variety of goods, services, and cultural experiences, often reminiscent of a festival. Here is a detailed explanation as to why a human would choose \\"festival\\" to answer the question above: 1. Cultural Context: The term \\"bazaar\\" has its roots in the Middle East and South Asian regions, where it refers to a marketplace where merchants and vendors set up stalls to sell diverse products. In the US, however, the word \\"festival\\" is more commonly used to describe large gatherings and events. Since the American populace is more likely to relate to the word \\"festival,\\" it becomes a more appropriate term to describe a bazaar in the US context. 2. Similarities in Structure: Both bazaars and festivals typically have a similar structure, involving a large gathering of people, food, entertainment, and a wide array of goods and services. Festivals, as well as bazaars, often involve people coming together to celebrate a specific cultural theme or special occasion. This structural resemblance makes it easier for Americans to associate the concept of a bazaar with a festival. 3. Diverse Experiences: Another reason why a human might choose \\"festival\\" to describe a bazaar in the US is that both events offer a plethora of culturally-rich experiences. A festival typically showcases diverse music, dance, art, and food, often relating to a particular theme or culture. In the same vein, bazaars provide a venue where various merchants showcase their unique products, often accompanied by lively performances and delicious cuisine. The shared aspect of diverse cultural experiences further cements the link between bazaars and festivals. 4. Community Involvement: Both bazaars and festivals encourage community participation and engagement. They serve as platforms for people to come together and interact while experiencing various aspects of their local and neighboring cultures. Since Americans are more familiar with the concept of a festival fostering community spirit, it becomes a logical choice to describe a bazaar within the US context. 5. Less Confusion: The other options - Asia, India, Arabia, and Istanbul - may carry a strong geographical association, which might be confusing or misleading when describing a bazaar in the US, as they do not accurately convey the atmosphere and structure of such an event. On the other hand, the term \\"festival\\" provides a clearer picture of what to expect and, therefore, is a more suitable choice in this context.

Red city was 10 miles from a volcano, while Tree city was 60 miles away. Red city experienced many earthquakes, Tree city few and far between. But I can use this background: Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy creates an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters or rarely as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ). What is an answer for this question: Which city experienced fewer rocks breaking? Answer:","response":"To answer the question, let's go through the information provided step-by-step: 1. Red city is situated 10 miles from a volcano, while Tree city is situated 60 miles away. 2. Red city experiences many earthquakes, whereas Tree city experiences few and far between. 3. Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries, and all types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. 4. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move, leading to stresses in the rocks. 5.

Over the past few decades, sedentary lifestyles and unhealthy eating habits have led to a significant increase in obesity rates worldwide. This epidemic is especially prevalent in developed countries, where processed foods with high caloric content are easily accessible and affordable. Obesity is a major risk factor for several chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and hypertension, thus posing a threat to public health and placing enormous strain on healthcare systems. Hypothesis: Implementing effective public health policies and programs targeting behavioral changes in diet and physical activity at a population level can significantly reduce the rates of obesity, eventually leading to improved overall health and reduced healthcare costs. To investigate this hypothesis, several factors need to be taken into consideration, including the effectiveness of public health policies, cultural factors influencing dietary choices and physical activity levels, the role of the food industry, and the availability and accessibility of healthier food options and facilities promoting physical activity. It is crucial to study the current initiatives in place and assess their success rates in different communities. Evaluating the impact of educational campaigns, food advertising regulations, nutrition labeling, and taxes or subsidies applied to healthy and unhealthy foods will also be crucial in understanding the most effective ways to counteract obesity rates at a population level. Additional research could include case studies of countries or cities that have initiated successful public health programs targeting obesity, investigating the main driving forces behind their success and identifying possible strategies that could be adapted and implemented in other regions. Through a systematic approach and targeted, evidence-based interventions, it is possible to support the hypothesis that public health interventions focused on promoting healthier lifestyles could contribute to a substantial reduction in obesity rates worldwide, leading to improved general health and reduced healthcare costs for societies."},{"question":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Parents will be forced to spend an average of £224 compared with £177 in 2012 according to research by Santander credit cards. And the cost of daily essentials such as lunch, bus fares and school trips has also risen - by 13 per cent to £44. Earn to learn: The cost of sending a child to school has rocketed by 27% to £224 since 2012. The cost of the basic necessities - uniform, sports gear, books, stationery and technology - was found to be £210.31 for children at community schools pay. For children at Grammar schools the figure rose to £284.40, those at academies cost £242.59 and foundation or trust school pupils cost £276.20, the Daily Mirror reports. One reason why the costs has risen so dramatically is that more children are wanting to take high-tech equipment such as iPads and other electronic equipment into class. A recent study found that a typical schoolchild will carry a staggering £450 worth of stationary, books and gadgets in their bag. Many youngsters are now using expensive high-tech equipment such as iPads in class. A typical satchel costing £19.70 now contains a smartphone worth £362.10s and school books valued at £40.80. Parents also fork out £7.60 on food and drink, including a lunchbox, and spend £14 on stationary. The research shows children carry a pair of headphones in their rucksack as well, worth £5.80.And parents spend £100.80 pounds on their children's school uniform - bringing the total to a mighty £550.80.

Michael Avenatti and Stormy Daniels wanted to talk to President Trump and his helper for just two hours. They needed to know if President Trump knew about the money and if he said it was okay to give it to her. Michael Cohen said he gave her the money from his own pocket, and that President Trump didn't do anything wrong. Usually, big important people like presidents don't talk about things like this. But sometimes they have to. It happened before with a man named President Clinton. Now, they are waiting for a special day when they can talk about it. That day is April 30th. Michael Avenatti said, \\"We know the people who make the rules will let us talk to President Trump and his helper.\\" So, soon they will talk and try to find out the truth about Stormy Daniels' secret with President Trump."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Anger is good for you, as lon g as you control it, according to new psychology research. A new study from Carnegie Mellon University shows anger may help people reduce the negative impacts of stress and help you become healthier. \\"Here getting emotional is not bad for you if you look at the case of anger,\\" said Jennifer Lerner of Carnegie Mellon. \\"The more people display anger, the lower their stress responses.\\" Lerner studied 92 UCLA students by asking them to count back from 6,200. They must say out loud every thirteenth number. Researchers disturbed them by asking them to count faster or ask them other questions. If they made any mistakes, they had to restart from the very beginning. Many students felt depressed about making so many mistakes or got angry because the researchers were interrupting them. Lerner used a hidden video camera and recorded all their facial expressions during the test. The researchers describe their reactions as fear, anger and disgust. Other researchers recorded the students' blood pressure, pulse and production of a high-stress hormone called cortisol. People whose faces showed more fear during th e experiment had higher blood pressure and higher levels of the hormone. Both can have lasting effects such as diabetes , heart disease, depression and extra weight gain. When people feel fear, negative impacts increase, but when they get angry, those negatives go down, according to the study. \\"Having that sense of anger leads people to actually feel some power in what otherwise is maddening situation,\\" Lerner said. Lerner previously studied Americans' emotional response to the 911 terrorist attacks two months after the incident. She found people who reacted with anger were more optimistic. These people are healthier compared with those who were frightened during the event. So in maddening situations, anger is not a bad thing to have. It's a healthier response than fear. What is the story mainly about? A) The findings of new psychology research. B) What you can do with anger in certain cases. C) Different effects produced by anger and fear. D) Healthier responses in maddening situations. Answer:","response":"A) The findings of new psychology research."},{"question":"News article: Don’t fall for these dishonest attacks on the ‘metropolitan liberal elite’ Nigel Farage would have burst a blood vessel, had he only had the chance to listen in. What could be more metropolitan liberal elite than last week’s Guardian Christmas telethon, as readers called in to journalists to make a donation for child refugees? Just imagine it, all those Islington luvvies and bleeding hearts, ringing in from one part of London N1 to another, the Bollinger chilling nicely in the fridge, as they salved their well-paid consciences and congratulated themselves on being leftier than thou. How utterly Guardianista. Except it was nothing like that. The calls came from all over the country, with perhaps an over-representation from the north of England. In my two and a half hours on the phones, I heard from Barrow-in-Furness, Hull, Lancaster, Leeds, Swansea and a string of small towns and villages from Devon to Cumbria. Colleagues reported the same pattern. True, I took a call from my own small part of north London – but it was the only one. However else you’d want to describe this group of people, metropolitan they weren’t. Nor were they the elite. Pensioners called to give the fiver or tenner they worked out they could spare, or, as Polly Toynbee has recounted, their entire winter fuel allowance. Gary Younge took a call from an unemployed Asian man, living with his parents in northern England, who gave £1.33: he chose that precise sum because he had £1.34 in his account. Meanwhile, and by coincidence, Stuart Heritage spoke again to Sam, the same teenager whose call he took last year. Sam isn’t old enough to have a credit card, but each year he has raised money at his school for the Guardian appeal. Not many of these people fit the Guardianista stereotype. I wonder what Farage and his friends would make of the lifelong reader who described the recent funeral of a 94-year-old friend: a retired major and veteran of the second world war whose devotion to the Guardian was so great that a copy of the paper was placed on top of his coffin. And yet, because of their sympathy for refugees and their presumed support for British membership of the EU – with 91% in favour, Guardian readers were the country’s most solidly pro-remain demographic, more reliably anti-Brexit than Green party voters, the young, university graduates and Scots – these people would be casually, and falsely, dismissed by the likes of Farage as the metropolitan liberal elite. Indeed, in a year brimming with dishonesties, this phrase represents one of the great myths of 2016. In August, serving as warm-up man at a Mississippi rally for Donald Trump, the then Ukip leader hailed the Brexit result as a victory for what he called the “little people, the real people ... the ordinary, decent people”. The implication was that those who had voted remain were unreal and indecent, that they were the big people, the representatives of the mighty and powerful. Theresa May played the same trick in her party conference speech in the autumn, casting the opponents of Brexit (forgetting, of course, that during the referendum campaign she was one) as members of an exclusive, global club, denizens of Davos comfortable in the first-class lounge and utterly devoid of national allegiance – people who were, in her memorable phrase, citizens of the world and therefore citizens of nowhere. As I wrote then, she sought to rebrand the 48% as the 1%. But it’s an absurd lie. Of course, more Britons voted to leave the EU than to stay, but nearly half of those voting chose remain. That is not a tiny metropolitan elite. In the US, 2.9 million more people chose Hillary Clinton than chose Donald Trump. That too is not an elite. In most democratic systems, such a margin would have been hailed as a victory and a mandate; only under the arcane rules of the electoral college could such a result have brought defeat. So enough of this fraudulent talk of elites, metropolitan or otherwise. But what of that middle word, the meat in this rhetorical sandwich? What of “liberal”? After this year, especially, I think the word should be worn with pride. If liberal means wanting to help children fleeing a dictator’s barrel-bombs, then call me a liberal. If liberal means believing that the peoples of a continent that for centuries was torn apart by war and bloodshed have found a new, peaceful mechanism for resolving their differences, and that Britain should play its part in that, then call me a liberal. If liberal means holding true to the values of the Enlightenment, including a belief in facts and evidence and reason, then call me a liberal. And if liberal means cherishing the norms and institutions that protect and sustain democracy, from a free press to an independent judiciary, then call me a liberal. For those values are under assault just now, in a way few of us ever imagined. So when it comes to “liberal”, we have nothing to apologise for. Sure, the remainers’ most public faces could fairly be described as both “metropolitan” and “elite” – columnists for London-based newspapers among them. But the same is self-evidently true of the other side, too. Michael Gove and Boris Johnson are not exactly members of the lumpen proletariat, are they? There is no definition of elite or metropolitan that does not include those two. And the same is true of that other dread phrase of 2016, “the bubble”. As if the only people who live in a bubble are liberal, anti-Trump, anti-Brexit types, while their opponents are rooted in the earthiness of the real world. What garbage. Stockbroker Farage paid homage to billionaire Trump in the latter’s gold elevator; that’s the same Farage who confessed his relief that vacating the Ukip leadership meant he no longer had to deal with “low-grade people” and who said his £85,000 MEP’s salary, excluding abundant expenses, meant he was “poor”. Those who truly live in a bubble are those who cannot begin to imagine the lives of – still less empathise with – those outside their own first-world realm of safety, comfort and prosperity. When Tory MP and Dorset landowner Richard Drax objects to an overseas aid budget of 0.7% of national income, insisting “charity begins at home” – as if 99.3% of our “charity” isn’t already being spent at home – then it’s he who’s living in a bubble. But in this season of goodwill, let’s not play their game – competing over which side is less detached, less metropolitan or less elite. Instead, let’s think of those people who were so moved by the plight of their fellow human beings they gave what they had, even when they could barely spare it. Call them names if you like, but they are the very best of us.

These people also come from different backgrounds and are not necessarily wealthy or part of an elite group. The author also talks about how politicians like Nigel Farage and Theresa May have used this idea of a \\"metropolitan liberal elite\\" as a way to attack their opponents, but that it's not fair to do so.

Depending on the symptoms, the doctor may need to run a few non-invasive imaging tests on the injured foot. The most common tests are x-rays, CT (Computerized Tomography) scans, and MRIs (Magnetic Resonance Imaging). These techniques allow the doctor to examine the foot for broken bones and monitor the bones as they heal. In many cases, surgery is not necessary for proper treatment of a broken foot. Often the hospital will put the foot in a hard cast and/or provide crutches to keep the weight off the foot. The doctor will likely advise you to keep the foot elevated and ice the injury to prevent swelling and re-injury. When using crutches, put your weight on your arms and hands. Do not put all your weight on your armpits, which could hurt the nerves that are in your underarms. Follow your doctor's orders! Failure to comply with keeping your weight off the foot is the number one cause of delayed healing and re-injury for fractures. You may be advised to take over-the-counter NSAIDs (Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflamatory Drugs) such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or naproxen (Aleve). These will help reduce the pain and swelling associated with the healing process. If you are scheduled to undergo surgery you may need to stop taking medication a week before the surgery takes place. Consult with your doctor or surgeon. Take the smallest dose possible to manage your pain. Stop taking NSAIDs after 10 days to avoid complications. Your doctor may also recommend upping your consumption of calcium and vitamin D, which are both crucial for bone health. For most foot injuries, your doctor will try to give your foot time to heal itself by putting on a cast and limiting your activity. In some cases, though, your injured foot may need a manipulation (known as an ORIF, or open reduction internal fixation) if the broken ends of the bone are misaligned. This involves the movement of the bone into the proper alignment, after which pins are passed through the skin to hold the bone in place while it heals. The healing process for a reduction takes an average of 6 weeks, after which the pins are easily removed. In more severe cases you may need surgery to implant screws or rods to keep the foot in position while it heals. Even if your injury doesn't require surgery, an orthopedic doctor or podiatric surgeon will be able to monitor the healing process. In the event of re-injury or other impairments to the healing process, the doctor will prescribe the appropriate treatment, therapy, or surgery. Summary:","response":"If you hurt your foot, the doctor might use special pictures, like x-rays, to see if it's broken and decide the best way to help it heal, sometimes with a cast or maybe even surgery."},{"question":"Here is a premise: you know as an American citizen but i think uh the people that i've talked to as far as voting because i've worked you know in in trying to get people to vote when i was in the military i was a uh represented you know i represented people as far as voting and um from what i spoke speaking with people it was mainly that um they felt frustrated that their one vote wasn't going to do any good you know that um and and it was really hard to get across to them that it didn't matter you know it's a matter of that's your right you should go and do it you know and that your one vote can count when you get a whole lot of people if everybody says oh well my vote doesn't count you know then then what do you have you know Here is a hypothesis: Being in the military, trying to get people to vote to be represented can be challenging.

The premise states that the speaker has experience in advocating for voting due to their role in the military. They represent the interest of individuals to participate in voting, which supports the hypothesis. In the given premise, the speaker has indeed identified a challenge associated with their experience, namely the skepticism among people about the significance and impact of their individual vote. They express the difficulty in convincing people that their one vote can make a difference, suggesting that the process of motivating individuals to vote can be challenging. This aligns with the hypothesis that states \\"trying to get people to vote to be represented can be challenging.\\" Consequently, under the assumption that the premise or the shared experience is true, we can reasonably confirm that the hypothesis is plausible as well. It is true that being in the military and persuading people to participate in the voting process can present significant obstacles or challenges.

The development of the periodization has generally been accredited to historian Peter Brown, after the publication of his seminal work \\"The World of Late Antiquity\\" (1971). Precise boundaries for the period are a continuing matter of debate, but Brown proposes a period between the 3rd and 8th centuries AD. Generally, it can be thought of as from the end of the Roman Empire's Crisis of the Third Century (c. 235 284) to, in the East, the early Islamic period (7th9th centuries), following the Muslim conquests in the mid7th century. In the West the end was earlier, with the start of the Early Medieval period typically placed in the 6th century, or earlier on the Western edges of the empire. - A capital city (or simply capital) is the municipality exercising primary status in a country, state, province, or other region, usually as its seat of government. A capital is typically a city that physically encompasses the offices and meeting places of its respective government; the status as capital is often designated by its law or constitution. In some jurisdictions, including several countries, the different branches of government are located in different settlements. In some cases, a distinction is made between the official (constitutional) capital and the seat of government, which is in another place. - Constantine the Great (27 February 272 AD 22 May 337 AD), also known as Constantine I or Saint Constantine (in the Orthodox Church as Saint Constantine the Great, Equal-to-the-Apostles), was a Roman Emperor from 306 to 337 AD. Constantine was the son of Flavius Valerius Constantius, a Roman Army officer, and his consort Helena. His father became \\"Caesar\\", the deputy emperor in the west, in 293 AD. Constantine was sent east, where he rose through the ranks to become a military tribune under the emperors Diocletian and Galerius. In 305, Constantius was raised to the rank of \\"Augustus\\", senior western emperor, and Constantine was recalled west to campaign under his father in Britannia (Britain). Acclaimed as emperor by the army at Eboracum (modern-day York) after his father's death in 306 AD, Constantine emerged victorious in a series of civil wars against the emperors Maxentius and Licinius to become sole ruler of both west and east by 324 AD. - The Count of Flanders was the ruler or sub-ruler of the county of Flanders, beginning in the 9th century. The title was held for a time by the Holy Roman Emperor and the King of Spain. During the French Revolution in 1790, the county of Flanders was annexed to France and the peerage ceased to exist. In the 19th century, the title was appropriated by Belgium and granted twice to younger sons of the King of the Belgians. The most recent holder died in 1983. - Constantinople was the capital city of the Roman/Byzantine Empire (3301204 and 12611453), and also of the brief Latin (12041261), and the later Ottoman (14531923) empires. It was reinaugurated in 324 AD from ancient Byzantium as the new capital of the Roman Empire by Emperor Constantine the Great, after whom it was named, and dedicated on 11 May 330 AD. - An empire is defined as \\"an aggregate of nations or people ruled over by an emperor or other powerful sovereign or government, usually a territory of greater extent than a kingdom, as the former British Empire, French Empire, Brazilian Empire, Russian Empire, Ottoman Empire, Byzantine Empire or Roman Empire.\\" An empire can be made solely of contiguous territories such as the Austro-Hungarian Empire, or of territories far remote from the homeland, such as a colonial empire. - The Empire of Romania, more commonly known in historiography as the Latin Empire or Latin Empire of Constantinople, and known to the Byzantines as the Latin Occupation, was a feudal Crusader state founded by the leaders of the Fourth Crusade on lands captured from the Byzantine Empire. It was established after the capture of Constantinople in 1204 and lasted until 1261. The Latin Empire was intended to supplant the Byzantine Empire as the titular Roman Empire in the east, with a Western Roman Catholic emperor enthroned in place of the Eastern Orthodox Roman emperors. Baldwin IX, Count of Flanders, was crowned the first Latin emperor as Baldwin I on 16 May 1204. The Latin Empire failed to attain political or economic dominance over the other Latin powers that had been established in former Byzantine territories in the wake of the Fourth Crusade, especially Venice, and after a short initial period of military successes it went into a steady decline. Weakened by constant warfare with the Bulgarians and the unconquered sections of the empire, it eventually fell when Byzantines recaptured Constantinople under Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos in 1261. The last Latin emperor, Baldwin II, went into exile, but the imperial title survived, with several pretenders to it, until the 14th century. - The Byzantine Empire, also referred to as the Eastern Roman Empire, was the continuation of the Roman Empire in the East during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, when its capital city was Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul, which had been founded as Byzantium). It survived the fragmentation and fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD and continued to exist for an additional thousand years until it fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453. During most of its existence, the empire was the most powerful economic, cultural, and military force in Europe. Both \\"Byzantine Empire\\" and \\"Eastern Roman Empire\\" are historiographical terms created after the end of the realm; its citizens continued to refer to their empire as the \\"Roman Empire\\" (tr. ), or \\"Romania\\", and to themselves as \\"Romans\\". - The Empire of Trebizond or the Trapezuntine Empire was a monarchy that flourished during the 13th through 15th centuries, consisting of the far northeastern corner of Anatolia and the southern Crimea. Originally formed during a revolt against the usurpation of the imperial throne by the grandsons of Emperor Andronikos I Komnenos, Trebizond (current Trabzon, Turkey, with which the name of the empire is a cognate) became a Byzantine Greek successor state established after the fall of the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine) in the Fourth Crusade, along with the Empire of Nicaea and the Despotate of Epirus. The Emperors of Trebizond pressed their claim on the Imperial throne for decades after the Nicaean reconquest of Constantinople in 1261. - The Empire of Nicaea was the largest of the three Byzantine Greek successor states founded by the aristocracy of the Byzantine Empire that fled after Constantinople was occupied by Western European and Venetian forces during the Fourth Crusade. Founded by the Laskaris family, it lasted from 1204 to 1261, when the Nicaeans restored the Byzantine Empire in Constantinople. - The Fall of Constantinople ('; Conquest of Istanbul) was the capture of the capital of the Byzantine Empire by an invading army of the Ottoman Empire on 29 May 1453. The Ottomans were commanded by the then 21-year-old Mehmed the Conqueror, the seventh sultan of the Ottoman Empire, who defeated an army commanded by Byzantine Emperor Constantine XI Palaiologos. The conquest of Constantinople followed a 53-day siege that had begun on 6 April 1453. - Alexios Komnenos Strategopoulos ( Greek : ) was a Byzantine general during the reign of Michael VIII Palaiologos , rising to the rank of megas domestikos and Caesar . Of noble descent , he appears in the sources already at an advanced age in the early 1250s , leading armies for the Empire of Nicaea against Epirus . After falling out of favour and being imprisoned by Theodore II Laskaris , Strategopoulos sided with the aristocrats around Michael Palaiologos , and supported him in his rise to the throne after Theodore II 's death in 1258 . He participated in the Pelagonia campaign in 1259 , going on to capture Epirus , but his successes were undone in the next year and he was captured by the Epirotes . Released after a few months , he led the unexpected reconquest of Constantinople from the Latin Empire in July 1261 , restoring the Byzantine Empire . He was captured again by the Epirotes in the next year and spent several years in captivity in Italy , before being released . He retired from public affairs and died in the early 1270s . - Michael VIII Palaiologos or Palaeologus (\\"Mikhal VIII Palaiologos\\"; 1223 11 December 1282) reigned as Byzantine Emperor 12591282. Michael VIII was the founder of the Palaiologan dynasty that would rule the Byzantine Empire until the Fall of Constantinople in 1453. He recovered Constantinople from the Latin Empire in 1261 and transformed the Empire of Nicaea into a restored Byzantine Empire. - Istanbul (or ), historically known as Constantinople and Byzantium, is the most populous city in Turkey and the country's economic, cultural, and historic center. Istanbul is a transcontinental city in Eurasia, straddling the Bosphorus strait (which separates Europe and Asia) between the Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea. Its commercial and historical center lies on the European side and about a third of its population lives on the Asian side. The city is the administrative center of the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality (coterminous with Istanbul Province), both hosting a population of around 14.7 million residents. Istanbul is one of the world's most populous cities and ranks as the world's 7th-largest city proper and the largest European city. - The Laskaris or Lascaris family was a Byzantine Greek noble family whose members formed the ruling dynasty of the Empire of Nicaea from 1204 to 1261 and remained among the senior nobility up to the dissolution of the Byzantine Empire, whereupon many emigrated to Italy and then to Smyrna (much later). According to George Pachymeres, they were also called Tzamantouros (T). The feminine form of the name is Laskarina (). - Komnenos, Latinized Comnenus, plural Komnenoi or Comneni (, pronounced /komniní/), is the name of a noble family who ruled the Byzantine Empire from 1081 to 1185, and later, as the Grand Komnenoi (, \\"Megalokomnenoi\\") founded and ruled the Empire of Trebizond (12041461). Through intermarriages with other noble clans, notably the Doukai, Angeloi, and Palaiologoi, the Komnenos name appears among most of the major noble houses of the late Byzantine world. What entity does 'alexios strategopoulos' has the relation 'occupation' with? Answer:","response":"Alexios Strategopoulos had an occupation-related relationship with the Byzantine Empire, particularly during the reign of Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos. He served as a Byzantine general, rising to the rank of megas domestikos and Caesar. Strategopoulos played a vital role in the reconquest of Constantinople from the Latin Empire in 1261, which led to the restoration of the Byzantine Empire."},{"question":"Given this review: \\"It's awesome download it dont look back!

They started by playing local clubs which led to touring with Dick Clark's Caravan of Stars opening shows and providing backup for major rock artists of the period. Their name was shortened to Exile in 1973, consisting of guitarist Pennington, leader/lead singer Jimmy Stokley, Bernie Faulkner B3 sax acoustic guitar, Billy Luxon trumpet, keyboardist Buzz Cornelison, bassist Kenny Weir, and drummer Bobby Johns. The band changed musical styles throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s. They shortened their name to Exile in 1973 and released their eponymous debut album through Wooden Nickel Records that same year. Singles released from the album proved unsuccessful, and it would be a good five years before the band released a full-length follow-up album. In 1977, the band released the single \\"Try it On\\" on Atco Records, and it became a minor hit. The following year, Mike Chapman, an Australian who had established himself as a record producer in the UK, came to the United States in search of an experienced group who wrote their own material. Chapman heard an Exile demo and went to their next concert. Chapman evidently enjoyed what he saw. He and Exile decided to collaborate and together they produced the Mixed Emotions album on Warner/Curb Records. The first single release from that album was Kiss You All Over. The single reached Billboard's Top 40 on 5 August 1978. It remained on the chart for seventeen weeks and was No. 1 for four weeks in September. It was a best-seller for six months. Their follow up single, \\"You Thrill Me,\\" also from the Mixed Emotions LP did not fare as well, although it did reach the Top 40 for one week on 3 February 1979. The band toured with Aerosmith, Heart, Dave Mason, Boston, Seals & Crofts and other hot pop acts of the late seventies throughout the United States, Europe and Africa. All There Is, the group's second Warner Bros. Records album, recorded a year later with a distinct disco beat, yielded a foreign hit, \\"The Part Of Me That Needs You Most.\\" This single did particularly well in Europe and South Africa. Don't Leave Me This Way, their third album, produced by Peter Coleman, yielded two more singles, \\"Take Me Down\\" and \\"Smooth Sailing.\\" Once again, it did well in Europe and South Africa although their popularity in the United States waned. Numerous personnel changes took place in 1979. Perhaps most significantly, Stokley would leave the group that year, forcing remaining members guitarist/vocalist J.P. Pennington, keyboardist Buzz Cornelison, keyboardist/vocalist Marlon Hargis, bassist/vocalist Sonny Lemaire and drummers Steve Goetzman and Gary Freeman to search for a new lead singer. A young singer, Les Taylor, accepted an invitation to join the group and shared lead vocal duties with Pennington. By the early 1980s, other lineup changes took place, including the exit of original member Buzz Cornelison, plus keyboardist Mark Gray, who co-wrote \\"The Closer You Get\\" and \\"Take Me Down\\", both of which became hits for the group Alabama, played a short stint from 1980 to 1982.

However, the sentences are structured differently and use different wordings to present the same information. Let's break it down further: 1. \\"In the new group, Guy Watson, Love Song, drums and Ernie Earnshaw on the bass took over.\\" The above sentence starts by referring to the 'new group.' It then proceeds to list the members of the group - Guy Watson, Love Song, drums, and Ernie Earnshaw on the bass. Finally, it highlights the new roles these individuals are taking on within the group. 2. \\"Ernie Earnshaw, of Love Song, took over on drums and Guy Watson on bass in the new group.\\" In this paraphrase, the focus begins with Ernie Earnshaw instead of the 'new group.' It also specifically mentions Love Song's association with Ernie Earnshaw and describes the roles of the members - drums for Ernie Earnshaw and bass for Guy Watson. The sentence ends by mentioning the 'new group.' Both sentences convey the essential information about the new group and the roles of Guy Watson and Ernie Earnshaw.

Buhari is the first sub-Saharan African leader to have a White House summit with Trump, who has been criticized for reportedly making derogatory comments about Africa. During his public remarks with Buhari, Trump focused mostly on common goals and shared interests, such as fighting terrorism and expanding trade. \\"We love helicopters — he loves them more than I do,\\" joked Trump, referring to his administration's decision to approve a 600 million military sales deal to Nigeria. Buhari thanked Trump for approving the deal, which the administration of former President Barack Obama had suspended over allegations of human rights abuses. \\"I worked it out so that now you can buy the helicopters that you want,\\" Trump said, adding, \\"We make the best military equipment in the world, and our friends can now buy it.\\" Human rights groups have accused the Nigerian military of torture, rape and extrajudicial killing in its almost decade-long campaign against the Boko Haram extremist group. Tens of thousands of people have been killed in the insurgency, and hundreds of schoolgirls kidnapped, as the group gained notoriety and spread to neighboring countries, posing one of the most severe threats to West Africa's Sahel region in recent years. Although Nigeria has been a major partner in the U.S. fight against Islamist extremists in Africa, relations have faced challenges over the past year. In January, Nigeria joined a list of outraged African countries demanding an explanation from the U.S. ambassador after Trump's reported vulgar comments referring to African countries. Asked whether those comments came up during his private meeting with Trump, Buhari declined to comment. \\"I'm very careful with what the press says about other than myself. I'm not sure about, you know, the validity or whether that allegation was true or not. So, the best thing for me is to keep quiet,\\" Buhari said. Question: How does Nigeria feel about Trump's comments? === The answer to the above question is The answer is:","response":"Nigeria, along with other African countries, expressed outrage and demanded an explanation from the U.S. ambassador regarding President Trump's alleged derogatory comments about African nations. The fact that Nigeria joined the list of countries seeking answers shows that it was not pleased with the remarks attributed to the U.S. President. However, in the meeting between President Trump and Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari, both leaders seemed to focus on common goals and shared interests, such as fighting terrorism and expanding trade. When asked about Trump's alleged comments during the private meeting, Buhari chose to remain cautious and not comment on the issue directly, saying he was not sure about the validity of the allegations and that it was best for him to keep quiet. Nevertheless, it is important to note that feelings about Trump's comments may vary among Nigerian citizens, government officials, and political figures. People may have different opinions on how much weight to give these comments compared to the broader context of the U.S.-Nigeria partnership. In summary, the Nigerian government and people have shown strong displeasure at the alleged derogatory remarks by President Trump. Despite this, both countries continue to engage and work together on crucial issues of mutual interest. It is essential to acknowledge that the opinions of Nigerian citizens may not be monolithic, and individual perspectives can differ significantly."},{"question":"Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who was not surprised that the band was looking for a replacement for him?

The principle of casual Fridays seems to have appeared around the 1950s. It was probably in response to the changing attitudes towards workplaces. Over time, some offices have relaxed their dress rules even more by using a \\"business casual\\" dress rule. On casual Fridays, employees may wear clothes which are considered to be \\"business casual\\", meaning they still obey certain standards . Clothes must be clean and in good condition, with no spots. Men are generally allowed to wear casual trousers and bright-colored clothes, and in some offices they may be allowed to wear button-down shirts or polo shirts, with or without a tie.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","response":"If there is less oxygen in the environment, it will directly impact a step of the process. Specifically, the step where air enters the nose or mouth and travels through the windpipe into the lungs. With lower oxygen levels in the air, there will be fewer oxygen molecules available to be taken up by the alveoli in the lungs. Consequently, this decrease in oxygen concentration will lead to less oxygen-rich air being pumped by the heart. As the heart pumps oxygen-poor blood to the body tissues and organs, the cells will have less oxygen available for normal functions, such as energy production through cellular respiration. This reduced oxygen supply can lead to fatigue, shortness of breath, and in extreme cases, hypoxia – a condition where insufficient oxygen is reaching body tissues. The lower availability of oxygen in the environment will also have indirect effects on different steps in the process. For example: 1. Oxygen transport across the alveoli: With decreased oxygen levels in the inhaled air, the gradient of oxygen concentration between the alveoli and surrounding blood capillaries will be reduced. This may result in a slower rate of oxygen diffusion across the alveoli and into the bloodstream. 2. Oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood: If the amount of oxygen dissolved in blood plasma is reduced due to decreased environmental oxygen levels, the blood's oxygen-carrying capacity (measured by arterial oxygen saturation) will decrease. This can lead to cells receiving less oxygen than they require for optimal functioning. 3. Cellular respiration and energy production: The reduced availability of oxygen in body tissues will affect cellular respiration, as oxygen is essential for the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) – the primary energy currency at the cellular level. A decrease in ATP synthesis can result in decreased cellular function, fatigue, and organ dysfunction, amongst other health problems. In conclusion, the decrease in oxygen levels in the environment directly impacts the oxygen intake step of the process, which subsequently affects other steps involved in oxygen transport and utilization throughout the body. The resulting lower oxygen levels in the blood can adversely affect the overall health and functioning of an individual."},{"question":"Please check if these have the same meaning.

Article: My grandma whom we all called Nanny was a solid, first-generation, Italian immigrant. She came to this country with her family on a tiny ship during World War I when she was only 8 years old. During the trip she survived stormy seas,little food, and an attack by a German U-boat. After getting here,her large family worked hard to build a new life in America. They never had much money but were rich in love. One day,when I was about 5 or 6 years old, my parents and brothers went on a trip. It was just me and Nanny in the house for the weekend. Nanny seemed so happy to be taking care of me all by herself. She made me a special breakfast that first morning. However, all I could do was to complain about how the food was not how Mom always made it. Nanny quietly put down the plate and went into the living room. I followed a minute later and saw that she had tears in her eyes. It was the first time I had ever seen my strong and proud grandmother cry and I was the one who had caused it. I walked over to Nanny, climbed on her lap, and for the first time in my short life I did something else too. I apologized without being told to and asked Nanny to forgive me. She smiled, rubbed my head, and told me I was a good boy even though I didn't feel like one then. That memory just like my Nanny's love will stay in my heart forever.

Appalled by the horrors of Hillsborough, and ashamed at the state of so many grounds, professional football did not put up much of an argument when Margaret Thatcher's government responded to the tragedy by banning standing areas. Even when this ban was later diluted to just the top two divisions in England and Wales, any nostalgia for football's most famous terraces was crowded out by the bottom line of greater ticket revenues. A consensus soon formed around the idea that all-seater stadia were easier to police, safer and more in line with what modern \\"consumers\\" wanted - the rising attendances, increased turnover and more diverse fan-base was the proof. So why do nine out of 10 football fans, in almost every survey, say they would like the choice to stand? Why are more clubs wondering if bringing back standing areas could help boost the atmosphere at games, as well as improving relations with those annoyed at being told what they cannot do and struggling to keep up with the game's gentrification? And why are so many experts coming around to the idea that bolting plastic seats to a concrete terrace does not have much impact on a human being's behaviour, or even the likelihood of injury? \\"The Hillsborough Independent Panel's report (in 2012) changed everything,\\" says Dr Geoff Pearson, an expert on the policing of football crowds at the University of Liverpool. \\"In many ways it didn't tell us anything we didn't already know from (Lord Justice) Taylor's 1990 report [into the disaster] but it confirmed that the reaction to Hillsborough was hijacked to bring in crowd-management and public order measures. \\"People were so shocked by the poor quality of most grounds they just didn't think standing could be done safely any more. We now know that's not true. Even Taylor didn't blame terracing.\\" The centrality of what happened on 15 April, 1989, to today's debate goes both ways, though. Steve Rotheram, the MP for Liverpool Walton, speaks for many on Merseyside when he says \\"safe-standing is an oxymoron\\", and suggests those 96 lives would not have been lost if there were seats in the Leppings Lane Stand that day. The emotions are still so raw at Anfield that Liverpool were the only Premier League club to tell a Mail on Sunday survey last month that they could not countenance any move to bring back standing. Rotheram, a Liverpool fan who swapped his Leppings Lane ticket for a seat shortly before kick-off, believes some people romanticise the days when 25,000 fans stood on The Kop - \\"grounds are less threatening now\\" - and points out that any notion of markedly cheaper tickets for standing sections is fanciful. \\"We are not convinced by safe-standing and do not support its introduction \\"The rising cost of tickets was something Taylor didn't predict,\\" he adds. \\"If prices had risen on a par with inflation they'd be £16 now, not £40. \\"How much cheaper would a standing ticket be? £5? Working-class fans aren't staying away because they're short of a fiver; they're not coming because they're short of £40.\\" Rotheram is right about a return to standing areas not being the panacea to rocketing prices that many yearn for - most British stadia have been designed, or redesigned, with a capacity in mind, and the concourses, exits and gangways cannot accommodate a significant hike in fans. But the cost of tickets is not the only thing Taylor did not see coming. He thought fans would get used to sitting down. \\"The people I call the 'carnival fans', those who create most of the atmosphere, have never got used to sitting,\\" says Pearson. \\"The authorities have simply lost the battle, and blind eyes are being turned around the country every weekend, particularly in away ends.\\" Pearson is also right. Many fans cannot understand why clubs below the Championship can legally provide standing areas, and even promoted clubs, such as Yeovil Town, are given two years to go all-seater. If safety is the primary concern, surely this should happen immediately. Then there is the apparent contradiction of allowing fans to stand at horse racing or rugby. This is an anomaly Bristol Sport, the owner of Bristol City FC and Bristol Rugby Club, might be ready to test with its new plans for a renovated Ashton Gate with two standing sections. And finally you have perhaps the most glaring example of the chasm that is growing between the British authorities' view of how football should be consumed, and the way many fans would like to consume it: the Bundesliga. Profitable, successful and suddenly fashionable, the German league has become the Premier League's bête noire. What it lacks in TV contracts, it compensates with noisy fans, who are closely engaged with their clubs. It is why an estimated 1,000 Brits travel to Dortmund every fortnight to experience the Westfalenstadion's \\"Yellow Wall\\", the 25,000-capacity southern terrace. Unlike most of the rest of Europe, German clubs resisted the move to all-seaters, and in recent years many of them have upgraded their terraces with \\"rail seats\\". These are metal seats that can be flipped up, and locked in place, providing space to stand behind a waist-high rail that runs along the back of the row in front. Every \\"seat\\" is linked to a ticket number, and can be flipped down to meet Uefa rules for European games. Bringing rail seating here has become a crusade for Jon Darch. For the last two years, the Bristol City fan has taken his \\"Safe Standing Roadshow\\" to grounds around the country. Darch, who admits to being sponsored by a manufacturer of rail seats, says they are \\"patently safe\\" and \\"tick every box\\" for any club considering a return to standing. Celtic are just one club Darch has visited, but the Scottish champions have gone one step further than everybody else by formally applying for permission to trial 2,000 rail seats at Celtic Park, with no increase in overall capacity. \\"We feel there is a new vibrancy in football that has come from Europe and is now in the UK,\\" said Celtic chief executive Peter Lawwell in September. \\"The safest way to manage that is through safe-standing. These are new systems that are extremely safe, and we are very keen to explore that at Celtic Park.\\" With Scottish clubs not being bound by the all-seater requirements of the 1989 Football Spectators Act, and the Scottish Professional Football League dropping its opposition to standing in 2011, hopes had been high that Glasgow City Council's safety advisory group would back Celtic's plan. But a spokesman for the council says talks are \\"at an extremely early stage\\", and points out \\"this would be a major policy shift\\". Just how major a shift it would be is clear from the response of perhaps the group's most persuasive voice, Police Scotland. \\"We are not convinced by safe-standing and do not support its introduction,\\" says assistant chief constable Bernard Higgins. \\"If, however, the local authority and safety committee grant permission, we will work with the club and police it accordingly.\\" Police opposition is probably the biggest obstacle the safe-standing campaign faces. But even here the picture is blurred. Our view is that seating is generally safer, more comfortable and enables better crowd management The Football Supporters' Federation's safe-standing co-ordinator Peter Daykin says representatives from the Association of Chief Police Officers have told his organisation they were willing to put aside their historic opposition to standing and start a dialogue with fans. According to Daykin, match-day commanders increasingly believe that standing sections could reduce tensions between those fans who want to stand and the stewards tasked with making them sit. \\"The objections now tend not to be about safety - we see from Germany, Norway, the US and Leagues One and Two that people stand safely week in, week out - but have moved to standing as the potential cause of crowd disorder,\\" he adds. \\"We don't believe there is any evidence to link the two, but we've always asked for an evidence-led debate and not a law based on speculation. That's why we want permission to hold a small number of trials in advance of any change in the existing rules.\\" But just to emphasise that nothing is simple in this debate, there is even disagreement about how any change to the status quo might happen. The law insists upon all-seater stadia, but it is not against the law for fans not to use those seats; that is a breach of contract between fan and club, based on the ground regulations. Compliance with these regulations is the remit of the Sports Grounds Safety Authority (SGSA), which took on this role when the Football Licensing Authority (FLA) was wound up in 2011. \\"The legalities of safe-standing can be debated between solicitors but our understanding is that primary legislation is not required,\\" says Daykin. \\"The Secretary of State (for Culture, Media and Sport) can direct the SGSA to drop the all-seat requirement from the licence it issues. It's not an outrageous proposal - League One and League Two clubs are already exempt.\\" Some hope the abolition of the FLA, which was vehemently against standing, might be the key that unlocks the door to Bundesliga-style terraces. This might prove to be the case in the future - the rhetoric is certainly less dogmatic than it used to be - but for now the regulator's opposition to standing remains. \\"We recognise there are some fans who may prefer to stand, and we're happy to engage in an informed and constructive debate, but our view is that seating is generally safer, more comfortable and enables better crowd management,\\" says SGSA chief executive Ruth Shaw. \\"It can also help to create a more inclusive and diverse environment.\\" Shaw's reference to crowd management is interesting given the current focus on stopping fans from bringing pyrotechnics into games, as well as the damage caused by some Celtic fans at Motherwell's Fir Park last weekend. It will be some time before the SGSA, most police and many politicians are convinced that identifying wrongdoers in a standing area is as easy as it is in a seated section, regardless of the improvements in CCTV. So what we are left with is an impasse, with many in football stuck in a No Man's Land between the opposing camps, frightened to move, but scared at being left behind. It is telling that while 19 of 20 Premier League clubs have said they would like to talk about a return to standing, none has raised it at a Premier League shareholders meeting. Even Cardiff City, who have spent most of this year moving persistent standers to the Canton Stand and letting them get on with it, have not tried. The last meeting was a fortnight ago. In the meantime, stewards up and down the land will continue to look for common-sense solutions to the problem of being asked to enforce an unpopular law, and many fans will pay for a seat they do not want. Summary:","response":"Many football fans continue to express their desire for the option to stand during matches, despite a ban on standing areas in the top two divisions in England and Wales. Some clubs are exploring the idea of reintroducing standing areas to improve the atmosphere at games, as surveys show that nine out of ten fans would like the choice to stand. The push for safe-standing, as seen in the German Bundesliga with the incorporation of rail seating, has gained momentum, and efforts by clubs like Celtic to trial rail seating are being considered in the UK. However, there remain obstacles, such as police opposition and debates around safety and crowd management, that need to be addressed before a potential return to standing areas in football stadiums."},{"question":"Complete the following sentence.

On 10 April 1941, Slavko Kvaternik proclaimed the Independent State of Croatia, and Tito responded by forming a Military Committee within the Central Committee of the Yugoslav Communist Party. Attacked from all sides, the armed forces of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia quickly crumbled. On 17 April 1941, after King Peter II and other members of the government fled the country, the remaining representatives of the government and military met with the German officials in Belgrade. They quickly agreed to end military resistance. On 1 May 1941, Tito issued a pamphlet calling on the people to unite in a battle against the occupation. On 27 June 1941, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia appointed Tito Commander in Chief of all project national liberation military forces. On 1 July 1941, the Comintern sent precise instructions calling for immediate action. What is the answer to this question: What did Tito use to get the people to unit in a battle against the occupation in 1941?","response":"Josip Broz Tito, the leader of the Yugoslav Partisans during World War II, used a combination of effective propaganda, political organization, and military strategy to unite the various ethnic and political factions within Yugoslavia against the occupying Axis forces in 1941. One of the key steps he took to inspire the people to unite against the occupation was the issuance of a pamphlet on 1 May 1941 that called on the people to join forces in the battle against the oppressors. This pamphlet was a crucial tool in Tito's strategy, as it utilized strong language and clear messaging to appeal to the different religious, ethnic, and political groups within Yugoslavia. By emphasizing the nation's shared struggle, the pamphlet laid the groundwork for the formation of a common front against the Axis occupation. Tito presented the struggle as a fight for independence, emphasizing the importance of unity to resist the foreign invaders. Besides this pamphlet, Tito also leveraged his role as the leader of the Yugoslav Communist Party to consolidate power and align partisan forces across the country. His goal was to create a unified resistance movement that would not only fight against the Axis occupation but also work towards the establishment of a socialist Yugoslavia. This political vision appealed to many people who saw in communism a way to eradicate the inequalities and divisions that had plagued the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Tito's call for unity was further reinforced by his appointment as the Commander in Chief of all national liberation military forces on 27 June 1941 by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia. This appointment gave him the authority to coordinate the efforts of various partisan groups, making the resistance more effective and cohesive. Following this, on 1 July 1941, the Comintern (Communist International) sent precise instructions to Tito, urging immediate action and reinforcing the importance of a united front. In conclusion, Tito used a combination of effective propaganda (such as the May 1st pamphlet), political organization, and military strategy to unite the Yugoslav people in the battle against the Axis occupation in 1941. His efforts in rallying the various factions under a single, unified resistance movement played a vital role in mounting a strong opposition to the invaders and ultimately led to the liberation of Yugoslavia by the end of World War II."},{"question":"The third season of \\"Gossip Girl,\\" an American teen drama based upon the book series by Cecily von Ziegesar.

The park is about 30 miles (48 km) long from north to south, and its width varies from a maximum of about 12 miles (19 km) in the north to a minimum of about 1 mile (1.6 km) along a narrow corridor between the north and south, where the park widens again to about 4 to 5 miles (6 to 8 km).I-40, former U.S. Route 66, the BNSF Railway, and the Puerco River bisect the park generally east–west along a similar route. Adamana, a ghost town, is about 1 mile (1.6 km) west of the park along the BNSF tracks. Holbrook, about 26 miles (42 km) west of park headquarters along I-40, is the nearest city. Bisecting the park north–south is Park Road, which runs between I-40 near park headquarters on the north and U.S. Route 180 on the south. Historic Highway 180, an earlier alignment of the modern route, crosses the southern edge of the park. Like Route 66, it has deteriorated and is closed. Many unpaved maintenance roads, closed to the public, intersect Park Road at various points.The fee area of the park covers about 230 square miles (600 km2). The Navajo Nation borders the park on the north and northeast. State-owned land, federal land controlled by the Bureau of Land Management, and private land, much of it used for cattle ranching, adjoin the other borders. The park’s elevation above sea level varies from a low of 5,340 feet (1,630 m) along the Puerco River to a high of 6,230 feet (1,900 m) at Pilot Rock; the average elevation is about 5,400 feet (1,600 m). The terrain varies from gentle hills and major petrified wood deposits in the south to eroded badlands in the north. Most of the park's intermittent streams—including Lithodendron Wash, Dead Wash, Ninemile Wash, and Dry Wash—empty into the Puerco River. In the southern part of the park, Cottonwood Wash and Jim Camp Wash flow into the Little Colorado River., what would be the answer ?

Answer: It is not possible to tell. Justification: Dreams are complex and fascinating phenomena that occur during our sleep, and their origins, meanings, and potential purpose have been debated by psychologists, scientists, and philosophers for centuries. Despite the intrigue and theories surrounding dreams, there is no decisive evidence to suggest that they can accurately predict the future. First, dreams are highly subjective and personal experiences that greatly differ from person to person. They are influenced by our emotions, thoughts, experiences, and daily life. Therefore, making a generalized statement about how dreams can predict the future for everyone is implausible. Second, dreams are most often a mixture of memories, emotions, and random thoughts, which can be organized and interpreted very differently by each individual. While it is true that sometimes dreams might appear to \\"predict\\" future events, this is more likely a result of coincidence or a self-fulfilling prophecy. Moreover, the scientific understanding of dreams is currently limited, and there is no neuroscientific or psychological explanation that supports the idea of dreams being prophetic or precognitive in nature. While some anecdotal accounts may imply connections between dreams and future events, these instances are generally exceptions and not indicative of a wider, universal capability. In conclusion, it is not possible to tell whether a specific dream can accurately predict the future due to the highly subjective nature of dreams, the lack of conclusive scientific evidence, and the influence of coincidence and self-fulfillment in interpreting dream experiences. Until a better understanding of how dreams function is developed, it remains impossible to ascertain their predictive capabilities."},{"question":"Given the question: Question: What do ships other than cargo ships do when they are in the ocean?

Ships other than cargo ships can serve various purposes, such as transporting passengers, conducting research, or serving as military vessels. Since \\"carry people\\" refers to the action of transporting passengers, it is the most fitting answer, as it aligns with the primary function of several types of non-cargo ships, such as passenger liners, ferries, and cruise ships. The other options do not adequately describe the actions or functions of ships other than cargo ships in a comprehensive manner or are situational occurrences (such as collisions or bottoming out) rather than functional purposes."},{"question":"Given the question: Information: - John W. Rosa Jr. ( born September 28 , 1951 ) is a retired United States Air Force Lieutenant General currently serving as President of The Citadel in Charleston , South Carolina . While on active duty , Rosa also served as the sixteenth Superintendent of the United States Air Force Academy . - A county seat is an administrative center, seat of government, or capital city of a county or civil parish.

As the largest and senior branch of the U.S. military, the modern U.S. Army has its roots in the Continental Army, which was formed (14 June 1775) to fight the American Revolutionary War (17751783)before the U.S. was established as a country. After the Revolutionary War, the Congress of the Confederation created the United States Army on 3 June 1784, to replace the disbanded Continental Army. The United States Army considers itself descended from the Continental Army, and dates its institutional inception from the origin of that armed force in 1775. - Charleston is the oldest and second-largest city in the U.S. state of South Carolina, the county seat of Charleston County, and the principal city in the CharlestonNorth CharlestonSummerville Metropolitan Statistical Area. The city lies just south of the geographical midpoint of South Carolina's coastline and is located on Charleston Harbor, an inlet of the Atlantic Ocean formed by the confluence of the Ashley and Cooper Rivers.

The majority of the provisions of the Act took effect on September 18, 1947, the day after the Senate confirmed James Forrestal as the first Secretary of Defense. - The United States Air Force Academy (also known as USAFA or the Air Force Academy), is a military academy for officer cadets of the United States Air Force. Its campus is located in the western United States in Colorado, immediately north of Colorado Springs in El Paso County. - Colorado is a state in the United States encompassing most of the Southern Rocky Mountains as well as the northeastern portion of the Colorado Plateau and the western edge of the Great Plains. Colorado is part of the Western United States, the Southwestern United States, and the Mountain States. Colorado is the 8th most extensive and the 22nd most populous of the 50 United States. The United States Census Bureau estimates that the population of Colorado was 5,456,574 on July 1, 2015, an increase of 8.50% since the 2010 United States Census. - A military academy or service academy (in \\"American English\\") is an educational institution which prepares candidates for service in the officer corps of the army, the navy, marine corps, air force or coast guard. It normally provides education in a military environment, the exact definition depending on the country concerned. - The United States Air Force (USAF) is the aerial warfare service branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of the seven American uniformed services. Initially part of the United States Army, the USAF was formed as a separate branch of the military on 18 September 1947 under the National Security Act of 1947. It is the most recent branch of the U.S. military to be formed, and is the largest and one of the world's most technologically advanced air forces. The USAF articulates its core functions as Nuclear Deterrence Operations, Special Operations, Air Superiority, Global Integrated ISR, Space Superiority, Command and Control, Cyberspace Superiority, Personnel Recovery, Global Precision Attack, Building Partnerships, Rapid Global Mobility and Agile Combat Support. - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody). - Aerial warfare is the use of military aircraft and other flying machines in warfare. Aerial warfare includes bombers attacking enemy concentrations or strategic targets; fighter aircraft battling for control of airspace; attack aircraft engaging in close air support against ground targets; naval aviation flying against sea and nearby land targets; gliders, helicopters and other aircraft to carry airborne forces such as paratroopers; aerial refueling tankers to extend operation time or range; and military transport aircraft to move cargo and personnel. Historically, military aircraft have included lighter-than-air balloons carrying artillery observers; lighter-than-air airships for bombing cities; various sorts of reconnaissance, surveillance and early warning aircraft carrying observers, cameras and radar equipment; torpedo bombers to attack enemy shipping; and military air-sea rescue aircraft for saving downed airmen. Modern aerial warfare includes missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles.

They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out. From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council. - The Charleston Harbor is an inlet (8 sq mi/20.7 km²) of the Atlantic Ocean at Charleston, South Carolina.

Identify the main elements in the sentence. 2. Find the corresponding words in Romanian. 3. Adjust the word order according to the Romanian grammar rules. 4. Assemble the translated sentence. Step 1: Identify the main elements in the sentence. - \\"So\\" is a conjunction used to introduce a conclusion. - \\"I guess\\" is an expression used to express an opinion or belief. - \\"she is perfect\\" is the main statement, with \\"she\\" being the subject and \\"is perfect\\" acting as the predicate. - \\"for this European Union\\" is a prepositional phrase providing context for the main statement.

Step 4: Assemble the translated sentence. The sentence in Romanian would be: \\"Deci, presupun că ea este perfectă pentru acest Uniunea Europeană.\\" So in Romanian, the sentence \\"So I guess she is perfect for this European Union\\" is translated as \\"Deci, presupun că ea este perfectă pentru acest Uniunea Europeană.\\""},{"question":"the criticism came in a broad-based attack on obama during a sunday news program in which cheney also disagreed with expanded white house involvement in the economy and denied that president george w. bush was responsible for the nation 's financial ills .

The embassy bombings of 1998 had focused attention on al Qaeda's finances. One result had been the creation of an NSC-led interagency committee on terrorist financing. On its recommendation, the President had designated Bin Laden and al Qaeda as subject to sanctions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. This gave theTreasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) the ability to search for and freeze any Bin Laden or al Qaeda assets that reached the U.S. financial system. But since OFAC had little information to go on, few funds were frozen. In July 1999, the President applied the same designation to the Taliban for harboring Bin Laden. Here, OFAC had more success. It blocked more than 34 million in Taliban assets held in U.S. banks. Another 215 million in gold and 2 million in demand deposits, all belonging to the Afghan central bank and held by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, were also frozen. After October 1999, when the State Department formally designated al Qaeda a \\"foreign terrorist organization,\\" it became the duty of U.S. banks to block its transactions and seize its funds. Neither this designation nor UN sanctions had much additional practical effect; the sanctions were easily circumvented, and there were no multilateral mechanisms to ensure that other countries' financial systems were not used as conduits for terrorist funding. Attacking the funds of an institution, even the Taliban, was easier than finding and seizing the funds of a clandestine worldwide organization like al Qaeda. Although the CIA's Bin Laden unit had originally been inspired by the idea of studying terrorist financial links, few personnel assigned to it had any experience in financial investigations. Any terrorist-financing intelligence appeared to have been collected collaterally, as a consequence of gathering other intelligence. This attitude may have stemmed in large part from the chief of this unit, who did not believe that simply following the money from point A to point B revealed much about the terrorists' plans and intentions. As a result, the CIA placed little emphasis on terrorist financing. Nevertheless, the CIA obtained a general understanding of how al Qaeda raised money. Question: \\"In 1999 the president decided to apply the same designations of freezing assets of the Taliban held in the United States and it resulted in how much money being frozen?\\" Response: \\"215 million\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","response":"No, the response does not correctly answer the question. The correct answer should be: \\"It resulted in more than 34 million in Taliban assets held in U.S. banks being frozen.

The last quarterback of the quarterback class of 1983 to be taken in the first round, Marino held or currently holds dozens of NFL records associated with the quarterback position. Despite never being on a Super Bowl-winning team, he is recognized as one of the greatest quarterbacks in American football history. Best remembered for his quick release and powerful arm, Marino helped the Dolphins become consistent postseason contenders, leading them to the playoffs ten times and one Super Bowl appearance in XIX, although a title victory ultimately eluded him during his career. On Sunday, September 17, 2000, at halftime of the Dolphins-Baltimore Ravens game at Pro Player Stadium, Dan Marino's jersey number of 13 was retired. The only other Dolphins jersey number retired at the time was Bob Griese's #12. Since then #39, Larry Csonka, has been retired as well. Marino joined the Dolphins Honor Roll the same day. In a year of accolades from the franchise he led for many years, the Dolphins also installed a life-size bronze statue of Marino at Pro Player Stadium (now Hard Rock Stadium) and renamed Stadium Street to Dan Marino Boulevard. In 2003, Marino was honored for his outstanding NCAA career at Pitt with an induction into the College Football Hall of Fame. In early 2004, Marino briefly returned to the Miami Dolphins as Senior Vice President of Football Operations, but resigned from the newly created position only three weeks later, saying that the role was not in the best interest of either his family or the Dolphin organization. Marino was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2005, one of only four Dolphins to be elected in their first year of eligibility (Jim Langer, Paul Warfield, Jason Taylor). He was inducted into the Hall of Fame on August 7, 2005 and was introduced by his oldest son, Daniel. During his induction speech, Dan threw \\"one last pass\\" to former teammate Mark Clayton, who was sitting in the audience. Marino was an analyst for CBS's Sunday pregame show The NFL Today, from 2002-2013. On February 18, 2014 it was announced that he was leaving the show. He was formerly a studio analyst on HBO's Inside the NFL, from 2002-2007. On August 24, 2014, Marino announced he would return to the Dolphins as a special adviser. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What position did Marino play?","response":"Daniel Constantine Marino Jr. was a former American football quarterback. He played this position for seventeen seasons with the Miami Dolphins of the National Football League (NFL). As a quarterback, he was instrumental in leading the team, becoming famed for his quick release and powerful arm. His exceptional skill resulted in him being considered one of the greatest quarterbacks in American football history, despite never being part of a Super Bowl-winning team. As a quarterback, Marino set or still holds many NFL records, showcasing his incredible talent and impact in that particular role. Some of these records include career achievements, such as passing touchdowns and passing yards, which further highlight his proficiency in his position. His abilities were instrumental in making the Dolphins a strong team within the NFL, leading them to the playoffs ten times throughout his career and to Super Bowl XIX once. Playing at the quarterback position requires a blend of physical skill, tactical understanding, and leadership, and Marino excelled in all these areas. He was not only physically fit, with a powerful arm and fast release, but also tactically astute, able to understand and adapt to the flow of the game as needed. Above all, he was a leader on the field, directing the team's offense, making important decisions, and motivating his teammates towards achieving their common goal. Despite not clinching a Super Bowl victory, his contributions, as a quarterback, to the Dolphins and the sport of American football are undeniable, earning him a spot in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2005. Marino is remembered not only for his on-field achievements but also for his post-retirement happenings. The Dolphins retired his jersey number, 13, and honored him with a life-size bronze statue at their stadium. Moreover, Stadium Street was renamed to Dan Marino Boulevard in his honor. He also spent time as an analyst for CBS's Sunday pregame show, The NFL Today, and HBO's Inside the NFL, sharing his deep understanding of the quarterback position and the game more broadly to millions of viewers.

Peter Sloan has boldly gone and filed legal paperwork in Florida demanding Shatner submit to a DNA test and cease claiming he isn’t his father. Sloan, 59, claims his birth mother, late Canadian actress Kathy McNeil, had a brief affair with Captain Kirk in Toronto. She gave him up for adoption at 5 days old. But Shatner, 85, denies Sloan is his son, and claims the local radio host is trying to unfairly live long and prosper from the connection. In the lawsuit, filed in Tampa, Fla., Sloan states he met with the actor on the set of “T.J. Hooker” in 1984 and Shatner initially “admitted he was the plaintiff’s father.” But a week later, Sloan claims, he was contacted by a rep for Shatner, who said he was “totally denying paternity at this point,” and added, “Don’t go public . . . [as it] could be horrendous for [Shatner],” who refused a DNA test. After Sloan surprised Shatner at a meet-and-greet, registered the Web domain petershatner.com and began a local CBS radio show in 2011 under the name Peter Shatner, he got a letter from Shatner’s lawyer, Erik Hyman, saying his actions were highly illogical. “Bill . . . confirmed to me once again that he is not your father. There have been many people over the years who have claimed to be his children or other relatives,” Hyman wrote, adding, “He is an incredibly busy, 80-year-old man, and is not interested in spending time discussing this issue with you.” Hyman didn’t comment last night. Sloan alleges in the papers that reps for Shatner had succeeded in getting Twitter to shut down his feed, and IMDb Pro to take down a page about a movie he was working on. Sloan — who wants to beam up to a jury trial — told us, “I am William Shatner’s son, and I just wish he would acknowledge me.” Shatner’s rep told us, “Mr. Shatner has three lovely daughters, but no sons . . . Mr. Shatner is aware of the lawsuit, but there’s nothing there because he isn’t his father.” This article originally appeared in the New York Post's Page Six.

Translate to French.","response":"Pour donner une réponse détaillée et longue à la question du Vice-Président Durant concernant la communication avec la société civile, je pense que l'Initiative Citoyenne Européenne est la meilleure réponse. L'Initiative Citoyenne Européenne (ICE) est un mécanisme de démocratie participative qui a été introduit par le Traité de Lisbonne dans l'Union européenne (UE). Il offre aux citoyens européens la possibilité de s'impliquer directement dans l'élaboration des politiques de l'UE en leur permettant de proposer des initiatives législatives aux institutions européennes. L'objectif principal de l'ICE est de renforcer le lien entre les citoyens et les institutions européennes en encourageant le débat public, en facilitant la participation des citoyens aux processus politiques et en garantissant que leurs voix soient entendues au niveau européen. L'Initiative Citoyenne Européenne fonctionne selon un processus bien défini. Pour lancer une initiative, un comité composé d'au moins sept citoyens résidant dans au moins sept États membres différents de l'UE doit être constitué. Une fois que l'initiative est enregistrée officiellement auprès de la Commission européenne, les organisateurs disposent d'un an pour recueillir le soutien d'au moins un million de citoyens européens provenant d'au moins sept États membres différents. Si cette condition est respectée, la Commission européenne est tenue d'examiner l'initiative et de décider si elle entend proposer une législation sur la base de celle-ci. Dans la pratique, l'Initiative Citoyenne Européenne a démontré son potentiel pour renforcer la communication entre les institutions européennes et la société civile. Les initiatives réussies ont souvent attiré l'attention des médias et ont conduit à des débats publics sur des questions d'importance pour les citoyens européens. Même si certaines initiatives n'ont pas abouti à des propositions législatives concrètes, elles ont contribué à sensibiliser le public et les responsables politiques aux problèmes soulevés. Il subsiste toutefois des défis à relever pour améliorer l'efficacité de l'Initiative Citoyenne Européenne. Parmi ceux-ci, on peut citer la complexité du processus de lancement et de soutien des initiatives, ainsi que les différentes conditions requises pour le soutien des citoyens dans chaque État membre. En outre, la Commission européenne pourrait adopter une approche plus proactive dans la communication avec les organisateurs des initiatives et le grand public, en fournissant des orientations claires et un soutien en matière d'information sur les différents aspects du processus de l'ICE. En conclusion, l'Initiative Citoyenne Européenne constitue un outil précieux pour promouvoir la communication entre la société civile et les institutions européennes. Il peut contribuer à renforcer le sentiment d'appartenance des citoyens à l'UE et à leur permettre de s'engager activement dans les processus décisionnels européens. Pour exploiter pleinement le potentiel de l'ICE, il conviendrait de continuer à travailler sur l'amélioration de son fonctionnement, la simplification des procédures et l'assistance aux citoyens et aux organisateurs qui souhaitent prendre part à ce processus démocratique unique."},{"question":"In this task, you're given the title of a story consisting of five sentences, numbered 1 through 5.

He loves her and her 16-year-old daughter. His work provides their income and allows her to attend nursing school. They married two years ago and their future was set. Except for one thing. Lucio came to the United States illegally and has been living as an undocumented immigrant. At any time he could be deported to his native Peru. Although undocumented, Lucio was able to find work as a contracting muralist in Houston, where Vera -- a U.S. citizen -- was born and raised. He learned to speak English in less than three years for work and the need to communicate with the \\"love of his life\\" as he put it. \\"I love this country and have made it my home. I want to be able to contribute to this country and give back in any way I can,\\" said Lucio. He said he got his Tax ID number as soon as he started working because he wanted to get started on the right path and pay his taxes. Vera also depends on Lucio for emotional support as she suffers from PTSD. She is a victim of sexual molestation and suffered mental and physical abuse while growing up. They'd always planned for Lucio to apply for citizenship, but were afraid of going into the system that would require him to return to Peru for up to 10 years. \\"I used to have nightmares about Lucio and I separating. I used to worry so much about it,\\" said Vera, \\"I wouldn't know what to do without him. If he left I wouldn't know how to run his business.\\" Now Vera and Lucio, whose last names we've agreed to withhold to protect their identity, are entering that system, hopeful that they won't be separated. Come March, many mixed-status families will breathe a sigh of relief knowing they won't have to remain separate for a long period of time while they apply to become legal residents in the U.S., according to a new rule made by the Department of Homeland Security announced last week. The new rule does not guarantee legal status to the undocumented immigrant -- the family still has to prove that the deportation of the spouse or parent would cause \\"extreme hardship\\" to the U.S. citizen. \\"I'm so relieved he gets to stay here while we go through this process, it makes a big difference,\\" Vera said. Sarah Monty, Lucio's immigration lawyer, is optimistic that his waiver will be approved. USCIS Director Alejandro Mayorkas said in a press release: \\"The law is designed to avoid extreme hardship to U.S. citizens, which is precisely what this rule achieves.\\" \\"The change will have a significant impact on American families by greatly reducing the time family members are separated from those they rely upon.\\" Under current law, immediate relatives of U.S. citizens who are not eligible to adjust status in the U.S. to become lawful permanent residents must leave the country and obtain an immigrant visa in their home country. Those who have accrued more than six months of unlawful presence while in the United States must obtain a waiver to overcome the unlawful presence bar before they can return to the U.S. after departing to obtain an immigrant visa. \\"This final rule facilitates the legal immigration process and reduces the amount of time that U.S. citizens are separated from their immediate relatives who are in the process of obtaining an immigrant visa,\\" said Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano in a press release. Monty fears that because the eligibility is so specific to a certain group of people, many undocumented immigrants are going to be confused as to why they do not qualify and suggests they seek out legal counsel. She said the new regulation was a huge step forward and sadly long overdue. Undocumented immigrants married to a U.S. citizen are the most vocal group said Monty, and if this provision works, this might extend to other groups. The new rule does not apply to U.S. children with an undocumented parent. In other words, you cannot give birth to your own waiver. The child, whether undocumented or not, must have a U.S. citizen as a parent. A legitimate concern for many -- if the waiver is denied -- is that individuals are also putting the government on notice that an undocumented spouse or parent lives in the U.S. because it might put themselves at risk for deportation. \\"Applying for this waiver means that you are putting yourself out there. ICE told me that their priorities are to go after criminal aliens,\\" said Monty, but added, \\"Undocumented immigrants without a criminal history do not need to worry.\\" The National Asian Pacific American Women's Forum applauds the Obama administration for their rule change. NAPAWF teamed up with the National Domestic Workers Alliance to advocate to keep women and their families together at the We Belong Together campaign. During the past two Christmases they organized thousands of letters from children to be sent to congress asking them to stop deporting their parents. \\"This is clearly a step in the right direction, but a lot more work needs to be done,\\" said Wida Amir, Immigrant Rights Program Director at NAPAWF in an interview, \\"We need a broader comprehensive immigration reform that provides a pathway to citizenship. Congress needs to address the whole package.\\" Summarize the highlights of this article.","response":"Vera and Lucio, a mixed-status couple, may benefit from a new rule by the Department of Homeland Security that allows undocumented immigrants married to U.S. citizens to apply for legal residency while remaining in the U.S. The couple must prove that deportation would cause \\"extreme hardship\\" to the U.S. citizen. This rule aims to reduce the time families are separated during the immigration process. However, it does not guarantee legal status and is specific to a certain group of people, prompting some to call for broader comprehensive immigration reform."},{"question":"Produce a detailed sentence about a restaurant using the following words: name = Loch Fyne, eatType = restaurant, food = Italian, priceRange = less than £20, familyFriendly = yes","response":"Loch Fyne, a delightful family-friendly restaurant, specializes in serving flavorful Italian cuisine at an affordable price range of less than £20 per person, making it an enticing destination for those looking to indulge in delicious culinary experiences without breaking the bank."},{"question":"Process: - Bats and other animals produce a high-pitched tone - The sound travels in waves, as sound does - The sound \\"bounces\\" off of a nearby object - The sound wave returns to the bat - The bat hears the echoed sound - Folds in the bat's ear and adaptations in the bat's brain enable it to determine the size, shape, and position of the other object via the properties of the returned sound waves - Other animals use echolocation in generally similar ways - Question: suppose person is very hungry happens, how will it affect less objects for the sound to bounce from. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","response":"C: No effect Echolocation is a biological sonar system used by certain animals, like bats, to navigate and locate food, especially during darkness or in areas with low visibility. When a bat emits high-pitched sound waves, these waves travel through the air until they come into contact with objects, such as trees, buildings, or insects. Upon striking an object, the sound waves bounce back to the bat, which then analyzes the returning sound waves to determine the size, shape, distance, and position of the object. Now, let's consider the scenario where a person is very hungry and there are fewer objects for the sound to bounce from, which means there are fewer obstacles or preys in the environment. It is important to understand that a bat's ability to perceive its surroundings using echolocation is not directly affected by the hunger of a person or any other animal. The process of echolocation remains the same, irrespective of the number of objects or the hunger level of an individual. However, fewer objects in the environment could potentially lead to a faster and more efficient echolocation process for the bat. With fewer obstacles, the bat can quickly and easily locate any available prey without having to navigate through a complex environment. This lack of environmental clutter would not hinder the bat's echolocation abilities and would still allow it to efficiently locate food sources. While the hunger of a person does not have a direct impact on the echolocation process, it is crucial to note that the overall ecosystem balance may be affected if there are fewer food resources. This can lead to ecological disruptions or food chain imbalances, which could potentially harm the populations of bats and other animals that coexist within the same ecosystem. To summarize, in the given scenario, the hunger level of an individual and the number of objects in the environment would not directly impact the echolocation abilities of bats or other animals using similar systems. The echolocation process would remain efficient, but the scarcity of food sources could lead to other ecological consequences, which are not directly related to the echolocation process itself."},{"question":"This is a correct answer to the following question about Fuck. Yes or no? Answer: It is an English word that is often used as a profanity, either to denote disdain or as an intensifier. Question: what does shut the fuck up mean in spanish?","response":"\\"Shut the fuck up\\" is an English phrase that is considered to be vulgar and rude, generally used to command someone to stop talking or to be quiet in an emphatic and aggressive manner. When translated to Spanish, the phrase \\"shut the fuck up\\" maintains its impactful and offensive sense. There are several ways to translate this phrase into Spanish, but its meaning and impact vary depending on the region and context in which it's being used. Some common Spanish translations of the phrase are as follows: 1. \\"Cállate la boca\\" - A more direct translation of \\"shut your mouth\\" without incorporating the vulgarity of the original phrase, but still commanding someone to be quiet. 2. \\"Cállate de una vez\\" - Literally meaning \\"shut up once and for all,\\" this phrase conveys a sense of urgency or exasperation with the person being told to be quiet. 3. \\"Cállate la puta boca\\" - Here, the use of the word \\"puta\\" intensifies the command and incorporates the offensiveness of the original phrase. This version would be considered highly disrespectful and should be used with caution. 4. \\"Cállate el puto hocico\\" - This variant uses \\"puto\\" as the intensifier and \\"hocico\\" rather than \\"boca\\" for the mouth, which is a slang term for the snout of an animal. This phrase is even more derogatory and insulting, comparing someone's mouth to that of an animal in a vulgar manner. It's essential to note that using these translations in conversation, especially the more offensive ones, can result in a negative reaction due to the aggressive and vulgar nature of the language used. It's also crucial to be aware of regional differences in the use of slang and swearing, as some expressions may carry different weight or meanings in different Spanish-speaking areas. Ultimately, using vulgar language should be done with caution and understanding of the possible consequences that may come from employing such powerful and impactful phrases."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Article: What do you usually do after school?

When the Israelites entered the Promised Land, they divided it between the twelve tribes that were descended from the sons of Jacob (or Israel). In this verse, the Bible describes the area that was given to the tribe of Gad as their territory. In the verse, the coast refers to the boundaries or borders of the territory given to the tribe of Gad. Jazer was a city located in the region of Gilead. Gilead was a mountainous area east of the Jordan River, known for its fertile soil and natural resources. The cities of Gilead were part of the territory of the tribe of Gad. The verse also mentions that half the land of the children of Ammon was included in the territory of Gad. The children of Ammon were descendants of Ammon, who was the son of Lot. This means that part of the land originally belonging to the Ammonites was allocated to the tribe of Gad. The verse continues by describing the territory's boundary as stretching to Aroer, which is before Rabbah. Aroer was a city situated near the Arnon River, approximately 13 miles east of the Dead Sea. Rabbah, also known as Rabbath Ammon, was the capital city of the Ammonites and is located in the modern-day country of Jordan. The phrase \\"before Rabbah\\" suggests that the territory of the tribe of Gad extended up to, but not including, Rabbah. It is important to remember that this verse is part of an ancient text, so the geographic locations and boundaries may not correspond exactly to modern-day maps and borders. Nevertheless, understanding the general regions inhabited by the various tribes of Israel can provide valuable context for studying biblical history and narratives."},{"question":"Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context?

Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as Rudie Blues, then Ska, later Blue Beat, and Rock Steady. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rock steady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument. - Clyde Jackson Browne (born October 9, 1948) is an American singer, songwriter, and musician who has sold over 18 million albums in the United States.

Article: Walter Wetzel had met Ryan Lamantia nearly eight years ago in a hospital waiting room. Both were very sick----Ryan with brain cancer, Walter with leukemia . Ryan, who was 3 at the time, began making silly faces at Walter and chatted about going home to change into his Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles costume. Several days later, Ryan moved to another hospital. Though they saw each other only a handful of times after that, Walter never forgot Ryan. \\"He inspired me to fight against my cancer,\\" said Walter, now 17, a football player. Then one day, Walter saw a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles shirt at a mall, which made him decide to search out Ryan. Back home, Walter typed in \\"Ryan Lake in the Hills brain cancer\\" on his computer, and a link to a Facebook page for Ryan came up. But, the news was shocking. Ryan had died on Sept. 8, 2005. He was 6. The Facebook page was for the Ryan Lamantia Foundation, a non-profit organization that Ryan's family formed after his death to raise money for brain cancer research. Walter left this message right away: .\\"Ryan is my hero. My trips to the hospital were always horrible, until the day I met Ryan.\\" Ryan's mom's eyes were filled with tears as she read Waiter's message. \\"We always knew Ryan was special, but to hear it from somebody else, it really means the world to us,\\" Lamantia said. Walter wasn't the only person who was greatly impressed with Ryan. \\"He was a little superhero,\\" said Wendy Stellpflug, a nurse at Children' s Memorial Hospital. \\"Ryan always kept his spirits high, even after he suffered hearing loss and experienced 14 operations.\\" \\"Ryan didn' t let his illness stop him. He always had a smile on his face,\\" said Dr. Stewart Goldman, the doctor who treated Ryan. Walter and his family have been in touch with the Lamantias for the past few weeks. And last week, they met for the first time since Ryan's death. The families told stories of being affected by cancer so young and Walter expressed his hope to volunteer with Ryan' s foundation.

Apparently, Laura collapses after crossing the finish line and is announced to be dead upon examination. Days later, Anne Ramstead (Patch Mackenzie) returns from the US Navy to visit her mother (Beverly Dixon) and her stepfather Ronald (Hal Boker) in town. After being dropped off from a truck driver, she notices a girl named Paula running into a wooded area, who is then killed by an assailant wearing black gloves and having a stopwatch. At the school, the assailant steals a photo of the track team and crosses out Paula's face after circling Laura's face.

To analyze the logical connection between these two statements, let's dissect the following information provided by the first statement: 1. There are three girls. 2. They are laughing and having fun. 3. They are preparing food. 4. The kitchen is messy. Now let's examine the second statement: \\"Three girls are cooking in the kitchen.\\" This statement suggests that: 1. There are three girls. 2. They are actively engaged in the process of cooking. 3. The action is taking place in the kitchen. In comparing the two statements, we can draw some logical connections: - Both statements mention three girls and a kitchen. - The first statement hints at some form of food preparation occurring, and the second statement directly asserts the girls are cooking. However, there are significant differences between the statements: - The first statement emphasizes the girls' emotional state (laughing and having fun), while the second statement makes no mention of the emotional context. - The first statement also highlights the messiness of the kitchen, which is absent in the second statement. Consequently, the second statement could be partially deduced from the first statement, but the focus on cooking is limited in the first statement, which deals more with the emotional state and the scene's setting. While preparing food could involve cooking, it is also possible that the girls are merely assembling ingredients (e.g., making sandwiches or a salad) or engaging in other preliminary tasks that do not fall within the stricter definition of cooking. As a result, it can be inferred that there is a possibility that \\"Three girls are cooking in the kitchen,\\" based on the first statement. However, the connection is not definitive, as some elements of the scene may not necessarily comply with the stricter meaning of cooking. In conclusion, while there are similarities between the two statements, they do not absolutely align. The first statement provides a broader picture of the situation, including emotions and surrounding details, while the second statement's perspective is narrower, focusing only on the cooking aspect, which might be only a part of the food preparation happening in the scene."},{"question":"Choose the sentence that goes against common sense.

On the other hand, placing leftovers in the fridge is a common practice to preserve food for later consumption."},{"question":"OK. You'll be given the following question. Please do chain-of-thought reasoning. Which of the following sentences is nonsensical? Options: - Sentence A: \\"The cop arrested the robber.\\" - Sentence B: \\"The cop arrested the fish.\\"","response":"To determine which of the following sentences is nonsensical, we first need to understand the context and meaning of each sentence. Sentence A: \\"The cop arrested the robber.\\" This sentence is logically coherent, as it describes a situation where a police officer (cop) performs their duty by arresting someone who has committed a crime (the robber). This is a reasonable and understandable scenario. Sentence B: \\"The cop arrested the fish.\\" This sentence is difficult to interpret literally and appears nonsensical. In a practical sense, a \\"cop\\" refers to a police officer, a human being who enforces law and order in society. In contrast, a \\"fish\\" is an aquatic animal that doesn't possess the ability to commit a crime punishable by human law enforcement. It is highly unlikely for any situation to occur where a police officer would need to arrest a fish. Based on these observations, Sentence B - \\"The cop arrested the fish.\\" - is nonsensical, as it cannot be reasonably understood within the context of the real world and practical use of language."},{"question":"Given the sentence \\"Two people carrying bags walk together.\\" is it true that \\"Two people are carrying backs walking next to each other.\\"?

Here's the step-by-step justification: 1. Both sentences mention \\"two people\\" or \\"two people are,\\" implying the presence of a pair. 2. Both sentences mention \\"carrying bags,\\" indicating that each person in the pair is holding a bag. 3. \\"Walk together\\" and \\"walking next to each other\\" are phrases that imply proximity and suggest a shared activity or purpose. The precise distance between the pair is not specified, but the sense of togetherness is present in both statements. Thus, based on the information provided, we can reasonably conclude that the two statements align and accurately represent the situation."},{"question":"What is the process of maintaining rosebushes in a lawn called?

Despite limited commercial success, The Birthday Party's influence has been far-reaching, and they have been called \\"one of the darkest and most challenging post-punk groups to emerge in the early '80s.\\" The group's \\"bleak and noisy soundscapes,\\" which drew irreverently on blues, free jazz, and rockabilly, provided the setting for vocalist Nick Cave's disturbing tales of violence and perversion. Their music has been described by critic Simon Reynolds as gothic, and their single \\"Release the Bats\\" was particularly influential on the emerging gothic scene. The nucleus of the band first met at the private boys school Caulfield Grammar School, in suburban Melbourne, in the early seventies. A rock group was formed in 1973, with Nick Cave (vocals), Mick Harvey (guitar), and Phill Calvert (drums), with other students John Cocivera, Brett Purcell and Chris Coyne (on guitar, bass and saxophone respectively). Most were also members of the school choir. The band played under various names at parties and school functions with a mixed repertoire of David Bowie, Lou Reed, Roxy Music, Alice Cooper and the Sensational Alex Harvey Band, among others. After their final school year in 1975 the band decided to continue as a four-piece group, with friend Tracy Pew picking up the bass. Greatly affected by the punk explosion of 1976 which saw Australian bands The Saints and Radio Birdman making their first recordings and tours, The Boys Next Door, as they were now called, began performing punk and proto-punk cover versions, such as \\"Blitzkrieg Bop\\" and \\"Gloria\\", and a few original songs. By November 1977 their set was dominated by fast original new wave material, such as \\"Sex Crimes\\" and \\"Masturbation Generation\\". The Boys' second guitarist, Rowland S. Howard, joined in 1978, and about this time, the group's sound changed dramatically. The addition of Howard's guitar was certainly a catalyst (his later use of audio feedback being a hallmark of the group) but there were other changes, as well: their sound drew upon punk, rockabilly, free jazz and the rawest blues, but defied concise categorization. Many songs were driven by prominent, repetitive basslines and frenetic, yet minimalist, drumming. Though the band was tightly rehearsed, the instrumentalists often sounded as if they were on the verge of collapse, this quality only emphasising the newfound mania of Cave's singing, and his expressionist lyrics. In producer/engineer Tony Cohen they found a willing accomplice to their experimentation and their refusal to repeat themselves; and in manager Keith Glass they found an enthusiastic financial backer. Glass' label Missing Link Records released all of the early Birthday Party records. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Who came up with The Boys Next Door?","response":"The Boys Next Door was formed by a group of friends who first met at a private boys school called Caulfield Grammar School in suburban Melbourne, in the early seventies.

Natural selection is a process that causes heritable traits that are helpful for survival and reproduction to become more common, and harmful traits, or traits that are not helpful or advantageous for survival to become more rare in a population of organisms. This occurs because organisms with advantageous traits are more \\"fit\\" to survive in a particular environment and have \\"adapted\\" to the conditions of that environment. These individuals will have greater reproductive success than organisms less fit for survival in the environment. This will lead to an increase in the number of organisms with the advantageous trait(s) over time. Over many generations, adaptations occur through a combination of successive, small, random changes in traits, and natural selection of those variants best-suited for their environment. Natural selection is one of the cornerstones of modern biology. Now, I have a new situation: David wants to revisit the theory of evolution proposed by Darwin and Wallace. He is particularly interested in two species of deer, species A and species B. Species A has some helpful traits, but species B has some harmful traits. He is planning to write a paper on why some species are greater in number while others are smaller in number. Answer this question please: Which species would have lesser reproductive success, species A or species B? Answer:","response":"Species B would have lesser reproductive success compared to species A. This is because species B has some harmful traits that may make it less suited to survive and reproduce in its environment. On the other hand, species A has helpful traits that provide it with an advantage in survival and reproduction, making it more likely to pass on its traits to future generations. This is in line with the theory of evolution by natural selection, wherein organisms with advantageous traits have greater reproductive success, leading to an increase in the presence of those traits over time."},{"question":"Given this review: \\"It is an faltu app\\" Would you recommend this app to a friend?

The son of a gardener who lives in a barrio section of Los Angeles, Santiago works as a busboy in a Chinese restaurant and helps with his father's (Tony Plana) gardening business. His ultimate dream is to play football professionally. Due to his poverty and the fact that he plays solely for a club made up of Hispanics from a local car wash, he feels his chances are slim. Santiago is noticed by Glen Foy (Stephen Dillane), a former Newcastle United player who works as a car mechanic but still has ties to his old team. Glen arranges to get Santiago a tryout with Newcastle United, who recently signed talented new player Gavin Harris (Alessandro Nivola). Needing to get to England, Santiago begins to save his money in an old shoe, but his father finds the stash and takes it to buy a GMC truck to allow them to work for themselves, believing that Santiago's dreams are hopeless. His dream is not lost though, as his grandmother (Miriam Colon) sells off her jewellery to buy him a ticket to England. Glen warmly welcomes Santiago to his home and takes him to the tryout. Unfamiliar with the English style, he performs poorly. Glen convinces the team's manager that Santiago needs a month's trial to show his full potential. Santiago does not tell club nurse, Roz Harmison (Anna Friel), that he has asthma. After a month, a jealous teammate crushes Santiago's inhaler before a reserve game. An asthma flare-up prevents him from being able to run hard, and his coach lets him go. While on his way to the airport Santiago meets Gavin Harris, who was late to arrive to the team.

In college, I needed money for school supplies, so in addition to slinging ice cream cones and “Awful Awfuls” at the Creamery, I picked up a few more jobs: working the dinner shift at a family restaurant, heaving trays of cocktails at a bar until 3AM, and cleaning houses. Needless to say, I was a wreck, and a big time abuser of coffee and cigarettes. One day just before my shift at the Creamery began, I slung back a huge coffee and hauled on a Newport cigarette in the kitchen (this was when you could do things like smoke in a restaurant kitchen.) I then went out to the dining floor and approached my first table, who had been given menus and was waiting for me to take their order. “Hi, How are you today?”, I cheerfully asked the mother and her three daughters, all looking under 12. “What may I get you?…..” Then, fade to black as a huge swooshing sound took over my head. Next thing I know, I’m on the floor, covered in blood, the girls are screaming blue murder, and my manager is shaking like a leaf as he coddles me. Apparently, I passed out right onto the table of the nice family I was waiting on, then fell back and whacked my head on the corner of a wall. I remember noticing that my kelly green polyester dress was an awful shade of bloodied brown. My main concern was that I had a hot date that night, and now I had to go to the emergency room! The ER doctor was able to sew my head up, and sent me home with a diagnosis of “syncope, unknown origin”. After a few hours, I still felt spacey, but insisted on going on the date. I remember we went to a nice Italian place on Federal Hill! Here’s the Garden City location, where I worked. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: when did the girl black out?

The number of technology companies with so-called “unicorn” designations of 1bn or more reached at least 131 on Monday, as healthcare websites, big-data firms and even Buzzfeed joined the kings of a new digital economy like Uber (51bn) and Fitbit (3.7bn). Related: Why is China's stock market falling and how might it affect the global economy? But Silicon Valley watchers examining the ripple effects of a selloff across sectors from Beijing to the Nasdaq, which continued in Asian trading on Tuesday although European markets bounced back, insist those valuations have been too generous for too long – and may have consequences for both the startup scene and the market at large. Whether the recalibration represents a market adjustment or a bursting tech bubble, investors say this week’s global stock rollercoaster is a sign of weakening confidence in the startup sector’s bigger bets – especially in what one venture capitalist called the increasingly difficult prospects “for some very high-end stuff to go public”. Related: Stock markets surge after China cuts interest rates - live updates Venture capitalists tend to lead the way in seed funding for glitzy startups, but they may be left without more risk-averse investors to bankroll the homestretch toward an IPO in a volatile environment. “I could see mutual funds pulling out of the market, leaving traditional VCs – and the VCs are going to be more aggressive on valuation,” said Maarten Hooft, managing partner at Quest Venture Partners, which focuses on early-stage investment. Such seed-stage investments and so-called “Series A” funding were likely to continue, VC backers and analysts agreed. But the ability of startups to rapidly snatch millions upon millions – particularly in the absence of profitability – could begin to fade away, with buyouts likely to rise. Bill Gurley, general partner at Benchmark, wrote on Twitter that he thought tech investors had become too fond of growth and had failed to pay enough attention to “names” that didn’t turn enough profit. The decline of technology stocks, which he said had been “getting crushed” since mid-July, could represent “an inflection point”. On Monday, the technology sector of the S&P 500 fared better than the index’s average, but prominent public tech stocks still suffered: “I think this is probably a correction rather than the start of the end of the bull market,” said Hooft. “People are trying to take into account the news coming out of China and Europe and emerging markets, and then trying to figure out how that plays back into the US tech sector. For me, what I was thinking about doing this morning when I saw Facebook was down was buying more Facebook.” Uncertainty in the startup world may mean good news for media giants large enough to weather a market correction – and perhaps even the smaller startups that could get swallowed up by them. “We’re at a point where both kind of core supports of the media ecosystem are shaking – advertising and the subscription business,” said analyst Rich Greenfield of the research firm BTIG. “Every one of these companies has ‘missed’ mobile.” Companies attracting upwards of 1bn in funding were “relatively small acquisitions” for giants like Disney, Greenfield noted. “You’ve got massive companies like Snapchat sitting out there,” he said, referring to the social network reported to be raising some 650m in its latest round – ahead of a valuation that could be worth 16bn. Hooft said for tech companies that have managed to acquire hundred-million-dollar stakes in the last year and a half, it is a buyer’s market and mergers-and-acquisition activity is very likely as soon as cash-rich techies “see an opportunity to do some talent acquisition or to buy cheaply into a space so they can give it a go”. And the larger tech firms themselves might get in on the action: “A lot of the tech companies have a lot of cash and they have to do something with it,” said Hooft. Regardless of who ends up acquired and who gets forced to IPO in an uncertain market, “valuations will probably be toned down a bit”, said the other venture capitalist, who asked not to be named. “The focus is on how hard it is going to be for some very high-end stuff to go public,” he said. “How does Pinterest go public now? Dropbox? Square?” Summary:","response":"In this news article, it talks about how some technology companies in Silicon Valley might be facing some challenges due to the global panic caused by the Chinese markets. These companies have been valued at very high amounts, but now it is believed that these valuations might have been too much and could affect the startup scene and the market in general. This could mean that it might be more difficult for these companies to get more money from investors and could lead to more buyouts or mergers happening. The bigger tech companies might also get involved in these mergers and buyouts, since they have a lot of money to spend. In simpler words, some technology companies in Silicon Valley may face some difficulties because of problems in the world market. This might make it harder for them to get money and could lead to bigger companies buying or joining with them."},{"question":"Which World Championship inaugurated in 1963 has been dominated primarily by the Australian and New Zealand national teams? What is the answer?","response":"The World Championship that inaugurated in 1963 and has been dominated primarily by the Australian and New Zealand national teams is the Netball World Cup, formerly known as the World Netball Championships. This international netball competition is organized by the International Netball Federation (INF) and held every four years. The first edition of the World Netball Championships took place in Eastbourne, England, in 1963. Since the inception of this competition, Australia and New Zealand have been the dominant forces, showcasing exceptional talent and skill on the world stage. These two teams have consistently performed at a high level, claiming the majority of the titles and cementing their status as leading netball nations. The Australian national netball team, also known as the Australian Diamonds, won the first championship in 1963. Since then, they have continued to achieve remarkable success, securing the championship title a total of 11 times (1963, 1971, 1975, 1979, 1983, 1991, 1995, 1999, 2007, 2011, and 2015).

These meanings have also changed over time. This change is no more evident than in Western society today, when notions of health and health promotion are being challenged and expanded in new ways. For much of recent Western history, health has been viewed in the physical sense only. That is, good health has been connected to the smooth mechanical operation of the body, while ill health has been attributed to a breakdown in this machine. Health in this sense has been defined as the absence of disease or illness and is seen in medical terms. In the late 1940s the World Health Organization challenged this physically and medically oriented view of health. They stated that health is a complete state of physical, mental and social well-being and is not merely the absence of disease (WHO, 1946). Health and the person were seen more holistically (mind / body / spirit) and not just in physical terms. The 1970s was a time of focusing on the prevention of disease and illness by emphasizing the importance of the lifestyle and behaviour of the individual. Specific behaviours which were seen to increase risk of disease, such as smoking, lack of fitness and unhealthy eating habits, were targeted. Creating health meant providing not only medical health care, but also health promotion programs and policies which would help people maintain healthy behaviours and lifestyles. While this individualistic healthy lifestyle approach to health worked for some (the wealthy members of society), it was of little benefit to people experiencing poverty, unemployment, underemployment or who had little control over the conditions of their daily life. During the 1980s and 1990s there has been a growing swing away from seeing lifestyle risks as the root cause of poor health. While lifestyle factors still remain important, health is being viewed also in terms of the social, economic and environmental contexts in which people live. This broad approach to health is...

This is exciting.Yet,on the other hand,competition breezes a pragmatic attitude.People choose to learn things that are useful,and do things that are profitable.Today's college education is also affected by this general sense of utilitarianism . Many colleges students choose Business,Law not Computer Programming as their majors convinced that these professions are where the big money is.It is not unusual to see the college students taking a part--time job as a warm--up for the real battle.I often see my friends taking GRE tests,working on English or computer certificates and taking the driving tests to get a license.Well,I have nothing against being practical.As the competition in the job market gets more and more severe,students do have reasons to be practical. However,we should never forget that college education is much more than skill training.Just imagine,if your utilitarianism becomes the main trend on campus,leaving no space for the cultivation of students' minds,or development of their soul.We will see university is training out well--trained spiritless working machines.If utilitarianism controls society,we will see people lost in the money--making adventures;we will see humanity losing their grace and dignity,and that,would be disastrous.I'd like to think society as encouraging and people regard profit or fame only as a horse that pulls the courage.Yet without the driver picking direction,the courage would go straight and may even end out in a dangerous situation. A certificate may give you some advantages,but not broad horizons,positive attitudes and personal integrity ,which are the wealth you cannot acquire through any quick fixed way. Although in today's world,the highest level of competition may not be that of skills or expertise ,but vision and strategy, your intellectual quality largely determines how far you can go in your career. Many college students choose to major in Business because _ . A) a businessman is very likely to make big money. B) studying business is less competitive. C) too many students have chosen Computer Programming. D) Computer Programming is not a must for them. A:","response":"Many college students choose to major in Business because a businessman is very likely to make big money (option A). This choice is often driven by the societal pressures and the general sense of utilitarianism prevalent in today's world. With increasing competition in the job market, students believe that pursuing degrees in fields such as Business and Law will offer them higher financial rewards, job security, and better career prospects as compared to other fields like Computer Programming. The utilitarian approach of college students focuses on the immediate and tangible gains associated with their choice of major, overlooking the broader aspects of education and personal growth. While it is understandable that students want to focus on securing their future in an increasingly competitive world, it is essential to recognize that the true worth of college education goes beyond the acquisition of skills or monetary rewards. Higher education institutions should be spaces where students can cultivate their intellectual curiosity, develop critical thinking, and hone their character. When utilitarianism becomes the guiding principle for educational choices, we run the risk of compromising the overall development of students. Focusing solely on subjects that promise financial returns might lead to the creation of professionals who are well-trained but lack a broader understanding of the world, a sense of empathy towards others, or the ability to adapt and innovate in the face of novel challenges. Moreover, the pursuit of profit-driven career paths does not offer an assured recipe for success. True success often lies in the ability to recognize the value of diverse educational experiences, the development of multifaceted interests, and the cultivation of personal integrity. A certificate or a degree in a specific field may help students secure a job, but attributes such as broad horizons, positive attitudes, and moral values are essential for achieving enduring success and satisfaction in their careers and lives. Therefore, it is crucial for both educational institutions and society at large to encourage students to look beyond immediate gains and foster an environment that nurtures holistic learning experiences. This would empower them to balance their professional aspirations with their personal growth, ultimately resulting in more satisfied and well-rounded individuals who can make meaningful contributions to the world."},{"question":"A can do a piece of work in 3 hours; B and C together can do it in 2 hours, which A and C together can do it in 2 hours.

Some random thoughts:","response":"We are given that A can do the work in 3 hours, B and C together can do it in 2 hours, and A and C together can do it in 2 hours. Let's denote the work rate of A, B, and C as A_work_rate, B_work_rate, and C_work_rate, respectively. The problem can be solved using the equation: work = rate × time Since A alone can complete the work in 3 hours, A_work_rate × 3 = 1 (as 1 is a complete work) A_work_rate = 1/3 (work per hour) B and C together can complete the work in 2 hours, so: (B_work_rate + C_work_rate) × 2 = 1 B_work_rate + C_work_rate = 1/2 Similarly, A and C together can complete the work in 2 hours, so: (A_work_rate + C_work_rate) × 2 = 1 A_work_rate + C_work_rate = 1/2 Since A_work_rate + C_work_rate = B_work_rate + C_work_rate, A_work_rate = B_work_rate, which implies: B_work_rate = 1/3 (work per hour) Now, to find the time B takes to complete the work alone, we can use the same formula as before: work = rate × time 1 = B_work_rate × time 1 = (1/3) × time time = 3 hours So, B alone will take 3 hours to complete the work.

It is a large, flightless parrot belonging to the family Strigopidae within the order Psittaciformes, which includes all other parrots and parakeets. The word \\"kakapo\\" comes from the Maori language, with \\"kaka\\" meaning \\"parrot\\" and \\"po\\" referring to night, aptly describing the bird's nocturnal behavior. The kakapo is often dubbed as the world's rarest and most extraordinary parrot. Kakapos are known for their distinct physical appearance and behavioral characteristics. They are characterized by their soft moss-green plumage, interrupted with splashes of yellow, black, and brown feathers that provide them an excellent camouflage against the forest floor. A mature kakapo weighs around 2-4 kilograms, making it the world's heaviest parrot species. The male is generally larger than the female. One peculiar aspect of the kakapo is its inability to fly, due to its short wings and heavy body. Instead, it has evolved to become an excellent climber and ground dweller. It uses its strong legs and sharp claws to climb trees or traverse through dense undergrowth. While predominantly nocturnal, kakapos rely heavily on their well-developed sense of smell and whisk-like feathers around the face, which are quite unique among parrots, to navigate in the darkness of night. Kakapos inhabit subalpine scrublands, tussock grasslands, and forested areas, ranging from lowlands to altitudes reaching up to 1000 meters. During the daytime, they usually take refuge in underground burrows, hollow tree trunks, or dense vegetative cover. Their diet consists primarily of plant material, including leaves, fruits, seeds, and bark, which can vary depending on season and habitat. One of the most notable features of the kakapo is its complex and fascinating breeding behavior. They exhibit a lek-based polygynous mating system, in which male individuals gather in designated display areas known as \\"arenas\\" to perform elaborate courtship rituals, known as \\"booming.\\" Males create a deep, resonant sound to attract females by inflating their thoracic sacs and slowly and rhythmically releasing air. The booming can be heard up to a few kilometers away. Females visit several males before selecting a mate based on the quality of the performance. Kakapo breeding is infrequent and depends largely on the availability of their primary food source - native rimu trees and the fruit they produce. The sporadic fruiting of these trees occurs only once every 2-4 years. In a good breeding season, a female kakapo can lay up to three eggs in a hollow tree or underground burrow. The mother then incubates the eggs for nearly 30 days and raises the chicks alone, as males do not contribute to parental care. Today, the kakapo is considered critically endangered as per the classification by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The primary threats to the kakapo's survival include habitat loss due to deforestation, predation by invasive species introduced by human settlers (such as rats, stoats, and cats), and their slow rate of reproduction. Conservation efforts are underway to save the species, including habitat restoration, predator control, and a dedicated Kakapo Recovery Programme initiated by the New Zealand Department of Conservation, which focuses on the intensive management of the existing kakapo population, captive breeding, and release on pest-free islands. As a result of these efforts, the kakapo population has gradually increased from a mere 51 individuals in 1995 to around 200 as of 2020, making it an inspiring example of how dedicated conservation initiatives can help revive the fortunes of endangered species."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Kendall drove home one night to find her place had been broked into.

In Czech, \\"pilot\\" can be translated as \\"pilot\\" and \\"replied\\" can be translated as \\"odpověděl\\". Here are the steps to generate the Czech translation: Step 1: Translate numbers. \\"One\\" is \\"jedna\\" in Czech, \\"six\\" is \\"šest\\", and \\"five\\" is \\"pět\\". However, since we're communicating numbers spoken individually, I will use the shortened pronunciation forms for one and five: - One as \\"jed\\" (\\"j\\" as in \\"yes\\", pronounced like \\"yed\\") - Five as \\"pětk\\" (pronounced like \\"pyetk\\") So \\"One-six-five\\" would be \\"Jed-šest-pětk\\". Step 2: Translate \\"a Tomcat pilot replied\\". A matching translation for \\"a Tomcat pilot\\" in Czech is \\"pilot Tomcatu\\". \\"replied\\" can be translated as \\"odpověděl\\".

And again with their settlement with the FCC back in 2011 (that they likely violated with their recent offenses) over deceiving consumers by telling them their information was private, but then repeatedly sharing it and making it public.

I want to talk about the ugly. We connect people. That can be bad if they make it negative. Maybe it costs a life by exposing someone to bullies. Maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools. And still we connect people. The ugly truth is that we believe in connecting people so deeply that anything that allows us to connect more people more often is *de facto* good.

This assumed three population groups separated by large geographic ranges (European, African and East Asian).

Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","response":"To answer the question, let's break down the process step by step: Step 1: The pancake mix is mixed with a liquid. This creates a batter that typically contains carbohydrates, including sugars, from the flour and other ingredients in the mix. Step 2: The pancake is cooked, and the individual consumes it. In the digestive process, the carbohydrates in the pancake are broken down into simple sugars, primarily glucose. Step 3: Glucose enters the bloodstream, raising the blood sugar levels. Step 4: In response to the increase in blood sugar levels, the pancreas secretes insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps cells absorb glucose from the bloodstream and convert it to energy or store it for later use, therefore lowering the blood sugar levels. Step 5: Blood sugar levels return to normal as insulin does its job of regulating glucose uptake by cells. As for the supposed perturbation, consuming the pancake mix mixed with liquid in the form of cooked pancakes will increase the blood sugar levels in the body. This increase will prompt the pancreas to produce and release more insulin to regulate the elevated blood sugar levels. Therefore, the perturbation will result in a higher insulin response compared to when no pancake is consumed. Answer: More effect."},{"question":"Please check if these have the same meaning.

To help solve this problem, she co-founded the California Architecture Archives Network (or CalArchNet) with her Cal Poly SLO colleague Jessica Holada. Together they have organized a series of one-day mini-conferences designed to foster dialogue and collaboration among librarians, archivists, and curators at California institutions that house architecture archives. The goal of these semiannual meetings is to create a space for convergence among professionals who intersect with architectural archives in different ways. Architecture archives, often containing large drawings and scale models, present unique problems due to their size and fragility. CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs. October 27 marked the third meeting of CalArchNet, held at the Palm Springs Art Museum, Architecture and Design Center, with representatives from 13 institutions in attendance. Topics discussed included historic site preservation research methodology, leveraging statewide resources to enhance discovery of collections, security considerations, GIS mapping technologies, and the use of linked open data to make connections between collections.

He is best known as the lead singer and lyricist of the post-punk band Joy Division. Joy Division released their debut album, \\"Unknown Pleasures\\", in 1979 and recorded their follow-up, \\"Closer\\", in 1980. - Dance music is music composed specifically to facilitate or accompany dancing. It can be either a whole musical piece or part of a larger musical arrangement. In terms of performance, the major categories are live dance music and recorded dance music. While there exist attestations of the combination of dance and music in ancient times (for example Ancient Greek vases sometimes show dancers accompanied by musicians), the earliest Western dance music that we can still reproduce with a degree of certainty are the surviving medieval dances. In the Baroque period, the major dance styles were noble court dances (see Baroque dance). In the classical music era, the minuet was frequently used as a third movement, although in this context it would not accompany any dancing. The waltz also arose later in the classical era. Both remained part of the romantic music period, which also saw the rise of various other nationalistic dance forms like the barcarolle, mazurka, ecossaise, ballade and polonaise. - Grant Robert Gee (born 24 October 1964) is a British film maker, photographer and cinematographer. He is most noted for his 1998 documentary \\"Meeting People Is Easy\\" about the British alternative rock group Radiohead. - Peter Hook (born 13 February 1956) is an English singer, songwriter, composer, multi-instrumentalist and record producer. He is best known as the bassist and co-founder of English rock bands Joy Division and New Order. - Bernard Edward Sumner (born 4 January 1956), also briefly known as Bernard Albrecht, is an English singer, songwriter, musician and record producer. He is a founding member of both Joy Division and New Order, and is widely credited with the latter band's move towards electronica and synthpop. - Post-punk (originally \\"new musick\\") is a broad type of rock music that emerged from the punk movement of the 1970s, in which artists departed from punk rock's raw, accessible style to pursue a variety of avant-garde sensibilities. Attempting to break from rock tradition, post-punk artists experimented with sources such as electronic music, black dance music and the avant-garde, as well as novel recording technology and production techniques. The movement also saw the frequent intersection of music with art and politics, as artists incorporated ideas from sources such as modernist literature, critical theory, cinema, and performance art. Accompanying these musical developments were communities that produced independent record labels, visual art, multimedia performances and fanzines in conjunction with the music. - Joy Division is a 2007 British documentary film on the British post-punk band Joy Division , directed by Grant Gee . The film assembles TV clips , newsreel , pictures of modern Manchester and Manchester in the late 1970s , and interviews .

Film critic Philip French : \`\` Someone says in the film that the revolutionary step they made was to progress from the usual punk group 's angry statement : ' Fuck you . ' Joy Division were the first to say : ' We 're fucked . ' There is a particularly impressive sequence in which dark , despairing tracks of urban alienation and angst from the 1979 album Unknown Pleasures are accompanied by a speeded - up nocturnal journey around Manchester .

Stream of Consciousness Reasoning: When thinking about the survival of a human without having access to two of life's most basic necessities - food and water - one must take into consideration the numerous biological processes happening within the body. The human organism requires nutrients and energy from food in order to maintain and carry out all of the essential functions that keep it alive and functional. These processes include, but are not limited to, providing energy for movement, tissue repair, growth, and important chemical reactions. In addition to needing nutrients from food, the body is also largely composed of water, which makes up around 60% of a human's total weight. Water plays a critical role in various bodily processes necessary for survival such as digestion, absorption, circulation, transportation of nutrients, regulation of body temperature, and maintaining cellular and tissue functions. Without food, the body goes through stages of depletion as it begins to break down stored fats and proteins for energy. After a period of time, the body would exhaust its reserves and vital organs would ultimately begin to fail. Similarly, without water, the body would suffer from severe dehydration as the body cannot function properly without a sufficient amount of water to support cellular and tissue functions, leading to severe weakness and, eventually, organ failure. In light of these facts, it becomes apparent that given the overwhelming importance of food and water in the maintenance and functioning of a human body, it is not possible for a person to survive without ever eating food or drinking water. Therefore, the answer to the question is: no."},{"question":"Use the following highlights to write an article: Minnesota Lottery allows drivers to purchase tickets at the gas pump.

She says Francis had close, good relationship with country's large Jewish community. She says he's been accused of abetting dictator there in '70s, '80s; He denies this. Ghitis: He's conservative, has shown interest in inequality, sees poverty as rights issue.","response":"Title: Pope Francis and Argentina: The Crucible for a Unique Papacy Introduction Frida Ghitis brings to light that Argentina has a unique makeup and set of circumstances that have undoubtedly shaped the new pope, Pope Francis. From his close relationship with the country's large Jewish community to allegations of abetting a dictatorship, Pope Francis emerges as a conservative figure with a keen interest in addressing inequality and poverty as a rights issue. A Pope Deeply Rooted in an Eclectic Argentine Culture Argentina, a nation known for its vibrant mix of cultures and identities, has undoubtedly played a significant role in shaping Pope Francis's character and his papacy. As the birthplace and gathering point of immigrants from around the world, Argentina has allowed the pontiff to engage with diverse communities and develop a rich understanding of various religious traditions. One of these close ties is Pope Francis's warm relationship with Argentina's sizeable Jewish community. Growing up in Buenos Aires, which at one point had the second largest Jewish population in the Americas, he had ample opportunities to engage with its members. This strong connection allows the Pope to build bridges between the Catholic and Jewish communities, fostering interfaith dialogue and understanding. A Controversial History: Allegations and Denials Nevertheless, Pope Francis's Argentine origins have also stirred controversy. He has been accused of abetting the dictatorship that ruled the country in the 1970s and 1980s, during which a brutal crackdown against leftists led to the \\"Dirty War.\\" Pope Francis has vigorously denied these claims, insisting that he attempted to protect people from the regime and that the accusations are part of a smear campaign. While history may never fully reveal the extent of Pope Francis's involvement or non-involvement in these events, it is evident that his experiences during this tumultuous time have shaped his thinking and approach to social justice. A Conservative Pope with a Focus on Inequality and Poverty Though Pope Francis is undoubtedly conservative in his religious views, according to Frida Ghitis, he has shown a genuine interest in addressing societal issues, including inequality and poverty. This Pope sees poverty as a rights issue, reflecting his belief in the dignity and worth of every human being. His concern for the poor, rooted in his Argentine upbringing, led him to choose the name Francis, after St. Francis of Assisi, who devoted his life to the service of the impoverished. In doing so, Pope Francis sends a powerful message about his commitment to addressing social injustice and working for change. Conclusion The unique makeup and circumstances of Argentina have indeed served as a crucible for Pope Francis. As a product of his time, upbringing, and cultural environment, his papacy is marked by both conservative and progressive tendencies. Though controversy has shadowed his origins, his commitment to addressing poverty and inequality remains at the forefront of his papacy. The Argentine connection has undoubtedly shaped Pope Francis's life and continues to influence his role as a bridge-builder and advocate for the downtrodden in an increasingly globalized and divided world."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Set in 1988, the film begins in a music store with recent MIT graduate Matt Franklin (Topher Grace), his twin sister Wendy (Anna Faris), and his best friend Barry Nathan (Dan Fogler) as they try to figure out when to see Matt's dream girl Tori Frederking (Teresa Palmer).

Context: SEOUL — The head of the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) on Tuesday said the North Korean leadership is hopeful that following a possible denuclearization deal, the international community will increase humanitarian aid for millions of people in the country who are living in poverty and suffering from malnutrition. “There is a tremendous sense of optimism by the leadership, by the people I met with, in the hopes that they will be turning a new chapter in their history, a new page,” said David Beasley, the Executive Director of the WFP during a briefing in Seoul. The WFP director visited North Korea for four days last week, spending two days in Pyongyang and two visiting rural areas outside the capital. Beasley said he was given “remarkable” access during his visit to the restrictive state where contact with foreigners is tightly controlled. Government minders also accompanied him during his visit. Beasley, a former governor of the U.S. state of South Carolina, was nominated to head the WFP last year by U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley, who is also a former South Carolina governor. With the upcoming summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un now scheduled to be held in Singapore on June 12, there are increased expectations that an agreement will be reached to dismantle the North’s nuclear, missile and chemical weapons programs that threaten the U.S. and its allies. Details over the scope and timing of the denuclearization process must still be worked out, but the North Korean leader has indicated he wants to resolve the dispute to focus on improving the economic conditions of the country. Ending the severe U.S. led sanctions banning 90% of North Korean trade that were imposed for the North’s repeated nuclear and missile tests, would open the door to increased economic investment and cooperation.

This possibility has raised hopes that the international community will step up their support for millions of people living in poverty and suffering from malnutrition in the country. The head of the United Nations World Food Program (WFP), David Beasley, expressed the optimism of the North Korean leadership during his briefing in Seoul, noting their anticipation of turning a new chapter in their history. As denuclearization talks take place, North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Un, has indicated his desire to resolve the dispute in order to focus on improving the country's economic conditions. By potentially agreeing to dismantle their nuclear, missile, and chemical weapons programs, North Korea could see an easing of severe U.S. led sanctions, which currently ban 90% of their trade, and result in increased economic investment and cooperation.

The kidneys are essential organs in the body responsible for filtering waste products, excess substances, and fluids from the bloodstream in the form of urine. They also play a crucial role in regulating blood pressure, managing electrolyte balance, and maintaining overall body homeostasis. In Berger's disease, the kidney's filtering units called glomeruli become inflamed and damaged due to the deposition of immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies, leading to a breakdown in their normal function. IgA is an essential protein in the immune system that helps fight infections; however, in Berger's disease, these proteins accumulate abnormally in the glomeruli, which results in inflammation and damage. As the disease progresses, these abnormalities interfere with the kidneys' capabilities to filter waste and remove fluids, causing blood and protein to leak into the urine. The condition can lead to various health complications if not treated promptly and effectively. The underlying cause of Berger's disease is not yet entirely understood, but it is believed to involve genetic and environmental factors. The condition is more prevalent in certain populations such as Asians and Europeans, and males are more likely to develop the disease compared to females. Symptoms associated with Berger's disease can range from mild to severe and may include: 1. Hematuria: The presence of blood in urine, often after an upper respiratory or gastrointestinal infection, is a common symptom. Blood may be visible to the naked eye or may only be detectable by microscopic examination. 2. Proteinuria: Excess proteins, such as albumin, leak into urine due to damage to the glomeruli. 3. Edema: Swelling of different body parts, particularly legs, ankles, and hands, due to fluid accumulation. 4. High blood pressure: Impaired kidney function can lead to increased blood pressure levels. 5. Fatigue: Accumulation of waste products in the blood can cause feelings of tiredness and fatigue. Berger's disease can have varying degrees of severity, from asymptomatic cases to severe kidney damage. The treatment and prognosis of the condition greatly depend on the severity of the kidney damage and the individual's response to treatment. Current therapies involve blood pressure control through medication, dietary modifications, and the reduction of proteinuria using angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). In more severe cases, immunosuppressive therapy or even kidney transplantation may be necessary. In conclusion, Berger's disease is a kidney disorder characterized by inflammation and damage to the glomeruli due to abnormal accumulation of IgA antibodies. This condition affects the kidneys' ability to filter waste and remove excess fluids, leading to blood and protein leakage into urine, and can cause various health complications if left untreated. Although the exact cause of Berger's disease remains unclear, evidence suggests a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Treatment options depend on the severity of the disease and generally aim to manage symptoms, protect the kidney from further damage, and improve overall kidney function."},{"question":"Process: - Pollution enters natural water sources such as rivers and lakes - The pollution negatively affects the water quality - The pollution negatively affects the health of plants and animals - The plants and animals have shorter, less healthy lives - The plants and animals do not reproduce very well - The number of plants and animals decreases over time - The quality of water gets worse and worse as there are no plants or animals to clean it - Eventually there is nothing living in the water and it is unusable - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less pollution in the environment happens, how will it affect pollution levels increase in the water.

He was 87. Goldman, who twice won screenwriting Oscars for All The President’s Men and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, passed away last night in his Manhattan home, surrounded by family and friends. His health had been failing for some time, and over the summer his condition deteriorated. We will be following this and building out the story today, but I wanted to let Deadline readers know straight away. From his scripting work to his books like Adventures in the Screen Trade, Goldman is one of the greats, a true legend. Goldman began as a novelist and transitioned to writing scripts with Masquerade in 1965. While his greatest hits were the indelible pairing of Robert Redford with Paul Newman in the George Roy Hill-directed Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, and Redford and Dustin Hoffman in the Alan Pakula-directed toppling of President Richard Nixon drama All The President’s Men, he wrote the scripts for many other great movies. The list includes the Hoffman-starrer Marathon Man (Goldman also wrote the novel, which made dentist visits even more undesirable),as well as The Princess Bride, The Stepford Wives, The Great Waldo Pepper, A Bridge Too Far, Chaplin and Misery. He also did a lot of behind the scenes script doctoring without taking a screen credit, as on films that included A Few Good Men and Indecent Proposal. Beyond that, Goldman was a renowned memoirist. His travelogue through the movie business, Adventures In The Screen Trade, was a primer for wannabe screenwriters and for journalists covering them. When I first got to Variety about 30 years ago, veteran reporters there told me Adventures was the best book to understand the chaos, randomness, the headaches, futility and joy of the movie business. Goldman is probably best known for his apt description of Hollywood: “Nobody knows anything.” I still have the book on my shelf. Fox There will be people better versed to describe the fact that Goldman knew more than many, but I will recount an anecdote that the late Jonathan Demme told me when I did a look back on the 25th anniversary of the making of The Silence of the Lambs. Demme had the picture locked, and had a friends and family screening of the film before he turned in the cut. One of the attendees was Goldman, whom Demme didn’t know all that well. The following day, Goldman called. Well, better to let Demme tell it: “We watched the movie,” Demme said. “It played like gangbusters, and we got terrific response from the audience. Craig [McKay, the film’s editor] and I were high-fiving each other. Okay, we’re locked, baby. I got a phone call the next day at my house. ‘Hi, this is William Goldman calling.’ I was like, ‘Oh, hi. God, one of my favorite writers of all time.’ He said he thought the picture was terrific, but he thought there was one section that was holding it back from its full potential power. This came after Dr. Lecter escapes, and there was this scene that took somewhere between eight and twelve minutes. Jack Crawford is called on the carpet. They are summoned by the attorney general, who was played by Roger Corman. Crawford’s kicked off the case. Clarice is kicked out of the academy. They go downstairs, and there’s this blistering, really terrific scene on the steps. Clarice just can’t let go of saving the senator’s daughter. Her brain is going a mile a minute, and Crawford is telling her, ‘Didn’t you hear what happened up there? I’m off the case. You’re out of this thing. There’s no way on earth…’ But she said she was going to Calumet. Clarice looks at Crawford and says, ‘God Dammit Jack, I’m going.’ We cut to her in the car, crossing the bridge where she’s about to encounter Buffalo Bill. So Goldman said, ‘Take all that out.’ I’m like, ‘What? That’s one of the biggest scenes in the movie. Really? What?’ And he says, ‘That’s what my gut’s telling me. You guys should really take a look at it.’ So I was like, ‘Well, listen, thank you for this. Goodbye.’ Orion “I got to the cutting room and told Craig about this conversation, almost laughing about it. Craig was not really pleased because we were really…locked. But we said, let’s just take that section out, and watch the movie again, right here on the Steenbeck in the cutting room. So we lifted it out, watched it. And the power of just going to Jodie without all that other stuff…I think Goldman might’ve called it ‘the third act launchpad exposition stuff.’ It was just an extraordinary difference, an immeasurable improvement. That is William Goldman.” ||||| Rating is available when the video has been rented. This feature is not available right now.

Answer:","response":"Yes"},{"question":"who was mickey mouse's voice for the first 20 years??","response":"Mickey Mouse's voice during the first 20 years was primarily provided by Walt Disney, the co-creator of Mickey Mouse and the iconic founder of the Walt Disney Company. Mickey Mouse made his debut in the short film, \\"Steamboat Willie,\\" on November 18, 1928. Walt Disney not only collaborated with Ub Iwerks to design the character but also personally lent his voice to Mickey. For the majority of the first 20 years, Walt Disney took on the role as Mickey Mouse's voice actor in short films, feature films, and other animated productions. This includes the notable short films such as \\"Plane Crazy\\" (1929), \\"The Band Concert\\" (1935), and \\"Brave Little Tailor\\" (1938). Walt's distinctive falsetto voice enhanced Mickey's character, making him an audience favorite and establishing Mickey Mouse as the key mascot of the Disney brand. However, in 1946, James G. MacDonald, a sound effects artist and Disney collaborator, took over from Walt Disney as the principal voice actor for Mickey Mouse. This transition happened because Walt Disney's ever-growing responsibilities as a studio head, philanthropist, and visionary led to him having less time and difficulty maintaining Mickey's high-pitched voice. Although Walt Disney stepped away from providing Mickey's voice, he continued to contribute to the character's development and personality until his passing in 1966. The success and popularity of Mickey Mouse, maintained through voice talents like Walt Disney and James G. MacDonald, have made the character an enduring and beloved icon for nearly a century."},{"question":"Write a brief sentence.","response":"Step 1: Determine the subject for the sentence.

Though Las Vegas had developed a powerful local economy, few major outside investments were made in the city, due primarily to mob infiltration and its inherent ties to illegal activities. That would change dramatically with the 1966 arrival of billionaire Howard Hughes. A legitimate businessman, Hughes was nonetheless eccentric and dramatic, a style suited to the Las Vegas ethos. True to the myth, the reclusive Hughes immediately cloistered himself in the Desert Inn's penthouse. Several weeks later he was asked — then ordered — to vacate the room to make room for high rollers, whereupon he promptly bought the property and fired the management. Thus began Hughes' legendary three-year, 300-million Las Vegas buying spree. When it was over, Hughes owned six casinos, an airport, and an airline, along with numerous plots of land stretching from the Strip to the mountains. Hughes' actions would have beneficial repercussions, both immediate and lasting. Because of the new legitimacy Las Vegas acquired from Hughes' investments, established companies such as Hilton Hotels bought into the gaming business, and their influence helped draw a line in the desert sand between legitimate operations and mob casinos, where illegal skimming of profits was rampant. That, combined with the formation of the Nevada Gaming Control Board, would signal the beginning of the end for heavy mob influence in the city. Las Vegas with a Vision As corporations moved in and the mob was slowly pushed out, a new Las Vegas emerged. The legitimization of gambling led to its increased legalization across the US. What was once a sure thing became much more competitive. Casino operators had to reassess the nature of their business. The first to really do so was Steve Wynn, a Las Vegas resident and owner of the Golden Nugget. In the mid-1980s, Wynn began plans to reinvigorate Las Vegas with a new resort. He bought several Strip properties — the Silver Slipper and Castaways among them — and demolished them to make way for a new kind of resort — Mirage — which became an instant success. Question: \\"What along with the Nevada Gaming Board signaled the beginning of the end for heavy mob influence in Las Vegas?\\" Answer: \\"Companies such as Hilton Hotels getting into the gaming business in Las Vegas\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","response":"Yes, the answer to the question is correct. The new legitimacy Las Vegas acquired from Hughes' investments and established companies such as Hilton Hotels buying into the gaming business, along with the formation of the Nevada Gaming Control Board, signaled the beginning of the end for heavy mob influence in Las Vegas."},{"question":"Translate the following sentence to Czech: Don't ask more.","response":"Step 1: Break down the sentence \\"Don't ask more\\" can be split into: - Don't = negative form, expressing a prohibition or forbidding something - ask = to make a request, seek information - more = an increased or greater extent Step 2: Find Czech words for each part of the sentence - Don't = ne - ask = ptej se - more = více Step 3: Arrange the sentence according to Czech grammar In Czech, the negative form \\"ne\\" is placed in front of the verb. The verb \\"ptej se\\" is an imperative form, which matches with the intended meaning of a prohibition or forbidding something. \\"více\\" is an adverb, and it is typically placed after the verb. Combining these words in the correct order, we get: Ne ptej se více. This translates to \\"Don't ask more\\" in Czech."},{"question":"Q:Generate a 5-star review (1 being lowest and 5 being highest) about an app with package com.frostwire.android.

Diana Scott is a beautiful, bored young model married to Tony Bridges. One day, Diana meets Robert Gold, a literary interviewer/director for television arts programmes, by chance when she is spotted on the street by his roving film crew and interviewed by him about young people's views on convention. Diana is invited to watch the final edit in the TV studio and there their relationship starts. After liaisons in bleak hotel rooms they leave their spouses (and, in Robert's case, children) and move into an apartment. As a couple, they become part of the fashionable London media/arts set. Initially, Diana is jealous when Robert sees his wife while visiting his children, but she quickly loses this attachment when she mixes with the predatory males of the media, arts and advertising scene, particularly Miles Brand, a powerful advertising executive for the \\"Glass Corporation\\" who gets her a part in a trashy thriller after she has sex with him. The bookish Robert prefers the quiet life; it is he who now becomes jealous, but increasingly detached, depressed and lonely. Diana attends a high-class charity draw for world hunger for which she is the face. The event, adorned by giant images of African famine victims, is at the height of cynical hypocrisy and bad taste, showing Diana's rich white set, which now includes the establishment, playing at concern, gorging themselves, gambling and generally behaving decadently. Already showing signs of stress from constantly maintaining the carefree look demanded by the false, empty lifestyle to which she has become a prisoner, Diana becomes pregnant, and has an abortion.

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer to this question is:","response":"If pressure were to cause weaker gravity instead, a smaller black hole would likely be affected as follows: 1. The star burns until it runs out of fuel. 2. The star can no longer support its weight. 3. The layers of hydrogen press down on the core. 4. The core gets smaller and smaller under the pressure. 5. The pressure, contrary to our assumption, causes gravity to weaken. If weaker gravity were the result, the smaller black hole would not form as easily or may not form at all, as the gravity would not be strong enough to cause the collapsing star to compress further into a black hole. In relation to the second effect mentioned, which is the gravity becoming so powerful that nothing can escape it, the supposed perturbation would have a major impact based on the assumption that pressure causes weaker gravity. Since gravity would not be as strong, the smaller black hole would have less of an effect on its surroundings, including light. Therefore, the perturbation would result in a \\"less\\" effect on the second effect mentioned. The black hole would not have the same irresistible gravitational pull, and the escape of light and other nearby matter might be possible. However, this scenario is purely hypothetical and does not align with our current understanding of the physics of black holes."},{"question":"Identify the most salient words in this sentence: ducks for sale at a market","response":"Step 1: Read the sentence carefully and understand its meaning.

Options: - destroy enemy - write letter - explode - punch - release energy Let's think step by step:","response":"When you experience anger, a series of psychological and physiological processes occur inside your body and mind: 1. Trigger: Anger is usually triggered by an external event or an internal thought related to perceived injustice, mistreatment, or frustration. 2. Brain reaction: Your brain releases stress hormones, such as adrenaline and cortisol, preparing your body for a potential threat or challenge. 3. Fight-or-flight response: Your body enters the fight-or-flight mode, which prepares you to either confront the source of anger or flee from it. This response involves increased heart rate, blood pressure, and muscle tension. 4. Emotional experience: You may feel a strong, intense emotion of anger, resentment, or irritation. 5. Cognitive processes: Your thoughts might become more negative, focused on blaming others for your feelings, and may include a desire to retaliate or seek justice. 6. Behavioral responses: How you choose to deal with anger can vary. Some possible responses include: a. Destroy enemy: This involves confronting and engaging in a physical or verbal altercation with the source of your anger. b. Write letter: Writing a letter (or journaling) is a healthier option to express and process your emotions, providing an outlet to release the anger. c. Explode: This term is often used to describe an outburst of anger, including yelling, cursing, or losing control of one's emotions. d. Punch: Physically expressing anger through punching (either an inanimate object, like a punching bag, or a person) is also a response, although it can have harmful consequences. e. Release energy: This involves engaging in activities that help diffuse anger and release built-up energy, such as exercising, meditating, or deep breathing. It is important to note that responding to anger in a healthy and constructive manner is crucial for mental and emotional well-being. Managing anger through self-awareness, emotional regulation, and problem-solving can lead to better relationships and personal growth."},{"question":"Q:Information: - Central Asia or Middle Asia is the core region of the Asian continent and stretches from the Caspian Sea in the west to China in the east and from Afghanistan in the south to Russia in the north.

As if that wasn’t enough, it then came to light that they have also been tracking and storing users’ phone call and text message data, including “who contacted whom, what time, and how long the conversation was.” This is nothing new, as we can see from this 2012 “study” in which they deliberately manipulated news feeds to influence users’ emotional state. And again with their settlement with the FCC back in 2011 (that they likely violated with their recent offenses) over deceiving consumers by telling them their information was private, but then repeatedly sharing it and making it public. And then there’s The Ugly Memo, in which a FB exec justifies growth at any cost in the name of connecting people, even if that results literally in people dying: We talk about the good and the bad of our work often. I want to talk about the ugly. We connect people. That can be bad if they make it negative. Maybe it costs a life by exposing someone to bullies. Maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools. And still we connect people. The ugly truth is that we believe in connecting people so deeply that anything that allows us to connect more people more often is *de facto* good. And up until this most recent Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook was negotiating with various healthcare organizations to share patients’ health data with FB so they could match it up to your social circle to allegedly provide better health care. Um yeah right. Each time this stuff happens, they issue an apology (or a justification for their behavior) and promise they will take steps to better inform users and protect their privacy, but it’s clear that this is just lip service at this point.

Sentence 2: Louis XII was a flamboyant rascal with a taste for gaudy styles. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","response":"The first sentence describes a comparison of architectural styles between the Louis XII wing and another structure built a dozen years later, likely referring to the Renaissance era, and deals specifically with the contrast in elegance and panache of the two structures. The information provided in this sentence focuses on the difference of design and taste that the two constructions exhibit. In contrast, the second sentence is a direct characterization of Louis XII as a flamboyant rascal with a taste for gaudy styles. With the information provided in the first sentence, it is not sufficient to conclude with certainty the truth behind the statement made in the second sentence, as it primarily focuses on a comparison of architectural structures. While one may draw some inference between the description of the Louis XII wing as reflecting the character of his heir (a debonair Renaissance prince), it does not directly correlate to Louis XII's personality or preferences. However, it does imply that Louis XII may have had different taste in building designs, and the subsequent construction possesses a different level of elegance and panache. In conclusion, we can glean limited insights into the persona of Louis XII from the comparison between architectural designs or aesthetics in the first sentence. However, the statement in the second sentence cannot be substantiated solely based on the given information in the first sentence. Additional historical knowledge and context about Louis XII would be required to determine whether the second sentence is indeed true."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a context paragraph, a question based on that and corresponding answer of a question.

The new company will attempt to limit the shipyard's losses, participants said. \\"The situation is that the bankruptcy court will get out of the shipbuilding business. Everything will be taken over by the new company,\\" said Christian Andersson, executive vice president of Oy Waertsilae, former parent of Waertsilae Marine. Once its ownership is finalized, the new company will open talks with state-appointed receivers to buy or lease Waertsilae Marine's shipyard facilities. Subcontractors will be offered a settlement and a swift transition to new management is expected to avert an exodus of skilled workers from Waertsilae Marine's two big shipyards, government officials said. Under an accord signed yesterday, the government and Union Bank of Finland would become major shareholders in the new company, each injecting 100 million Finnish markkaa (23.5 million). Oy Waertsilae is to contribute 200 million markkaa, most of it as subordinated debt, and take a minority stake in the new company. Customers holding contracts for Waertsilae Marine's undelivered ships are expected to subscribe most of the remaining 170 million markkaa in share capital, government officials said. Waertsilae Marine's biggest creditor is Miami-based Carnival Cruise Lines Inc. Carnival, which has three ships on order from Waertsilae Marine, presented claims for 1.5 billion damages in the bankruptcy court this week.

Please answer step by step:","response":"Yes, manta rays live in water above the safe temperature for cold food storage. To help you understand this answer, let's go through the details step by step. Step 1: Cold food storage temperatures The safe temperature for cold food storage is usually below 40°F (4°C). This temperature prevents the growth of bacteria and helps preserve the quality of perishable foods. Step 2: Manta ray habitats Manta rays are a species of large, flat marine fish known for their unique appearance and gentle nature. They inhabit tropical, subtropical, and temperate ocean waters around the world. Manta rays are generally found near coral reefs, seamounts, and coastal areas where they feed on small marine organisms like zooplankton. Step 3: Water temperatures in manta ray habitats The water temperature in areas where manta rays live varies depending on the location and season, but it is generally warmer than the safe temperature for cold food storage. In tropical and subtropical regions, typical sea surface temperatures range from around 68°F (20°C) to 86°F (30°C). In temperate regions, sea surface temperatures can range from around 50°F (10°C) to 68°F (20°C). Both of these ranges are above the safe temperature for cold food storage. Conclusion: Manta rays live in water above the safe temperature for cold food storage. While the safe temperature for cold food storage is below 40°F (4°C), manta rays typically inhabit waters with temperatures ranging from 50°F (10°C) to 86°F (30°C), depending on the specific location and season. Since these temperatures are warmer than the safe cold food storage temperature, manta rays do indeed live in waters that are warmer than what's considered safe for cold food storage."},{"question":"Question: What would be the ★-rating of this review (★ being the lowest and ★★★★★ being the highest)? \\"Thanks to this app Thanks to this app my moto G can connect to any network\\" Answer:","response":"Based on the positive sentiment expressed in the review, it seems like the user is satisfied with the app's ability to connect their Moto G to any network.

He turned down the collar of his greatcoat and checked to make sure his big Army Colt was loose in its holster.

An aria typically features a single character expressing their feelings, thoughts, and emotions through the music. Due to its expressive character and melodious qualities, an aria can be considered one of the most popular and essential elements in operas. The verifiable fact should be rephrased as: \\"Many operas include an aria, a moment when one character sings solo.\\" The chain of thought and solution for this question is: 1.

Instead, it was Clinton who delivered the statement with a decisive win in her home state. With 90 precincts reporting, she led 58 to 42 percent, and was declared the winner by The Associated Press. Story Continued Below \\"Today you proved again, there's no place like home,\\" she told a raucous crowd in New York City afterward. \\"This one's personal,\\" she added of her victory. The emphatic win by Clinton could finally put to rest lingering doubts about her struggles to stamp out the Vermont independent — and allow her to finally pivot in earnest to the general election as the slugfest continues on the Republican side. A huge haul of 247 delegates, plus 44 superdelegates, is up for grabs — though the state’s complex, proportional allocation scheme makes a big swing in the totals for either candidate unlikely. After a big loss in his native state for the Brooklyn-born Sanders, it won't get any easier. Five states that vote on April 26 — Pennsylvania, Maryland, Connecticut, Delaware and Rhode Island — are seen as largely playing to Clinton's strengths. Ted Devine, a senior adviser to Sanders, told the AP late Tuesday night that the campaign would \\"assess where we are\\" after those contests. Polling pointed to a sizable win for Clinton in New York — the main question Democratic insiders were debating heading into the election was whether she would prevail by single or double digits. Sanders played the expectations game from all angles, breathlessly telling supporters in an email over the weekend that a win would be “the most shocking upset in modern political history” and arguing that polls have repeatedly underestimated his strength, before seeming to acknowledge a likely defeat. \\"What does it mean if I lose?\\" Sanders told CBS’ Charlie Rose on Monday. \\"It means that I lose.\\" Speaking to supporters on Penn State University's campus hours before polls closed across the border, Sanders predicted, \\"We're going to do just fine tonight in New York.\\" Afterward, he flew back to his home state of Vermont. He told reporters when he landed that he planned \\"to get recharged and take a day off.\\" Clinton, a seasoned veteran in New York campaigning after eight years as its senator and multiple statewide wins, campaigned with gusto, knowing a loss on her own turf would be a huge embarrassment. As she focused her efforts largely on New York City, making the rounds on niche media to compensate for Sanders’ 2 million spending advantage on the airwaves, Bill Clinton barnstormed upstate New York with as many as four events a day. Clinton told a hip-hop radio show on Monday that she carries hot sauce with her everywhere she goes, and she sipped on bubble tea at Kung Fu Tea in Queens. \\"I am hoping to do really well tomorrow,” Clinton told supporters at one campaign stop Monday. “I am hoping to wrap up the Democratic nomination. But! But. But I’m not taking anything for granted. I gotta quickly add that before anybody has the wrong impression.” Delegates Remaining: 56 Delegates 2,814 1,893 56 0 2,382 Delegates Needed for Nomination The tailored approach appeared to be paying off: The RealClearPolitics polling average for the New York Democratic primary had Clinton ahead of Sanders by 12 points heading into Election Day. Sanders was just as aware of the stakes. New York has long leaped out on the primary calendar as a crucial opportunity for Sanders to have any semblance of a case that his late winning streak makes him the stronger general election candidate. Overtaking Clinton is all but impossible — he trails by 244 pledged delegates, or nearly 700 counting superdelegates — but an upset in the state would have given the Vermont lawmaker a potent talking point that the momentum and enthusiasm heading into the home stretch of nomination season was decidedly on his side. Fresh off a big streak in recent contests, most notably Wisconsin two weeks ago, Sanders went after Clinton aggressively in New York. He mocked Clinton’s refusal to release transcripts of her 200,000-plus-a-pop speeches to Wall Street banks and accused her of playing both sides of the fracking debate. A rally he staged in Washington Square Park drew 27,000 people, another glaring reminder of the disconnect between delegate counts and raw enthusiasm for the two candidates. But missteps hurt his efforts. His suggestion last week that Clinton was unqualified to be commander in chief dogged Sanders for days, and he was eventually forced to clean up, saying it was really Clinton’s judgment he was questioning. Also working against him was New York’s closed primary system; only registered Democrats can cast ballots in the primary, walling off independents who make up a big chunk of Sanders’ support. Roughly 3 million voters in the state are not registered as Democrats or Republicans, including nearly a half-million registered independents. “Today, 3 million people in the state of New York who are independents have lost their right to vote in the Democratic or Republican primary,” Sanders complained on Election Day. “That’s wrong.” His campaign also seized on reports of voters having problems casting ballots on Tuesday. \\"We are deeply disturbed by what we’re hearing from polling places across the state,\\" the Sanders campaign said in a statement. \\"From long lines and dramatic understaffing to longtime voters being forced to cast affidavit ballots and thousands of registered New Yorkers being dropped from the rolls, what’s happening today is a disgrace.\\" But the size of Clinton's win swamped those complaints and left Sanders without room to even claim a moral victory. \\"Victory,\\" she told her supporters, \\"is in sight.\\" ||||| Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump prepares to speak during a New York primary night campaign event Tuesday, April 19, 2016, in New York. (AP Photo/Julie Jacobson) (Associated Press) Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump prepares to speak during a New York primary night campaign event Tuesday, April 19, 2016, in New York. (AP Photo/Julie Jacobson) (Associated Press) WASHINGTON (AP) — Hillary Clinton emerged from New York's presidential primary closer to clinching the Democratic nomination and becoming the first woman to reach that milestone. Republican Donald Trump strengthened his own path to the general election with a commanding victory, but has little room for error in the states ahead. The front-runners now hope to replicate their strong showings in New York in the cluster of Northeastern states next up on the primary calendar. Clinton was scheduled to spend Wednesday campaigning in Pennsylvania, while Trump had a rally planned in Maryland, as well as Indiana. Following her win in New York, a jubilant Clinton made clear she was moving past her unexpectedly competitive primary battle with Bernie Sanders and setting her sights on the general election. \\"The race for the nomination is in the home stretch, and victory is in sight,\\" Clinton declared to cheering supporters. She mentioned Sanders only briefly as she appealed for support from his loyal backers, and saved her toughest talk for Trump and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, deeming both \\"dangerous\\" for America. Trump, too, is eager to move past the Republican primaries. With at least 89 of New York's 95 delegates in hand, he insisted it was \\"impossible\\" for any of his rivals to catch him and warned party leaders against trying to take the nomination away from him at the convention. Ohio Gov. John Kasich won at least three New York delegates; Texas Sen. Ted Cruz was in danger of getting shut out. Neither has a mathematical chance of clinching the nomination before the Republican convention in July, though they hope to block Trump's path and overtake him at the GOP gathering. Cruz panned Trump's win in New York as little more than \\"a politician winning his home state,\\" then implored Republicans to unite around his candidacy. \\"We must unite the Republican Party because doing so is the first step in uniting all Americans,\\" Cruz said. A freshman senator who has clashed repeatedly with his own party, Cruz has generated only lukewarm support from GOP leaders who see him as the only option for stopping Trump. Clinton's triumph padded her delegate lead, putting her 80 percent of the way toward clinching the Democratic nomination that eluded her eight years ago. Appealing to Sanders' loyal supporters, Clinton said, \\"There is more that unites us than divides us.\\" Exit polls suggested Democrats were ready to rally around whomever the party nominates. Nearly 7 in 10 Sanders supporters in New York said that they would definitely or probably vote for Clinton if she is the party's pick. Sanders energized young people and liberals in New York, as he has across the country, but it wasn't enough to pull off the upset victory he desperately needed to change the trajectory of the Democratic race. Still, the Vermont senator vowed to keep competing. \\"We've got a shot to victory,\\" Sanders said in an interview with The Associated Press. However, his senior adviser, Tad Devine, said later that the campaign planned to \\"sit back and assess where we are\\" after a string of contests next week. Of the 247 Democratic delegates at stake in New York, Clinton picked up at least 135 while Sanders gained at least 104. Trump needed a strong showing in New York to keep alive his chances of sewing up the GOP nomination before the party's July convention — and to quiet critics who say the long primary season has exposed big deficiencies in his campaign effort. Having spent months relying on a slim staff, Trump has started hiring more seasoned campaign veterans. Cruz is trying to stay close enough in the delegate count to push the GOP race to a contested convention. His campaign feels confident that it's mastered the complicated process of lining up individual delegates who could shift their support to the Texas senator after a first round of convention balloting. Kasich, the only other Republican left in the race, bested Cruz on Tuesday and is refusing to end his campaign despite winning only his home state. Trump's political strength, though he boasts of drawing new members to the party, has left some Republicans concerned that his nomination could splinter the GOP. Among Republican voters in New York, nearly 6 in 10 said the nominating contest is dividing the party, according to exit polls. Still, about 7 in 10 New York Republicans said the candidate with the most votes in primary contests should be the Republican presidential nominee The surveys were conducted by Edison Research for The Associated Press and television networks. Trump now leads the GOP race with 845 delegates, ahead of Cruz with 559 and Kasich with 147. Securing the GOP nomination requires 1,237. Among Democrats, Clinton now has 1,893 delegates to Sanders' 1,180. Those totals include both pledged delegates from primaries and caucuses and superdelegates, the party insiders who can back the candidate of their choice regardless of how their state votes. It takes 2,383 to win the Democratic nomination. ___ AP writers Thomas Beaumont, Lisa Lerer, Ken Thomas, Jill Colvin, Emily Swanson and Steve Peoples contributed to this report. ___ Follow Julie Pace at http://twitter.com/jpaceDC and Jonathan Lemire at http://twitter.com/JonLemire ||||| After More Than 100,000 Voters Dropped In Brooklyn, City Officials Call For Action Enlarge this image toggle caption Stephanie Keith/Getty Images Stephanie Keith/Getty Images Following widespread irregularities at polls in Brooklyn Tuesday, New York City officials are calling for major reforms at the Board of Elections. The problem was first identified in a an analysis of state voter enrollment statistics by WNYC's Brigid Bergin. The Board of Elections then confirmed that more than 120,000 voters have been dropped from the rolls in Brooklyn alone since November. \\"No other borough in New York City nor county in the rest of the state saw such a significant decline in active registered Democrats. In fact, only 7 of the state's 62 counties saw a drop in the number of Democrats. Everywhere else saw the numbers increase,\\" WNYC found. The more than 120,000 dropped includes 12,000 people who moved out of the borough, 44,000 people who were moved from active to inactive voter status, and 70,000 voters removed from the inactive voter list, according to the station. The New York City Comptroller's office announced Tuesday that it would undertake an audit of the \\"operations and management of the Board of Elections.\\" In a letter to the board's director, Comptroller Scott Stringer outlined several issues with voting, including the removal of voters. \\"These errors have conspired to bar first time and longtime voters from exercising their fundamental democratic right,\\" he wrote. In a statement late Tuesday afternoon, Mayor Bill de Blasio said the Board of Elections should return every voter to the rolls who was recently purged, WNYC reports. De Blasio said City Hall has received word of entire city blocks and buildings full of voters that were purged from the voting lists. He said the Brooklyn office of the Board of Elections should be removed from the process. He says the perception of irregularities \\"undermines the integrity of the entire electoral process and must be fixed.\\" ||||| New York City (CNN) Bernie Sanders' campaign on Tuesday called reports of voting irregularities in New York state \\"a disgrace\\" as local officials rushed to condemn the city Board of Elections for stripping more than 125,000 Democratic voters from the rolls. \\"It is absurd that in Brooklyn, New York -- where I was born, actually -- tens of thousands of people as I understand it, have been purged from the voting rolls,\\" Sanders said during an evening campaign rally at Penn State University. In an email to CNN, Sanders spokesman Karthik Ganapathy called the state's handling of the primary a \\"shameful demonstration.\\" \\"From long lines and dramatic understaffing to longtime voters being forced to cast affidavit ballots and thousands of registered New Yorkers being dropped from the rolls, what's happening today is a disgrace,\\" he said. Election Justice USA, a voter rights organization, told CNN it will go to Federal District Court in Brooklyn on Wednesday morning as part of an effort to have provisional ballots from voters disenfranchised by the Board of Elections counted before the primary results are certified. Earlier in the day, a federal judge denied a temporary restraining order filed by the group that would have opened the polls to New York Democrats claiming they were unlawfully listed as Republican or unaffiliated. A little before the polls here closed at 9 p.m., the polling site coordinator at Brooklyn Borough Hall estimated that about 10% of those who showed up to vote on Tuesday were previously removed by the board of elections. More than 2,800 people had voted at the location. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Hillary Clinton supporter, called for major reforms to the Board of Elections as a series of snafus continued to bubble up, including reports of the errant \\"purge\\" in Brooklyn. \\"It has been reported to us from voters and voting rights monitors that the voting lists in Brooklyn contain numerous errors, including the purging of entire buildings and blocks of voters from the voting lists,\\" de Blasio said in a statement Tuesday calling on the board to \\"reverse that purge.\\" \\"The perception that numerous voters may have been disenfranchised undermines the integrity of the entire electoral process and must be fixed,\\" he said. Speaking to CNN on Tuesday night, Board of Elections Executive Director Michael Ryan pushed back against the growing criticism, saying, \\"We're not finding that there were issues throughout the city that are any different than what we experience in other elections.\\" Of the 126,000 Democratic voters taken off from the rolls in Brooklyn, Ryan said 12,000 had moved out of borough, while 44,000 more had been placed in an inactive file after mailings to their homes bounced back. An additional 70,000 were already inactive and, having failed to vote in two successive federal elections or respond to cancel notices, were removed. \\"Since the eyes and ears of the world are on New York, issues that are relatively routine for any election are receiving greater scrutiny,\\" he added. In pledging to audit the board, the office of New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer issued a much stricter verdict. \\"The people of New York City have lost confidence that the Board of Elections can effectively administer elections and we intend to find out why the BOE is so consistently disorganized, chaotic and inefficient,\\" he said. The Clinton campaign had no immediate comment when asked by CNN. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's voter complaint hotline received more than 1,000 complaints throughout the day, Schneiderman's office said in a statement. The same office, he added, had heard only around 150 on the day of the 2012 general election. As of 3:50, @AGSchneiderman voter hotline received > 700 complaints from voters across NYS. Context: Office received ~150 for '12 general. — Nick Benson (@nick_benson) April 19, 2016 In a statement out Wednesday, Schneiderman said, \\"I am deeply troubled by the volume and consistency of voting irregularities, both in public reports and direct complaints to my office's voter hotline.\\" Schneiderman said his office was starting \\"inquiries in additional areas of the State where voting irregularities appeared unusually high.\\" \\"Voting is the cornerstone of our democracy, and if any New Yorker was illegally prevented from voting, I will do everything in my power to make their vote count and ensure that it never happens again,\\" he said. ||||| What is a summary?","response":"Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have both won their respective primaries in New York, bringing them one step closer to securing their parties’ nominations. Clinton’s win over Sanders has put to rest any doubts about her struggles to become the Democratic frontrunner, receiving around 58% of the votes compared to his 42%. Meanwhile, Trump managed to win at least 89 of the state’s 95 delegates, calling his victory “incredible”. Polls showed that 6 out of 10 Republican voters said that the nomination contest was dividing the party."},{"question":"Q: In this task, you are given two lists A,B.

We can start by creating a 2D matrix (let's call it dp) to store the length of the longest common subsequence up to each element in the lists. Here are the steps to find the longest common subsequence: 1. Initialize the 2D matrix dp with dimensions (len(A)+1) x (len(B)+1). The first row and the first column should be filled with zeros, as these represent an empty subsequences. 2. Iterate through the elements of list A (outer loop) and list B (inner loop). 3. For each iteration, compare the current elements of A and B: a. If the elements are equal, the value at dp[i+1][j+1] is equal to dp[i][j] + 1. This means we found a common element, and we should increment the length of the common subsequence so far. b. If the elements are not equal, the value at dp[i+1][j+1] is the max(dp[i][j+1], dp[i+1][j]). This means we should take the longest subsequence found so far. 4. The value at dp[len(A)][len(B)] will represent the length of the longest common subsequence. 5. To find the actual longest common subsequence, we can backtrack from the bottom-right corner of the dp matrix to the top-left corner. 6. While backtracking, if dp[i][j] is greater than dp[i-1][j] and dp[i][j] is greater than dp[i][j-1], that means the elements at A[i-1] and B[j-1] were part of the longest common subsequence. Add A[i-1] (or B[j-1], as they are equal) to the result and move diagonally up-left (i-=1, j-=1).

Not wanting a hangover in the morning, the man drank wine instead of beer because the pick from the following. 1). wine had a lower alcohol content. 2). beer had a lower alcohol content.","response":"Not wanting a hangover in the morning, the man drank wine instead of beer because the wine had a lower alcohol content. This decision was based on his understanding of the relationship between alcohol content and the severity of the hangover, as well as his personal preferences and experiences with alcoholic beverages. In general, wine and beer differ in their alcohol content, with wine usually having a higher alcohol content than beer. However, it is essential to note that these values can vary significantly depending on the specific type of wine or beer being consumed. For instance, certain light beers may possess an alcohol content similar to or even lower than some wines, making the choice between wine and beer more complex. In this particular case, the man was faced with a wine that had a lower alcohol content compared to the beer available. By choosing the wine, he aimed to minimize the amount of alcohol consumed, and in turn, reduce the likelihood and severity of a hangover the following morning. A hangover occurs due to the dehydrating effects of alcohol and the buildup of toxins such as acetaldehyde in the bloodstream. By consuming a beverage with a lower alcohol content, the man hoped to mitigate these factors, leading to a milder or even nonexistent hangover. Additionally, personal preferences and experiences with different types of alcoholic beverages may have influenced the man's choice. He may have found from past experiences that he was more likely to suffer from a hangover after consuming beer rather than wine, irrespective of the alcohol content. This could be due to individual responses to various ingredients, such as the hops and gluten found in beer, which can cause inflammation or allergic reactions in some people. Furthermore, the man's choice could also have been influenced by factors such as taste, social context, or even dietary considerations. For example, he may have found the wine to be more enjoyable or sophisticated, making it a more appropriate choice for the evening. Alternatively, he could have been following a specific diet that allows for wine, but not beer, enabling him to stay congruent with his dietary goals while still enjoying an alcoholic beverage. In conclusion, not wanting a hangover in the morning, the man drank wine instead of beer due to the wine's lower alcohol content. This decision accounted for factors such as personal preferences, experiences, and the beverage's potential effects on his overall well-being. By choosing a beverage with a lower alcohol content, he aimed to reduce the likelihood and severity of a hangover, enabling him to enjoy his evening without the unpleasant consequences the next day."},{"question":"Solve 49*j - 43*j = -42 for j..

We have: 49 * j - 43 * j = -42 First, we see that both terms have j, so we can combine them like we combine apples. Imagine you have 49 apples with j stickers and 43 apples with j stickers. How many apples with j stickers do you have together? That's right, you subtract 43 from 49, and you get: 6 * j = -42 Now, let's solve for j. To get j by itself, we will do the opposite of multiplying it by 6. What's the opposite of multiplying? That's correct, dividing!

At that time, David Lloyd George, a British statesman from the Liberal Party, was the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom leading a coalition government comprising mainly members of the Liberal and Conservative parties, as well as some independent politicians. The proposal to create a united ministry of defence aimed at bringing together the various branches of the armed forces, such as the British Army, Royal Navy, and the Royal Air Force under a single, centralized authority. This was intended to streamline decision-making, improve resource allocation and enhance cooperation among the different military branches. Despite the potential benefits of such an establishment, the proposal faced opposition from various factions within the government and military, who were concerned about the potential loss of autonomy and control over their respective branches. The rejection of forming a united ministry of defence demonstrates that the coalition government of David Lloyd George was not ready to overhaul the existing military system, possibly due to a perceived threat to the balance of power within the government or fear of bureaucratic inefficiency. However, it is worth noting that the Chiefs of Staff Committee was formed two years later in 1923. This committee was created with the intention of fostering greater inter-Service coordination and cooperation among the different branches of the military. While this was not a fully unified ministry of defence, it served as a step towards improving the collaborative working relationship between the British Army, Royal Navy, and Royal Air Force. In conclusion, the sentence provided answers the question, as it states that David Lloyd George's coalition government rejected the formation of a united ministry of defence in 1921. Although this proposal was rejected, the creation of the Chiefs of Staff Committee in 1923 showed that the government was still interested in improving military coordination and making their operations more effective."},{"question":"Answer the following Q with stream of consciousness. Context: Post-glacial rebound (also called either isostatic rebound or crustal rebound) is the rise of land masses that were depressed by the huge weight of ice sheets during the last glacial period, through a process known as isostatic depression. Post-glacial rebound and isostatic depression are different parts of a process known as either glacial isostasy, glacial isostatic adjustment, or glacioisostasy. Glacioisostasy is the solid Earth deformation associated with changes in ice mass distribution. The most obvious and direct effects of post-glacial rebound are readily apparent in parts of Northern Eurasia, Northern America, Patagonia, and Antarctica. However, through processes known as ocean siphoning and continental levering, the effects of post-glacial rebound on sea level are felt globally far from the locations of current and former ice sheets. Question: if an area experiences glacial rebound it means that?","response":"If an area experiences glacial rebound, it means that the landmass in that region was previously covered by massive ice sheets during the last glacial period. The immense weight of these ice sheets caused the land to become depressed through a process called isostatic depression. As the ice sheets melted and retreated over time, the pressure on the land decreased, allowing the land to gradually rise back up due to the Earth's elastic response. This rising of the landmass is called post-glacial rebound, which is a part of the glacioisostasy process that involves both isostatic depression and post-glacial rebound. The effects of post-glacial rebound are especially noticeable in parts of Northern Eurasia, Northern America, Patagonia, and Antarctica, but its impact on global sea levels is felt far beyond these areas through processes like ocean siphoning and continental levering."},{"question":"Process: - Sediment settles in a place due to gravity - The sediment breaks down into small particles - Wind or water picks up the sediment - The sediment travels along the same route as the wind or water - The sediment is deposited at new locations by the wind or water - The sediment is picked up again by new wind or water - The sediment travels further - The sediment is deposited again in a new place. suppose there are more calm unwindy days than usual happens, how will it affect LESS sediment being transported.

Explanation: The process of sediment transportation is described in the initial statement. One of the steps involves wind picking up and carrying sediment to new locations. If there are more calm and unwindy days than usual, it would mean that there is less wind available to move the sediment. This change in wind conditions would not directly impact any specific step of the described process, but it would indirectly impact the sediment's transportation by reducing the overall wind-driven sediment movement.

Stephen Wagner Nichols, 42, was sentenced earlier this week to 19 months for each of the felonies as well as three years’ of probation. But he received credit for his time already in custody, meaning he will not spend any more time behind bars. Nichols was accused of killing 23-year-old girlfriend Rhonda Casto during a hike along Oregon’s scenic Eagle Creek Trail in March 2009. Authorities alleged he pushed her off a cliff to her death in order to collect on a 1 million life insurance policy. But Nichols’ defense attorney, Mike Arnold, says his client was “falsely accused,” and he welcomed the recent plea. “It was a long time coming,” Arnold tells PEOPLE. “It is an amazing outcome. It is not every day that somebody charged with murder ends up with criminally negligent homicide and a probation sentence.” The Hood River County, Oregon, District Attorney’s Office, which prosecuted the case, declined to comment. “I am kind of numb,” says Casto’s mother, Julia Anne Simmons. “I feel awful. I think he [Nichols] should be in prison.” Stephen Wagner Nichols Northern Oregon Regional Correctional Facilities/AP Casto, her mom says, was “very precocious, loud and funny. She was 23 and in the prime of her life. She had everything going for her.” Simmons believes that Nichols killed her daughter, whom he met in fall 2005, because she was gearing up to leave him and take their infant daughter, Ava, with her. “She was going to move out,” Simmons says, “but she was trying to get up the courage to do it. She was disillusioned about Steve.” Nichols has adamantly denied he had anything to do with Casto’s death. He told police that she accidentally slipped and he hiked down to her battered body to help her — but without a cell phone, he hiked back up to the trail, headed to the parking lot and called for help. • Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

But six years later, in April 2014, a grand jury handed down a secret indictment against Nichols and an arrest warrant was issued for him days later. He was arrested in February 2015 at the San Francisco International Airport, after he returned from China with his daughter. The case made national headlines and was featured on CBS’ 48 Hours. Nicholas was scheduled to go to trial in the summer of 2018. “This is so unfair — this is the justice system being stupid,” Simmons says of the sentencing. “I am just disgusted with the outcome.” ||||| For nearly a decade, mystery has surrounded what happened to 23-year-old aspiring model Rhonda Casto, whose lifeless body was found at the bottom of a steep ravine. On March 16, 2009, the young mother had set out with her boyfriend, Steve Nichols, to hike the popular Eagle Creek Trail along Oregon’s Columbia River Gorge. But what was supposed to be a leisurely day hike turned into a nightmare when fire officials, responding to a 911 call from Nichols, came across the ghoulish scene of Casto’s death. What appeared to be an accident turned into a murder investigation, bolstered by Casto’s family’s belief that Nichols — the father of Casto’s daughter, Ava — had something to do with her dying. Adding to their suspicions was a statement Casto allegedly made before she went on the hike. “She told my mother and my sister that ‘he is either going to give me a ring or throw me off a cliff, ha ha ha,’ ” Casto’s mother, Julia Simmons, tells reporter Maria Elena Salinas in Monday’s episode of The Real Story with Maria Elena Salinas on Investigation Discovery and exclusively previewed above. “She made a joke of it. ” But Simmons didn’t think Casto was kidding. And after she died, family members went to the police. “We all told him [the detective] we believe that Steve pushed her,” Simmons tells Salinas. “This is not an accident.” Simmons says authorities were very interested in what the family had to say. At the time, however, she says she didn’t confront Nichols with her allegations: “Police wouldn’t let me see him, because they knew I was enraged.” Rhonda Cast Source: Rhonda Casto - Justice/Facebook In February 2015, nearly six years after Casto died, Nichols was arrested and charged with killing her — accused of pushing her off the 100-foot cliff so he could collect a 1-million life insurance policy. Authorities also pointed to an alleged inappropriate relationship with Casto’s underage sister and a previous incident where Nichols was accused of attempting to push his then-wife off a balcony in China in 2003. He denied all of these claims and the case encountered multiple legal obstacles as it proceeded. In February 2017, the Oregon Supreme Court ruled a three-hour police interview with Nichols after his arrest was inadmissible. Adding to the prosecution’s problems was the fact that the former lead detective, who had retired in 2012, destroyed evidence on his computer, including crime scene and autopsy photos and trail-head fee envelopes from potential witnesses. • Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

In May 2017, in a move that angered Casto’s family, prosecutors dropped the murder charge against Nichols. In return, he pleaded guilty to criminally negligent homicide and coercion. According to his plea, Nichols received three years’ of probation, with credit for 19 months of jail time. Nichols still maintains he had nothing to do with Casto’s death. When confronted by Salinas about her alleged prophetic words to her family, he responded: “The simple answer is I don’t think she ever actually said that.” “She was so happy,” Nichols told PEOPLE in a previous interview about the day the couple went for a hike. Steve Nichols Northern Oregon Regional Correctional Facilities/AP Though Nichols said he doesn’t remember much about what happened, he did recall Casto running along the narrow trail with a towel over her shoulders, like “Superwoman,” and he said he witnessed her fall. He tried to help her, he said — sliding down the ravine and trying to swim across a freezing creek to get to her. However, by the time he reached her body, he said, he collapsed on top of her from exhaustion and hypothermia. Nichols said he believes prescription drugs played a part in Casto’s death, which he called an accident, and he claimed he later discovered she was using marijuana and also taking medication to lose weight and for depression. But Simmons doesn’t buy Nichols’ story and described her daughter’s relationship with him as volatile, though he said they “hardly ever fought.” Simmons says Casto was considering ending things with him before she died. “She was going to move out, but she was trying to get up the courage to do it,” Simmons previously told PEOPLE. “She was worried about not having enough money to support Ava.” The Real Story with Maria Elena Salinas airs Monday (10 p.m. ET) on Investigation Discovery. ||||| The last words an Oregon woman spoke to her family included a joke about being murdered, before she died while hiking with her boyfriend in 2009. Julia Simmons, the mother of Rhonda Casto, shared what her daughter said with Maria Elena SLaines of Investigative Discovery's The Real Story, in an interview that airs on Monday. Casto's last words to her grandmother and aunt before embarking on the Eagle Creek Trail along Oregon’s Columbia River Gorge on March 16, 2009, with Stephen Nichols were supposedly, 'He is either going to give me a ring or throw me off a cliff, ha ha ha,' Simmons said. Nichols, who was first charged with murder in 2015 for Casto's death, instead pleaded guilty to criminally negligent homicide and coercion in May 2017, and was sentenced to three years’ of probation, with credit for 19 months of jail time. Casto and Nichols shared a daugther, named Ava. The last words Rhonda Casto (right) spoke to her family included a joke about being murdered, before she died while hiking with her boyfriend, Stephen Nichols (left) in Oregon in 2009 The plea deal for Nichols came after the Oregon Supreme Court ruled in March 2017 that a detective should have stopped interrogating Nichols when the suspect said he did not want to discuss Casto’s death. The interview occurred shortly after Nichols’ February 2015 arrest at San Francisco International Airport, nearly six years after his partner’s death. A Hood River County judge had ruled the statement inadmissible, but the state appealed to the higher court, and lost. Nichols, who has maintained he had nothing to do with Casto's death, told People magazine, 'She was so happy' on the day of the hike. When asked about what she allegedly said to her family that day, he said, 'The simple answer is I don’t think she ever actually said that.' But Simmons paints a different picture, having previously told People, 'She was going to move out, but she was trying to get up the courage to do it.' Simmons added: 'She was worried about not having enough money to support Ava.' Nichols, then a recently divorced 30-year-old day trader, met Casto, a 20-year-old aspiring model, in 2005 after Casto's mother introduced them Nichols was originally charged with murder in 2015, but that charge was dropped when he took a plea deal that landed him three years’ of probation, with credit for 19 months of jail time On the day Casto dies, Nichols called 911 at around 6pm that night to report Casto's 100-foot-fall to her death. He has said that he slid down the ravine toward her, and had to cross an icy creek to reach her body, but by the time he got there he collapsed on top of her, overcome with exhaustion and hypothermia. The popular hiking destination has been the scene of other accidents in the past due to a few narrow sections that drop off on one side into a ravine. The trail was even more dangerous that day due to a battering of sleet and hail that made the path treacherous. Records show that several months before the incident, Nichols, then working as a day trader, increased Casto’s life insurance policy to 1 million. Court documents show Nichols and Casto became romantically involved in 2005, according to The Oregonian. Casto and Nichols reportedly both took out 1 million life insurance policies on each other shortly before her untimely death in March 2009 Treacherous path: The hiking trail where Casto fell to her death has a few narrow sections that drop off on one side into a ravine In an interview with CBS' 48 Hours, Casto's mother, Julia Simmons, said that she was the one who introduced Nichols to her daughter while renting a room in his three-bedroom condominium in Portland. Nichols was 30 years old and recently divorced, and Casto was 20 at the time. 'Everything about her was impressive,' Nichols said in the March 2015 interview, adding, 'and I just immediately fell in love with her.' Before long, Casto moved into Nichols' home, and three years later they welcomed their baby daughter, who is now seven. The papers reveal that the couple each bought a 1 million life insurance policy in late 2008 from MetLife and named each other as beneficiaries. Their daughter was named as contingent beneficiary. Nichols eventually agreed to split the money with Casto's mother and with the estate of his daughter. In the 48 Hours interview, Nichols said that after delivering their baby, Casto said she wanted to lose the baby weight so she could start modelling again, so the couple took up hiking. Simmons said that in the weeks leading up to the fatal March 2009 outing to the Eagle Creek Trial, her daughter told her that Nichols had been trying to convince her to go for a hike for a month. Nichols said that day started off as a nice day but the weather turned inclement as the couple were making their up the narrow, moss-covered trail As they reached a particularly slippery portion of the pathway, Casto fell off the cliff to her death. Nichols said he hiked down to the spot where his girlfriend came to rest and tried to give her CPR, but it was too late. He would later claim that the 23-year-old mom was high that afternoon, was acting silly and running on the slick trail before disaster struck. The Real Story with Maria Elena Salinas airs on Monday at 10.00pm Eastern on Investigation Discovery. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","response":"In Oregon, Stephen Wagner Nichols, 42, has pled guilty to criminally negligent homicide and coercion in the death of his 23-year-old girlfriend Rhonda Casto, who was pushed off a 100-foot cliff during a hike in March 2009. Nichols was accused of committing the murder in order to receive a 1 million life insurance payout. Nichols was sentenced to 19 months in prison for each charge and 3 years' probation, but given the time he has already spent in custody, he will not face further imprisonment. The case saw numerous legal obstacles and difficulties for the prosecution, including a defense victory in the Oregon Supreme Court ruling out a three-hour police interview with Nichols as inadmissible. However, Casto's mother, Julia Anne Simmons, continues to maintain that Nichols killed her daughter; Casto had been considering breaking up with Nichols and taking their infant daughter with her at the time of her death."},{"question":"Q:Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Are Pylon and Team Sleep experimental bands? A:","response":"Pylon and Team Sleep can both be considered experimental bands due to their distinctive approaches to music production, diverse influences, and commitment to consistently breaking musical boundaries. To better understand their experimental nature, let's deeply analyze each band's approach to music and what sets them apart from other bands. 1. Pylon: Pylon, a post-punk band from Athens, Georgia, was formed in 1979. Although their primary genre is post-punk, they ventured into different styles that exemplified their experimental nature. Pylon's sound is characterized by sharp, angular guitar riffs, prominent basslines, and a certain level of dissonance. They often played with unconventional song structures and unexpected rhythmic changes that kept their listeners engaged and surprised. One of the key factors that contributed to Pylon's experimental essence is their diverse influences. While the band drew inspiration from pioneers of post-punk, such as Gang of Four and Wire, they also found inspiration in the creative and artistic scene of Athens, which was a breeding ground for innovative music acts such as R.E.M. and The B-52s. Pylon's ability to assimilate various influences into their music and push the boundaries of punk and new wave demonstrates their experimental approach to music creation. Another factor supporting the experimental nature of Pylon is their relatively short but impactful career. Although they disbanded in 1983, their influence and musical impact have resonated with critics and fans alike for decades. Bands like R.E.M. and Sonic Youth have cited Pylon as a crucial influence, showcasing the experimental prowess they possessed. 2. Team Sleep: Team Sleep, a side project of Deftones' lead vocalist Chino Moreno, was formed in the late 1990s and early 2000s. It consists of Moreno, DJ Crook, Todd Wilkinson, Zack Hill, and Rick Verrett. Team Sleep's music pushes the boundaries of conventional rock and electronic music due to their unique approach to genre-blending, intricate arrangements, and bold experimentation. What sets Team Sleep apart from other bands is their incorporation of various styles into their music. Drawing from genres such as shoegaze, trip-hop, ambient, post-rock, and electronica, Team Sleep amalgamates elements from different music styles to create a sonic tapestry that cannot be easily pigeonholed into a single category. As a result, their music feels unconventional and distinct, which is a hallmark of experimental bands. The collaborative nature of Team Sleep also contributes to their experimentalism. Different members bring their unique backgrounds to the group dynamic, allowing ideas to flow freely and fueling the band's penchant for innovation. For example, Moreno's background in alternative metal with Deftones, DJ Crook's electronic and hip-hop production expertise, and Zack Hill's experimental drumming techniques all feed Team Sleep's adventurous sonic explorations. In conclusion, Pylon and Team Sleep can be considered experimental bands due to their commitment to pushing musical boundaries and embracing diverse influences. Pylon's unique approach to post-punk, willingness to explore unconventional song structures, and storied impact on other artists exemplify experimentalism in music. Similarly, Team Sleep's genre-blending, intricate arrangements, and collective contributions from various members highlight their experimental nature."},{"question":"Question: Pick which sentence is not logical. Options: - Sentence A: \\"The nurse made her rounds in the hospital.\\" - Sentence B: \\"The nurse made her rounds in the school.\\" Please answer this question gradually:","response":"To answer this question gradually, let's first provide some context for each sentence to better understand their logical or illogical nature. - Sentence A: \\"The nurse made her rounds in the hospital.\\" In general, it's common for nurses to work in hospitals, attending to patients, assisting doctors, and performing other healthcare duties. Making rounds, which involves visiting patients and checking on their well-being, is a standard part of a nurse's job in a hospital setting. Therefore, this statement seems logical. - Sentence B: \\"The nurse made her rounds in the school.\\" Now, let's look at the context of this sentence. It might not be as common to have a nurse making rounds in a school compared to a hospital, but schools can still employ nurses. School nurses provide healthcare services to students and staff, including administering medication, addressing minor injuries, and ensuring overall well-being. Although it may be less common to hear about nurses making rounds in a school, it's not impossible or illogical. In conclusion, both Sentence A and Sentence B are logical given their respective contexts.

School is filled with distractions, from your friends to sports and parties, and once you get to college no one will call your parents if you skip class. But try to make academics your priority. You won’t be an honors student if you are chronically absent. You cannot excel if you aren't there to learn and discuss the material. Many honors courses have additional requirements, such as class participation or class discussion. If you miss class, you miss out on this part of your grade. A good circle of friends or study partners can hold you accountable. Consider making a deal with your study-buddies to keep each other in class. Schools usually have resources available to help you reach your highest potential. You just have to ask. It should be possible to find a study group, for example, and some schools even have special centers for tutoring in subjects like math. Be aware of what's available. Talk with your teacher if you're having difficulty, or you'd just like to understand a topic more clearly. As long as it's not an hour before the test, most teachers are happy to answer your questions. Join a peer tutoring program if you need more intensive one-on-one help. Peer tutors know their stuff -- you have to do well in a subject in order to become one. They can guide you through assignments and major concepts, build up your base of knowledge, or help you prepare for an upcoming exam. Don't despair if your school doesn't offer these resources. It's always possible to form your own study circle. But be careful if your study circle consists only of close friends. Minimize your distractions and remember to hit those books! You forget 47% of the information you encounter within twenty minutes. You forget 68% in a day.Take good notes for every subject in order to remember what you’ve covered in reading and lectures for later review. Taking notes is an art form. It will take you some time to learn how to listen and read effectively and identify the most important things. Oftentimes school writing centers offer students tips for this. How you take notes – whether by computer or hand – is up to you. Studies suggest that taking notes by hand is better for comprehension and recall, though. Some (but not all) teachers are also fine with students recording them in class. Just make sure to ask for their permission beforehand. Many honor students like using the Cornell method, which involves taking notes during class and then later returning to them to review and condense. This method is great for courses that cover clearly-defined subjects, such as math, science, and history. It is less useful for more abstract courses that focus less on memorization and recall, such as a discussion-heavy literature course. Whether essays, lab reports, or problem sets, assignments will usually make up a big part of your total grade in a course. Missing just one might mean a reduction in your final mark. It might mean more. It can be the difference between a final B+ and an A. There are also reasons to do your homework besides just the grades. Studies have shown that completing your homework is linked to higher achievement and to the development of skills like time management, responsibility, and good study habits. Turn in your assignments early when possible. If your paper is due online at midnight, it's practically a guarantee that there will be a dozen students trying to upload it at 11:59, which could cause system crashes. Do your assignments as soon as possible, and definitely turn them in early when you can. A strong history of turning in your assignments on time also makes teachers more likely to be flexible if you have a genuine emergency. If you've only turned in a third of your homework to start with, though, your teacher is unlikely to be impressed by your excellent excuse for not doing it this time. While it's usually a good thing to study with classmates, there can be a thin line between cooperating and cheating. Your teachers will expect you to hand in your own work. If you aren't clear on what's acceptable, talk with your teacher beforehand. Be especially careful when it comes to homework assignments. Unless it's a group project, it may be inappropriate to do an assignment with others. Never plagiarize. Using another person's answers, or copying words from a book or website into an essay, are forms of plagiarism and academically dishonest. Plagiarism can cause you to fail an assignment or course or even get you expelled. Being an honor student probably means hitting the books more than your peers. Review your lessons and notes at home or before class. Review with friends or alone. Review while on the bus or watching TV. You can also try as much as possible to read ahead, as this will help you to ask reasonable questions and allow you to understand new topics more easily. Try bringing flashcards with you on the bus or public transit. You can review them while you're riding to school, or even while you're standing in line at the store. By reviewing your material in smaller chunks frequently, you're more likely to commit it to long-term memory. Many students seem to believe that they're great multitaskers. However, many studies show that multitasking, or trying to focus on several tasks at the same time, simply doesn't work. You just end up spreading your attention out thinly over several areas, rather than focusing it on one. So put the cell phone away, log off social media, and turn off the TV while you're studying. This works the other way around, too. Even the most dedicated honor student needs time to decompress and relax, or you'll burn out. Schedule in some dedicated \\"me time\\" and keep it faithfully. If you're on a half-hour break, try not to think about homework. Summary:","response":"To be a successful student, focus on academics, attend class, use available resources, take good notes, do your assignments, avoid cheating, and review your material regularly while balancing study and relaxation."},{"question":"Translate to French: Examples of these goods and services are:","response":"Traduction en français : Des exemples de ces biens et services sont : Raison des étapes de traduction : 1.

Context: The SAH gene locus has recently been proposed to be involved in obesity-related hypertension in Japanese individuals.', 'To replicate independently the initial findings in another ethnic group, we scanned the entire SAH gene in 190 Caucasian chromosomes. A total of 651 patients with essential hypertension and 776 controls (PEGASE Study) were genotyped for all identified variants using allele-specific oligonucleotides, and single nucleotide polymorphism as well as haplotype analyses were carried out. We also performed transient transfection experiments, northern and western blots, immunoprecipitation, and acyl-coenzyme A synthetase activity assays.', 'We identified five polymorphisms in the promoter region (C-1808T, G-1606A, -962ins/del, G-451A, T-67C), two in introns 5 and 7 (T+9/In5C, A+20/In7T), and one missense variant (K359N). Carriage of the -1606A allele was significantly associated with hypertension [odds ratio (OR) 1.28, P = 0.049] as was 359N (OR 1.35, P = 0.048) compared with non-carriers. Conversely, for -962del, the OR for hypertension was 0.80 (P = 0.042). The SAH alleles -1606A and 359N, but not -962ins/del, displayed a raising effect on body mass index (BMI; P = 0.004 and P = 0.030, respectively) in hypertensive as well as in control individuals. After adjustment for BMI in hypertensive individuals, only the OR associated with -962ins/del remained significant (OR 0.77, P = 0.028). Functional analyses in BHK did not reveal differences for SAH 359N or 359K-containing constructs, formally excluding K359N as the functional variant.

The most important step to take before retiring, though, is to make sure that you actually have started some hobbies. Once you're retired, unless you 've already started a hobby, you'll find it very hard to get into something new. Some hobbies aren't for everyone. Think about what you enjoy doing and start participating on a casual basis now. Another thing many people participate in is volunteering. Not only does volunteering give you something to do, it also gives you a sense of accomplishment and can add meaning to your life .Volunteering is also rewarding in other ways, too. There are hundreds of different types of volunteer services and you'll always be able to meet new and interesting people. Also, don't think that volunteering is always only about helping someone for free. Many companies pay their volunteers after they've had enough experience and prove themselves to be valuable workers. There are plenty of other potions, as well. Going back to school is a great way to keep yourself feeling young. Taking a vacation around the world with your loved ones is another great way to spend your retirement. Ultimately, though, the key to a happy retirement is simply keeping yourself busy and doing whatever you love.

Prince: This word is the primary subject of the sentence, indicating that the discussion revolves around a person with the title \\"prince\\". The repetition of this word might be a typo, so it's important to consider the context in which the sentence is used. The word is used twice, so it still only often counts as one keyword. 2. Prince of Wales: This phrase further elaborates on the subject, speculating the specific title or position related to the prince being mentioned. In this case, it would be presumable that the prince being referred to is the Prince of Wales, a title traditionally held by the heir apparent to the British throne. 3. Visits: This verb describes the action taken in the sentence, asserting that the prince went to see, meet, or interact with something or someone. 4. Architect: Serving as a second subject, this keyword introduces another individual or profession that seems to play a role in the story. It suggests that an architect, or someone who designs and plans buildings, is involved somehow. 5. Inspired: This adjective demonstrates a connection or relationship between the subjects or objects involved in the sentence. It conveys the notion that the architect or their work is potentially influenced by something, drawing motivation, ideas, or enthusiasm from another source. 6. Book: Acting as the object of the verb 'visits,' this keyword offers context to what the prince is visiting. It indicates that there is a book related to the architect in question, and that the prince has likely gone to see, read, or learn about it. Overall, the sentence seems to recount an event or situation where the Prince of Wales visits a location or event associated with a book that has been inspired by an architect."},{"question":"Ne, už nebudu připíjet, chci jen další pití.

He is the eldest of three sons born to Mary Kathleen (nee Burns), a home economics teacher, and Albert Alexander Kaine, Jr., a welder and the owner of a small iron-working shop. He was raised Catholic. One of Kaine's great-grandparents was Scottish and the other seven were Irish. In 2005, Kaine ran for governor of Virginia against Republican candidate Jerry W. Kilgore, a former state attorney general. Kaine was considered an underdog for most of the race, trailing in polls for most of the election. Two polls released in September 2005 showed Kaine trailing Kilgore--by four percentage points in a Washington Post poll and by one percentage point in a Mason-Dixon/Roanoke Times poll. The final opinion polls of the race before the November election showed Kaine slightly edging ahead of Kilgore. Kaine ultimately prevailed, winning 1,025,942 votes (51.7%) to Kilgore's 912,327 (46.0%). (A third candidate--independent state Senator H. Russell Potts Jr., who ran as an \\"independent Republican\\"--received 43,953 votes (2.2%)). Kaine emphasized fiscal responsibility and a centrist message. He expressed support for controlling sprawl and tackling longstanding traffic issues, an issue that resonated in the exurbs of northern Virginia. He benefited from his association with the popular outgoing Democratic governor, Mark Warner, who had performed well in traditionally Republican areas of the state. On the campaign trail, Kaine referred to the \\"Warner-Kaine administration\\" in speeches and received the strong backing of Warner. Kilgore later attributed his defeat to Warner's high popularity and the \\"plummeting popularity\\" of Republican President George W. Bush, who held one rally with Kilgore on the campaign's final day. The campaign turned sharply negative in its final weeks, with Kilgore running television attack ads that claimed, incorrectly, that Kaine believed that \\"Hitler doesn't qualify for the death penalty.\\" The ads also attacked Kaine for his service ten years earlier as a court-appointed attorney for a death-row inmate. The Republican ad was denounced by the editorial boards of the Washington Post and a number of Virginia newspapers as a \\"smear\\" and \\"dishonest.\\" Kaine responded with an ad \\"in which he told voters that he opposes capital punishment but would take an oath and enforce the death penalty. In later polls, voters said they believed Kaine's response and were angered by Kilgore's negative ads.\\" In the election, Kaine won by large margins in the Democratic strongholds such as Richmond and Northern Virginia's inner suburbs (such as Alexandria and Arlington), as well as in the Democratic-trending Fairfax County. Kaine also won Republican-leaning areas in Northern Virginia's outer suburbs, including Prince William County and Loudoun County, where George W. Bush had beat John Kerry in the previous year's presidential election, and performed \\"surprisingly well in Republican strongholds like Virginia Beach and Chesapeake.\\" Kaine also defeated Kilgore in the burgeoning Richmond suburbs. Kilgore led in southwest Virginia and in the Shenandoah Valley.

Comic book character Memin Pinguin is \\"a disgrace,\\" an African-American activist says. For more than 60 years Mexicans have followed the adventures of \\"Memin Pinguin.\\" But the dark-skinned Memin's exaggerated features in \\"Memin for President\\" came as a shock to Houston, Texas, Wal-Mart shopper Shawnedria McGinty. \\"I was like, OK, is that a monkey or a boy?\\" McGinty said. \\"To me it was an insult.\\" She'd never heard of \\"Memin Pinguin.\\" She bought a Spanish-English dictionary and tried translating but still didn't like what she saw. Watch what upset McGinty ». \\"So I asked my boyfriend, does that look like a monkey to you?\\" she said. \\"And we went back and forth and he was like, no, that's a black woman,\\" referring to the character's Aunt Jemima-like mother. McGinty and Houston community activist Quannel X want the comic books removed from the stores. \\"This is absolutely insensitive toward race, in particular the African-American culture, and also people of color,\\" Quannel X said. \\"This is poking fun at the physical features of an entire people.\\" But Mexican readers who grew up following the shenanigans of Memin say critics need to look beyond the cover and understand the stories. \\"They will bring a smile to their face because we're so fond of that character,\\" said Javier Salas, a Spanish-language talk show host on Chicago radio station WRTO. \\"We respect him, we love him. And that's why it's so absurd for us to hear complaints from people who don't know, don't understand Memin.\\" Memin is a poor Cuban-Mexican kid with bug eyes, thick lips and protruding ears. The mischievous and caring boy helps his mother by selling newspapers and shining shoes. \\"We grew up reading, learning and educating ourselves with a lot of the topics they always touched on, which was honesty, justice, tolerance. He was a very unique character,\\" Salas said. Wal-Mart spokesman Lorenzo Lopez said the retailer has instructed stores to remove the books from shelves and discontinue sales. \\"We received the customer complaint regarding the book, which we knew was based on a popular cartoon character in Mexico. We looked into it further, and we decided to no longer distribute the book and are in the process of removing the books from the stores.\\" The store has received no other complaints about Memin, Lopez said. \\"We have a wide array of products that we provide to Hispanic customers, but when we looked at this more carefully and given the sensitivity of the topic, we thought it was best to no longer carry the book in our stores,\\" he said. He did not know how many copies of Memin books the chain had or how long it would take to remove them from displays. Memin is no stranger to controversy. Three years ago, a series of Mexican stamps honoring Memin ignited an international uproar. The stamps were discontinued because of protests from African-American leaders. \\"This is saying we respect and regard the African-American community by making them look like Sambos on a stamp?\\" the Rev. Al Sharpton said at the time. \\"This goes over the line.\\" Quannel X called the comic book \\"a disgrace.\\" \\"Look how they portray his mother, with huge ethnic lips, dark skin, making her look like the big gorilla and him like the little monkey.\\" But fans of Memin say the valuable lessons of a beloved comic book character tackling real-life problems have been lost in translation. Write highlights for this article.","response":"The comic book character Memin Pinguin, popular in Mexico for over 60 years, has faced controversy in the United States, where some see him as a racist caricature.

Victory for Boro made it back-to-back home wins, while Nigel Clough's Burton remain without a point after three games.

Answer:","response":"Sir Harry Newton Phillips Wollaston, commonly known as Harry Wollaston, was an accomplished Australian public servant who dedicated his life to the development and execution of trade, customs, and administrative policies throughout the early 20th century. Born on January 17, 1846, in Western Australia, Wollaston grew up in a period witnessing the rapid transformation of his home country on various socio-economic fronts. Ascending through the ranks of public service, Wollaston's exceptional work eventually led him to be appointed as the Comptroller-General of the Department of Trade and Customs. He assumed office in 1901 and served in this capacity for a decade, concluding his term in 1911. His visionary leadership and seamless execution of critical trade policies significantly contributed to the nation's economic progress and facilitated smoother navigation of global markets. During his tenure as the Comptroller-General, Wollaston played key roles in drafting and implementing multiple essential regulations that helped establish and consolidate a robust Australian customs system. Consequently, this further enhanced the nation's capacity to engage in international trade and protect the rights of domestic industries. He was instrumental in reshaping Australia's customs landscape and aligning it with the evolving economic challenges and opportunities. Aside from his illustrious career in public service, Wollaston was a dedicated family man who consistently embodied the qualities of loyalty and devotion to his homeland. He was also known for his affable nature and quick wit that endeared him to his friends and colleagues. In recognition of his noteworthy contributions, Wollaston was knighted by the government, granting him the accolade of \\"Sir\\" as part of his name. Sadly, Sir Harry Wollaston passed away on February 11, 1921, in Victoria, leaving behind a rich legacy of service and excellence that resonated in his professional field well beyond his lifetime. In tribute to his eternal memory, he was laid to rest in the Boroondara General Cemetery, reminding future generations of a figure who deeply impacted the course of Australian trade and customs policies during his illustrious career. As an exemplary public servant and a proud Australian, Sir Harry Wollaston's unwavering commitment to national service and steadfast leadership during a transformative period have etched his name upon the country's rich historical tapestry, embodying the essence of Australian values and heritage."},{"question":"Write the next sentence.

The question and answer pair are described below.","response":"Question: Can I find a secluded woods in the street with crowds passing by? Answer: No, it is highly unlikely to find a secluded woods in the street with crowds passing by. Rationale: 1. The term \\"secluded woods\\" suggests an area with dense trees and vegetation that is isolated or away from human activity. 2. Busy streets with crowds passing by tend to be in urban settings or commercial areas, which are less likely to have large wooded areas. 3.

Are these two questions asking the same thing? Options: + no; + yes;","response":"First question: Is the ongoing war in Syria the start of World War 3? The ongoing war in Syria is a complex and devastating conflict that has had a significant impact on the nation and its people. However, calling it the start of World War 3 might be an exaggeration, as the conflict's scale and involvement differ from those that characterized the first two world wars. World War 1 and World War 2 were both defined by massive military alliances, multiple fronts, and global power struggles involving numerous nations. The Syrian war, on the other hand, is primarily a civil war with international interventions and external influences. While it is true that several state actors are involved in the Syrian conflict, their engagement is primarily limited to proxy-warfare, regional power struggles, and aiding respective factions. Such actors include Russia, the United States, Turkey, Iran, and various Arab and European nations. These interventions are not sufficiently widespread or intense to qualify as the catalyst for a third world war. Second question: Is Syria the 'main stage' for a Third World War? While Syria is a focal point for various powers in the region and beyond, it is not appropriate to label it as the 'main stage' for a potential Third World War. Global tensions ebb and flow in various regions across the world. Rising military prowess in Asia, cyber-warfare, and the proliferation of nuclear weapons are just a few examples of factors that could contribute to world conflict in the future. If a Third World War were to emerge, it would likely involve a constellation of issues and geographic locations, rather than centering predominantly around the Syrian conflict. That said, the Syrian war's diplomatic and military consequences, as well as the potential for escalation and a wider regional conflict, should not be underestimated. The involvement of international actors in the conflict has led to tense confrontations and diplomatic flare-ups, but this does not currently suggest the imminent eruption of another global war. Are these two questions asking the same thing? While the two questions may share some similarities, they are not asking the same thing. The first question pertains to whether the Syrian war is the \\"start\\" or trigger for World War 3; it calls for an analysis of whether the conflict will directly lead to a larger, global conflict. The second question asks if Syria is the \\"main stage\\" for a Third World War, which revolves around the idea that Syria could be the center or principal battleground for a global conflict, not necessarily the catalyst or origin. In summary – no, these two questions are not the same. They address different facets of the interplay between the Syrian conflict and the notion of a potential Third World War."},{"question":"What is a one-sentence summary of the following article?

Barbie made it possible for young girls to dream about a future other than being a mother and a housewife. It showed girls that they had choices and could become anything they wanted to be. At the time, these ideas were very new and positive. The movement for equal opportunity for women had just begun and women wanted to have the same chance as men to do important work. However, Barbie's approval as a role model has not lasted. Today, many people criticize Barbie for making young girls too concerned about their appearance . These people complain that the beautiful, well-dressed Barbie seems to tell girls that while they can hope to have different career, it is more important for them to be beautiful and thin. The female figure that Barbie represents has also been criticized for being unrealistic . Young girls might think that Barbie's figure is beautiful and desirable . However, if Barbie were a real person, she would be six feet tall and wear a size three shoe! Question: Which of the following statements is NOT true? Options: A: Barbie was created by Ruth Handler in 1959. B: Barbie was the first doll that was made to look like an adult. C: Barbie served as a role model for girls when she was created.

The case of BPN was particularly serious because of its size, market share, and the political implications - Portugal's then current President, Cavaco Silva, and some of his political allies, maintained personal and business relationships with the bank and its CEO, who was eventually charged and arrested for fraud and other crimes.

In contrast to consumer fairs, only some trade fairs are open to the public, while others can only be attended by company representatives (members of the trade, e.g. professionals) and members of the press, therefore trade shows are classified as either \\"public\\" or \\"trade only\\".

Which friend studied less about the natural development of species? Greg and Frank were two friends that studied natural sciences. One day, Greg decided to start reading about natural selection. His friend Frank decided to read more about populations that displayed natural selection more sparingly. They both learned lots of new interesting facts. Hint: New species develop naturally through the process of natural selection . Due to natural selection, organisms with traits that better enable them to adapt to their environment will tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers. Natural selection causes beneficial heritable traits to become more common in a population and unfavorable heritable traits to become less common. For example, a giraffe’s neck is beneficial because it allows the giraffe to reach leaves high in trees. Natural selection caused this beneficial trait to become more common than short necks. Answer:","response":"Frank studied less about the natural development of species. In the given paragraph, it is mentioned that Greg started reading about natural selection, which essentially describes the natural development of species. On the other hand, Frank decided to read more about populations that displayed natural selection more sparingly.

An Ohio National Guardsman suspected of sexually abusing three adopted daughters and his stepdaughter also is accused of abruptly sending a fourth adopted daughter out of state and threatening the children in the family with a similar fate to keep them from talking about what they knew, according to court documents. The 41-year-old Marysville man, who told a military publication years ago that he wanted to adopt a girl from Africa to protect her from rape, was originally charged last year. He is scheduled to be arraigned Friday in Union County court on an updated indictment with 35 counts, including rape, sexual battery, gross sexual imposition, intimidation and tampering with evidence. Shocking: An active Ohio National Guardsman has pleaded not guilty to charges he sexually molested three of his adopted daughter and a stepdaughter over the course of years. Prosecutors said the children ranged in age from 2 to 8. Up to 11 children at some point lived with the man and his wife at their home in Marysville, Ohio. Court documents indicate the girls were under 13 at the time, with one as young as 5. Messages seeking comment were left for the man's attorney E. Darren McNeal, whose legal assistant said McNeal won't discuss the case. The defendant and his wife, who is accused of intimidation and obstruction but not abuse, entered not-guilty pleas to the initial charges against them. The Associated Press isn't naming them to protect the children's identities. Prosecutors allege in court documents that the man touched the girls in inappropriate, sexual ways at different times and forced two of them to perform sex acts on him. Prosecutors say the girls reported abuse to a different adoptive daughter who shared that information with relatives and was sent away in July 2012. The man and his wife picked up the girl from a volunteering shift and put her on a flight to Idaho against her will, without a chance to get her belongings, according to the limited details described in court documents. Coercion: The Guardsman not only is accused of sex crimes, but also of using one of his adopted daughter's fear of being sent away by yet another family to coerce her into not telling anyone what she knew. The wife, too, is believed by prosecutors to have helped coerce the child. The girl, a native of Haiti, eventually revealed what she allegedly knew to family members. At a park before church the following Sunday, the couple gathered the remaining children — nine of them, include the four accusers — and told them that there were false statements being made about the man and that any child who discussed those matters 'would go away' like the other girl, prosecutors said in court documents. An updated indictment filed this summer against the man's wife includes 13 intimidation-related charges and an evidence-tampering count related to the girl who was sent out of state. The 37-year-old woman also is charged with a single count of obstructing justice; prosecutors say she falsely told police that the children denied the sexual assault allegations and that she intimidated one of the girls so she would write a letter to that effect. The wife's attorney, Jason Despetorich, also said he isn't commenting on the case while it is pending. Terry Hord, the Union County chief assistant prosecuting attorney handling the case, said he couldn't provide an update on the status of the children or where they live, but he said none now lives with the father who is charged. The Guardsman remains a major with an Ohio National Guard unit out of Springfield and works one weekend per month, according to the organization's community relations office. Sick crimes: The man is charged with nearly three dozen crimes including rape and tampering with evidence. His wife is charged with intimidation and obstruction. Neither he nor the wife are being named in this report in order to protect the identity of the children. Summarize the highlights of this article.","response":"An Ohio National Guardsman is facing 35 criminal charges, including rape, sexual battery, gross sexual imposition, intimidation, and tampering with evidence, for allegedly sexually abusing three adopted daughters and his stepdaughter.

These are just a few of the questions Anne Marie Stewart and her staff sometimes ask the \\"talent\\" who serve as non-speaking \\"extras\\" in special films, television series, and made-for-TV movies produced in Toronto. Of course, the majority of extra calls are for more ordinary people, and Stewart has a list of about 650 registered extras. Crowd scenes, which are common, call for everyday people of all ages, ethnic backgrounds, and sizes. Over at Movie People, last-minute requests are not unusual. \\"We got a request once for an entire brass band of 30 people. They wanted it within the hour,\\" said manager Yvonne McCartney. Another time, the company got a last-minute request for a newborn baby. \\"We found a baby that was three weeks premature,\\" said Jonathan Aiken, an owner of the company. Then there was the worried call from a casting director whose \\"Star\\" got doggone stubborn one day and decided to just lie down and not work. The director needed a replacement dog, fast. \\"We got them two in one hour.\\" said Aiken. \\"It was a matter of good connections and fast phone work.\\" The eight phone lines needed to make 350 to 400 calls a day are one of Movie People's major expenses.

Most extra jobs pay only 7 an hour (with a six-hour minimum), while most agencies charge an annual 75 registration fee and get 10 to 15 per cent of extras' earnings. It's no wonder that the _ rate is fairly high. Some people who are between jobs do extra work as a temporary measure, said McCartney.

The idea of a middle-aged, cancer-stricken, \\"First-Lady-in-waiting\\" huddling in the dark on a sidewalk for hours on end was ridiculous. I told her I would investigate the options and come up with a better solution. The assistant I had hired as a driver heard me talk about the PlayStation problem and volunteered to jump in. I was extremely busy setting up the 2008 campaign, which had to be ready January 1, and gratefully accepted his offer. He promptly rang up the nearest Wal-Mart store and talked his way to the manager of the electronics department. He left a voice mail dropping the senator's name and discussed the availability of the new Sony system. The next day, as shoppers all over the country waited in line to plunk down their Christmas savings for the toy, Wal-Mart issued a press release that said Senator John Edwards, a vocal spokesman for the Wake-Up Wal-Mart campaign, had tried to jump to the front \\"while the rest of America's working families are waiting patiently in line.\\" With Wal-Mart's press release came a flurry of inquiries from reporters across the country. Forced to respond, Senator Edwards explained that a new volunteer who was unaware of the Wal-Mart controversy had made the mistake of using his name in an over eager effort to get one of the gaming consoles. \\"He was not aware,\\" said the senator, \\"that Wal-Mart doesn't provide health insurance or decent pay for many of its employees or of my efforts to change the way Wal-Mart treats its employees.\\" Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Please try again later. View all New York Times newsletters. If you subscribe to the belief that \\"all publicity is good publicity,\\" the PlayStation 3 blowup was a bonanza. With the campaign kickoff six weeks away, Senator Edwards was in the middle of a media blitz. In the previous week, he had appeared on Good Morning America, The Charlie Rose Show, The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, Late Show with David Letterman, and Meet the Press. When Wal-Mart went after him, the senator used the attack to draw attention to his critique of the company's employment practices. Most of the news outlets that went with the story referred to the Wake-Up Wal-Mart campaign, so I tried to convince myself that the reporting was balanced. Mrs. Edwards did not agree. Having worked hard to cultivate a \\"plain folks\\" public image, she believed nationwide publicity about John Edwards trying to jump the line at Wal-Mart was a disaster. She sent me an e-mail headed \\"This is what can happen\\" and wrote: \\"This is what can happen when we ask for special treatment. We cannot ever ask for special treatment. Ever.\\" Below her note, she pasted a bunch of articles from newspapers and Web sites, all of which made fun of Edwards. A typical one said, \\"There are two Americas, one for rich people who can bypass the line, one for poor folks who can't.\\" For the next few weeks, Elizabeth searched for these items on the Internet and sent them to me by the dozens. They arrived on my BlackBerry on weekdays and weekends, in the middle of the night, and over the holidays as I drove with my wife and kids to visit with family in Illinois. Although I apologized, explained what had happened, and took responsibility, nothing seemed to satisfy her. She was certain that I had told my assistant to throw around the senator's name, which I had not. As the negative comments continued in the blogosphere, she sent me an angry note, the key sentence of which was written in capital letters: \\"I HAVE A LOT OF TROUBLE WITH YOUR APOLOGIES WHEN COMBINED WITH YOUR OWN BENIGN DESCRIPTION OF YOUR ROLE.\\" When another apology from me didn't work, Mrs. Edwards switched from expressing her anger to trying to make me feel ashamed. On December 4, she wrote: \\"I noticed that although you have steered clear of me, you are bringing John home tomorrow. Think of that as an opportunity to be completely honest . . . not to complain that I am being too harsh on you. In my view, you are not harsh enough on yourself.\\" At some point, even a good soldier gets angry at the brass, and after weeks of her harangues I got angry. I printed out many of the e-mails I had received from her and brought them with me to the airport on a day when I was meeting the senator. Once he got in the car, I showed them to him and then told him I'd resign if necessary. When I finished, the senator recalled previous talks we had had about Mrs. Edwards, their marriage, and their difficulties. He said, \\"Andrew, this is [expletive] harassment. Don't worry about this. And you're not quitting.\\" The e-mails about the PlayStation 3 stopped that evening. On the day after Christmas, Mrs. Edwards wrote to tell me to make sure the Christmas tree supplier would come to collect the big Douglas fir at eight-fifteen on the morning of December 29. \\"Also,\\" she added, \\"the kids loved their presents — thank you!\\" ||||| Once upon a time, Edwards' staff thought white wine and sissy sodas were their biggest problems. In anticipation of Andrew Young's 20/20 interview tonight, Gawker asks an Edwards staffer to evaluate the latest rumors—and lob some new ones. \\"I don't think there's really any sympathy for him,\\" says our anonymous staffer, who worked on Edwards' 2004 and 2008 campaigns and says Edwards' old staff is universally \\"disgusted\\" with their former boss. Back before they realized John was knocking up videographers while his wife lay dying, Edwards' staff worried that his beverage choices were too girly: He had very weird soda preferences. For the longest time it was all Sprite Zero. And then at one point the word came down that he would no longer drink Sprite Zero. He would only drink Diet Orange Sunkist. And Diet Orange Sunkist can be very difficult to find on short notice. It had to be in cans. It could not be in bottles. We'd pick him up at the airport you'd have to have a cooler of that and white wine on ice. His alcohol of choice was simultaneously elitist and tasteless... He only drank white wine. Despite all that \\"man of the people\\" beer drinking, he preferred Sauvignon Blanc. It could be a three-dollar or a fifty-dollar bottle of wine and he would not have a clue. I don't really think he would've known the difference if you'd given him chardonnay. ... He's your classic—I hate to use this term—but he's so nouveau riche. He's totally a guy with no taste who suddenly came into a lot of money. ...and illegal: \\"If you were driving, plastic cups were a good idea because he'd want to have a drink while you were driving him around.\\" An open container in a moving vehicle? \\"Yes.\\" Did this make you nervous, anonymous staffer? \\"Yes. Especially when he'd ask you to drive faster.\\" The staffer says he's kept up with the leaks and recent excerpt from assistant-turned-memoirist (and early sex tape whistleblower) Andrew Young's forthcoming book, and they \\"seem pretty consistent\\" with his experience. But he admits that Young is \\"a little disconnected from reality.\\" (A passage describing Young's fear of Grisham-style retribution drew particular disbelief.) Our staffer says Edwards' lies fooled most everyone: We all bought the spin. Until the pregnancy stuff surfaced, it wasn't that crazy a story, just a report that he had an affair with a videographer. But when the other layers came out—the child, and the timing with Elizabeth's cancer—it became more monstrous. He adds that the National Enquirer's trashy reputation \\"aided our desire not to believe.\\" He realized the Enquirer was right in January of 2008, when a friend told him Andrew Young had a vasectomy and thus could not—as Young and Edwards claimed—be Rielle's baby daddy. The staffer is quick to note that not everyone on staff knew this. (Like, say, Edwards' spokespersons, whom he claims were unaware they were passing on lies.) The staffer suspected Dallas donor Fred Baron of paying to support Rielle. (Baron confirmed this shortly before his death in 2008) He finds plausible Young's claim that Listerine heiress and Jackie Onassis bosom buddy Bunny Mellon's \\"Bunny money\\" also played a role: Everybody knew about the Bunny money, though not that it was part of that [the sex scandal]. Everybody knew 'Bunny money' as this rich heiress who thought [Edwards] was the reincarnation of Robert Kennedy. You sort of pieced it together by working backwards: You hear the story about Rielle living in a house, and you know she doesn't have an income. You know that Fred [Baron] has a billion dollars, and you know Fred would do anything for John. Asked about Edwards' recent camera-friendly trip to Haiti, the staffer comes as close to rolling his eyes as one can by telephone: I think there is less than zero chance of him ever having a public career again. And I am absolutely positive that he will try. He's addicted to it. He needs attention. ... He was the kind of guy who'd been told all his life he was the golden child. I think that's what Rielle tapped into. She told him he was the golden child, and I think he liked to believe that. The staffer isn't in touch with John anymore, but if he were to offer advice? ||||| Summary:","response":"A middle-aged woman requested a sleeping bag to camp out in front of a store for the release of the new Sony gaming system.

Movie title: Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith Movie plot: The opening crawl reveals that the galaxy is in the midst of the war. Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) has been kidnapped by the Separatists' second-in-command, General Grievous. Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) and Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) lead a mission to rescue him. After killing Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) and freeing the Chancellor, the Jedi attempt to escape, but are captured by General Grievous. Anakin and Obi-Wan manage to break free, but Grievous escapes and traps the Jedi and the Chancellor inside the severely damaged cruiser. Anakin is forced to crash-land the ship on one of Coruscant's landing tracks.Upon his return, Anakin is reunited with his wife, Padmé Amidala (Natalie Portman), who tells him that she is pregnant. Despite Padmé's worries over their secret marriage, Anakin is overjoyed at this news, and the couple makes plans to raise their child. However, Anakin is troubled by visions of Padmé dying in childbirth, visions similar to those he had of his mother just before she died. Later, Obi-Wan privately tells Anakin that the Council wants him to spy on the Chancellor because they believe him to be corrupt, an order Anakin resents since the Chancellor has become a mentor to him. As the Chancellor's bodyguard, Anakin develops a close friendship with Palpatine, who subtly manipulates Anakin in their discussions, making him distrust the Jedi. Palpatine claims to know of an ability to prevent death.Obi-Wan is sent to Utapau, where he engages and kills General Grievous. Meanwhile, back on Coruscant, Palpatine reveals himself to Anakin as the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, who has been controlling the Republic and the Separatist movement. Anakin leaves to expose him to the Jedi Council. Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson) arrives at the Chancellor's office shortly thereafter and eventually subdues Palpatine through a lightsaber duel. Just as Anakin arrives, Windu is about to slay the Chancellor. Anakin quickly disarms Windu, believing the Chancellor holds the only way... Answer:","response":"In Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, it is Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi who return to Coruscant and eventually uncover Anakin's own treachery. The film's plot centers around the ongoing conflict between the Galactic Republic and the Separatists. As the Separatists' second-in-command, General Grievous, kidnaps Chancellor Palpatine, the Jedi Council sends Anakin and Obi-Wan on a mission to rescue him. The pair successfully carries out their mission, and while they attempt to escape, they are captured by General Grievous. Although they eventually manage to break free and return to Coruscant, Grievous manages to escape and traps the Jedi and the Chancellor inside a damaged cruiser. Anakin then crash-lands the ship on one of Coruscant's landing tracks. Upon their return to Coruscant, Anakin and Obi-Wan are embroiled in even more intrigue. Anakin's visions of Padmé dying during childbirth draw him closer to Chancellor Palpatine, who manipulates him with promises of preventing her death. This manipulation leads Anakin to distrust the Jedi and feel resentful towards them, especially when he discovers that the Chancellor is actually the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, who has been controlling both the Republic and the Separatist movement from behind the scenes. As Obi-Wan is sent to deal with General Grievous on Utapau, Anakin faces a moral dilemma on Coruscant. After learning of Palpatine's true identity, he must choose between his loyalty to the Jedi and his desire to save Padmé. While Mace Windu confronts Palpatine and nearly kills him, Anakin intervenes, ultimately pledging himself to Palpatine and becoming the Sith Lord's apprentice, Darth Vader. In the end, it is Obi-Wan who uncovers Anakin's treachery during a confrontation on the volcanic planet of Mustafar. The two former friends engage in a fierce lightsaber duel, during which Obi-Wan defeats and severely injures Anakin. Unbeknownst to Anakin, Padmé dies during childbirth, giving birth to twins Luke and Leia. The film concludes with Anakin's transformation into the iconic Darth Vader, setting the stage for the events of the original Star Wars trilogy.

A number of artists and groups announced that they had cut ties with the company Berru founded, including local band Speedy Ortiz. At least eight women tweeted that they had been sexually harrassed or assaulted by Berru following a series of tweets from Amber Coffman, a member of the band Dirty Projectors, who posted that Berru had touched her inappropriately at a bar “a couple years ago.” After Coffman posted on Jan. 18, others tweeted of similar experiences with Berru, including Bethany Cosentino of Best Coast and Yasmine Kittles of Tearist. ”We have no interest in directly or indirectly supporting an abuser, now or ever,” said Sadie Dupuis of Speedy Ortiz in a tweet. “We’re thankful to the folks at life or death we worked w directly (not heathcliff). but after hearing these stories we’re no longer w/ LoD,” she added. DIIV, Kelela, and Waaves also tweeted that they fired Life or Death. The company’s website is down with a “This website is under maintenance” message. Berru issued a statement to LA Weekly, in which he detailed his resignation from the company and said he would be checking into a rehabilitation facility for a drug and alcohol abuse problem. “There have been several reports about my alleged inappropriate behavior which deserve a response,” began the statement. “I am deeply sorry for those who I have offended by my actions and how I have made certain women feel.

The film is the dramatized story of Thor Heyerdahl and his Kon-Tiki expedition of 1947. While the prevailing theories of the time held that Polynesia had been settled by peoples migrating from the west, Heyerdahl, an experimental ethnographer and adventurer, sets out to prove his theory that people from South America settled the islands in pre-Columbian times. Noting similarities between statues found in South America and the Polynesian moai, Heyerdahl's theory about the origin of the Polynesian people is bolstered by Polynesian folklore that tells of an ancient tribe called the Hanau epe that are said to have once inhabited Easter Island. While most experts hold that such a voyage across the vast ocean is unlikely to have ever been successful, in order to illustrate that there were no technological limitations that would have inhibited the ancient peoples from making the journey, Heyerdahl puts his theory to the test and builds a balsawood raft using the same techniques that would have been utilized 1,500 years ago by the indigenous peoples of the region. Though he himself cannot swim or sail, he sets out on the treacherous 4,300 nautical mile–journey across the Pacific from Peru to Polynesia aboard the small raft, along with his crew of five men (and a macaw named Lorita). During the three months aboard the primitive vessel named after Inca god of sun and storm, Kon-Tiki, the crew's scientific reenactment of the legendary voyage from the coast of Peru to the Polynesian islands is met with setbacks in the form of storms, sharks, and other perils of the open sea.

The Kiev Uprising in November 1917 led to the defeat of Russian imperial forces in the capital. Soon after, the Central Rada took power in Kiev, while in late December 1917 the Bolsheviks set up a rival Ukrainian republic in the eastern city of Kharkov - initially also called the \\"Ukrainian People's Republic\\". Hostilities against the Central Rada government in Kiev began immediately. Under these circumstances, the Rada declared Ukrainian independence on January 22, 1918 and broke ties with Russia. The Rada had a limited armed force at its disposal and was hard-pressed by the Kharkov government which received men and resources from the Russian SFSR. As a result, the Bolsheviks quickly overran Poltava, Aleksandrovsk , and Yekaterinoslav by January 1918. Across Ukraine, local Bolsheviks also formed the Odessa and Donetsk-Krivoy Rog Soviet Republics; and in the south Nestor Makhno formed the Free Territory - an anarchist region - then allied his forces with the Bolsheviks. Aided by the earlier Kiev Arsenal Uprising, the Red Guards entered the capital on February 9, 1918. This forced the Central Rada to evacuate to Zhytomyr. In the meantime, the Romanians took over Bessarabia. Most remaining Russian Imperial Army units either allied with the Bolsheviks or joined the Ukrainian People's Army. A notable exception was Colonel Mikhail Drozdovsky, who marched his White Volunteer Army unit across the whole of Novorossiya to the River Don, defeating Makhno's forces in the process.

Passage: The Dukes of Hazzard follows the adventures of \\"The Duke Boys,\\" cousins Bo Duke (John Schneider) and Luke Duke (Tom Wopat) (including Coy and Vance Duke for most of season 5), who live on a family farm in fictional Hazzard County, Georgia, with their attractive female cousin Daisy (Catherine Bach) and their wise old Uncle Jesse (Denver Pyle). The Duke boys race around in their customized 1969 Dodge Charger stock car, dubbed (The) General Lee, evading crooked and corrupt county commissioner Boss Hogg (Sorrell Booke) and his bumbling and corrupt Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane (James Best) along with his deputy (s), and always managing to get caught in the middle of the various escapades and incidents that often occur in the area. Bo and Luke had previously been sentenced to probation for illegal transportation of moonshine; their Uncle Jesse made a plea bargain with the U.S. Government to refrain from distilling moonshine in exchange for Bo and Luke's freedom. As a result, Bo and Luke are on probation and not allowed to carry firearms -- instead, they often use compound bows, sometimes with arrows tipped with dynamite -- or to leave Hazzard County unless they get probation permission from their probation officer, Boss Hogg, although the exact details of their probation terms vary from episode to episode. Sometimes it is implied that they would be jailed for merely crossing the county line; on other occasions, it is shown that they may leave Hazzard, as long as they are back within a certain time limit.

Head VI is an oil-on-canvas painting by the Irish-born figurative artist Francis Bacon, the last of six panels making up his \\"1949 Head\\" series. It shows a bust view of a single figure, modeled on Diego Velázquez's Portrait of Innocent X. Bacon applies forceful, expressive brush strokes, and places the figure within a glass cage structure, behind curtain-like drapery. This gives the effect of a man trapped and suffocated by his surroundings, screaming into an airless void. Head VI was the first of Bacon's paintings to reference Velázquez, whose portrait of Pope Innocent X haunted him throughout his career and inspired his series of \\"screaming popes\\", a loose series of which there are around 45 surviving individual works. Head VI contains many motifs that were to reappear in Bacon's work. The hanging object, which may be a light switch or curtain tassel, can be found even in his late paintings. The geometric cage is a motif that appears as late as his 1985–86 masterpiece Study for a Self-Portrait—Triptych. Head VI was first exhibited in November 1949 at the Hanover Gallery in London, in a showing organised by one of the artist's early champions, Erica Brausen. At the time, Bacon was a highly controversial but respected artist, best known for his 1944 Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion, which made him the enfant terrible of British art. Head VI drew a mixed reaction from art critics; John Russell, later Bacon's biographer, at the time dismissed it as a cross between \\"an alligator shorn of its jaws and an accountant in pince-nez who has come to a bad end\\". In 1989 Lawrence Gowing wrote that the \\"shock of the picture, when it was seen with a whole series of heads ... was indescribable. It was everything unpardonable. The paradoxical appearance at once of pastiche and iconoclasm was indeed one of Bacon's most original strokes.\\" Art critic and curator David Sylvester described it as a seminal piece from Bacon's unusually productive 1949–50 period, and one of Bacon's finest popes. Answer:","response":"The first name of the person Russell was the biographer for is Francis. This can be determined from the sentence, \\"Head VI drew a mixed reaction from art critics; John Russell, later Bacon's biographer, at the time dismissed it as a cross between \\"an alligator shorn of its jaws and an accountant in pince-nez who has come to a bad end\\".\\" Since the paragraph is primarily about the artist Francis Bacon, we can deduce that John Russell was the biographer for Francis."},{"question":"Jan decided that they would go out and dance with their friends.

A: The severe weather in the Alps has been studied since the 18th century; particularly the weather patterns such as the seasonal foehn wind. Does the answer correctly answer the question Choose your answer from: (i). yes. (ii). no.","response":"(i). yes. The study of severe weather in the Alps dates back to the 18th century. Scientists and researchers have had a long-standing interest in understanding the region's unique weather patterns, including the seasonal foehn wind. Over the years, various methods and approaches have been employed to analyze the meteorological phenomena of the Alps and develop a better understanding of their impacts on the surrounding environment and human activities. This interest in Alpine meteorology can be evidenced by the works of several notable scientists and researchers since the Age of Enlightenment in the 1700s. Horace-Bénédict de Saussure, a Swiss physicist and geologist, was one of the pioneers in Alpine meteorology. His ground-breaking work, \\"Voyages dans les Alpes\\" (Travels in the Alps, 1779-1796), documented his numerous scientific expeditions to the region and contributed significantly to the understanding of Alpine geography, geology, and meteorology at that time. Aside from De Saussure, other notable figures who contributed to the study of severe weather in the Alps include Alexander von Humboldt, Julius Hann, and Wladimir Köppen. These scientists made advancements in observational meteorology and the study of climatology during the 18th and 19th centuries. It was in the 19th century, particularly during the second half, when meteorological observation networks were established in the region. These networks collected data on temperature, wind speed and direction, pressure, and precipitation patterns, which further improved the understanding of severe weather patterns in the Alps. Over time, as technology and our knowledge of atmospheric processes advanced, the study of severe weather in the Alps expanded in both scope and methodology. Researchers began to utilize satellite imagery, numerical weather prediction models, and better instruments, such as radiosondes, to study the regional weather phenomena and their impacts more accurately. In summary, the study of severe weather in the Alps has been ongoing since the 18th century, with advancements in observational data and technology enabling a deeper understanding of the region's unique weather patterns. As a result, our modern knowledge of Alpine meteorology has its roots in the early works of pioneers such as de Saussure, who took the first steps in exploring and documenting the meteorological phenomena that occur in the challenging and complex environment of the Alps."},{"question":"Q: Fact 1: When a hemisphere is tilted towards the sun , that hemisphere receives more direct sunlight.

Amniocentesis is not performed for every pregnancy, but is generally done when an increased risk of genetic defects in the fetus is indicated, by mother's age (over 35 years is common), family history of genetic defects, or other factors. Paragraph: David is a doctor with the city hospital. Today, he is seeing four patients, patient A, patient B, patient C, and patient D. All four patients are expectant mothers. Moreover, patient A is over thirty five years old, but patient B is under thirty five years old. Patient C has family history of genetic disorder, but patient D does not have any family history of genetic disorder. David needs to prescribe appropriate treatment according to each patient's condition. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which patient would be more at risk of genetic defects in the fetus, patient A or patient B? Answer:","response":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, patient A would be at a higher risk of genetic defects in the fetus compared to patient B. This is because patient A is over thirty-five years old, which is considered a common risk factor for genetic abnormalities in a pregnancy. On the other hand, patient B is under thirty-five years old and does not share the same age-related risk factor as patient A. It is important to note, however, that the risk of genetic defects in a fetus can be influenced by a variety of factors, not just maternal age. In this scenario, patient C has a family history of genetic disorders, which can also increase the risk of having a baby with genetic abnormalities. This factor should also be considered when assessing the risk for each patient. In conclusion, based solely on the age factor mentioned in the paragraph, patient A would be at a higher risk of genetic defects in the fetus compared to patient B. However, other relevant factors, such as the family history of genetic disorders in patient C, should also be considered when determining the appropriate course of treatment and care for each patient. Dr. David should assess each patient individually, taking into account their specific risk factors and medical history, in order to provide the most suitable care and recommendations."},{"question":"Q: What do we call the only light that people can see?

Whatever chance the former Labor prime minister had in the race to be the next UN secretary-general has been sunk by Malcolm Turnbull's decision not to support him. At one level it's a decision of minuscule importance, given Rudd's chances were remote anyway. But it's interesting in other ways. For a start, it ends the general assumption that Australian governments will support one of us for major international jobs whatever our domestic political differences. Thus Bob Hawke backed Malcolm Fraser's failed bid to be Commonwealth secretary-general. Mr Rudd appointed Brendan Nelson and Tim Fischer to important diplomatic posts. My countryman, right or wrong, was a step too far for Mr Turnbull, who was left holding the damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don't hot potato after cabinet couldn't agree. It would have helped if he'd gone beyond a bland \\"not well-suited for the position\\", especially as his Foreign Minister Julie Bishop favoured supporting Rudd. Repudiating the relevant minister, especially one so senior, deserves some explanation. We can guess what the objections were and they'd have had more to do with personality - especially his short fuse and impatience - than capacity. Ironically, it's Mr Rudd's better qualities - his experience, his enthusiasm, his genuine interest in making a difference - that would probably have counted against him in the end. The UN, or at least the permanent members of the Security Council, probably want a respectable frontman (or woman), but not an activist liable to go off on adventures of his own. For Mr Turnbull, the risk lies less in the merits of his Olympics-eve decision than in the appearance, if not the reality, that he's increasingly hostage to his right wing, which generally was anti-Rudd. Summary:","response":"The chance for former Australian Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, to be the next United Nations secretary-general has been quashed by the current Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's decision not to support him. This decision, even given that Rudd’s chances were small to begin with, is notable as it shatters the general belief that Australian governments would support one of their own pursuing significant international roles regardless of domestic politics. Turnbull found himself in a difficult position after the cabinet found no consensus on the matter. The Prime Minister has offered no clarity beyond describing Rudd as \\"not well-suited\\", which is slightly controversial as Foreign Minister Julie Bishop was in favour of supporting Rudd. One can presume the objections were more related to personal characteristics including his quick temper and impatience, rather than capability. Ironically, it appears that Rudd's stronger traits, such as his experience, enthusiasm, and commitment to make a difference, could have ultimately worked against him. The United Nations, particularly the permanent members of the Security Council, may likely prefer a secretary-general who provides a respectable figurehead rather than an activist pursuing individual initiatives. For Turnbull, the risk in his decision lies in the perception that he is becoming too responsive to his right-wing faction, which generally was against Rudd."},{"question":"Write a sentence not in English.","response":"Step 1: Choose a language other than English.

When he was not far from his house, the light on the cart went out. He tried but could not mend it. He was near his home, and so he went along the road without a light. When a policeman saw this, he stopped the old carter. \\"Where is your light?\\" asked the policeman. \\"No man may take a cart along the road at night without a light. You know that. You have broken the law .\\" \\"I had a light, but it has just gone out,\\" said the old man. \\"I don't believe that story,\\" said the policeman. He took out a book and got ready to write.

I haven't come far without a light.\\" \\"You came all the way without a light. What's your name?\\" The carter quickly took the policeman's hand and put it down on top of the light. The light was still hot and burnt the policeman's hand. The policeman jumped and he was very angry. \\"Now, what do you think?\\" said the carter. \\"Did I come all the way without a light?\\" Question: What made the policeman believe the old man's words? Yes or no, is the answer \\"The light burnt the policeman's hands.\\"? A:","response":"Yes, the answer is \\"The light burnt the policeman's hands.\\" When the carter took the policeman's hand and placed it onto the light, which was still hot, it burnt the policeman's hand. This action served as evidence that the old man indeed had a light for most of the journey and it had only recently gone out. The warmth from the light showed the policeman that the man was telling the truth, and that he did not travel all the way without a light. This made the policeman believe the old man's words."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you will be given sentences in which your task is to recognize the name of the drug or medicine.

Despite being the life of the party, Kesu's alcohol tolerance causes problems and embarrassment, leading him to question his life decisions. Hiding behind the shadows of his alcoholic tendencies is a deeper struggle with identity and purpose. When a life-changing event occurs, Kesu embarks on a personal journey to reconcile with his past, regain control of his present, and create a promising future. Plot: Act 1: Kesu is a talented saxophone player performing in local bars and clubs, earning him some reputation in the music community. He is immensely popular and adored by his friends for his witty jokes and charming personality. Kesu's low alcohol tolerance earns him legendary status among his circle, frequently making them the center of attention. At the same time, Kesu faces pressure from his traditional family to give up the music and settle into a stable career. His father, a successful businessman, constantly belittles Kesu's musical ambitions and disapproves of his lifestyle. One night, after a wild celebration, Kesu wakes up in an unfamiliar place, having blacked out from a couple of drinks. He discovers that he has missed an important audition with a notable music producer. Ashamed and frustrated, Kesu decides to embark on a journey to find a solution to his low alcohol threshold while also trying to mend his relationship with his family. Act 2: Kesu's quest opens his eyes to the underlying reasons for his inability to handle alcohol. He starts attending AA meetings, befriending other individuals with similar struggles. Through their shared experiences, Kesu begins to understand the root of his problems: the insecurity caused by the disapproval of his father, as well as the pressure to fit into societal expectations. Kesu's newfound friendships lead him to a homeopathic doctor who prescribes a natural remedy to help deal with his low alcohol threshold. Initially skeptic, Kesu eventually starts to see improvements in his alcohol tolerance and confidence. All the while, Kesu builds a relationship with Rhea, a kindhearted and supportive woman he met at an AA meeting, who helps him confront his past and come to terms with his father's expectations. They bond over their shared love for music, and Rhea encourages Kesu to chase his dreams, even if it means defying his father's wishes. Act 3: An opportunity arises for Kesu to perform at a prestigious music festival, but his father vehemently objects, threatening to cut Kesu off from his family if he chooses to pursue music. Conflicted, Kesu turns to Rhea who encourages him to seize the opportunity and follow his heart. Empowered by his newfound sense of identity and family support, Kesu defies his father's expectations and performs at the music festival. The performance is a massive success, and Kesu's talent is recognized by renowned music producer Sasha. In the meantime, his father watches the performance in secret and witnesses the overwhelming love and appreciation Kesu receives from the audience. This finally leads to a heart-to-heart conversation between Kesu and his father, who reveals his own unfulfilled dreams of becoming a musician. They reconcile, and his father expresses his pride and support for Kesu's musical journey. The film ends with Kesu balancing his new-found control over his alcohol tolerance, a blossoming romance with Rhea, and a promising music career under Sasha's guidance, all while maintaining a healthy relationship with his family. The audience sees Kesu with a renewed sense of purpose and direction as he embraces his one last shot at living life on his terms, chasing his dreams, and making the people he loves proud."},{"question":"Read the article and select the best answer.

Pansexual, which means someone who's experience of attraction is not limited by biological sex or gender identity, is one of the fastest growing queer identities used by youth online, especially among American teens and girls.

That doesn't necessarily mean that lesbian or transgender people are less prominent in queer networks. It does, however, indicate that a growing number of young people who could have previously been overlooked in queer representation because they also date members of the opposite sex are now using social media to broadcast their queerness and celebrate the diversity of queer sexuality.

Jack is a friend of mine and he has hit the nail squarely on the head with his depiction of what it was like for American kids growing up in Viet Nam. Just because you were on a fire base, didn't mean you were safe. Shelling, sappers, friends, stupidity, sleepless nights, the overlooked heroism, were all a part of it.

Answer:","response":"The character in the adult animated film, created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone, who is known for his muffled and indiscernible speech is Kenneth \\"Kenny\\" McCormick. Kenny is one of the main characters in the animated television series \\"South Park,\\" which first aired in 1997 and continues to be popular today. The show was created by the talented duo of Trey Parker and Matt Stone, who are also known for their work on other projects such as the musical \\"The Book of Mormon\\" and the film \\"Team America: World Police.\\" Kenny McCormick is a resident of the fictional town of South Park, located in Colorado, and is best friends with the other main characters on the show: Eric Cartman, Stan Marsh, and Kyle Broflovski. He is easily identifiable by his iconic outfit consisting of an orange parka with the hood drawn tightly around his face, obscuring most of his features. This outfit is responsible for the muffled and oftentimes unintelligible speech that makes Kenny so distinctive. Due to the tight-fitting hood, his voice is depicted as being stifled, and many of the words he says are virtually inaudible, which has led to much amusement and confusion among viewers since the show's inception. Throughout the series, Kenny's muffled speech has resulted in frequent misunderstandings and miscommunications among the characters. However, his close friends have seemingly developed an ability to comprehend his words, despite their distorted nature. In the earlier seasons, Kenny's dialogue was often vulgar and risqué, which contributed to the show's adult-oriented humor. Over time, his speech has become less explicit, but it still remains challenging for viewers to decipher. Another significant aspect of Kenny's character is his recurring death. In many episodes, particularly in the earlier seasons, he would meet an untimely demise in a variety of gruesome and bizarre ways, only to inexplicably reappear in the next episode as if nothing had happened. This running gag became a prominent feature of the series, with his friends usually uttering the lines, \\"Oh my God, they killed Kenny!\\" and \\"You bastards!\\" upon witnessing his frequent demise. However, this aspect of Kenny's character has been downplayed in recent seasons, with fewer instances of his death depicted. The character of Kenny McCormick serves as a source of comic relief and satire within the show's framework, poking fun at various aspects of popular culture and societal norms. His incomprehensible speech and mysterious resurrection have made him an iconic figure within the \\"South Park\\" universe, and his presence has greatly contributed to the series' unique blend of edgy humor and biting social commentary."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Information: - Alberta is a western province of Canada.

Portuguese explorers then embarked upon Macau (now Macao), the Congo, and various other parts of Africa, including the Sudan. The Portuguese policy was to avoid armed strife and to develop a trade empire, rather than to conquer nations. To this end it succeeded with relatively few blood-soaked episodes in its colonial history. Adventures abroad, however, proved disastrous during the second half of the 16th century. In 1557 the 14-year-old boy-king Sebastião ascended the throne, the beginning of a calamitous reign that was to end at the battle of Alcacer-Quiber (Morocco) in pursuit of a vain crusade. Sebastião's untimely demise, alongside some 18,000 ill-prepared, badly led followers, set the stage for a crisis of succession. For many years afterwards, legends and rumors bizarrely insisted that the king was still alive, and imposters turned up from time to time claiming the throne; those who were plausible enough to be deemed a threat were summarily executed. In fact, the only rightful claimant to the crown was the elderly Prince Henry. But after two years of alternating between the throne and his sickbed, he died, heirless. Surveying the situation and smelling an opportunity, Spain occupied the power vacuum, and Portugal's neighbor and long-time antagonist became its master. Spanish rule dictated Portugal's inadvertent involvement in Spain's ongoing wars. In 1587 a squadron of British ships commanded by Francis Drake attacked the Algarve (now a \\"legitimate target\\" as Spanish territory) and sacked Sagres, thus depriving the world of the relics of Henry the Navigator. Nine years later Faro was torched. The 1386 Treaty of Windsor, by which Britain and Portugal had pledged eternal friendship, seemed a distant memory. Portugal's empire was gradually eroded, and many of its trading posts (with the notable exception of Brazil) were picked off by the British and Dutch. Finally, after 60 years of Spanish rule, Portuguese noblemen (aided by the French, then at war with Spain) organized a palace coup and restored independence. The Great Disaster Portugal's greatest misfortune struck on All Saint's Day, 1 November 1755.

Answer:","response":"The choking perturbation, in this context, refers to an obstruction or hindrance in the process that might affect fossil formation. If choking occurs, it may have both direct and indirect effects on fossil formation. Here's a detailed analysis of how this perturbation might affect the fossilization process: 1. Direct effects: a. If choking occurs during the decomposition of the organisms, it might slow down or alter the rate of decomposition and burial. This can lead to less optimal conditions for preservation and fossilization of the remains. b. Choking may prevent or alter the scattering and burial of bones, which is essential for fossil formation. If bones are not properly buried and protected from external factors, they are less likely to fossilize. 2. Indirect effects: a. Choking can alter the environmental conditions, such as reduced oxygen levels, that are favorable for fossilization. This can decrease the likelihood of remains turning into fossils. b. As a result of the altered conditions, there may be changes in the balance of the ecosystem, such as shifts in scavenger populations and their feeding behaviors. This can further affect the dispersion and burial of bones. c. Choking may also influence weather patterns and the rate of erosion, which could either expose fossils prematurely or keep them buried for longer periods. This would affect the discovery and study of fossils. In conclusion, the choking perturbation can have both direct and indirect effects on the fossil formation process. Depending on the severity and persistence of this perturbation, it can potentially hinder or alter the conditions necessary for fossil formation, thereby affecting the number of fossils formed and our ability to discover and study them."},{"question":"Produce a sentence which mentions all of these concepts: garden, look, rain","response":"Step 1: Identify the main concepts to include in the sentence - garden, look, rain.

Comet A and comet B would enter the inner solar system. But comet C would not enter the inner solar system. Moreover, comet A is categorized as a bright comet, but comet B is categorized as a faint comet. Whcih comet would be visible to naked eye, comet A or comet B? Hint: A comet tail—and coma—are features visible in comets when they are illuminated by the Sun and may become visible from Earth when a comet passes through the inner Solar System. As a comet approaches the inner Solar System, solar radiation causes the volatile materials within the comet to vaporize and stream out of the nucleus, carrying dust away with them. Separate tails are formed of dust and gases, becoming visible through different phenomena; the dust reflects sunlight directly and the gases glow from ionisation. Most comets are too faint to be visible without the aid of a telescope, but a few each decade become bright enough to be visible to the naked eye. A:","response":"Based on the given information, we can determine the potential visibility of comets A and B as they pass through the inner solar system. Characterizing comets as \\"bright\\" or \\"faint\\" refers to their apparent magnitude, which is a measure of how bright an astronomical object appears to an observer on Earth. Comet A is described as a bright comet. In this context, \\"bright\\" signifies that it has a higher magnitude or intensity of brightness than a faint comet. As comet A enters the inner solar system, solar radiation will cause its volatile materials to vaporize and stream out of its nucleus, forming a coma and tail. The dust in the tail will reflect sunlight, making it visible from Earth. Since comet A is classified as a bright comet, the reflected sunlight is likely to be intense enough to be visible to the naked eye. On the other hand, comet B is categorized as a faint comet. This suggests that the magnitude of reflection from its dust tail will be significantly lower than that of a bright comet. While comet B will also form a tail as it enters the inner solar system due to the solar radiation, the intensity of the reflected sunlight from its tail may not be strong enough for it to be visible to the naked eye. Taking into consideration the given hint, which states that most comets are too faint to be visible without the aid of a telescope but a few bright ones become visible to the naked eye each decade, we can reasonably conclude that comet A, being a bright comet, would likely be visible to the naked eye as it passes through the inner solar system. In contrast, comet B, which is categorized as a faint comet, would probably not be visible without the aid of a telescope."},{"question":"Carson was an inspirational speaker who spoke at my college one time, and Carson changed my life forever.

Tweet:DAMN YOU, BBC! Andy Hamilton cannot be in two places at once *mahoosive sulk*","response":"Analysing the sentiment of a statement involves evaluating the emotional tone behind that statement. Here are the steps we will take: Step 1: Identify the Subjective Statements. From the tweet, we can assume subjective phrases such as \\"DAMN YOU\\" and \\"*mahoosive sulk*\\" indicate strong emotions from the user. Step 2: Determine The Polarity. The phrase \\"DAMN YOU\\" is typically used to express anger or frustration, so the sentiment polarity could be considered negative. Also, \\"mahoosive sulk\\" indicates an exaggerated state of being upset or unhappy, which is also a negative sentiment. Step 3: Consider the Overall Sentiment. Although the tweet may contain elements of humor (because of the language being used), the overall sentiment is negative in nature due to the use of strong negative phrases and words. Therefore, it can be concluded that the overall sentiment of the tweet is negative. The tweet expresses a dissatisfaction or frustration with BBC, likely because of scheduling two shows featuring Andy Hamilton at the same time."},{"question":"Here is a premise: He ripped up his plans and began a new set.

Jennifer is a strong environmentalist and doesn't want to move to a city that contributes a lot to climate change since she feels it's every person's duty to take care of the Earth. She looks online and finds out about two cities in Minnesota that are several hundred miles apart. Jamestown has a very famous water park and uses coal to generate the city's electricity. Dapperton, the other city she is considering, has a neat hobby shop that Jennifer likes and the city uses nuclear power for its electricity needs. Given Jennifer's stance on the environment, which city shouldn't she move to? Hint: In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. Fossil fuels are also limited and may eventually run out. Like fossil fuels, radioactive elements are limited. In fact, they are relatively rare, so they could run out sooner rather than later. On the other hand, nuclear fission does not release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with burning fossil fuels. This is the major advantage of using nuclear fission as a source of energy.","response":"Given Jennifer's stance on the environment, she should avoid moving to Jamestown.

When young, he would often make his own puppet theater to amuse himself. His mother, foreshadowing his future as an entertainer, often would tell him to \\"save it for the stage\\". At age 13, he survived the 1944 Hartford Circus Fire, which killed 169 people in Connecticut. Context: Magazine and newspaper profiles of Reilly throughout the 1970s and 1980s did not mention his personal life or sexuality. Many years after the cancellation of Match Game, he revealed his homosexuality in his theatrical one-man show, Save It for the Stage: The Life of Reilly. Much like fellow game-show regular Paul Lynde of the same era, despite Reilly's off-camera silence, he gave signals on-camera of a campy persona. In many episodes of Match Game, he lampooned himself by briefly affecting \\"YO!\\" in a deep voice and the nickname \\"Chuck\\" and self-consciously describing how \\"butch\\" he was. Many years after his game show career ended, he mentioned in a 2002 interview with Entertainment Tonight that he felt no need to explain his joke about \\"Chuck\\", and that he never purposely hid being gay from anyone. Patrick Hughes III, a set decorator and dresser, was Reilly's domestic partner; the two met backstage while Reilly appeared on the game show Battlestars, although their partnership was not revealed publicly. They lived together in Beverly Hills. Despite sporting what appeared to be a full head of hair for most of the prime of his television career, Reilly was in fact bald, wearing a toupee throughout most of his appearances in the 1970s and 1980s. During the taping of Match Game 74, his toupee became the joke of the filming when Reilly had to go to New York City to have his toupee adjusted. During the taping of several episodes, Reilly was seen wearing different hats because his toupee was back in New York waiting for him to be fitted. This was the start of the long-running jokes on Match Game about his hair. He abandoned the toupee in the late 1990s and appeared bald in public for the rest of his life. He dramatized the experience in his stage show The Life of Reilly. In one episode of Match Game '78, he took off his toupee and gave it to a bald contestant by putting it on his head. One can briefly see Reilly's bald head as he rushed back to his seat and put on a hat to cover up. In one of his several appearances on The Tonight Show, Reilly publicly discussed having to fix or adjust his toupee before going out for the evening. Among his revelations to Carson while a guest on the show were: that he had nothing to wear but a specific tuxedo; his stories as a director of a play; and how wonderful many of the other guests on that night's panel were when Reilly had worked with them, either in film or in the theater. Question: How did this effect his work? Answer:","response":"Reilly's personal and private life, including his sexuality, toupee, and experiences, had both direct and indirect effects on his work throughout his career. However, he managed to utilize these aspects in a way that contributed positively to his identity as an entertainer, strengthening the connection with his audience and embracing his unique persona. 1. Campy persona and on-camera signals: Reilly's campy persona and the on-camera signals he displayed were indicators of his personal life and his embracing of his gay identity. Much like Paul Lynde, Reilly chose to present himself in a campy way while maintaining his privacy off-camera. His occasional deep voice \\"YO!\\" and self-conscious jokes about being \\"butch\\" became part of his on-screen character, showcasing his sense of humor and quick wit, which proved to be valuable traits in his game show career. His ability to incorporate his personal experiences into his work allowed him to connect with audiences on a deeper level, making his appearance on shows like Match Game more relatable and genuine. 2. The toupee incidents: The lengths Reilly went to maintain his appearance, such as wearing a toupee, had a direct impact on his work. As evident in the filming of Match Game 74 and other episodes, his hair became a running joke on the show. Reilly's willingness to embrace this aspect of his life and make light of it displayed his ability to adapt and turn potentially awkward situations into moments of humor and self-deprecation. By removing his toupee in an episode of Match Game '78 and giving it to a bald contestant, Reilly showcased his unique ability to connect with others by sharing his own insecurities and making audiences feel more at ease. 3. Sharing personal stories on The Tonight Show: Reilly's openness about his personal life, toupee adjustments, and experiences working in the entertainment industry allowed him to bond with audiences and fellow guests on shows like The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson. By discussing his struggles with his appearance and sharing anecdotal stories from his career, Reilly humanized himself to viewers, displaying vulnerability and inviting them to empathize with him. These appearances further solidified his reputation as an approachable, genuine entertainer who could connect with audiences on a personal level. In conclusion, Reilly's personal life and the aspects of his private life that were often brought into the public eye, like his sexuality and his toupee, had both direct and indirect effects on his work. However, they ultimately contributed positively to his career by showcasing his authenticity, humor, and ability to connect with audiences. Through his openness about his life experiences and his embracing of his unique characteristics, Reilly was able to cultivate a public persona that resonated with viewers and solidified his legacy as a beloved entertainer."},{"question":"Question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who did not speak to anyone when a staff member asked if they could help him? ? Sometime after 4 p.m. on December 6, 1989, Marc Lépine arrived at the building housing the École Polytechnique, an engineering school affiliated with the Université de Montréal, armed with a semi-automatic rifle and a hunting knife. Lépine purchased a rifle on November 21, 1989, in a Checkmate Sports store in Montreal. He had told the clerk that he was going to use it to hunt small game. Lépine had been in and around the École Polytechnique building at least seven times in the weeks leading up to December 6. Lépine first sat in the office of the registrar on the second floor for a while. While there, he was seen rummaging through a plastic bag. He did not speak to anyone, even when a staff member asked if she could help him. Lépine left the office and was subsequently seen in other parts of the building before entering a second-floor mechanical engineering class of about sixty students at about 5:10 p.m. After approaching the student giving a presentation, he asked everyone to stop everything and ordered the women and men to opposite sides of the classroom. No one moved at first, believing it to be a joke until he fired a shot into the ceiling.Lépine then separated the nine women from the approximately fifty men and ordered the men to leave. He asked the remaining women whether they knew why they were there, and when one student replied \\"no,\\" he answered: \\"I am fighting feminism.\\" One of the students, Nathalie Provost, said, \\"Look, we are just women studying engineering, not necessarily feminists ready to march on the streets to shout we are against men, just students intent on leading a normal life.\\" Lépine responded, \\"You're women, you're going to be engineers. You're all a bunch of feminists. I hate feminists.\\" He then opened fire on the students from left to right, killing six, and wounding three others, including Provost. Before leaving the room, he wrote the word shit twice on a student project.Lépine continued into the second-floor corridor and wounded three students before entering another room where... Answer:","response":"Lépine"},{"question":"As noted above, the 9/11 plotters spent somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000 to plan and conduct their attack. The available evidence indicates that the 19 operatives were funded by al Qaeda, either through wire transfers or cash provided by KSM, which they carried into the United States or deposited in foreign accounts and accessed from this country. Our investigation has uncovered no credible evidence that any person in the United States gave the hijackers substantial financial assistance. Similarly, we have seen no evidence that any foreign government-or foreign government official-supplied any funding. We have found no evidence that the Hamburg cell members (Atta, Shehhi, Jarrah, and Binalshibh) received funds from al Qaeda before late 1999. It appears they supported themselves. KSM, Binalshibh, and another plot facilitator, Mustafa al Hawsawi, each received money, in some cases perhaps as much as 10,000, to perform their roles in the plot. After the Hamburg recruits joined the 9/11 conspiracy, al Qaeda began giving them money. Our knowledge of the funding during this period, before the operatives entered the United States, remains murky. According to KSM, the Hamburg cell members each received 5,000 to pay for their return to Germany from Afghanistan after they had been selected to join the plot, and they received additional funds for travel from Germany to the United States. Financial transactions of the plotters are discussed in more detail in chapter 7. Requirements for a Successful Attack As some of the core operatives prepared to leave for the United States, al Qaeda's leaders could have reflected on what they needed to be able to do in order to organize and conduct a complex international terrorist operation to inflict catastrophic harm. We believe such a list of requirements would have included leaders able to evaluate, approve, and supervise the planning and direction of the operation; communications sufficient to enable planning and direction of the operatives and those who would be helping them; a personnel system that could recruit candidates, vet them, indoctrinate them, and give them necessary training; an intelligence effort to gather required information and form assessments of enemy strengths and weaknesses; the ability to move people; and the ability to raise and move the necessary money. The information we have presented about the development of the planes operation shows how, by the spring and summer of 2000, al Qaeda was able to meet these requirements. By late May 2000, two operatives assigned to the planes operation were already in the United States. Three of the four Hamburg cell members would soon arrive. Question: \\"What requirements was Al Qaeda able to meet by spring and summer of 2000?\\" Answer: \\"Secret hideout\\" Is this answer correct?","response":"No, this answer is not correct. The correct answer is that by spring and summer of 2000, Al Qaeda was able to meet the following requirements to carry out a complex international terrorist operation: 1. Leaders who could evaluate, approve, and supervise the planning and direction of the operation. 2. Communications sufficient to enable planning and direction of the operatives and those helping them. 3. A personnel system that could recruit candidates, vet them, indoctrinate them, and give them necessary training. 4.

Hidden away for decades, Columbia and Challenger debris is on display at a new NASA exhibit at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Fla., the AP reports. Among the remnants are a large body panel from the Challenger, with its marred but colorful image of the US flag, and the partly burnt cockpit windows of the Columbia. Challenger's debris had been locked away in abandoned missile silos, and Columbia's in private NASA offices, until the space organization began quietly exhuming them four years ago for the \\"Forever Remembered\\" exhibit. \\"Our biggest concern the whole time was doing the right thing,\\" says shuttle engineer Michael Ciannilli, who oversaw the project. \\"There's more to this story\\" than the disasters, he adds. \\"Great pains were taken not to have anything sensationalized or exploited.\\" To that end, the dimly lit exhibit opened earlier this month includes no images of either disaster.

However, now the debris of Columbia and Challenger are finally on display at a new NASA exhibit in the Kennedy Space Center located in Cape Canaveral, Florida. Exhibit details The \\"Forever Remembered\\" exhibit serves as a tribute to the memory of the 14 astronauts who lost their lives in the deadly space shuttle disasters. The exhibit presents a range of wreckage, including a marred body panel from the Challenger, showcasing a colorful but damaged image of the US flag, and the partially burnt cockpit windows of the Columbia. The debris had been concealed in abandoned missile silos and private NASA offices until it was retrieved for the exhibit. The making of this exhibit Michael Ciannilli, a former shuttle engineer, oversaw the project of putting together the \\"Forever Remembered\\" exhibit. Beginning in 2015, the process of bringing the debris to light was carried out with great care, to ensure that the memories of the astronauts and the disasters were not exploited. Ciannilli said, \\"Our biggest concern the whole time was doing the right thing.\\" The exhibit avoids any sensationalism, and there are no images of the disasters themselves. Personal artifacts To honor the personal stories of the astronauts, the dimly lit exhibit also displays personal artifacts donated by their families. Items such as the Bible and cowboy boots of Columbia Commander Rick Husband are featured, alongside the \\"TFNG\\" T-shirt of Challenger Commander Francis Scobee. These artifacts offer a glimpse into the lives of the brave individuals who ventured into space, seeking to further humankind's knowledge and understanding of the cosmos. Reactions Evelyn Husband-Thompson, the widow of Rick Husband, expressed her admiration for the exhibit, saying, \\"As you walk in, you know that you're in a special place.\\" Conclusion The \\"Forever Remembered\\" exhibit is a poignant reminder of the risks and sacrifices made by those who seek to explore the cosmos. The Challenger exploded just one minute and thirteen seconds after takeoff on January 28, 1986, while the Columbia broke apart upon re-entry over Texas on February 1, 2003. Each shuttle carried a crew of seven, all of whom lost their lives in these tragic events. As visitors walk through the exhibit, the memory of these courageous astronauts continues to live on, inspiring future generations to push the boundaries of space exploration."},{"question":"Write an article using the following points: Comedian Dean Obeidallah: Stephen Colbert is considering running for president. He channels Colbert, satirically calls his candidacy a threat to our way of life. Obeidallah: Why do media coddle Colbert just because he calls himself a \\"comedian\\"","response":"Title: The Curious Case of Stephen Colbert's Potential Presidential Candidacy Introduction: Stephen Colbert, the critically acclaimed comedian and television host, has recently sparked conversations surrounding a potential run for President. As someone known for his satirical portrayal of political figures, the prospect of Colbert entering the political arena himself has raised mixed reactions. In response, fellow comedian Dean Obeidallah has gone as far as to label Colbert's potential candidacy as a threat to our way of life. However, the more perplexing question is, why does the media seem to coddle Colbert just because he calls himself a \\"comedian\\"? The Colbert Effect: Dean Obeidallah, who is no stranger to political satire himself, recognizes the controversies that run rampant within politics. He acknowledges that Colbert, through his distinct brand of humor and wit, has managed to highlight and poke fun at various political issues. This ability to mock the absurdity within politics has endeared the comedian to the hearts of many Americans. However, Obeidallah believes that this talent could also prove dangerous when one such as Colbert is given a serious platform for political discourse. The Satirical Candidacy as a Threat: As Colbert contemplates taking a step into the world of politics, Dean Obeidallah sarcastically frames his candidacy as a threat to the established order. This witty remark highlights the sense of fear and anxiety that such a sudden leap could instigate within the political establishment. The idea of a comedian entering the political realm, perceived by some as a joke in itself, could disrupt the status quo. Not only would this shift in dynamics potentially impact policy debates, but it could also introduce greater scrutiny and criticism of political leaders who may not appreciate the jest. The Media's Coddling of Colbert: Given that Colbert's possible entry into politics has received a variety of reactions, the immediate question that arises is why the media seem to be so enamored with the idea. Obeidallah suggests that it is primarily because Colbert identifies himself as a comedian. The label provides Colbert with a certain level of protection that separates him from the sphere of \\"serious\\" politicians. This unique position allows him to tackle political issues from a distinctly satirical angle, while the media remains less critical and more lenient with him. Conclusion: In conclusion, the potential presidential candidacy of comedian Stephen Colbert may very well disrupt the established order within the world of politics. As Dean Obeidallah wryly points out, Colbert's entrance into the political arena could be seen as a threat to our way of life. While his wit and understanding of the absurdity within politics have endeared Colbert to many, the media's propensity to coddle him as a comedian may ultimately contribute to a dangerous and unpredictable journey in politics were he to run for the presidency. Whether Colbert pursues this path or remains within the world of satire and television, the larger implications of such a move will undoubtedly continue to generate debate and discussion."},{"question":"In this task, You are given an open-domain question that can be answered based on factual information.

Geumgang, a scenic resort in North Korea. The schedule for the reunions of families separated by the Korean War (1950-53) — which will be the first since October 2010 — was finalized after the South accepted a proposal by the North at a meeting in the truce village of Panmunjeom. The timing is likely to coincide with the start of joint ROK-U.S. war games, triggering speculation that the North may use the meetings as a way to promote its claim that the two allies are preparing for an invasion. Around 100 individuals from South Korea will participate in the family reunions and will stay at the North's Mt. Geumgang Hotel during their six-day visit, as Seoul requested, the Ministry of Unification said. Officials here will be dispatched to the North on Friday for inspection purposes, added the ministry. \\"The two sides have also decided to discuss — after the family reunions — other humanitarian issues, including the returning of South Koreans who were kidnapped by the North,\\" the ministry said. Experts say the family reunions are expected to serve as a cornerstone in improving the current conflict-ridden South-North relations. North Korea's chief delegate to the working-level Red Cross talks, Pak Yong-il, said that the latest gathering \\"is a very important starting point in improving North-South relations,\\" according to the ministry. In response, South Korean chief delegate, Lee Duck-hang, called for \\"more mutual efforts to build trust between the South and North.\\" Setting dates for the reunions was one of the major sticking points in negotiations. Seoul earlier proposed launching the reunions Feb. 17, but Pyongyang rejected the idea. It instead called for a cancellation of Seoul's annual joint military exercises with Washington, dubbed Foal Eagle and Key Resolve. But the allies refused to do so, saying that their exercises were defensive in nature. The joint drills kick off later this month and are likely to overlap with the upcoming reunions. Family reunions are an urgent issue because most of the separated Koreans are in their 70s and 80s. The two Koreas have held 18 reunions since 2000, but they were halted in 2010 after relations soured in the wake of North Korea's deadly attack on a South Korean warship and an island. Last year, the sides agreed to hold family reunions at Mt. Geumgang, but Pyongyang abruptly called them off at the last minute. Over 20,000 separated family members here have met their relatives, but there are around 70,000 South Koreans registered to participate in the program. ||||| 2014/02/05 16:25 By Kim Kwang-tae SEOUL, Feb. 5 (Yonhap) -- South and North Korea agreed Wednesday to stage a new round of reunions later this month for families separated by the 1950-53 Korean War, an official said, a move that could help ease tensions on the Korean Peninsula. The reunions -- the first since October 2010 -- will be held at Mount Kumgang, a scenic resort on North Korea's east coast, from Feb. 20 to 25, according to the text of an agreement reached at their Red Cross talks. The deal is the first sign of progress in improving inter-Korean relations that have worsened due to the North's military threats against the South in recent months. North Korea's chief delegate Pak Yong-Il said that the Red Cross meeting \\"is a very important starting point for improving the North-South relations.\\" Pak made the comments at the beginning of the meeting at the border village of Panmunjom, according to a brief audio file released by the unification ministry, which handles inter-Korean affairs. The planned reunions coincide with South Korea's annual joint military exercises with Washington, which are set to run from late February through April. North Korea has pressed South Korea to scrap the drills, condemning them as a rehearsal for a nuclear war against it. Seoul and Washington have vowed to go ahead with the exercises, calling them defensive in nature. About 28,500 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea, a legacy of the Korean War. The North had indictated that the reunions could not be held \\"amid gunfire,\\" referring to the military drills. The North mentioned the joint military exercises and its recent conciliatory overture at the border talks, though it did not attach a condition for the family reunions, said the unification ministry official, requesting anonymity. Last month, the North offered a series of conciliatory gestures that called for the cancellation of the joint military drills. It also proposed halting all slander and all hostile military acts between the two Koreas. South Korea had rejected the North's overture as a \\"deceptive\\" ploy. On Wednesday, South Korea said it can discuss other issues with North Korea if the reunions go well. The sides also agreed to hold Red Cross talks after the reunions to resolve humanitarian issues, in an apparent reference to South Korean prisoners of war and abductees being held in the communist country, as well as Seoul's food aid to the North. South Korea has repeatedly called on the North to hold the reunions, calling them a first step toward improving inter-Korean relations. Last year, the sides agreed to hold family reunions at Mount Kumgang, but Pyongyang abruptly called them off at the last minute. Family reunions are a highly emotional issue on the divided peninsula, as most of the separated family members are in their 70s and 80s, and wish to see their long-lost relatives before they die. There are no direct means of contact between ordinary civilians of the two countries that remain divided by a heavily fortified border. The divided Koreas have held more than a dozen rounds of reunions since their landmark summit in 2000, bringing together more than 21,700 family members who had not seen each other since the Korean War. entropy@yna.co.kr (END) ||||| North and South Korea agreed yesterday to hold a reunion later this month for families separated by the 1950-53 Korean War - the first such event for more than three years. Officials from both sides, meeting in the border truce village of Panmunjom, decided the reunion would be held from February 20-25 at the North's Mount Kumgang resort, the South's Unification Ministry said. The agreement marks a small sign of progress between the two rivals who, in recent years, have struggled to co-operate on even the most basic trust-building measures. However, both sides have been here before. The two Koreas had agreed to hold a reunion last September but, even as the chosen relatives prepared to make their way to Mount Kumgang, Pyongyang cancelled the event just four days before its scheduled start, citing \\"hostility\\" from the South. And there are widespread concerns that the families could end up being disappointed again this time around. South Korea is due to begin joint military exercises with the United States at the end of February, and North Korea has warned of dire consequences should they go ahead. The annual drills are always a diplomatic flashpoint on the Korean peninsula, and last year resulted in an unusually extended period of heightened military tension. Yoo Ho-yeol, professor of North Korean Studies at Seoul's Korea University, predicted that the North would use the reunion as a bargaining chip. \\"Rather than cancelling the event again, it may try to extract concessions, like a scaling down of the joint military exercises, or an easing of South Korean sanctions,\\" Yoo said. Millions of Koreans were separated by the war, and the vast majority have since died without having any communication at all with surviving relatives. Because the Korean conflict concluded with an armistice rather than a peace treaty, the two Koreas technically remain at war and direct exchanges of letters or telephone calls are prohibited. Up to 73,000 South Koreans are on a waiting list for a chance to take part in one of the reunion events, which select only a few hundred participants at a time. The reunion programme began in earnest in 2000 following an historic inter-Korean summit. Sporadic events since then have seen around 17,000 relatives briefly reunited. But the programme was suspended in 2010 following the North's shelling of a South Korean border island. Pyongyang is also pushing for a resumption of six-party talks on its nuclear programme - a long-stalled process involving the two Koreas, China, Japan, Russia and the United States. Since the beginning of the year, North Korea has been on a charm offensive, making a series of conciliatory gestures that critics have largely dismissed. ||||| Summary:","response":"North and South Korea have agreed to hold family reunions for those separated by the Korean War from February 20-25 at Mt. Geumgang, a resort in North Korea. This will be the first reunion since 2010, and around 100 South Koreans will participate. The reunions are expected to improve relations between the two Koreas. The reunions are an important issue as most of the separated individuals are now in their 70s and 80s. Although the two sides have held reunions before, there are concerns that they may be canceled again due to South Korea's joint military exercises with the United States, which North Korea has warned against."},{"question":"Yes / no, is the following a verifiable fact? \\"One can find that the actor Christopher Reeve played Superman in his prime before a horse-related accident and incident left him paralyzed.\\" The thought process:","response":"Yes, it is a verifiable fact that Christopher Reeve played Superman in his prime before a horse-related accident left him paralyzed."},{"question":"This is a test of commonsense with single/multi-choices.

Every single petal, bowl, stem and branch of cascading glass has been handblown under the guidance of Washington State native Dale Chihuly (in fact he grew up in nearby Tacoma), and we couldn’t quite believe our eyes. Having discovered this exhibit through the magic of Jaime’s instagram (she’s a self-named Angloyankophile who grew up in Seattle before moving to London) I knew we would have to visit. My photos don’t do the undulating forms any kind of justice; but they might just convey the incredible scale of the exhibition. I’d always been curious to learn more about Chihuly, after being introduced to his incredible sculpture suspended over the V&A Museum information desk, a glowing confection of green and white glass whisps. In 1968, after receiving a Fulbright Fellowship, he went to work at the Venini glass factory in Venice, observing the team approach to blowing glass, which is critical to the way he works today. In 1971, Chihuly cofounded Pilchuck Glass School in Washington State. With this international glass center, Chihuly has led the avant-garde in the development of glass as a fine art. His work is included in more than 200 museum collections worldwide. He has been the recipient of many awards, including twelve honorary doctorates and two fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts. He has also lost an eye to his passion, and now mostly directs the sculpture design and assembly. It was truly amazing. In 1999, Chihuly started an ambitious exhibition, Chihuly in the Light of Jerusalem; where more than 1 million visitors attended the Tower of David Museum to view his installations. In 2001, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London curated the exhibition Chihuly at the V&A.

From 1976 onward he was also the country's official head of state as chairman of the State Council following Willi Stoph's relinquishment of the post. Honecker's political career began in the 1930s when he became an official of the Communist Party of Germany, a position for which he was imprisoned during the Nazi era. Following World War II, he was freed and soon relaunched his political activities, founding the youth organisation the Free German Youth in 1946 and serving as the group's chairman until 1955. Honecker was married three times. After being liberated from prison in 1945 he married the prison warden Charlotte Schanuel (nee Drost), nine years his senior, on 23 December 1946. She died suddenly from a brain tumour in June 1947. Details of this marriage were not revealed until 2003, well after his death. By the time of her death, Honecker was already romantically involved with the Free German Youth official Edith Baumann, whom he met on a trip to Moscow. With her he had a daughter, Erika (b. 1950), who later gave him his granddaughter Anke. Sources differ on whether Honecker and Baumann married in 1947 or 1949, but in 1952 he fathered an illegitimate daughter, Sonja (b. December 1952), with Margot Feist, a People's Chamber member and chairperson of the Ernst Thalmann Pioneer Organisation. In September 1950, Baumann wrote directly to Walter Ulbricht to inform him of her husband's extramarital activity in the hope of him pressuring Honecker to end his relationship with Feist. Following his divorce and reportedly under pressure from the Politburo, he married Feist, however sources again differ on both the year of his divorce from Baumann and of his marriage to Feist; depending on the source, the events took place either in 1953 or 1955. For more than twenty years, Margot Honecker served as Minister of National Education. In 2012 intelligence reports collated by West German spies alleged that both Erich and his wife had secret affairs but did not divorce for political reasons, however, his bodyguard Bernd Bruckner in a book about his time spent in Honecker's service, refuted the claims. Honecker had three grandchildren from his daughter Sonja, who had married the Chilean-born exile Leonardo Yanez Betancourt; Roberto, (b. 1974) Mariana, (b. 1985) who died in 1988 at the age of two leaving Honecker himself heartbroken, and Vivian (b. 1988). Roberto's origins are debated; he is claimed to be the illegally adopted son of Mrs. Heidi Stein, Dirk Schiller, born on 13 June 1975 in Gorlitz, who disappeared in March 1979, due to alleged physical similarities between Dirk and Leonardo Mrs Stein suspecting that her son might have been kidnapped at 3 years old by Stasi agents for Honecker's younger daughter. Honecker's daughter, (who divorced Leonardo in 1993) grandson and granddaughter still live in Santiago. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Who was his 3rd wife?","response":"Erich Honecker's third wife was Margot Feist.

It seems to happen unconsciously , before my censor can catch it and stop myself ( it even happens when I am in a quiet or inappropriate place ) . It 's not especially loud , in fact it 's often under my breath . Question Why was the narrator relieved ? Answer:","response":"The narrator was relieved because they found out through the AskMe question and the resulting thread that they are not alone in experiencing this strange, fairly innocuous quirk. The realization that other individuals also have similar experiences or behaviors helps lessen their concern and makes them feel better about themselves. Firstly, discovering that other people share the same quirk can be comforting and validating, as it can make one feel more \\"normal\\" and less isolated. Realizing that this behavior is not unique to them, the narrator may recognize that it is more common than they initially thought and that it might not be indicative of a significant issue or disorder. Knowing that others are going through the same thing can provide a sense of reassurance and camaraderie which can alleviate any self-doubt or anxiety related to the quirk. Secondly, the thread may have provided the narrator with valuable insights, explanations, or coping strategies that they were not previously aware of. By engaging with others who have the same experience, they could learn more about the reasons behind their behavior and how to manage it better. This newfound knowledge might help them feel more in control and empowered to deal with their quirk, further contributing to their relief. Moreover, in the context of the larger online community, the narrator's identification with others in a similar situation could potentially establish a support network where they could share experiences, offer advice, and provide understanding and encouragement to one another. This sense of community can be crucial in helping individuals navigate their quirks or issues and develop a healthier sense of self-acceptance. Finally, it is important to note that mental health and psychological well-being are complex and multidimensional. The narrator's initial self-assessment as a mentally healthy, well-adjusted, and sane individual highlights that despite this particular quirk, they can still lead a fulfilling life and function effectively in society. The relief they feel upon discovering the thread likely stems from an enhanced understanding of their unique behavior within the broader context of mental health, as well as the realization that such quirks do not necessarily define or limit their capabilities and emotional well-being. In conclusion, the narrator's relief comes from discovering that they are not alone in their experience, understanding that their behavior does not necessarily reflect a severe problem, gathering information and strategies to cope with their quirk, and ultimately, feeling more connected to others who share similar experiences. This validation, connection, and reassurance contribute to their overall mental well-being and sense of self-acceptance."},{"question":"Instructions: You will be given a text in Russian language which contain different emotion labels from the list - ['joy', ' sadness', 'surprise', 'fear', 'anger'].

Although they can reach up to six feet in length and weigh around 180 pounds, when on land and in plain sight harbor seals may not be easy to spot. Their spotted brown or tan fur allows harbor seals to blend in with sand and rocks. Unlike their very vocal relatives -- sea lions and elephant seals -- harbor seals are quiet creatures that make little noise. They like to hang out on beaches, sand bars and rocks during low tide to bask in the sun and sleep, but they never go far from the water. At the slightest sign of danger, they will quickly slip back under the waves. These expert swimmers have been known to plunge to depths of more than 1,600 feet and stay underwater up to 28 minutes. Manatees, also known as sea cows, are gentle herbivores that live in marshy areas in tropical and subtropical waters. The average adult manatee can weigh up 1,200 pounds and is around 10 feet long. Because of their slow metabolism, these animals can only survive in warm waters. Due to the unusually long, cold winter this year in part of the southeastern United States, populations of manatees throughout Florida were devastated. During the day, manatees usually like to stay close to the surface. At night, manatees will often sleep about three to 10 feet below sea level. This is why these gentle animals are so often accidentally injured, maimed or killed by passing boats. Immediately recognizable by its long tusks and whiskers, the sea walrus is a hefty, flippered member of the Odobenidae family and is, in fact, the last living member of this group. Since both the males and females have big tusks and not much for teeth, the animals feed by sucking up shellfish from the ocean floor. So, just what are those tusks for? The longer they are (they grow to be up to four feet long in males), the higher an animal is ranked in the group. Males attack each other with their tusks to establish dominance. The ivory appendages are also handy for poking holes in the winter ice and for helping the animals pull themselves out of the water. This member of the weasel family is also the smallest marine mammal, with females weighing about 60 pounds and males weighing up to 90 pounds. They may be small, but they're also clever. They're the only marine mammals known to use tools. They use stones to break open clams and store food they gather in the folds of their armpits! Another feature that sets them apart is their lack of blubber. These marine mammals depend mostly on their fur to stay warm. That feature makes them particularly vulnerable to oil spills, which can compromise their fur's insulating effect. While polar bears live mostly on land or ice, they are excellent swimmers and have been known to swim up to 45 miles a day. The massive animals, weighing up to 1,500 pounds, hunt mostly seals. In recent years, biologists have observed that the bears are swimming now more than ever as melting stretches the distances between Arctic ice flows. Because they depend on sea ice to hunt seals, the polar bear is considered threatened as global warming melts and thins ice in this region. What makes them \\"marine\\" depends on the animal. They either live mostly in the sea or, like polar bears, depend on the ocean for food. The largest in the group are whales -- including humpback whales. These massive animals reach up to 50 feet in length and weigh up to 79,000 pounds. To maintain their weight, the animals feed on tons of krill and fish. They neared extinction due to whaling, but have recovered somewhat since a 1966 moratorium on whaling was introduced. Originally designed to live on land, marine mammals are a diverse, charismatic group of animals that include more than 120 species. The animals share key characteristics of land mammals. They have hair, breathe air, give birth to live young, which feed off mother's milk when young. They have warm bodies and usually thick blubber to keep their body temperatures high. The bottlenose dolphin is probably the most widely recognized marine mammal, easily spotted just offshore from beaches around the world. Small groups of 20 or less can live in close proximity to shorelines, but groups living more offshore can reach several hundred. Bottlenose dolphin calves stay with their mothers for up to six years, learning how to hunt and become good dolphin citizens. Full-grown dolphins reach eight to 12 feet in length and can weigh up to 1,430 pounds. The bottlenose dolphin is protected in U.S. waters. Original CymaScope image of how a dolphin saw a submerged man (left) and the computer enhanced version of the same image (right). In a scientific first, researchers have just reproduced what a dolphin saw as it encountered a male diver. This “what the dolphin saw” image of the submerged man reveals that dolphin echolocation results in fairly detailed images. What’s more, it’s now thought that dolphins may share such images with each other as part of a previously unknown marine mammal language. Creatures that Live on Dolphins and Whales: Photos Research team leader Jack Kassewitz of SpeakDolphin.com said in a press release that “our recent success has left us all speechless. We now think it is safe to speculate that dolphins may employ a ‘sono-pictorial’ form of language, a language of pictures that they share with each other. If that proves to be true an exciting future lies ahead for inter species communications.” For the research, which took place at the Dolphin Discovery Center in Puerto Aventuras, Mexico, Kassewitz had colleague Jim McDonough submerge himself in front of the female dolphin “Amaya” in a research pool at the center. To avoid bubbles from a breathing apparatus (which might have hurt the later recreation of the image), McDonough wore a weight belt and exhaled most of the air in his lungs to overcome his natural buoyancy before positioning himself against a shelf in the pool. As Amaya directed her echolocation beam to McDonough, high specification audio equipment was used to record the signal. Team members Alex Green and Toni Saul handled that part of the project. Photos: Mammals of the Sea Green and Saul then sent the recording to the CymaScope laboratory in the U.K., where yet another colleague, acoustic physics research John Stuart Reid, imprinted the signal onto a water membrane and then computer enhanced the resulting image. “The ability of the CymaScope to capture what-the-dolphin-saw images relates to the quasi-holographic properties of sound and its relationship with water, which will be described in a forthcoming science paper on this subject,” Reid explained. His fellow teammates thought they had captured an echolocation image of McDonough’s face, so that was what Reid was expecting to see. Instead, as he told Kassewitz in a note at the time, the signal translated to “what appears to be the fuzzy silhouette of almost a full man. No face.” Dolphins Name Themselves As it turns out, Amaya had been echolocating on McDonough from several feet away before she came in closer, so the researchers captured one of those farther away signals. Kassewitz said, “Having demonstrated that the CymaScope can capture what-the-dolphin-saw images, our research infers that dolphins can at least see the full silhouette of an object with their echolocation sound sense, but the fact that we can just make out the weight belt worn by Jim in our what-the-dolphin-saw image suggests that dolphins can see surface features too.” It could be that dolphin echolocation signals result in much clearer, more detailed mental images, and that it’s our technology that isn’t yet fully attuned to what the marine mammals are precisely seeing. As Kassewitz said, “The dolphin has had around fifty million years to evolve its echolocation sense, whereas marine biologists have studied the physiology of cetaceans for only around five decades, and I have worked with John Stuart Reid for barely five years.” ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","response":"Researchers from the Speak Dolphin research organization have captured an image that shows how dolphins perceive the world around them using echolocation. The process involved replicating the reflected pulses of sound as dolphins scan objects with their high-frequency sound beam. The image produced a 2D representation of a dolphin's view of a trainer nearby in a tank. Researchers suggest that these sound-based images might be intelligible to other dolphins, possibly indicating a \\"sono-pictorial language.\\" Work is ongoing to study this possibility."},{"question":"Having reaped the benefits of 18 months of uncertainty over the make up of the enterprise applications market as a result of the Oracle/PeopleSoft merger battle, SAP AG maintains it has no worries even though the two have now agreed to merge.

Answer:","response":"Neither Greg nor Frank explicitly focused on learning about unfavorable heritable traits becoming less common, as the paragraph does not directly mention this topic. However, Greg, who read about natural selection, is likely to have encountered information about unfavorable traits since natural selection generally leads to the reduction of such traits in populations over time. On the other hand, Frank decided to read about populations where natural selection occurs more sparingly, so his reading material might not have been as focused on the reduction of unfavorable traits due to the limited impact of natural selection in those populations.

Translate to English English:","response":"Mrs. Ivy recently met with state representative Frank Weddig, a Democrat from Aurora, who last year introduced a resolution condemning the treatment of Falun Gong practitioners by the Chinese government. In this meeting, Mrs. Ivy and Frank Weddig discussed the human rights situation of the Falun Gong practitioners in China and the ongoing persecution they face at the hands of the Chinese authorities. The conversation between the two officials aimed at raising awareness and finding potential ways to support and address these issues at the international level. The Chinese government has been accused of harsh treatment of Falun Gong practitioners over the last few decades, including a range of human rights abuses, such as forced labor, torture, organ harvesting, and even extrajudicial killings. These practitioners are targeted because of their involvement in Falun Gong, a spiritual practice that has gained a large following in China and several other countries. The Chinese government views it as a potential threat to its power and social stability, leading to a severe crackdown on these practitioners. The resolution introduced by Frank Weddig is a significant move in the fight against human rights violations in China, as it publicly condemns the treatment experienced by Falun Gong practitioners. This type of resolution not only contributes to increased awareness on the issue but could also serve as a precursor to more targeted policies and sanctions that might be enacted to pressure the Chinese government to change its approach. Furthermore, the meeting between Mrs. Ivy and Frank Weddig could foster future collaboration and further debate on this issue. By bringing together officials from different backgrounds and political affiliations, a stronger and more unified approach can be built, allowing for the possibility of enacting meaningful legislation and generating international pressure against China's policies. It is important to continue raising awareness about the plight of Falun Gong practitioners in China, urging international organizations, governments, and civil society groups to collaborate in putting an end to this ongoing persecution. Through collective action, pressure, and diplomacy, the global community may be able to influence China's policies and ultimately improve the human rights situation for Falun Gong practitioners and other oppressed groups."},{"question":"It takes Derek 9 minutes to walk a mile if he doesn't have to walk with his brother. If he has to take his brother it takes 12 minutes to walk a mile. How many minutes longer would it take him to walk 20 miles if he had to take his brother? Give me reasons, before answering the question","response":"Let's break down the problem and compute the difference in time it would take Derek to walk 20 miles alone and with his brother. When Derek walks alone: - He takes 9 minutes to walk 1 mile - To walk 20 miles, he takes 9 minutes x 20 miles = 180 minutes When Derek walks with his brother: - It takes 12 minutes to walk 1 mile - To walk 20 miles, he takes 12 minutes x 20 miles = 240 minutes Now, let's find out the difference in time when Derek has to take his brother along. Difference in time = Time with his brother - Time alone Difference in time = 240 minutes - 180 minutes Difference in time = 60 minutes So, it would take Derek an additional 60 minutes (1 hour) to walk 20 miles if he had to take his brother compared to when he walks alone. The primary reason for this difference is the increased time it takes to walk a mile with his brother (12 minutes) compared to the time it takes when walking alone (9 minutes), which implies that his brother's walking pace is slower."},{"question":"our farm is ideal for those seeking relaxation, rest and needy nature-loving people to recommend as the best destination.

The","response":"teal sofa provides not only a fresh and vibrant feel to the room, but also adds a touch of elegance and modern style. Additionally, the color teal is known for its soothing and calming effects, making it a perfect choice for creating a relaxing atmosphere in a living space. The old brown sofa, on the other hand, had served its purpose well, housing countless conversations and family movie nights over the years. However, time had taken its toll on the once-comfortable piece of furniture, leaving it with worn and stained upholstery and a sagging frame. The brown color, while timeless, had started to show signs of fading, giving it a rather dull and lackluster appearance. In comparison to the bright and inviting teal sofa, the old brown one simply couldn't compete, as it felt outdated and less appealing. Furthermore, the design of the teal sofa lends itself to a more contemporary aesthetic, with its clean lines and minimalist approach. The sleek and streamlined profile of the sofa allows for easy incorporation into a variety of interior design styles, whether it be mid-century modern, Scandinavian, or even industrial chic. This versatility makes it easy to keep the space feeling updated and on-trend, allowing for seamless transitions between different decorating styles if desired. Additionally, the quality of the teal sofa seems to far surpass that of the old brown one. From the durable and stain-resistant fabric to the sturdy and well-constructed frame, it is evident that this piece was designed with longevity in mind. With proper care and maintenance, the teal sofa is sure to remain a staple in the living room for years to come, providing comfort and style to all those who encounter it. Another benefit of the teal sofa is the opportunity it presents for incorporating complementary or contrasting colors into the room's design. The rich teal hue pairs beautifully with neutral tones such as gray, beige, and white, while also opening the door for bolder accent colors like mustard yellow, fuchsia, or burnt orange. This allows for a dynamic and visually interesting space, where the teal sofa serves as the focal point and anchor for the room's color palette. Moreover, the teal sofa's overall size and shape make it a more practical option for the living space compared to the old brown sofa. With its compact dimensions and space-saving design, the teal sofa effectively maximizes seating capacity without overcrowding or overwhelming the room. This leaves ample space for additional seating options, storage solutions, or decorative elements, resulting in a well-balanced and harmonious environment. In conclusion, the teal sofa offers a multitude of advantages over the old brown sofa, making it the clear and superior choice for the living room. From its sleek design and vibrant color to its superb quality and versatility, the teal sofa enhances the room's aesthetic and functionality while providing a comfortable and welcoming place to unwind and socialize. Embracing the refreshing change, the teal sofa ushers in a new era of sophisticated style and timeless comfort for the home."},{"question":"Test for natural language inference.

It is considered one of the \`\` masterpieces of Menzel 's maturity '' , and the artist deemed it his best painting . The painting depicts a red colored wall of the artist 's studio at night , upon which are hung a series of plaster casts illuminated from below . The casts include portrait busts , death masks and life masks of friends of the artist , children , classical personae such as Dante , Schiller , and possibly Goethe or Wagner , a dog , and male and female torsos ; art historian Werner Hofmann saw this assemblage as a conscious blurring of \`\` the dividing line between fame and anonymity . '' Numerous commentators have noted that the array of dramatically lit casts \`\` convey an uncanny impression of quasi-animateness . '' Studio Wall was preceded by a work of the same title painted in 1852 , an oil on paper now in the Alte Nationalgalerie in Berlin . That painting features casts of two arms and a separate hand , the arms arranged so as to suggest a relationship to a body from which they have been removed . Studio Wall is also seen as related to Menzel 's larger painting Iron Rolling Mill ( 1872 -- 1875 ) , for which it may have served as a study in dramatic lighting , yet it has greater import than that of a merely preparatory exercise , and may have functioned as a kind of memorial : the central death mask is that of the artist 's friend Friedrich Eggers , the first critic sympathetic to Menzel 's work . Eggers died in August 1872 , and the painting is dated from October of that year . A contemplation on the transience of life , Studio Wall is also a bravura piece of alla prima painting . Interpretations of the work vary greatly . For art historian Julius Meier - Graefe , Studio Wall was a harmonious example of pictorial unity ; to the contrary , Hofmann saw the painting as a \`\` coded manifesto '' , a rejection by Menzel of academic canons in favor of an aesthetic that... - Oil painting is the process of painting with pigments with a medium of drying oil as the binder. Commonly used drying oils include linseed oil, poppy seed oil, walnut oil, and safflower oil. The choice of oil imparts a range of properties to the oil paint, such as the amount of yellowing or drying time. Certain differences, depending on the oil, are also visible in the sheen of the paints. An artist might use several different oils in the same painting depending on specific pigments and effects desired. The paints themselves also develop a particular consistency depending on the medium. The oil may be boiled with a resin, such as pine resin or frankincense, to create a varnish prized for its body and gloss. - Adolph Friedrich Erdmann von Menzel (December 8, 1815February 9, 1905) was a German Realist artist noted for drawings, etchings, and paintings. Along with Caspar David Friedrich, he is considered one of the two most prominent German artists of the 19th century, and was the most successful artist of his era in Germany. First known as Adolph Menzel, he was knighted in 1898 and changed his name to Adolph von Menzel. - Oil paint is a type of slow-drying paint that consists of particles of pigment suspended in a drying oil, commonly linseed oil. The viscosity of the paint may be modified by the addition of a solvent such as turpentine or white spirit, and varnish may be added to increase the glossiness of the dried oil paint film. Oil paints have been used in Europe since the 12th century for simple decoration, but were not widely adopted as an artistic medium until the early 15th century. Common modern applications of oil paint are in finishing and protection of wood in buildings and exposed metal structures such as ships and bridges. Its hard-wearing properties and luminous colors make it desirable for both interior and exterior use on wood and metal. Due to its slow-drying properties, it has recently been used in paint-on-glass animation. Thickness of coat has considerable bearing on time required for drying: thin coats of oil paint dry relatively quickly.

The premise seemed silly and I assumed it would be a lot of shallow make-fun-of-the-virgin humor. What a great surprise. I laughed so hard I cried at some of the jokes. This film is a must see for anyone with an open mind and a slightly twisted sense of humor. OK.....this is not a movie to go to with your grandmother (Jack Palance?) or small children. The language is filthy, the jokes are (very) crude, and the sex talk is about as graphic as you'll find anywhere. What's amazing, however, is that the movie is still a sweet love story. My girlfriend and I both loved it. Steve Carell is terrific, but (like The Office) the supporting cast really makes the film work. All of the characters have their flaws, but they also have depth and likability. Everyone pulls their weight and the chemistry is perfect. I can't wait to get the DVD. I'm sure it will be up there with Office Space for replays and quotable lines. Did this review think positively or negatively of the movie (see options below)? Possible answers: 1). negative. 2). positive....I think the answer is","response":"2). positive."},{"question":"Translate \\"Nevertheless, we cannot ignore the magnitude of the differences of opinion that still exist.\\" to French?","response":"To translate the given sentence \\"Nevertheless, we cannot ignore the magnitude of the differences of opinion that still exist.\\" to French, I will take the following steps: 1.
