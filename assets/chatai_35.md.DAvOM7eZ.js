Pentagon officials acknowledged originally providing inaccurate figures to SIGAR because of a failure \\"to account for the transfer of most of the Afghan Border Force from the Afghan National Police to the Afghan National Army,\\" according to a SIGAR statement. According to the new figures, there were 313,728 members of the Afghan defense forces as of January 31, 2018. That compares to a total of 296,409, as previously reported. \\"SIGAR receives all of the (Afghan National Defense and Security Forces) personnel strength numbers published in the quarterly report from USFOR-A and has no means of independently verifying them,\\" the statement added. The new figures still amount to a sharp decline. Afghan forces suffered unprecedented casualties in 2017, reportedly losing about 10,000 personnel, according to reports. SIGAR has been unable to publicly disclose the exact number of Afghan forces killed, because that information continues to be classified by Washington and Kabul. The violence has led to increased reports of Afghan military desertions, but that information too has been classified. Senior U.S. military officials repeatedly have acknowledged the nearly 17-year-old conflict remains a stalemate, even while touting some successes under the new strategy announced by President Donald Trump in August. Those success include the increasing capability of the Afghan military, which began conducting airstrikes two years ago. The Afghan air force carries out between four to 12 airstrikes every day, according to the Afghan Ministry of Defense. But the Kabul government controls just over half of the country's districts, SIGAR says. Trump's strategy appeared to commit the U.S. to Afghanistan indefinitely. It involves pressuring Pakistan to end its support for Afghan militants, supporting Kabul's effort to engage the Taliban in peace talks, and dropping more bombs on the country. The U.S.-led... According to the above context, answer the following question. After the Pentagon released the corrected figures on the decline in forces, SIGAR officials probably felt that: Answer:","response":"After the Pentagon released the corrected figures on the decline in forces, SIGAR officials probably felt concerned, acknowledging that they had originally received inaccurate data. They might have also felt a sense of urgency to update their information and future reports as they rely on the U.S. military for these figures and do not have independent means to verify them. They likely appreciated the clarification provided by the Pentagon but might have been apprehensive about the implications of the decline in Afghan defense forces. With a sharper decline than initially reported, SIGAR officials would be even more alarmed about the state of Afghanistan's security situation, the unprecedented casualties in 2017, and the ongoing reports of military desertions. The fact that certain information, such as the exact number of Afghan forces killed and desertions, remains classified by Washington and Kabul could also contribute to a sense of uncertainty and frustration for SIGAR officials as they attempt to accurately assess and report on the situation in Afghanistan. Furthermore, SIGAR officials would still recognize the considerable challenges faced in the conflict that remains in a stalemate. While there have been reported successes under President Trump's new strategy, such as the increasing capability of the Afghan military, the Kabul government only controls just over half of the country's districts. This precarious situation would be a source of concern for SIGAR, especially given the updated and more dramatic decline in Afghan defense forces."},{"question":"Given the below context: In 1987 in Oklahoma, Danielle Edmondston is a troubled and promiscuous high school student.

He says grandfather sent to NY from Belarus in 1907 at 9. His parents feared growing violence. Chaim was penniless, scrappy, made his way on his own; married, had kids, was patriotic. Kasinitz: Chaim was a loyal, industrious citizen. Have border protesters forgotten their roots? Article:","response":"Title: America's Border Crisis: Are We Forgetting Our Roots? Introduction The current crisis at the American border has highlighted the complicated issue involving children arriving from different countries, often unaccompanied by adults. The situation has brought many discussions about the humanitarian treatment, the right policy to address it, and the responsibility of fellow Americans in showing concern towards these innocent lives. Philip Kasinitz, a professor of sociology, expresses his dismay over the uncharitable response demonstrated by some Americans towards the children at the border. Drawing a parallel between his own grandfather's journey to America in the early 20th century and the current crisis, Kasinitz discusses the forgotten roots of many American families and the values that have shaped the very core of American society. Children at the Border: A Complicated Problem The situation involving unaccompanied children arriving at the US border is undoubtedly complex, as multiple factors contribute to its nature. These factors include socio-economic and political instability in their home countries, the inherent danger for minors embarking on a hazardous journey alone, and the difficulty in providing for their well-being while under the supervision of US authorities. As such, a comprehensive and empathetic response must be derived that balances the need to preserve American national security and border integrity while acknowledging the humanitarian aspect of the issue. Philip Kasinitz's American Heritage Kasinitz reflects on his grandfather's journey to America – a tale shared by countless American families. His grandfather, Chaim, was sent to New York from Belarus in 1907 when he was just nine years old. His parents, fearing the growing violence surrounding them, risked everything and had faith that the young boy would have a chance to start anew in the land of opportunity, the United States of America. Despite his circumstances, Chaim was a scrappy, penniless child who determinedly made his way through the challenging new environment. Over time, he settled in this new land, married, and started a family. Like generations of immigrants before and after him, Chaim became a patriotic, loyal, and industrious citizen. He fully embraced and contributed to the nation's ethos, helping shape the multicultural fabric of America. Have Border Protesters Forgotten Their Roots? With the crisis unfolding at the border, some Americans have expressed their disapproval and opposition towards the incoming children, often neglecting the nature of American society as a melting pot of immigrants. These protesters, Kasinitz suggests, may have forgotten their roots. Echoing the sentiment Ellis Island represents to millions, America has historically been a haven for those seeking safety, stability, and the promise of a better life. The hardships faced by Chaim and countless others who made the arduous journey to America, physically and emotionally, are reminiscent of the experiences of children at the border today. Their resilience and determination in overcoming adversity are values ingrained deep in the American narrative. Conclusion Philip Kasinitz's family history and the uncharitable sentiment against the children at the border serve as a powerful reminder of the rich and diverse heritage that defines America. As the border crisis continues, we need to find a solution that acknowledges the humanitarian aspect of the situation while being in line with the values that have shaped the nation. As Americans, we must strive to remember our roots and recognize the similarities between these children and our forefathers who established the nation. In doing so, we may draw inspiration to engage in collective action that addresses the crisis, incorporating empathy, understanding, and a just approach."},{"question":"Q: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what filters blood?\\" is \\"capillaries\\", given that nephrons filter blood? The answer is:","response":"No, the right answer to the question \\"what filters blood?\\" is not \\"capillaries.\\" While capillaries are indeed involved in the overall process of blood circulation and nutrient exchange, they do not play a direct role in filtering the blood. The correct answer to the question would be \\"nephron,\\" as it is the primary structural and functional unit of the kidney responsible for filtering blood. Nephrons are made up of several key components that contribute to the process of blood filtration, like the glomerulus, proximal tubule, loop of Henle, distal tubule, and the collecting duct. The process of filtering blood occurs in the following steps: 1. Blood enters the kidney through the renal artery, which divides into smaller arterioles and then into the microscopic glomerular capillaries. 2. The glomerulus is a specialized capillary network that filters the blood. It is made up of unique fenestrated endothelial cells that have small pores, which allow for the filtration of plasma (consisting of water, ions, waste substances, and various small solutes) into a structure called Bowman's capsule. This filtration process is highly selective and does not allow larger blood components, such as blood cells and proteins, to pass through. 3. The filtered fluid, now called the glomerular filtrate, moves into the proximal convoluted tubule. This is where the majority of reabsorption happens, and essential molecules (like glucose, amino acids, and ions) are returned to the bloodstream via tubular cells and peritubular capillaries. 4. The filtrate then continues its journey through the loop of Henle, which has two limbs: ascending and descending. In this part of the nephron, a counter-current multiplier system is established, which assists in the concentration of urine and the absorption of ions and water. 5. The filtrate reaches the distal convoluted tubule, where further selective reabsorption and secretion of ions take place. This step is regulated by the hormone aldosterone and helps in maintaining electrolyte balance and blood pressure. 6. Finally, the remaining filtrate enters the collecting ducts, where the fine-tuning of water reabsorption occurs under the influence of the hormone vasopressin (also known as antidiuretic hormone or ADH). The final concentration of the urine is adjusted in the collecting duct system, and then the urine is excreted through the renal pelvis, ureter, and bladder. In conclusion, although capillaries play an essential part in the overall process of blood circulation and the transport of nutrients, they do not filter the blood directly. Nephrons, specifically the glomerulus within the nephron, are the structures responsible for blood filtration in the kidneys."},{"question":"Please add punctuation to this: 2008 European Year of Intercultural Dialogue","response":"2008, European Year of Intercultural Dialogue."},{"question":"The next morning I called up my friend, Nick Unger, who worked for the police department.

And the answer is?","response":"The answer is Belgium. Duffel coats derive their name from the town of Duffel, which is located in the province of Antwerp, Belgium. A duffel coat, also known as a duffle coat, is a type of heavy coat characterized by its thick, woolen fabric, hood, and distinctive toggle fastenings. The name \\"duffel\\" comes from the town where the durable material used for these coats was originally produced. Duffel, the town, has a long history of textile production, particularly for the sturdy, dense fabric that is used to make duffel bags, blankets, and, of course, duffel coats. Historically, the duffel fabric originated from Belgium with roots dating back to the 15th century. The fabric became increasingly popular over the years due to its durability and insulation properties. Duffel coats rose in popularity during World War I and World War II, primarily as the British Royal Navy issued these coats to officers for both protection and warmth during harsh weather conditions at sea. Featuring oversized hoods to accommodate naval officers' caps, duffel coats gained their reputation for practicality and functionality during these times. Another significant reason for the duffel coat's widespread usage during the World Wars was its ability to withstand wear and tear, intensive use, and adverse weather conditions. The toggle fastenings, or \\"walrus teeth,\\" made from wood or bone, served as easy-to-fasten closures that proved highly efficient, even with gloves on. These unique fastenings became an iconic feature of duffle coats. As the years progressed, duffel coats made their way from military attire to mainstream fashion. Various designers and brands included their own interpretations of the duffel coat into seasonal collections, making it a versatile and fashionable wardrobe staple. Today, duffel coats can be found in various colors, styles, and materials, all while retaining their original, practical elements derived from the town of Duffel in Belgium."},{"question":"Given a sentence, generate a new sentence by performing small changes on the sentence.

The capital, and largest city, is Baghdad. The main ethnic groups are Arabs and Kurds; others include Assyrians, Turkmen, Shabakis, Yazidis, Armenians, Mandeans, Circassians, and Kawliya. Around 95% of the country's 36 million citizens are Muslims, with Christianity, Yarsan, Yezidism, and Mandeanism also present. The official languages of Iraq are Arabic and Kurdish. - Prince Zeid bin Hussein , GCVO , GBE ( Arabic : ; February 28 , 1898 -- October 18 , 1970 ) was an Iraqi prince who was a member of the Hashemite dynasty and the head of the Royal House of Iraq from 1958 until his death . - The Yazidis (also Yezidis, \\"Êzidî\\") are an ethnically Kurdish religious community or an ethno-religious group indigenous to northern Mesopotamia (see also Ezidkhan) who are strictly endogamous. Their religion, \\"Yazidism\\" is linked to ancient Mesopotamian religions and combines aspects of Zoroastrianism, Islam, Christianity and Judaism. Yazidis who marry non-Yazidis are automatically considered to be converted to the religion of their spouse and therefore are not permitted to call themselves Yazidis. They live primarily in the Nineveh Province of Iraq. Additional communities in Armenia, Georgia, Turkey, Iran, and Syria have been in decline since the 1990s as a result of significant migration to Europe, especially to Germany. The Yazidis' cultural practices are observably Kurdish, and almost all speak Kurmanji (Northern Kurdish). The Soviet Union considered the Yazidis to be Kurds, as does Sharaf Khan Bidlisi's \\"Sheref-nameh\\" of 1597, which cites seven of the Kurdish tribes as being at least partly Yazidi, and Kurdish tribal confederations as containing substantial Yazidi sections. - A Christian (or ) is a person who follows or adheres to Christianity, an Abrahamic, monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. \\"Christian\\" derives from the Koine Greek word \\"Christós\\" (), a translation of the Biblical Hebrew term \\"mashiach\\". - Christianity is a monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, who serves as the focal point for the religion.

The features describe aspects of articulation and perception, are from a universally fixed set, and have the binary values + or −. There are at least two levels of representation: underlying representation and surface phonetic representation. Ordered phonological rules govern how underlying representation is transformed into the actual pronunciation (the so-called surface form).

She and a coworker couldn’t see eye-to-eye on a project. Should they ask the client to postpone the deadline in order to complete testing or should they deliver a product that wasn’t quite there? “By the time 10 emails had been sent, I was seriously beyond frustrated. We weren’t getting any closer to resolving the situation. I had to do something.” For Cutrone, that “something” was cc’ing their direct supervisor. “It really felt like the right thing to do. The way I saw it, he would see what was happening, step in and make the decision we were unable to make. End of argument.” Wrong. Unfortunately, Cutrone’s “cc’ing up” was a bad career move. Her coworker was furious and her supervisor was not just let in on a revealing email chain, but saw Cutrone’s decision to do so as both self-serving and immature. Shortly after, Cutrone left the company, embarrassed, she says, but much wiser. A decision she made with the best intentions had been perceived as the worst. Instead of efficient, she was seen as undermining. Instead of gracious, petty. According to experts, she’s not alone. Email makes up the majority of our daily communication—especially in business. According to the Pew Research Center, the majority of employed adults (62%) use the internet or email in the workplace. And yet social cues and etiquette are often overlooked. The problem, it seems, is that communication through email can bring out the worst of competitive or controlling behavior. “It’s a very weird dynamic that has happened,” says Cherie Kerr, the founder of ExecuProv, an executive coaching seminar series that borrows from improvisational comedy and the author of The Bliss or “Diss” Connection: Email Etiquette for the Business Professional. “People do or say things via email that they would never do in person. They’d never upstage a higher up in a meeting, but in email there’s this disconnected feeling of not having to look anyone in the eye that emboldens people to act in competitive or even arrogant ways.” “Emily Post was not around when email began,” agrees Marsha Egan, author of the book Inbox Detox and the Habit of Email Excellence. “So people have to make up their own rules. What one person might see as absolutely fine, another might find offensive. That being said, the basis of all etiquette is respect.” Respect, she says, is what Cutrone was lacking in her decision to invite her boss into her disagreement with her coworker. Here, Egan and Kerr take on Cutrone’s misstep and other serious email faux pas—to explain how even the best intentions can be misread—and what the better tack to take might be.

This law states that deeper rock layers are older than layers closer to the surface. Answer the question: Rocks that are buried deep underground are newer or older than rocks on the surface? Answer:","response":"According to the law of superposition, rocks that are buried deep underground are generally older than rocks found closer to the surface. This principle is based on the observation that, in undisturbed layers of rock, the deeper layers must have been deposited first, and thus, they are older. Over time, new layers of sediment are deposited on top, making the upper layers younger than the ones below them. However, this law applies to sedimentary rocks and not necessarily to igneous or metamorphic rocks, which form through different processes, such as volcanic eruptions or high-temperature and pressure conditions."},{"question":"Definition: You are given a review about a place.

Similar to puzzle pieces fitting together, the active site can only bind certain substrates. Q: The active site can only bind certain what? Choices: - electrons - membranes - proteins - substrates A: Answer:","response":"The active site can only bind certain substrates. In the given paragraph, it is mentioned that the active site is specific for the reactants of the biochemical reaction the enzyme catalyzes. Active sites are unique pockets or clefts on the surface of enzymes where the biochemical reaction takes place. These sites have a specific shape, size, and functional group arrangement that allows them to recognize and bind only certain molecules, which are known as substrates. Substrates are the reactant molecules that are transformed during the enzyme-catalyzed reaction. When the substrate binds to the active site, it forms an enzyme-substrate complex. This interaction induces changes in the substrate's bonds, eventually leading to the formation of a product. The key principle highlighted in the paragraph is that the shape of the active site is unique and complementary to the shape of the substrate, thus allowing for the \\"lock-and-key\\" or \\"induced fit\\" model of enzyme-substrate binding. This specificity ensures that enzymes can selectively catalyze a single type of reaction, which contributes to the overall regulation and efficiency of biochemical processes within an organism. To summarize, based on the information provided in the paragraph, the active site can only bind certain substrates. This selectivity is what allows enzymes to function with a high degree of specificity and efficiently catalyze the biochemical reactions they are responsible for."},{"question":"What is a question about this article? If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\". Electrolytic capacitors use an aluminum or tantalum plate with an oxide dielectric layer. The second electrode is a liquid electrolyte, connected to the circuit by another foil plate. Electrolytic capacitors offer very high capacitance but suffer from poor tolerances, high instability, gradual loss of capacitance especially when subjected to heat, and high leakage current. Poor quality capacitors may leak electrolyte, which is harmful to printed circuit boards. The conductivity of the electrolyte drops at low temperatures, which increases equivalent series resistance. While widely used for power-supply conditioning, poor high-frequency characteristics make them unsuitable for many applications. Electrolytic capacitors will self-degrade if unused for a period (around a year), and when full power is applied may short circuit, permanently damaging the capacitor and usually blowing a fuse or causing failure of rectifier diodes (for instance, in older equipment, arcing in rectifier tubes). They can be restored before use (and damage) by gradually applying the operating voltage, often done on antique vacuum tube equipment over a period of 30 minutes by using a variable transformer to supply AC power. Unfortunately, the use of this technique may be less satisfactory for some solid state equipment, which may be damaged by operation below its normal power range, requiring that the power supply first be isolated from the consuming circuits. Such remedies may not be applicable to modern high-frequency power supplies as these produce full output voltage even with reduced input. What is one type of metal which the conducting plates in electrolytic capacitors are commonly made of?","response":"One type of metal that the conducting plates in electrolytic capacitors are commonly made of is aluminum."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Build a movie plot around this: where did Monika and her friends have a movie night? at Monika's apartment Answer:","response":"Title: Movie Night Mayhem Genre: Comedy, Drama Plot: Monika, a 28-year-old aspiring film director, lives in a cozy apartment in the heart of a bustling city.

Do these two sentences convey the same information?","response":"The two sentences appear to convey similar information, but there are discrepancies in the details that make them different. In Sentence 1, we understand that Wollstonecraft met someone or a group of people in Sydney (most likely referring to Sydney, Australia) on August 31, 1819, while they were on board a ship called \\"Grenada.\\" This sentence focuses on the meeting that took place in Sydney and highlights the ship's name as \\"Grenada.\\" In Sentence 2, Wollstonecraft is mentioned to have arrived in Grenada, which is a country in the Caribbean, on August 31, 1819, on board a ship named \\"Sydney.\\" The sentence emphasizes Wollstonecraft's arrival in Grenada and tells us that the ship he traveled on was called \\"Sydney.\\" There are two critical distinctions between these sentences: 1. Location: In Sentence 1, the meeting takes place in Sydney, while in Sentence 2, the arrival is in Grenada. Sydney and Grenada are geographically distant locations. 2. Ship Name: The ship's name differs between the two sentences. In Sentence 1, the ship is called \\"Grenada,\\" whereas, in Sentence 2, the ship's name is \\"Sydney.\\" Based on these differences, the two sentences do not convey the same information.

They have left a cholera-stricken wagon train and, alone, arrive in a small dilapidated town. Here, they meet no-good Doc Shabbitt (Matt Clark) and ask for directions. He suggests they stay in a deserted local building, but McKaskel senses danger and they leave. Shabbit decides to steal two of their horses. Con Vallian (Sam Elliott) is chasing a half-breed Indian, the latest recruit to Shabbit's gang who, it transpires, Vallian has tracked for hundreds of miles for personal reasons. Vallian witnesses the homesteader's encounter with Shabbit and turns up at the McKaskel's wagon during supper. He advises them their horses have been stolen. Against Susanna's advice, Duncan rides into town and tries to reclaim the horses. An intense gunfight ensues when Vallian, who has secretly followed him, shoots some of the Shabbit gang. When Doc Shabbitt finds that his son, who was about to shoot McKaskel in the back, has been killed, he vows to pursue the family and seek revenge. Susanna, Duncan, and Tom flee in their covered wagon, trying to keep ahead of their pursuers. Vallian keeps arriving to help protect them from Shabbitt and his gang.

They seem to be able think, understand, and learn things quickly. But they are smart like humans or more like cats or dogs? Dolphins use their brains differently from people. But scientists say dolphin intelligence and human intelligence are alike in some ways. How? FACT 1: Talk to Me Like humans, every dolphin has its own \\"name\\". The name is a special whistle . Each dolphin chooses a specific whistle for itself, usually by its first birthday. Actually, scientists think dolphins, like people, \\"talk\\" to each other about a lot of things, such as their age, their feelings, or finding food. And, like humans dolphins use a system of sounds and body language to communicate. But understanding their conversations is not easy for humans. No one \\"speaks dolphin\\" yet, but some scientists are trying to learn. FACT 2: Let's Play Dolphins are also social animals. They live in groups called pods, and they often join others from different pods to play games and have fun ---just like people. In fact, playing together is something only intelligent animals do. FACT 3: Fishermen's Helpers Dolphins and humans are similar in another way: both make plans to get something they want. In the sea of southern Brazil, for example, dolphins use a interesting strategy to get food. When fish are near a boat, dolphins signal to the fishermen to put their nets in the water. Using this method, the men can catch a lot of fish. What is the advantage for the dolphins? Why do they assist the men? The dolphins get to eat some of the fish. Question: Which of the following best describes dolphins? Yes or no, is the answer \\"Friendly and smart.\\"? A:","response":"Dolphins can indeed be described as friendly and smart, based on the information provided in the article. Their intelligence is showcased in various ways that are similar to humans, making them unique creatures among the animal kingdom. The first fact mentioned in the article highlights that dolphins have their own \\"names,\\" which are special whistles unique to each individual. This demonstrates their ability to think, understand, and communicate with one another, similar to how humans use language. The fact that they are believed to discuss their age, feelings, and even information about finding food reveals their impressive capacity for complex communication and mimics human conversations in some aspects. The second fact emphasizes the social nature of dolphins, as they live in groups called pods and frequently interact with other dolphins from different pods to play games and have fun. Engaging in play is associated with intelligence, and this behavior is something that dolphins have in common with humans. Their social nature makes them friendly creatures that thrive in cooperative environments and even involve themselves in interactions with humans in some situations. The third fact showcases the strategic thinking and collaboration between dolphins and humans in the context of food procurement. In southern Brazil, dolphins indicate to fishermen when and where to drop their nets to capture fish more effectively—and in doing so, they benefit from the catch as well. This cooperation between dolphins and humans demonstrates their intelligence and resourcefulness in developing strategies to achieve their goals. In conclusion, the answer \\"Friendly and smart\\" is an accurate description of dolphins based on the shared characteristics between them and humans – communication, social behavior, strategic thinking, and problem-solving abilities."},{"question":"Come up with a question and reasoning that would justify this answer: no","response":"Question: Is it possible for a person to survive without drinking water at all?

Water helps the body to regulate temperature, remove wastes, transport nutrients, and support the metabolic process. Dehydration leads to various health problems and can be life-threatening if not addressed. Therefore, it is not possible for a person to survive without drinking water at all."},{"question":"Madrasa (Arabic: مدرسة‎, madrasah, pl. مدارس, madāris, Turkish: Medrese) is the Arabic word for any type of educational institution, whether secular or religious (of any religion). The word is variously transliterated madrasah, madarasaa, medresa, madrassa, madraza, medrese, etc. In the West, the word usually refers to a specific type of religious school or college for the study of the Islamic religion, though this may not be the only subject studied. Not all students in madaris are Muslims; there is also a modern curriculum. The word madrasah derives from the triconsonantal Semitic root د-ر-س D-R-S 'to learn, study', through the wazn (form/stem) مفعل(ة)‎; mafʻal(ah), meaning \\"a place where something is done\\". Therefore, madrasah literally means \\"a place where learning and studying take place\\". The word is also present as a loanword with the same innocuous meaning in many Arabic-influenced languages, such as: Urdu, Bengali, Hindi, Persian, Turkish, Azeri, Kurdish, Indonesian, Malay and Bosnian / Croatian. In the Arabic language, the word مدرسة madrasah simply means the same as school does in the English language, whether that is private, public or parochial school, as well as for any primary or secondary school whether Muslim, non-Muslim, or secular. Unlike the use of the word school in British English, the word madrasah more closely resembles the term school in American English, in that it can refer to a university-level or post-graduate school as well as to a primary or secondary school. For example, in the Ottoman Empire during the Early Modern Period, madaris had lower schools and specialised schools where the students became known as danişmends. The usual Arabic word for a university, however, is جامعة (jāmiʻah). The Hebrew cognate midrasha also connotes the meaning of a place of learning; the related term midrash literally refers to study or learning, but has acquired mystical and religious connotations. Now, provide a numbered list of answers to these questions: 1. what is the article mainly about? 2. what does the word literally mean? 3. can it be private school? 4. what language does it come from? 5. are all students in madaris Muslim? 6. is it generally considered a religious school in the west? 7. what levels of school does it cover? 8. what is the Arabic word for University? 9. is modern curriculum offered in madrasa? 10. what are some Arabic languages that are mentioned?","response":"1.

Context: Today, I want to share why I think you should interview real estate agents before hiring one. Why You Should Interview Real Estate Agents Truth be told, I have only purchased one house and I’m in the process of selling it. My husband and I thought long and hard about whether we would try to sell our property on our own or hire someone to represent us. In the end, we chose the latter. If you have ever shared with friends or family that you’re looking for a home or thinking of selling your own, most everyone says something along the lines of, “Oh! I know a realtor I can recommend!” Many of you may know a real estate agent personally as well. I still think it makes sense to interview any prospective agents because they are being paid by you. When you hire someone to do work on your home, you get estimates and gather information about how and when the work will be done. When you are looking for babysitters, you meet them and see how they’ll interact with your child. When you’re an employer, you interview any potential employees. Don’t Take The Easy Route with Previous Agents and Friends Just because a friend is a realtor, doesn’t mean they’ll be the best real estate agent for you. Just because a friend recommends their realtor to you, doesn’t mean you have to hire him/her. It’s business and nobody should take it personally. Interviewing real estate agents just makes sense. Oftentimes, people don’t. Why not just use the realtor that sold you the house you’re currently in? Well, you can. But do you know how that realtor handles business when they are the listing agent versus the buyer’s agent? Do you know if they’ll want to pursue the option to be a dual agent (and double their commission)? Why not interview them while interviewing others? It won’t hurt.

Options: A. they want to buy it B. they tell you not to sell it C. they give you recommendations D. not enough information The answer to this question is:","response":"C. they give you recommendations Justification: The context mentions that, \\"If you have ever shared with friends or family that you’re looking for a home or thinking of selling your own, most everyone says something along the lines of, “Oh!

It only explains collectivism and individualism as contrasting aspects of human nature.

Collectivist societies value the greater good, conformity, and interdependence among the members.

Context: With almost two years left of my law degree, and with no intention of doing anything so idiotic as actually attending lectures or studying law, I had plenty of time to come up with my next bid for online fame. The Griff Rhys Jones TV project had stalled after a couple of meetings when everyone involved realised that the idea - to pipe broadband comedy programming into the nation's workplaces under the noses of bosses - was a bit of a non-starter. But I had become quite good friends with Rhys Jones's partner in the project, a comedy writer called Charlie Skelton, and he, Clare and I frequently met to brainstorm possible projects we might work on together. It was during one of these meetings that Clare proposed the idea of starting a comedy magazine - something like Private Eye, but for the Internet generation. My days as a school magazine publisher had taught me that printing magazines and distributing them was a royal pain in the arse and, anyway, if it was to be a magazine for the Internet generation then shouldn't it actually be on the Internet? The Zingin.com newsletter had attracted a ton of subscribers and had a distribution cost of basically nothing so why, I suggested, didn't we start a weekly comedy ezine, sent out by email? And, in a nod to Charlie's failed office comedy project, we could target it at bored office workers, sending the email to them on a Friday afternoon to cure the crushing boredom of those final few hours of the working week. And with that, The Friday Thing was born. To promote our fledgling publication we came up with a brilliant ruse: an online petition to have Friday afternoons declared a national holiday. British people worked harder than any other Europeans (we made up) and so it was only fair that our working week should end at noon on a Friday. We created an official website explaining our demands, registered a web address - letsgetitoff.com (snigger) - and sent a press release to the media.

But good luck telling that to President Donald Trump or a dozen or so Democrats contemplating a White House bid two years from now. Trump has already been out on the campaign trail testing themes for his expected re-election bid. \\"Our new slogan for 2020. Do you know what it is?

But Trump also made it clear he is concerned about this year's congressional midterm elections, in which opposition Democrats are favored to make gains. \\"And all of the great momentum that we are having as a country on jobs, on safety, on security, on our military — it is all at stake in November,\\" Trump warned at the Indiana rally. 2020 is expected to produce a bumper crop of Democratic presidential contenders who will vie for their party's nomination. Those in the group range from the well-known like former Vice President Joe Biden and 2016 contender Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont to a younger, less recognizable contingent that includes California Senator Kamala Harris and New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand. Several potential Democratic presidential contenders spoke about the party's future at a recent conference in Washington hosted by the Center for American Progress, a Democratic-leaning public policy institute in Washington.

You also have the option to paint your bones if desired. Roll up several pieces into a tube shape. Roll others into small balls of various sizes. Make enough newspapers balls and tubes so that the ratio is 4 newspapers to balls to every 1 tube. Place two newspaper balls onto each end of the tube to create the most realistic bone shape. Use tea bags; loose tea is not good for this project because you do not want any tea leaves to get on your finished product. The tea will be used to dye the plaster cloth used in the next step. Plaster cloth is a cloth that hardens into an outer shell when it becomes wet and is then wrapped around a surface (such as your newspaper bones.) Dipping the plaster cloth into the tea will dye the cloth a yellowish grey and will give your bones an aged look. Squeeze the tea out of it by running the cloth between your middle and index fingers. If your plaster cloth is too wet when applied to the newspaper, your newspaper bone might lose some of its shape. Start at one of the ends of the bone and work your way down to the other end. Cover the bone in plaster cloth pieces. When the bone is entirely covered, place it somewhere safe to let it dry. Small bones should take several hours to dry. Larger bones may take up to a day to dry. Test your bones for dryness by touching them. If the plaster cloth still feels wet or slightly sticky, continue to let the bones dry. Only do this if you do not care for the aged coloring that the dyed plaster cloth gives your bones. Summary:","response":"This article provides instructions for making fake bones using newspapers, masking tape, plaster cloth, water, and tea bags. First, create the bone shape with newspapers, maintaining a ratio of 4 balls to 1 tube. Next, use tea to dye the plaster cloth for an aged appearance. Ensure the plaster cloth is not too wet before covering the newspaper bones, and then allow them to dry for several hours, or up to a day for larger bones. The option to paint the bones is also available."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a hateful post in Bengali that expresses hate or encourages violence in a geopolitical context based on the protected characteristics such as race, religion, sex, and sexual orientation.

In A River Runs Through It, Redford displays the lyric romanticism and visual splendor of the high Rocky Mountains of Montana as if he were a 19th century landscape painter of the ilk of Thomas Moran or Albert Bierstadt. This film makes love to the visual and the word with text by author Norman Maclean, and stunning camera work by Phillippe Rousselot (Serpent's Kiss, Reigne Margot). Redford's cast is perfect. Tom Skerritt is the Rev. MacLean, a man whose methods of education include fly fishing as well as the Bible, Brenda Blythen, the mother, and his sons, Craig Schaffer and Brad Pitt create a family whose interactions reflect the same problems all encounter with growing teenage sons, and later, complex young men. Both Schaffer and Pitt are totally believable as the brothers whose love of fly fishing and each other will tie them together forever. It is the relationships between men, father and sons, brothers, and their women to the outside world that grounds A River Runs Through It to a vein of storytelling that is missing in so many of Hollywood films produced in recent years. What makes these relationships special however, is the attention Redford gives to the language as spoken in dialogue. This is a literate script, beautiful to hear and unforgettable when coupled with the stunning Montana rivers and mountains. The words and setting are equal to performances by a cast that rises to their material. While the idea of fly fishing may seem an odd device to center a story, it is not so implausible in Redford's directorial hands. Given the material, Redford's ode to a simpler time and life is worth revisiting again and again. What is the sentiment of this review?","response":"The sentiment of this review is highly positive and appreciative of both Robert Redford's directorial talent and his ability to create a visually stunning and emotionally captivating film. The reviewer is particularly impressed by the casting, the dialogue, and the use of fly fishing as a central theme in \\"A River Runs Through It.\\" The review celebrates the film's ability to evoke nostalgia for a simpler time and praises the filmmaking for its attention to details and genuine portrayal of relationships between characters.

Please find a comprehensive review below. Title: The Shawshank Redemption (1994) Directed by: Frank Darabont Starring: Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton, William Sadler, Clancy Brown, Gil Bellows Review: \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" is a captivating story about friendship, hope, and the indomitable human spirit in the face of adversity. Set in the backdrop of the Shawshank State Penitentiary, the movie follows the journey of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a young and successful banker who is convicted for the murder of his wife and her lover, and his life after being sentenced to two consecutive life terms. The narrative carefully traces Andy's experiences in Shawshank, where he forms a strong bond with a long-term inmate, Ellis \\"Red\\" Redding (Morgan Freeman). Their friendship is portrayed with warmth and depth, showcasing the power of their unwavering support for one another despite the harsh realities of prison life. The character of Red brings out the best in Andy, as he observes and later narrates their shared experiences. Step 1: Analyze the film's key themes and elements The movie's main theme focuses on the persistence of hope. Andy refuses to become a victim of his circumstances, inspiring others to follow his optimism. Director Frank Darabont masterfully interweaves motifs of self-renewal, resilience, and eventual redemption throughout the film. Subtle symbolism, such as the famed Rita Hayworth poster and the use of Mozart's music, add layers of meaning that enhance the overall impact of the story. Step 2: Comment on the acting performances Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman deliver standout performances in their respective roles. Robbins' portrayal of Andy is nuanced and powerful, while Freeman imbues Red with a sense of wisdom and insight that serves as the emotional backbone of the film. The supporting cast, including Bob Gunton's portrayal of the oppressive Warden Norton and Clancy Brown's sadistic Captain Hadley, also add to the film's overall authenticity. Step 3: Discuss the technical aspects The film's cinematography is visually arresting, with effective use of lighting and color palettes to evoke the bleak atmosphere of the titular prison. The score, composed by Thomas Newman, further complements the movie's themes and mood, delivering a haunting and evocative backdrop for the unfolding drama. Step 4: Provide a final assessment In conclusion, \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" is a timeless, emotionally resonant film that showcases the power of hope and the beauty of human connection. With its brilliant screenplay, powerful performances, and outstanding direction, the movie has earned its status as a modern classic and remains a must-watch for all movie lovers.

This thoughtful act is often appreciated and may naturally evoke a sense of gratitude in the recipients. Although I cannot predict the exact actions that Jesse will take next, several possibilities could arise as a response to Bailey's heartwarming display of affection: 1. Expression of Gratitude: Jesse may feel inclined to show their appreciation by expressing gratitude verbally or by giving Bailey a hug, a smile, or even a small gift as a token of their appreciation. 2. Returning the Favor: Jesse might want to reciprocate Bailey's kind gesture at a future time. This could involve planning an evening meal or event wherein Bailey will be surprised and delighted, or simply doing something thoughtful for Bailey in return, such as helping with chores or making their favorite dessert. 3. Sharing the Experience: Jesse could decide to spread the joy of Bailey's act by sharing pictures and stories of the surprise breakfast with friends and loved ones. This act will not only brighten the days and lives of others but also strengthen the bond between Jesse, Bailey, and their family. 4. Making it a Tradition: If the family genuinely enjoyed the surprise breakfast, Jesse might consider proposing the idea of rotating responsibilities for breakfast among family members, giving everyone the opportunity to surprise others and further strengthen their familial bonds. 5. Engaging in Quality Time: Jesse may want to spend more quality time with Bailey and their family in response to the surprise breakfast. This could entail planning a day or an evening for the family to spend together, enjoying each other's company and fostering an environment of love and unity. 6. Discussing How the Act Made Them Feel: Jesse may take the time to discuss their emotions with Bailey and express how the surprise breakfast had a positive impact on them. This candid conversation will contribute to a deeper understanding and appreciation of one another. Ultimately, each individual's behavior may vary based on their unique personality traits, upbringing, and personal values.

Options: (A) 1875 (B) 2000 (C) 2375 (D) 2500 (E) 3875 Let's think first. Stream of consciousness:","response":"First, let's consider the cases with no 4 in the number. There are 3 even numbers (0, 2, 6) that can be the first digit (the first digit cannot be 4). That leaves 2 options (2 and 6) for the second digit since we just used one of the even digits for the first digit. Now, there are 5 odd digits (1, 3, 5, 7, and 9), and these digits would have no restrictions for the third, fourth, and fifth digits. So, we have: 3 options (first digit) * 2 options (second digit) * 5 options (third digit) * 5 options (fourth digit) * 5 options (fifth digit) = 3 * 2 * 5 * 5 * 5 = 750 Now, let's consider the cases with exactly one 4 in the number. Since 4 can only appear in the first two digits, there are 2 possible positions for it: 1. 4 as the first digit, then we have: * 1 way to choose 4 (first digit) * 2 ways to choose the even digit (second digit) * 5 ways to choose the odd digit (third digit) * 5 ways to choose the odd digit (fourth digit) * 5 ways to choose the odd digit (fifth digit) = 1 * 2 * 5 * 5 * 5 = 250 2. 4 as the second digit, then we have: * 2 ways to choose the even digit (first digit) * 1 way to choose 4 (second digit) * 5 ways to choose the odd digit (third digit) * 5 ways to choose the odd digit (fourth digit) * 5 ways to choose the odd digit (fifth digit) = 2 * 1 * 5 * 5 * 5 = 250 So in total there are 750 (with no 4) + 250 (with one 4 as first digit) + 250 (with one 4 as second digit) = 1250 five-digit numbers that meet the conditions.

Article: It is sometimes said that strange flying objects have been seen high up in the sky. People call these strange objects Unidentified Flying Objects(UFOs). These UFOs caused a lot of interest. Some of the reports about them are difficult to believe. Some have been explained in scientific ways. Others have never been explained. Here is an account of UFOs from a report. Dennis Burdens, who wrote an article, tells us that he once saw a UFO himself. He was having dinner one night with a friend near Tripoli, Libya, and after dinner the two men walked across a yard to his room to look at some papers. Burdens noticed that the moon looked strange that night. \\"It wasn't the moon,\\" was the reply. They watched the light and saw that it was moving. It seemed to be an object rather like a big plate. In some ways it looked like smoke with a light on it, but it wasn't smoke because it didn't change its shape. It was moving in a regular way. That is to say, it didn't go suddenly faster or more slowly, and it didn't go higher or lower. So the two men decided that there must be men in it. After that, Burdens said that he felt eyes looking at him. He was being watched in the darkness. When it was nearer, they noticed that the bottom parts were brighter than the top. The bottom was yellow and the top red. Then the object suddenly turned away and left Libya, moving very fast. On a later day Burdens talked to other people about it, and he found some who had seen it. They all described it in the same way. Could they all be mistaken? Question: UFOs are _ . Options: A: flying high up in the sky B: strange flying objects C: difficult to believe D: very interested The answer is:","response":"B: strange flying objects Step 1: I read the article carefully to understand what it is about. The article is mainly about strange flying objects called UFOs. Step 2: I analyze the question. The question is asking what UFOs are. Step 3: I review the options given and identify which one corresponds to the description of UFOs in the article. Option A: \\"flying high up in the sky\\" - Although the article mentions that UFOs are seen high up in the sky, this option does not fully encompass the definition of UFOs. Option B: \\"strange flying objects\\" - This option accurately describes UFOs, as the article states that people call these objects \\"Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs)\\" because of their strange and unexplained nature. Option C: \\"difficult to believe\\" - This option refers to some of the reports about UFOs being difficult to believe. However, it does not describe what UFOs are. Option D: \\"very interested\\" - This option does not make sense grammatically or contextually within the article. Step 4: Based on my analysis, I choose option B as the best answer, as it directly corresponds to the description of UFOs in the article."},{"question":"Choose your story that continues the following story. Zelda could throw the javelin further than the shot put, because the Options are: (A). javelin was much heavier.. (B). shot put was much heavier..","response":"B. Shot put was much heavier. Ever since Zelda was a little girl, she had been fascinated by sports and the sheer adrenaline rush that came with it. Growing up in a family of athletes, she had been fueled by passion, dedication, and a never-ending quest to achieve greatness. Among the various sports she excelled in, she had a particular inclination towards field events—especially the javelin and shot put. One day, while she was training, Zelda noticed how she was able to throw the javelin farther than the shot put. This observation left her wondering why this was the case. The most evident reason was that the shot put was much heavier, which limited its potential range. A standard shot put weighed around 8.8 pounds or 4 kilograms for women, whereas a typical women's javelin weighed approximately 1.3 pounds or 600 grams. This significant difference in weight heavily influenced the distance Zelda could achieve with each throw. Moreover, several other factors contributed to Zelda's ability to throw the javelin further. First and foremost was the aspect of aerodynamics. The javelin, designed with a slender, elongated structure, easily cut through the air, minimizing air resistance during flight. On the other hand, the shot put's spherical shape, although efficient in some aspects, hindered its capacity to traverse vast distances because of the increased air resistance it encountered. Additionally, technique played a significant role in the distances Zelda could reach with each throw. Javelin throwing required a combination of speed, strength, and precision in the approach and release, facilitating an optimal trajectory, angle, and force. By contrast, shot put relied heavily on explosive power, primarily derived from the athlete's legs and core. Zelda's sprinting skills, combined with her well-practiced release technique, allowed her to optimize her javelin throws, achieving longer distances than with the shot put. Another crucial factor was the training involved in honing her skills in each of the events. The hours of practice, guidance from her coaches, and her propensity to excel at sports played a massive role in Zelda’s performance. As she was blessed with a lean, agile, yet powerful physique, her body was more naturally suited for the javelin. Zelda's consistent hard work and dedication allowed her to overcome physical limitations tied to the shot put's weight and still perform admirably in both events. Finally, Zelda's exceptional ability to visualize her progress and set achievable goals helped her excel in various sports, including javelin and shot put. She believed in pushing her boundaries and relentlessly worked towards improving her performance in both disciplines. However, it was the shot put's heavier weight that presented her with a greater challenge, and this ultimately led to the javelin taking precedence in her achievements. In conclusion, the difference in weight between the javelin and shot put significantly impacted Zelda's ability to throw the javelin further than the shot put. The heavier shot put, combined with aerodynamic differences, variations in techniques, her physical suitability for each event, and the training she underwent, made this difference quite apparent. Nevertheless, Zelda's unwavering spirit, commitment to excellence, and prowess in both javelin and shot put events served as an inspiration to athletes everywhere."},{"question":"Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot. If the question isn't answerable, please output \\"Can't answer\\". Question: Who's corpse in the bathtub Title: Les Diaboliques Movie plot: The story takes place in a second-rate boarding school run by the tyrannical and mean Michel Delassalle (Meurisse). The school, though, is owned by Delassalle's teacher wife, the frail Christina (Clouzot), and Delassalle flaunts his relationship with Nicole Horner (Signoret), a teacher at the school. Rather than antagonism, the two women are shown to have a somewhat close relationship, primarily based on their apparent mutual hatred of Michel, who is physically and emotionally abusive to both.Unable to stand his mistreatment any longer, Nicole devises a plan. Though hesitant at first, Christina ultimately consents to help Nicole. Using a threatened divorce to lure Michel to Nicole's apartment building in a remote village several hundred kilometers away, Christina sedates him. The two women then drown him in a bathtub and dump his body in the school's neglected swimming pool. When his corpse floats to the surface, they think it will appear to have been an accident. Almost everything goes according to their plans until the body fails to surface, and Michel's corpse is nowhere to be found when the pool is drained.Nicole sees in the paper that the police found the corpse. Christina goes to the morgue and learns it is not Michel's body. There she meets Alfred Fichet (Vanel), a retired private detective. He gets involved in the case, much to Nicole's chagrin.When Christina and Alfred come back, a boy is punished for breaking a window; the boy says Michel punished him. After hearing this Christina becomes very sick. She is unable to be photographed for the school photo; however, it seems that Michel is in it, in the back next to a window. Nicole becomes worried and leaves the school. Christina, overcome by fear, tells Alfred everything. He does not believe her, but he investigates the pool.

With less human activity in the area, there is less disturbance to the already stressed ecosystems and habitats. This allows animals to adapt and recover more easily, finding new sources of food and shelter without interference from humans. Additionally, fewer people in the area means less pollution, noise, and other factors that could further hinder the recovery of affected ecosystems. So, a reduction in human presence and activity would lead to fewer negative effects on animals after forest fires."},{"question":"Come up with a question and reasoning that would justify this answer: it is not possible to tell","response":"Question: Can you accurately predict the exact date and time of a volcanic eruption? Reasoning: It is not possible to tell the exact date and time of a volcanic eruption because there are many complex factors and variables involved in the geological processes that lead to an eruption. While scientists can monitor signs of volcanic activity such as seismic activity, gas emissions, and ground deformation, these indicators can only provide a general idea of the potential for an eruption – not an exact prediction. The natural processes governing volcanic eruptions are still not fully understood, and even with advanced technology and monitoring systems, there remains a degree of uncertainty in predicting eruptions accurately."},{"question":"Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Gunshots rang out once again on a campus in the United States on Wednesday. Students and faculty raced out of harm's way, ducked under furniture, barricaded doors and hid in interior rooms, bathrooms and labs. The short-lived nightmare on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles came one day before Wear Orange: National Gun Violence Awareness Day. Wear Orange was inspired by friends of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old Chicago high school student killed by gunfire in 2013. The group decided to honor her life by wearing orange — the color worn by hunters in the woods to protect themselves and others. While the idea has been embraced by civic organizations, politicians and celebrities, it has been rejected by gun rights advocates. The National Rifle Association has attacked the campaign as \\"pointless,\\" and said \\"participating is an easy way of scoring points for being 'socially conscious.'\\" Here is a look at the unique relationship between Americans and their guns. Any law-abiding citizen in the United States is allowed to own or carry a gun. That right comes from the U.S. Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It says: \\"A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\\" The Second Amendment was based partially on English common law, which describes an auxiliary right, supporting the natural rights of self-defense, resistance to oppression, and the civic duty to act in concert in defense of the state. To purchase a gun in the majority of states, a person needs to be of age, pass the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check and fill out a firearms transaction record. However, background checks are not currently required for private sales, including those conducted at gun shows. Certain people are banned from owning weapons, including convicted criminals, people with mental health illnesses or non-U.S. citizens. But the system has major holes in it.

They both describe the Appalachian Trail, a designated National Scenic Trail in the United States that takes a route from Georgia to Maine and vice versa, according to both sentences. The trail, in both instances, is described as traveling across Franconia Ridge and includes a location known as Little Haystack. However, the order in which the trail's endpoints - Georgia and Maine - are given in the two sentences are swapped. The first version of the sentence suggests that the trail commences in Georgia and ends in Maine, and the second version of the sentence implies the starting point to be Maine and the finishing point as Georgia. Nonetheless, this is not an inconsistency because the Appalachian Trail can be hiked in either direction. Therefore, one can start from Georgia and move northwards to Maine, or conversely, commence the journey in Maine and hike southwards towards Georgia. Commonly, through hikers, those who attempt to complete the entire trail, start in Georgia in spring and hike north to reach Maine by fall to take advantage of the more favorable weather conditions, but both directions are officially recognized. Notably, regardless of the direction in which one travels, the trail passes over the Franconia Ridge and includes an area called Little Haystack in both descriptions. This area is a famous portion of the trail known for its exceptional beauty and impressive heights.

In the beginning of the Lenten season in 1959, \\"fifteen years after the War,\\" they travel to a quiet French village that closely adheres to tradition, as led by the village mayor, the Comte de Reynaud (Alfred Molina). Just as the villagers begin observing the forty days of Lent, Vianne opens a chocolate shop, much to Reynaud's displeasure. Vianne wears more colorful clothing than the village women, is an atheist, and has an illegitimate child. She does not fit in well with the townspeople, but is nevertheless optimistic about her business. Her friendly and alluring nature begins to win the villagers over one by one, causing Reynaud to openly speak against her for tempting the people during a time of abstinence and self-denial. The Comte will not admit that his wife has left him; he is romantically interested in Caroline, but he does not pursue her. One of the first to fall under the spell of Vianne and her confections is Armande (Judi Dench), her elderly, eccentric landlady. Armande is unhappy that her cold, devoutly pious daughter Caroline (Carrie-Anne Moss) will not let Armande see her grandson Luc because Caroline thinks Armande is a \\"bad influence\\". Vianne arranges for Luc and his grandmother to see each other in the chocolaterie, where they develop a close bond.

Unfazed by traditions and religious dogma, Vianne opens a chocolate shop, drawing the ire of the town's mayor, Comte de Reynaud. Through her daring sense of style and her secular beliefs, Vianne poses a striking contrast to the restrictive atmosphere of the village. As her enchanting chocolates and captivating personality begin to captivate the hearts of the villagers, Reynaud sees her as a threat to the town's principles, accusing her of tempting the residents during a time of penance and self-denial. As Vianne becomes increasingly woven into the fabric of local life, she forms bonds with a myriad of characters, helping them face their inner demons and embrace their true selves. Along her journey, she reunites an estranged grandmother with her grandson, empowers a woman to break free from an abusive relationship, and encourages the townspeople to accept one another's flaws and appreciate life's simple pleasures. In \\"L'Enchantement Chocolat,\\" the powerful message of love, acceptance, and healing through connection is embodied in the delicate art of chocolate-making.

A:","response":"The collision is called an Elastic Collision. Step-by-step reasoning: Step 1: Understanding the task - The task provided is a direct question that needs a specific answer based on physics principle. The user is asking about the type of collision where both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved. Step 2: Applying knowledge from physics - In collisions, two physical quantities, momentum and energy, play a crucial role. Depending on whether they are conserved or not after the collision, collisions are classified into two main types, namely, elastic and inelastic collisions. For elastic collisions, both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved. For inelastic collisions, only momentum is conserved while kinetic energy is not conserved. Therefore the collision where both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved is called an elastic collision. Hence, I provided the required answer based on this fundamental physics principle."},{"question":"I know that the answer to the question \\"Whose contributions from this period might by recognized by a modern day student of geometry?\\" is in \\"The Hellenistic period covers the period of ancient Greek (Hellenic) history and Mediterranean history between the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC and the emergence of the Roman Empire as signified by the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the subsequent conquest of Ptolemaic Egypt the following year. At this time, Greek cultural influence and power was at its peak in Europe, Africa and Asia, experiencing prosperity and progress in the arts, exploration, literature, theatre, architecture, music, mathematics, philosophy, and science. For example, competitive public games took place, ideas in biology, and popular entertainment in theaters. It is often considered a period of transition, sometimes even of decadence or degeneration, compared to the enlightenment of the Greek Classical era. The Hellenistic period saw the rise of New Comedy, Alexandrian poetry, the Septuagint and the philosophies of Stoicism and Epicureanism. Greek Science was advanced by the works of the mathematician Euclid and the polymath Archimedes. The religious sphere expanded to include new gods such as the Greco-Egyptian Serapis, eastern deities such as Attis and Cybele and the Greek adoption of Buddhism.\\". Can you tell me what it is? A:","response":"Certainly! From the Hellenistic period, a modern-day student of geometry would likely recognize the contributions of Euclid and Archimedes. Euclid was a Greek mathematician who wrote the influential work \\"Elements,\\" which has been used as a textbook in teaching geometry for centuries and laid the foundation for much of modern geometry. Archimedes was a polymath who made significant contributions to various fields, including geometry, where he worked on the measurement of geometric shapes and volumes, as well as the development of mathematical principles and theorems. Both of these figures are considered giants in the field of geometry, and their works continue to be celebrated and studied by modern scholars."},{"question":"How do you say \\"I answered him: \\"How can I try to do such a thing when they have been shrewd enough not to fix the very date of the alleged crime against me?\\"\\" in Spanish?","response":"In Spanish, you would say: \\"Le respondí: '¿Cómo puedo intentar hacer algo así cuando han sido lo suficientemente astutos como para no fijar la fecha exacta del supuesto delito en mi contra?'\\" Here's a breakdown of the translation: - \\"I answered him\\" is translated to \\"Le respondí\\", where \\"le\\" refers to the person you are talking to and \\"respondí\\" is the past tense of \\"responder\\" (to answer). - \\"How can I try to do such a thing\\" is translated to \\"¿Cómo puedo intentar hacer algo así\\", where \\"cómo\\" means \\"how\\", \\"puedo\\" is the present tense of \\"poder\\" (can), \\"intentar\\" means \\"try to\\", \\"hacer\\" means \\"do\\", \\"algo\\" means \\"something\\", and \\"así\\" means \\"such\\" or \\"like that\\". - \\"when they have been shrewd enough not to fix the very date of the alleged crime against me?\\" is translated to \\"cuando han sido lo suficientemente astutos como para no fijar la fecha exacta del supuesto delito en mi contra?\\", where \\"cuando\\" means \\"when\\", \\"han sido\\" is the present perfect tense of \\"ser\\" (to be), \\"lo suficientemente\\" means \\"enough\\", \\"astutos\\" means \\"shrewd\\", \\"como para\\" means \\"as to\\" or \\"in order to\\", \\"no\\" means \\"not\\", \\"fijar\\" means \\"fix\\" or \\"establish\\", \\"la fecha exacta\\" means \\"the exact date\\", \\"del supuesto delito\\" means \\"of the alleged crime\\", and \\"en mi contra\\" means \\"against me\\".

Article: A car that runs on coffee is unveiled(shown to the public for the first time)today but at between 25 and 50 times the cost of running a car on petrol, the invention won't please any motor industry accountants. Nicknamed the Car-puccino, it has been created using a 1988 Volkswagen Scirocco bought for PS400 and it was chosen because it looked like the time-traveling DeLorean in the movieBack To The Future.The car will be driven the 210 miles between Manchester and London powered only by roasted coffee granules .It has been built by a team from the BBC1 science programme Bang Goes The Theory and will go on display at the Big Bang science fair in Manchester to show how fuels other than traditional petrol can power vehicles. The team calculates the Car-puccino will do three miles per kilo of ground coffee -- about 56 cups of espressos per mile.The journey will use about 70 kilos of ground coffee which, at supermarket prices of between PS13 and PS26 a kilo depending on brand and quality, will cost between PS910 and PS1,820, or between 25 and 50 times the PS36 cost of petrol for the journey.In total, the trip will cost 11,760 espressos, and the team will have to take 'coffee breaks' roughly every 30 to 45 miles to pour in more granules.They will also have to stop about every 60 miles to clean out the 'coffee filters' to rid them of the soot and tar which is also generated by the process.So despite a top speed of 60mph, the many stops mean the going will be slow, with the journey taking around ten hours. Sadly, the inventors will still have to pay duty on their coffee fuel---even though tax collectors at Her Majesty's Revenue and Custom haven't yet worked out how much. Nick Watson, producer of Bang Goes The Theory, said, \\"Coffee, like wood or coal, has some carbon content so you can use it as a fuel.The coffee needs to be very dry and in granules to allow the air to move through the pile of coffee as it burns.The brand doesn't matter.\\" He said the same technology could be used to power a car on other unusual...

Options are: A. yes. B. it is not possible to tell. C. no.","response":"C. no. The statement provided suggests that pursuing sharp reductions in CO2 emissions from the electricity generating sector alone may lead to a dramatic shift from coal to natural gas. This shift could pose a threat to national energy security, cause a substantial increase in energy prices, and harm consumers. Therefore, we cannot conclude that \\"The use of generating electricity from coal to natural gas would not impact national energy security.\\" This is because moving from coal to natural gas for electricity generation could lead to various potential risks and challenges such as: 1. Dependency on gas suppliers: A rapid and substantial shift to natural gas may lead to a higher dependence on natural gas suppliers, both domestic and international. This may create challenges in maintaining a stable and secure supply of fuel for electricity generation, thus impacting national energy security. 2. Price volatility: Natural gas prices can be subject to high levels of volatility, especially when compared to coal prices, due to factors such as geopolitical issues, supply constraints, and weather conditions. A higher dependency on natural gas may lead to an increased vulnerability to price fluctuations that could impact electricity prices and consumers. 3. Infrastructure challenges: A significant shift from coal to natural gas would require considerable investment in new infrastructure, such as gas pipelines, storage facilities, and generating plants. This could strain financial resources and challenge the capacity of countries to develop or upgrade the necessary infrastructure to ensure a reliable and secure energy supply. 4. Environmental concerns: While natural gas is generally considered cleaner than coal when it comes to CO2 emissions, it is not without environmental concerns. For example, methane, the primary component of natural gas, is a potent greenhouse gas. Leakage during natural gas production, transportation, and storage can lead to increased greenhouse gas emissions, partially offsetting the benefits of reduced CO2 emissions. To minimize the risks associated with transitioning from coal to natural gas, it is essential to consider a more comprehensive approach to energy policy, which includes diversifying the energy mix with renewable energy sources, promoting energy efficiency, and investing in new technologies for cleaner electricity generation. This will help ensure that national energy security is maintained while mitigating the potential negative impacts of a rapid shift from coal to natural gas."},{"question":"Please capitalize where necessary: registering for school in turkey | sunsearch","response":"When registering for school in Turkey, it is important to follow several crucial steps and capitalize proper nouns for accuracy.

People who set realistic goals and expectations have higher self esteems. You can ask yourself the following questions: What is the root of my goal? When did it develop? Why do I want to achieve this goal? Is it based on my desires or someone else’s (e.g. partner, parent, teacher)? Can I realistically achieve this goal based on my personality and past experience? What is the purpose of achieving this goal? What is most important to you? Perhaps your job or your relationship. Focus on the top three things that matter in your life and make sure that you are giving your time and energy to those activities. If you have time and energy to do more activities, add them in gradually. Aim for a good balance. For example, you might say that your top three priorities are your family, job, and choir. Schedule weekly quality family time. Make sure you sleep enough to do well at your job. Plan to have a babysitter on choir nights. Other priorities for a university student might be gaining entrance to medical school, being a good student government leader, and staying fit. In this case, plan out your study times for the MCAT. Also, put your student government meetings in your calendar in advance. Map out your work out times. It is possible that at some times, like the week before your MCAT exam, you must focus even more on just one priority. When you set goals or want to change things about yourself, keep in mind that change does not happen overnight. Strive instead to set mini goals as you work towards a larger goal. Also realize that achieving your goal likely has a few consequences but will not necessarily impact your entire life. For instance, if you want to lose weight, focus on the health benefits of weight loss first. Do not automatically assume it will improve your personal relationships or overall happiness. For example, instead of saying, “I’m going to lose forty pounds this year,” try instead to lose one pound per week for one month. After this time, reassess your situation and make another mini goal. If your goal is gaining entrance into medical school, set mini goals and tasks, like enrolling in organic chemistry, anatomy, molecular biology, and other courses. Then, focus on doing well in your courses. Eventually, add the goal of acing the MCAT. After this, you can add tasks like writing your essays, receiving recommendation letters, gathering transcripts, etc.","response":"In order to achieve your short-term and long-term goals effectively, it is essential to understand the root of these goals and set realistic expectations. Doing so can contribute to higher self-esteem. To gain insight into your goals, ask yourself questions about the origin, purpose, and feasibility of the goal. Determine if the goal is motivated by your desires or influenced by others such as family members, or teachers. Once you have identified the root and purpose of your goals, prioritize the top three essential aspects of your life to ensure efficient allocation of time and energy. For example, if your priorities are family, job, and a hobby, dedicate time each week to spend quality time with family and ensure proper planning for work and hobby commitments. Similarly, if you are a university student, set priorities like entrance to a prestigious program, leadership roles, and maintaining fitness; then create a schedule to make sure you achieve the desired balance. Understanding the fact that significant change cannot be achieved overnight, focusing on setting and achieving mini-goals can help maintain motivation and make the process more manageable. Break down your larger goals into smaller steps and reassess your progress periodically. For example, if you aim to lose weight, set smaller, achievable weight loss targets and assess your progress every month. Setting smaller goals is helpful in tackling larger ambitions too; for instance, if you aspire to enter medical school, set mini-goals like enrolling in relevant courses, excelling in your studies, and acing the MCAT. Eventually, focus on additional tasks such as writing essays, obtaining recommendation letters, and gathering transcripts as part of the application process. By understanding the roots of your goals, prioritizing essential aspects of your life, and setting achievable mini-goals, you can make steady progress towards your short-term and long-term objectives.

A:","response":"Vladimir Lenin, born as Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov on April 22, 1870, was a Russian revolutionary, politician, and political theorist. He played a crucial role in the 1917 Russian Revolution and became the first head of the Soviet state. Lenin's importance lies in his impact on world history, the development of communism, and his influence on the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. Here are some key facts to help answer who Vladimir Lenin was and why he was important: 1. Ideological development: Lenin's political and economic ideas, particularly his interpretation of Marxism, formed the basis of Leninism, a distinct political theory that later developed into the core of Soviet and Marxist-Leninist ideology. 2. Founding of the Russian Communist Party: Lenin was instrumental in the establishment of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party (RSDLP) in 1898, which later split into the Bolshevik and Menshevik factions in 1903. Lenin led the more radical Bolsheviks, who ultimately became the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. 3. Role in the Russian Revolution: Lenin played a pivotal role in the Russian Revolution, a series of events that led to the overthrow of Tsar Nicholas II and the establishment of the Soviet Union. Lenin returned to Russia from exile in April 1917 and, within a few months, successfully orchestrated the October Revolution, which brought the Bolsheviks to power. 4. Leadership of Soviet Russia: After the Russian Revolution, Lenin served as the leader of Soviet Russia from 1917 to 1924, first as Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars and later as Chairman of the Council of Labor and Defense. During his tenure, Lenin introduced policies to nationalize industry, redistribute land, and establish a socialist government. 5. Promotion of world revolution: Lenin believed in the international spread of communism. Under his leadership, the Soviet Union supported communist movements in other countries, which led to the formation of the Third (Communist) International or Comintern in 1919. This organization aimed to spread communism globally and unite proletarian nations in their struggle against capitalism. 6. Lenin's death and legacy: Lenin passed away on January 21, 1924, and his death marked the beginning of a power struggle within the Soviet Union that ultimately led to Joseph Stalin's leadership. Despite controversies surrounding his policies and actions, Lenin is remembered as a transformative figure who shaped the course of 20th-century history and altered the geopolitical landscape with the emergence of a new superpower in the form of the Soviet Union."},{"question":"Which novel by Colombian Nobel Prize-winning author author was Hilary Simon's painting used as the cover?

Answer the above question based on the context below: Chinese imperial tombs are typically approached by a \\"spirit road\\", sometimes several kilometres long, lined by statues of guardian figures, based on both humans and animals. A tablet extolling the virtues of the deceased, mounted on a stone representation of Bixi in the form of a tortoise, is often the centerpiece of the ensemble. In Han tombs the guardian figures are mainly of \\"lions\\" and \\"chimeras\\"; in later periods they are much more varied. A looted tomb with fine paintings is the Empress Dowager Wenming tomb of the 5th century CE, and the many tombs of the 7th-century Tang dynasty Qianling Mausoleum group are an early example of a generally well-preserved ensemble.The complex of Goguryeo Tombs, from a kingdom of the 5th to 7th centuries which included modern Korea, are especially rich in paintings. Only one of the Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties has been excavated, in 1956, with such disastrous results for the conservation of the thousands of objects found, that subsequently the policy is to leave them undisturbed.The Lei Cheng Uk Han Tomb Museum in Hong Kong displays a far humbler middle-class Han dynasty tomb, and the mid-2nd-century Wu Family tombs of Jiaxiang County, Shandong are the most important group of commoner tombs for funerary stones. The walls of both the offering and burial chambers of tombs of commoners from the Han period may be decorated with stone slabs carved or engraved in very low relief with crowded and varied scenes, which are now the main indication of the style of the lost palace frescoes of the period. A cheaper option was to use large clay tiles which were carved or impressed before firing. After the introduction of Buddhism, carved \\"funerary couches\\" featured similar scenes, now mostly religious.

Answer:","response":"In later periods, the guardian figures in Chinese imperial tombs became much more varied as compared to the Han dynasty, where they were mainly represented by lions and chimeras. This increase in variety and diversity of guardian figures can be attributed to several factors, including the influence of different dynasties, cultural changes, artistic developments, and the introduction of new religious beliefs. 1. Influence of different dynasties: As different dynasties ruled China over the centuries, they brought with them their own customs, beliefs, and artistic preferences. This led to variations in the types of guardian figures used in imperial tombs. For instance, the Tang dynasty (618-907 CE) saw an increased use of human and animal guardian figures that were not only powerful and mythical, but also depicted daily life, such as servants, guards, and horses. 2. Cultural changes: Over the course of Chinese history, its society evolved and became increasingly sophisticated. This cultural evolution was reflected in the art and architecture, including the guardian figures in imperial tombs. As a result, the types of guardian figures diversified to include more human-like characters, celestial beings, and mythological creatures that symbolized protection, power, and wealth. 3. Artistic developments: As Chinese artists developed new techniques and styles, the depiction of guardian figures in imperial tombs grew more intricate and refined. Artists began to portray guardian figures with greater realism and attention to detail, giving rise to more varied and unique representations of these protective entities. 4. Introduction of new religious beliefs: As new religious beliefs, such as Buddhism, were introduced to China, they began to influence the art and architecture in imperial tombs. Buddhist concepts, such as spiritual liberation and the afterlife, influenced the design of guardian figures, leading to the inclusion of Buddhist deities and more religiously-themed representations. In conclusion, the guardian figures in Chinese imperial tombs became much more varied in later periods due to the influence of different dynasties, cultural changes, artistic developments, and the introduction of new religious beliefs. These factors contributed to making the guardian figures a more diverse and sophisticated means of embodying the power, protection, and prosperity required for the deceased in the afterlife."},{"question":"Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What's the last name of the person who first discovers that Julian's brother has been resurrected?

Your task is to classify given movie review into two categories: 1) positive, and 2) negative based on its content. Where can I begin. I heard this movie was coming out and I was very mad. I am a huge fan of the original Carlito's Way and when I heard about this, I thought it would be just like almost all the other sequels that come out in Hollywood. I thought it would be bad. Boy was I wrong, this movie was much worse than I expected. Not saying all sequels are bad, but thats the problem with Hollywood these days, they make too many sequels and remakes and rush them. This was not a theater release, it is a DVD release. Still, in my opinion, there was no reason at all for this to be made. After I heard about this film was in progress, I then later heard Pacino was not in it. That right away killed any chance this movie had of being good. Why did I check this movie out then some of you may ask? Well I had the opportunity to see it so I did. I don't only watch movies that I have high expectations of, I had low expectations on this one obviously. I just wanted to see if it would have anything relevant in it. Now, if any of you reading this are a Carlito's Way fan, you know a lot of the story in the first one has to do with him going to jail.*VERY MINOR SPOILER* I wont ruin anything, because this may actually make you not want to waste 2 hours watching this trash. All I will say is- in the end of Carlito's Way 2, we don't see Carlito go to jail. Now, I don't know about any of you, but I would have thought a prequel to Carlitos Way would show how he ended up in jail. I even had some interest in actually seeing what happened.Now, thats not my only problem with the film. The actor who played Carlito did not do too bad a job, but he could not have saved this film if he tried. There's not even all those little things that should be thrown in there that Carlito's Way fans would like. You don't see any appearance of Kleinfeld or other key characters in the first one, I would have liked to see something like that. What is even worse, is Luis Guzman is in this film, yet he doesn't play the same character he plays in the first film. Big mistake on their part, why cast the same actor for a different character, it made the movie worse than it already was.Bottom line, I am a Carlito's Way fan, this new straight to DVD release is a disgrace. If you are a fan, don't watch this movie coming in with high expectations. This movie did basically nothing for me, and it is definitely one movie I wont be picking up on DVD, or watching ever again. A:","response":"Based on the content of the review, I would classify the movie review as negative. The reviewer has clearly expressed their dissatisfaction with the movie, mentioning that it was \\"much worse\\" than they expected and calling it \\"trash.\\" They talk about various aspects of the film that disappointed them, including the absence of key characters from the original movie, the storyline inconsistency, and the use of the same actor for a different character. Additionally, the reviewer states that the movie is a \\"disgrace\\" to the original Carlito's Way and that they have no intention of ever watching it again. The definition of a negative review typically involves expressing dissatisfaction, disappointment, or disapproval of the subject being discussed. In this case, the review clearly fits these criteria, leading to the classification of the review as negative."},{"question":"Concepts: ceremony, graduate, hold, senior Write a sentence that includes all these words.","response":"The graduation ceremony, organized to commemorate the accomplishments of the senior students, was finally held amidst the exuberant atmosphere, signifying a proud and momentous event for both the graduates and their families as they gathered together to celebrate this significant milestone in their academic journey."},{"question":"În opinia mea, doar acestea vor putea să creeze locuri noi de muncă și, prin urmare, să facă față aspectelor sociale ale crizei financiare cu care ne-am confruntat, iar acestea vor constitui în mod natural o trambulină importantă pentru inițierea fazei noi care urmează crizei economice.

He rushed into the classical music scene at the age of 12 after Itzhak Perlman, the famed violinist, heard him play. But nothing in his family history explains where Haimovitz got his extraordinary talent. And that's typical, Ellen Winner, a professor says. \\"People are fascinated by these children because they don't understand where their talent came from. You will see parents who say, 'I wasn't like this, and my husband wasn't like this.' It seems to sometimes just come out of the blue,\\" Winner says. It's not clear whether a prodigy's brain is any different from the brains of other children, in part because there have been no study comparing the brains of prodigies to those of average people. \\"But I believe that anything that shows up so early, without training, has got to be either a genetic or some other biological basis,\\" Winner says. \\"If a child suddenly at the age of 3 goes to the piano and picks out a tune and does it beautifully, that has to be because that child has a different brain.\\" Children who are extremely gifted tend to be socially different, too, Winner says. \\"They feel like they can't find other kids like themselves, so they feel strange, maybe even like a freak, and feel like they don't have anybody to connect with.

I was a huge comic book reader at the time, and anything relating to superheroes was anticipated heavily. The end result, however, was underwhelming. I was aware of the \\"Emma Peel\\" Diana Prince stories, as they had only recently come to an end and Diana was returned to her Amazonian form. However, there was so little action that I was bored throughout most of the movie. The final costume was an interesting idea, but looked more like a cheerleader than a superhero. I saw the movie again in my late teen years. It hadn't improved much. Cathy Lee Crosby was more familiar, thanks to That's Incredible, but her acting was no better. The script had a few good ideas, like the rogue Amazon, and a decent villain in Ricardo Montalban, but it just didn't come together and was still boring. I think they should have built the back story better, and built the show into a more epic climax. It was too much like a bland spy film, crossed with a superhero story written by someone who had never seen a comic book. The Amazon elements were intriguing, but needed to be expanded. The film did succeed in forcing producers to go back to the drawing board and come up with something more faithful, if a bit too camp and low budget. The budget was also pretty low here, and superheroes don't come cheap. It would be nice to have the movie available on DVD, if only as a comparison and historical document. Even Superman 4 is available, and it has nothing over this film (except Chris Reeve and Gene Hackman).

Online, you may have seen the playful social media stories they created to share their experiments with artistic and scientific processes. The teens were participants in the Getty Teen Lab, a four-week paid internship for high school students. Supported by a generous grant from the Vera R. Campbell Foundation, Teen Lab was the first of several teen-focused initiatives that the J. Paul Getty Museum is launching in 2017 and 2018. The Getty’s Education Department developed Teen Lab in response to several seemingly disconnected questions that many art museums are grappling with today: How can we engage diverse youth in meaningful ways? How can museums help meet the rising demand for K-12 curriculum that integrates Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math (STEAM)? Can art museums themselves be sites for STEAM learning? To address these questions, we looked at other teen programs and discovered that the most successful models are those that give teens agency and a voice in the museum.(1) For example, many museums have teen councils that program events for their peers or offer opportunities for students to collaborate on projects with artists.(2) The Getty wanted to build on these models by empowering teens to be active creators of educational content.

Although he does not show any overt signs of mental illness, he hopes to avoid hard labor and serve the rest of his sentence in a more relaxed hospital environment. McMurphy's ward is run by steely, unyielding Nurse Mildred Ratched (Louise Fletcher), a strict authoritarian woman who passive-aggressively employs subtle humiliation, unpleasant medical treatments and a mind-numbing daily routine to suppress the patients and keep them submissive. McMurphy finds that they are actually more fearful of Nurse Ratched and her methods than they are focused on their main goal of eventually becoming functional in the outside world. In order to help them achieve this (as he believes), McMurphy establishes himself immediately as the leader of his fellow patients. The ward's other patients include Billy Bibbit (Brad Dourif), a nervous, anxiety-prone young man with a noticeable stutter; Charlie Cheswick (Sydney Lassick), a man disposed to childish fits of temper; Martini (Danny DeVito), who is delusional; Dale Harding (William Redfield), a high-strung, well-educated paranoid; Max Taber (Christopher Lloyd), who is chronically belligerent and profane; Jim Sefelt (William Duell), an epileptic man; and \\"Chief\\" Bromden (Will Sampson), a silent Native American-descended man of very imposing stature who is believed to be both deaf and mute. Nurse Ratched soon comes to see McMurphy's newfound presence to be a threat to her authority and total control of the ward's patients, McMurphy's and Ratched's battle of wills escalates rapidly.

Article: Alexis Pilkington was a popular 17-year-old and a well-liked athlete who had already won a soccer scholarship to college. But none of that stopped Alexis from becoming the target of online bullying . Alexis began to receive hundreds of online unpleasant comments via the latest social networking site called www.formspring.com. In March 2010, Alexis committed suicide and although all agreed that the online bother was not the single factor that led to Alexis' death, everyone did agree that it was a contributory factor. Unfortunately, Alexis' story is not unique. A 2010 study conducted by the Cyberbullying Research Center showed that cyberbullying victims were almost twice as likely to have attempted suicide compared to youth who had not experienced cyberbullying. Suicide is obviously the extreme and no one can minimize the tragedy of it. However, there are other damages that occur as a result of aggressive bullying. It can damage self-esteem and lead to feelings of worthlessness, and also increase social isolation and make victims become withdrawn, depressed, anxious, and insecure. So what causes girls to be so unkind towards each other? A term known as relational aggression may best describe the cause of girl-on-girl bullying. It starts with a clique usually led by a girl with a high level of social status and popularity. In order not to lose her position, she will control girls within the clique and take action if she feels threatened. At the leader's directive the girls within the clique will spread rumors and lies and annoy other girls continuously. The bullying starts at school but will quickly go to cyberbullying due to anonymity . Girls will easily do so in the anonymity of the Internet. Ultimately the cause will be summarized as the insecurity and jealousy of one girl and the twisted loyalty of members within her clique. Underneath the confident exterior of a female bully lie desperate insecurities. Question: Which of the following is NOT the cause of bullying? Answer: A:","response":"The article does not provide a specific option for what is NOT the cause of bullying. However, it mentions that insecurity, jealousy, and twisted loyalty are contributing factors to girl-on-girl bullying."},{"question":"What is the title of this article: Magnates often received gifts from monarchs, which significantly increased their wealth.

Here, three concepts are provided to me, namely: fan, leave, and match. Each of these concepts can have multiple meanings based on the context. - 'Fan' could be an object to provide a cooling breeze, or it could refer to a person who is an ardent follower of something (such as a sports team, a celebrity, etc.) - 'Leave' could mean the action of going away from a place, or it could also refer to permission to be away from work or it could refer to a leaf. - 'Match' could describe a sporting event or competition, or it could also mean a short, thin stick that is used to create a flame, or it could refer to pairing something perfectly. Step 2: Crafting a sentence Once the concepts are understood, the next step is to form a sentence using these concepts. To make it meaningful, I would create a context which would use these three concepts logically. Step 3: Final sentence My final result is, \\"The fan decided to leave the cricket match early because it was too hot.\\" In this sentence, the concepts are used as follows: 'Fan' has been used in the context of a follower or supporter (of a cricket match in this case). 'Leave' has been implied as the action of going away from a place (the cricket match). 'Match' has been used to depict a sporting event (cricket match).

Head VI is an oil-on-canvas painting by the Irish-born figurative artist Francis Bacon, the last of six panels making up his \\"1949 Head\\" series. It shows a bust view of a single figure, modeled on Diego Velázquez's Portrait of Innocent X. Bacon applies forceful, expressive brush strokes, and places the figure within a glass cage structure, behind curtain-like drapery. This gives the effect of a man trapped and suffocated by his surroundings, screaming into an airless void. Head VI was the first of Bacon's paintings to reference Velázquez, whose portrait of Pope Innocent X haunted him throughout his career and inspired his series of \\"screaming popes\\", a loose series of which there are around 45 surviving individual works. Head VI contains many motifs that were to reappear in Bacon's work. The hanging object, which may be a light switch or curtain tassel, can be found even in his late paintings. The geometric cage is a motif that appears as late as his 1985–86 masterpiece Study for a Self-Portrait—Triptych. Head VI was first exhibited in November 1949 at the Hanover Gallery in London, in a showing organised by one of the artist's early champions, Erica Brausen. At the time, Bacon was a highly controversial but respected artist, best known for his 1944 Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion, which made him the enfant terrible of British art. Head VI drew a mixed reaction from art critics; John Russell, later Bacon's biographer, at the time dismissed it as a cross between \\"an alligator shorn of its jaws and an accountant in pince-nez who has come to a bad end\\". In 1989 Lawrence Gowing wrote that the \\"shock of the picture, when it was seen with a whole series of heads ... was indescribable. It was everything unpardonable. The paradoxical appearance at once of pastiche and iconoclasm was indeed one of Bacon's most original strokes.\\" Art critic and curator David Sylvester described it as a seminal piece from Bacon's unusually productive 1949–50 period, and one of Bacon's finest popes.

His parents are Ahmet Erdogan and Tenzile Erdogan. Erdogan reportedly said in 2003, \\"I'm a Georgian, my family is a Georgian family which migrated from Batumi to Rize.\\" But in a 2014 televised interview on the NTV news network, he said, \\"You wouldn't believe the things they have said about me. They have said I am Georgian... forgive me for saying this... even much uglier things, they have even called me an Armenian, but I am Turkish.\\" In an account based on registry records, his genealogy was tracked to an ethnic Turkish family. Erdogan spent his early childhood in Rize, where his father Ahmet Erdogan (1905 - 1988) was a Captain in the Turkish Coast Guard. Erdogan had a brother Mustafa (b. 1958) and sister Vesile (b. 1965). His summer holidays were mostly spent in Guneysu, Rize, where his family originates from. Throughout his life he often returned to this spiritual home, and in 2015 he opened a vast mosque on a mountaintop near this village. The family returned to Istanbul when Erdogan was 13 years old. As a teenager, he sold lemonade and sesame buns (simit) on the streets of the city's rougher districts to earn extra money. Brought up in an observant Muslim family, Erdogan graduated from Kasimpasa Piyale primary school in 1965, and Imam Hatip school, a religious vocational high school, in 1973. He received his high school diploma from Eyup High School. He subsequently studied Business Administration at the Aksaray School of Economics and Commercial Sciences, now known as Marmara University's Faculty of Economics and Administrative Sciences--although several Turkish sources dispute that he graduated. In his youth, Erdogan played semi-professional football at a local club. Fenerbahce wanted him to transfer to the club but his father prevented it. The stadium of the local football club in the district where he grew up, Kasimpasa S.K. is named after him. Erdogan married Emine Gulbaran (born 1955, Siirt) on 4 July 1978. They have two sons; Ahmet Burak and Necmettin Bilal, and two daughters, Esra and Sumeyye. His father, Ahmet Erdogan, died in 1988 and his 88-year-old mother, Tenzile Erdogan, died in 2011. He is a member of the Community of Iskenderpasa, a Turkish sufistic community of Naqshbandi tariqah. In 2001, Erdogan established the Justice and Development Party (AKP). The elections of 2002 were the first elections in which Erdogan participated as a party leader. All parties previously elected to parliament failed to win enough votes to re-enter the parliament. The AKP won 34.3% of the national vote and formed the new government. Turkish stocks rose more than 7% on Monday morning. Politicians of the previous generation, such as Ecevit, Bahceli, Yilmaz and Ciller, resigned. The second largest party, the CHP, received 19.4% of the votes. The AKP won a landslide victory in the parliament, taking nearly two-thirds of the seats. Erdogan could not become Prime Minister as he was still banned from politics by the judiciary for his speech in Siirt. Gul became the Prime Minister instead. In December 2002, the Supreme Election Board canceled the general election results from Siirt due to voting irregularities and scheduled a new election for 9 February 2003. By this time, party leader Erdogan was able to run for parliament due to a legal change made possible by the opposition Republican People's Party. The AKP duly listed Erdogan as a candidate for the rescheduled election, which he won, becoming Prime Minister after Gul handed over the post. On 14 April 2007, an estimated 300,000 people marched in Ankara to protest against the possible candidacy of Erdogan in the 2007 presidential election, afraid that if elected as President, he would alter the secular nature of the Turkish state. Erdogan announced on 24 April 2007 that the party had nominated Abdullah Gul as the AKP candidate in the presidential election. The protests continued over the next several weeks, with over one million people reported to have turned out at a 29 April rally in Istanbul, tens of thousands at separate protests on 4 May in Manisa and Canakkale, and one million in Izmir on 13 May. The stage of the elections of 2007 was set for a fight for legitimacy in the eyes of voters between his government and the CHP. Erdogan used the event that took place during the ill-fated Presidential elections a few months earlier as a part of the general election campaign of his party. On 22 July 2007, the AKP won an important victory over the opposition, garnering 46.7% of the popular vote. 22 July elections marked only the second time in the Republic of Turkey's history whereby an incumbent governing party won an election by increasing its share of popular support. On 14 March 2008, Turkey's Chief Prosecutor asked the country's Constitutional Court to ban Erdogan's governing party. The party escaped a ban on 30 July 2008, a year after winning 46.7% of the vote in national elections, although judges did cut the party's public funding by 50%. In the June 2011 elections, Erdogan's governing party won 327 seats (49.83% of the popular vote) making Erdogan the only prime minister in Turkey's history to win three consecutive general elections, each time receiving more votes than the previous election. The second party, the Republican People's Party (CHP), received 135 seats (25.94%), the nationalist MHP received 53 seats (13.01%), and the Independents received 35 seats (6.58%). Prime Minister Erdogan expressed multiple times that Turkey would acknowledge the mass killings of up to 1.5 million Armenians during World War I as genocide only after a thorough investigation by a joint Turkish-Armenian commission consisting of historians, archaeologists, political scientists and other experts. In 2005, Erdogan and the main opposition party leader Deniz Baykal wrote a letter to Armenian President Robert Kocharian, proposing the creation of a joint Turkish-Armenian commission. Armenian Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian rejected the offer because he asserted that the proposal itself was \\"insincere and not serious.\\" He added: \\"This issue cannot be considered at historical level with Turks, who themselves politicized the problem.\\" In December 2008, Erdogan criticised the I Apologize campaign by Turkish intellectuals to recognize the Armenian Genocide, saying, \\"I neither accept nor support this campaign. We did not commit a crime, therefore we do not need to apologise ... It will not have any benefit other than stirring up trouble, disturbing our peace and undoing the steps which have been taken.\\" In November 2009, he said, \\"it's not possible for a Muslim to commit genocide.\\" In 2011, Erdogan ordered the tearing-down of the Statue of Humanity, a Turkish-Armenian friendship monument in Kars, which was commissioned in 2006 and represented a metaphor of the rapprochement of the two countries after many years of dispute over the events of 1915. Erdogan justified the removal by stating that the monument was offensively close to the tomb of an 11th-century Islamic scholar, and that its shadow ruined the view of that site, while Kars municipality officials said it was illegally erected in a protected area. However, the former mayor of Kars who approved the original construction of the monument said the municipality was destroying not just a \\"monument to humanity\\" but \\"humanity itself\\". The demolition was not unopposed; among its detractors were several Turkish artists. Two of them, the painter Bedri Baykam and his associate, Pyramid Art Gallery general coordinator Tugba Kurtulmus, were stabbed after a meeting with other artists at the Istanbul Akatlar cultural center. On 23 April 2014, Erdogan's office issued a statement in nine languages (including two dialects of Armenian), offering condolences for the mass killings of Armenians and stating that the events of 1915 had inhumane consequences. The statement described the mass killings as the two nations' shared pain and said: \\"Having experienced events which had inhumane consequences - such as relocation - during the First World War, (it) should not prevent Turks and Armenians from establishing compassion and mutually humane attitudes among one another\\". Answer this question \\"When did this happen?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","response":"This happened on 23 April 2014, when Erdogan's office issued a statement in nine languages offering condolences for the mass killings of Armenians and acknowledging the inhumane consequences of the events of 1915."},{"question":"Choose your story that continues the following story. Katrina studied a lot more in college than Carrie. As a result, Available choices: [A]. Katrina got good grades in exams and was successful in life.; [B]. Carrie got good grades in exams and was successful in life.;","response":"[A]. Katrina got good grades in exams and was successful in life. As college life progressed, the difference in study habits between Katrina and Carrie became more and more evident. As Katrina's focus and dedication to her studies grew, so did her understanding of the material, allowing her to excel in her courses. Her grades reflected her hard work, resulting in her consistently being on the dean's list. Carrie, on the other hand, took a more relaxed approach to her studies. She preferred to spend her time socializing, attending parties, and participating in extracurricular activities. Her grades suffered as a result, putting her academic standing in jeopardy. Katrina's strong work ethic and determination didn't go unnoticed by the faculty and her peers. She became an active participant in class discussions, and her professors appreciated her keen insights and thoughtful contributions. Meanwhile, Carrie struggled to keep up with the coursework, and her lack of engagement in class did not help her connect with her professors. During her senior year, Katrina decided to take on a research project under the guidance of one of her professors. This experience allowed her to delve deeper into her field of study, and her findings were eventually published in a respected academic journal. This accomplishment boosted her credibility and propelled her to become a well-regarded figure within her chosen field. As graduation approached, the difference in career prospects for Katrina and Carrie was stark. Katrina landed a job offer from a prestigious company in her field, while Carrie struggled to find any job opportunities that aligned with her career goals. In the years that followed, Katrina continued to excel in her career, earning promotions and respect from her peers and superiors. She eventually established herself as an expert within her industry and was invited to speak at conferences, lead workshops, and serve as a mentor to young professionals entering the workforce. Carrie, on the other hand, found it difficult to break into her desired field and eventually settled for a more modest career path. While she enjoyed a relatively stable job, she couldn't help but feel unfulfilled, knowing that she hadn't reached her true potential. Despite their diverging career paths, Katrina and Carrie stayed in touch and remained close friends. Carrie often looked to Katrina for advice and guidance in her professional life. Over time, Carrie learned from Katrina's example and began to take her career more seriously, gradually improving her professional standing. In the end, Katrina's commitment to her studies during college wasn't just about getting good grades. It laid the foundation for her successful career and the opportunities that came with it. Moreover, her achievements also had a ripple effect on those around her, inspiring people like Carrie to strive for more in their own lives. This story demonstrates the importance of hard work and dedication, as well as the far-reaching impact of personal success."},{"question":"Josie started planning her new garden in the winter.

As Christian narrates, the film flashes back to one year earlier upon Christian's move to the Montmartre district of Paris to become a writer among members of the area's Bohemian movement. He soon encounters that his neighbours are a loose troupe of performers led by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (John Leguizamo). Toulouse-Lautrec and the others ask for Christian's help, and his writing skills allow them to finish their proposed show, \\"Spectacular Spectacular\\", that they wish to sell to the owner of the Moulin Rouge, Harold Zidler (Jim Broadbent). The group arrives at the Moulin Rouge as Zidler and his \\"Diamond Dog Dancers\\" perform for the audience (\\"Zidler's Rap Medley\\"). Toulouse arranges for Christian to see Satine (Nicole Kidman), the star courtesan, in her private quarters to present the work, unaware that Zidler is promising Satine to the wealthy and unscrupulous Duke of Monroth (Richard Roxburgh), a potential investor in the cabaret (\\"Sparkling Diamonds\\"). Satine mistakes Christian for the Duke, and dances with him before retiring to her private chamber with him to discuss things privately (\\"Rhythm of the Night\\", \\"Meet Me in the Red Room\\"), but soon learns he is just a writer (\\"Your Song\\"). The Duke interrupts them; Christian and Satine claim they were practicing lines for \\"Spectacular Spectacular\\".

The first item in the list is considered to have a position of 1. If no letters are found in the list, the program should return -1. Here's how you can approach this task: Step 1: Define your function that takes the list as an input. Step 2: Create an empty list to store positions of alphabet characters. Step 3: Loop over the list. You can use the enumerate() function which returns both the value and the index of each item in the list. Step 4: Inside the loop, check if the current item is an alphabet character. You can do this by using the isalpha() method which checks whether a string consists of alphabetic characters only. Step 5: If the current item is an alphabet character, add its index (or position) to the created list. Since we're considering the position of the 1st element to be 1, simply add 1 to the index value returned by enumerate(). Step 6: After the loop, check if your list storing the positions is still empty. If it is, return -1. This means there were no alphabet characters in the input list. Step 7: If there were any alphabet characters, return the list of their positions.

With the help of bassist Camus Celli , keyboarder Guy Daniel and drummer Pat Schick , guitars and keyboards played on the album . Do these sentences mean the same thing?","response":"No, these sentences do not convey the same meaning despite sharing similar information, and they can lead to confusion. Let's break down each sentence to analyze the differences. 1. Ponti played guitars and keyboards on the album, with the help of bassist Camus Celli, keyboard player Guy Daniel and drummer Pat Schick. In this sentence, the main subject is \\"Ponti\\" who played guitars and keyboards on the album. The other musicians, Camus Celli (bassist), Guy Daniel (keyboard player), and Pat Schick (drummer), are mentioned as providing support or assistance to Ponti in creating the album. The focus of the sentence is on Ponti's performance of guitars and keyboards, and the other musicians are acknowledged for their collaborative roles. 2. With the help of bassist Camus Celli, keyboarder Guy Daniel and drummer Pat Schick, guitars and keyboards played on the album. In contrast, the main subject of this sentence is not clear. The sentence appears to be focusing on the guitars and keyboards as if they are the performers instead of the musicians. The use of \\"with the help of\\" implies that Camus Celli, Guy Daniel, and Pat Schick are supporting characters, but it is not evident who the primary musician is. Moreover, the second sentence is less grammatically accurate, as it says, \\"guitars and keyboards played on the album\\" instead of mentioning the human performer. This phrasing confuses the meaning and makes it difficult to understand the sentence's intent. To conclude, the two sentences do not mean the same thing. The first sentence emphasizes Ponti's role in playing the guitars and keyboards with the assistance of other musicians, while the second sentence is ambiguous and less grammatically accurate, leading to potential confusion about the key performer and their respective roles in producing the album."},{"question":"Premise: \\"Woman in purple shirt fixes her hair in front of man with a tripod.\\" Based on this premise, can we conclude that the hypothesis \\"A woman is touching up her hair in front of a tripod.\\" is true?

The early release is part of Obama's effort to correct what he views as unreasonably long mandatory minimum sentences. The president's push to lessen the burden on nonviolent drug offenders reflects his long-stated view that the nation should remedy the consequences of decades of onerous sentencing rules, which have put tens of thousands of Americans behind bars for far too long. Among those affected by Wednesday's presidential order were 67 individuals serving life sentences - almost all for nonviolent drug crimes, although a few also were charged with firearms violations related to their drug activities. To date, Obama has granted 562 commutations, more than the previous nine presidents combined, and more clemency actions that by any other president in nearly a century. White House counsel Neil Eggleston said in the White House blog that Obama examines each clemency application on its specific merits to identify the appropriate relief, including whether the prisoner would be helped by additional drug treatment, educational programs or counseling. Presidents tend to use their powers to commute sentences or issue pardons more frequently near the end of their terms of office. Administration officials said the rapid pace will continue before Obama's leaves the White House in January 2017. \\"We are not done yet,\\" Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates said. \\"We expect that many more men and women will be given a second chance through the clemency initiative.\\" Obama has long called for phasing out strict sentences for drug offenses, arguing they lead to excessive punishment and incarceration rates unseen in other developed countries.

RSV infection was associated with the common bacterial pathogens causing AOM.

They’re not sending an Anderson Cooper or a Christiane Amanpour, intrepid journalists well-versed in geopolitics and the art of the spiel. They’re sending people like Megyn Kelly, a race-baiter who rode the wave of one semi-challenging debate question all the way to a cushy gig at NBC News, or Oliver Stone, a revisionist history buff who’s spent the past few decades cozying up to dictators like Fidel Castro, Hugo Chavez, and Putin. Yes, in addition to qualifying Hitler and claiming the Jews run the media, Stone helmed the 2014 documentary Ukraine on Fire—a bizarre slice of Kremlin propaganda alleging that the CIA orchestrated the 2014 Ukrainian revolution (based on scant evidence), and featuring cameos from Viktor Yanukovych and Putin. If that weren’t enough, in September, the JFK filmmaker posited that the Democratic National Committee hack was an inside job and not, as 17 U.S. intelligence agencies concluded, the work of Russian agents. Stone’s The Putin Interviews, a new four-part series debuting on Showtime on June 12, should thus be viewed as nothing short of hero worship; the rough equivalent of a Twihard probing Robert Pattinson or Donald Trump interrogating a tacky gold chair. The Putin Interviews, a documentary comprised of conversations with the Russian president that took place between July 2015 and February 2017, is clearly intended to humanize Putin and demonize America. In the first two parts provided to press, there are scenes of Putin feeding horses and strolling through lush gardens as string instruments sound; footage of the sexagenarian schooling men one-third of his age in hockey; and fawning Stone comments ranging from “You have a lot of discipline, Sir” to “You are a very lucky man” to “What do you bench?” OK, that last one I made up. Stone not only fails to challenge Putin, but essentially cedes him the floor, allowing the cunning ex-KGB operative to spin more than the president’s toupee in a tornado. Putin denies Russia was the aggressor in virtually every global conflict, including the invasions of Georgia and Ukraine. He champions Russia’s economy over that of the U.S., despite his GDP being a little more than half that of California’s. He even blames the Cuban Missile Crisis on the U.S. At one point Stone, in an apparent effort to name-drop one of his movies, asks Putin: “Is Wall Street actively working to destroy the Russian economy in the interests of the United States?” He shrugs it off. “Do you think the National Security Agency had gone too far in its eavesdropping?” Of course he does. Some of the director’s lame questions bear fruit in spite of themselves. When Stone asks Putin, “Do you ever have a bad day?” during a tour of the throne room, the Russian strongman giddily answers, “I’m not a woman so I don’t have bad days.” He then doubles down on the misogyny, explaining that, “There are certain natural cycles which men probably have as well, just less manifested. We are all human beings. It’s normal. But you should never lose control.” A conversation about whether gays can serve in the military in Russia leads to the Stone question: “If you’re taking a shower in a submarine with a man and you know he’s gay, do they have a problem with that?” Putin’s answer is not only homophobic, but completely bonkers. “Well, I prefer not to go to shower with him,” exclaims a cackling Putin. “Why provoke him? But you know, I’m a judo master and a SAMBO master as well. And I can tell you this, that as head of state today, I believe it’s my duty to uphold traditional values and family values. But why? Because same-sex marriages will not produce any children. God has decided, and we have to care about birth rates in our country. We have to reinforce families. But that doesn’t mean that there should be any persecutions against anyone.” The lion’s share of The Putin Interviews’ B-roll consists of news clips from RT, the propaganda arm of the Kremlin, and pro-Russia graphics. Putin admits to never having seen Dr. Strangelove, and, in the first two episodes’ most surreal sequence, the two sit down to watch Stanley Kubrick’s 1964 Cold War satire. “[Kubrick] foresaw some issues even from a technical point of view, things that make us think about real threats that exist,” Putin says in his mini-review. “The thing is that since that time, little has changed. The only difference is that the modern weapons systems have become more sophisticated, more complex. But this idea of a retaliatory weapon, and the inability to control such weapons systems, still hold true to this day. It has become even more difficult, even more dangerous.” Stone and Putin chat in various locations throughout the doc, from the halls of the Kremlin to the great outdoors. In one exchange aboard Putin’s plane, he reveals his unvarnished thoughts on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. “There is no longer an Eastern Bloc, no more Soviet Union. Therefore, why does NATO keep existing? My impression is that in order to justify its existence, NATO has a need of an external foe, there is a constant search for the foe, or some acts of provocation to name someone as an adversary,” says Putin. “Nowadays, NATO is a mere instrument of foreign policy of the U.S. It has no allies, it has only vassals. Once a country becomes a NATO member, it is hard to resist the pressures of the U.S.,” he continues. “And all of a sudden any weapon system can be placed in this country. An anti-ballistic missile system, new military bases, and if need be, new offensive systems. And what are we supposed to do? In this case we have to take countermeasures. We have to aim our missile systems at facilities that are threatening us. The situation becomes more tense. Why are we so acutely responding to the expansion of NATO? Well, as a matter of fact, we understand the value or lack thereof, and the threat of this organization. But what we’re concerned about is the following: We are concerned by the practice of how decisions are taken. I know how decisions are taken there.” Huddled inside a car with Putin behind the wheel—in what is without question the worst episode of Carpool Karaoke ever—they discuss the plight of whistleblower Edward Snowden, a former NSA contractor who was granted asylum in Russia after leaking top-secret government documents revealing a complex web of surveillance conducted by the U.S. against its allies and own citizens. Putin claims that the U.S. refused to agree to a deal years back that “stipulated for a mutual extradition of criminals,” and since “Snowden didn’t violate any [Russian] law,” and since “the U.S. has never extradited any criminals to us who have sought asylum there,” they refused to extradite Snowden back to America. While he doesn’t agree with what Snowden did, Putin refers to him as “courageous” several times and asserts, “Snowden is not a traitor. He didn’t betray the interests of his country. Nor did he transfer any information to any other country which would have been pernicious to his own country or to his own people. The only thing Snowden does he does publicly.” The 2016 U.S. presidential election is briefly mentioned during a February 2016 chat within the halls of the Kremlin, with Putin maintaining that Russia is “going to be ready to work with whoever gets elected by the people of the United States.” When he adds, “I believe nothing is going to change no matter who gets elected,” he can’t help but unleash a knowing smirk. Stone suggests that Putin could influence the U.S. election by endorsing a candidate, thereby causing his or her popularity to plummet. “Unlike many partners of ours, we never interfere within the domestic affairs of other countries,” replies Putin, smiling wide. “That is one of the principles we stick to in our work.” The Putin Interviews offer, first and foremost, a staggering display of mendacity on the part of both interviewer and interviewee. During a back and forth aboard his jet, Putin claims to have in his possession a letter from the CIA admitting that they provided technical support to the Chechens—including terrorist organizations—during the Second Chechen War. When Stone requests that he provide the letter, Putin responds, “I don’t think it would be appropriate. My words are enough.” For Oliver Stone, they most certainly are. ||||| Published on Jun 13, 2017 Fresh off of 'The Putin Interviews' in which the documentarian spent an extended period of time with the Russian President, Oliver Stone sits down to defend widespread criticism that he's been too soft on Vladimir Putin.

I think he respected me and respected my work, and he knew I would give him a fair hearing. And it wouldn’t be chopped up to pieces,” he added. In a clip shown to viewers, Stone explains to Putin his potential sway over the presidential election in the United States and Putin responds, “Unlike many partners of ours, we never interfere within the domestic affairs of other countries,” adding, “That is one of the principles we stick to in our work.” Stone responds: “Thank you sir, we will see you tomorrow. Talk about some heavier stuff.” Explaining his response, Stone said he took Putin’s remark “at face value because I’m not – this is an important point for him that he keeps insisting on it.” “No followup on that question?” Colbert wondered. “That doesn’t seem like an interview. That seems like an opportunity for him to merely propagandize,” Colbert suggested. Stone promised he presses Putin in the fourth hour of the docu, about his own election coming up in 2018, and on now-POTUS Trump, “the whole hacking thing, and cyber warfare” which the director said is “very complex” and not to be taken lightly. Colbert wondered if Stone likes Putin or trusts him, after spending so much time with him. “He is a head of state. He has his own interests of Russia. I respect him for that, and I understand why he’s doing that,” Stone answered. Calling Putin “a strong nationalist,” Stone began. “I never heard him badmouth the U.S. I heard him try to reach out and have a relationship with them. He called them ‘our partners’ repeatedly…And that was made fun of at one point, because it didn’t feel like the partnership was working both way. He really wants a partnership. There is a strong feeling he can still have a relationship with the US. That I felt very genuine about that.” Later, Stone said of Putin, “I think he’s devoted to his country, and I’m amazed at his calmness, as I said, his courtesy. He never really said anything bad about anybody. And he’s really been through a lot and he’s been insulted and abused –“ That’s where Stone began to lose Colbert’s studio audience, who had been effusive in applause when he’d takenthe stage. “Abused in the press; in the media,” Stone clarified, appearing to think that would win them over. It did not. “I didn’t sense any kind of anger about that,” Stone said of Putin’s “abuse” in the press. “Any thing about him negative you found? Or, does he have your dog in a cage someplace?” Colbert joked, the studio audience erupted in approval. “What is wrong with détente with Russia?” Stone asked. “Why would you be against it? I don’t understand this mentality of — may be it’s because you hate Trump.” “Hate is a strong word,” Colbert interrupted. “I don’t trust him.” “You don’t trust him, therefore Russia is convenient as an excuse –” Stone plowed ahead. “I don’t understand why our president will never say anything negative about Vladimir Putin, given that Putin is an oppressive leader of his country, who suppressed the free press and arrests his enemies,” Colbert interrupted again. “And that is not something that I, as an American, or a member of the press, can respect. And I’m surprised that you do respect that.” Replied Stone: “You know I’ve always been for free speech.” Colbert let that go, instead pointing out, “He doesn’t seem like he would be a hero of that.” “No question he’s a social conservative,” Stone conceded. “I don’t know why you’re laughing,” he added, addressing the studio audience. Because, of course, they were laughing at his remark. “That seems like a mild description” of Putin, Colbert laughter-translated. “I think if you watch patiently, you’ll see that it’s developed, it is a film that has a flow, from 2000 all the way up to 2016,” Stone said of the docu, debuting on Showtime. “We went back… to talk to him seriously about the election. It’s all done in that vein, and everything is above board.” “Has he murdered a man? I wouldn’t know how to ask him that question,” Stone said, in maybe the most revealing moment of his sit-down with Colbert. “I’ve looked at the evidence too. If I believed it I’d go after it.” For a second time, Colbert let it go, thanking Stone for being his guest. ||||| Write a summary.","response":"This is a really long story, sweetheart. Let me break it down for you. There's this man named Oliver Stone. He is a man who makes movies and he decided to make a four-part series about the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin. Some people are upset because they think Oliver Stone is being too nice to Putin, who has done bad things. Imagine if you did something naughty, like writing on the walls, and I only asked you about your favorite color or toy. Some people might think I'm ignoring the naughty things you did. That's why some people are upset with Oliver Stone. But Oliver says that he was polite to Putin because it took him two years to get all the chats he had with the Russian President. And that Putin is a very busy man who works many hours a day for many years. Some of the things they talked about were serious, like the U.S. elections, Russia's relations with other countries, and even the privacy of certain people. Oliver said he respects Putin because he cares about his country, Russia. But some people, including a funny man on TV named Stephen Colbert, don't agree with Oliver. Stephen said that he can't respect Putin because Putin doesn't allow people in Russia to express their feelings freely or criticize him. He doesn't trust Putin and is surprised that Oliver seems to respect Putin. Oliver ended by asking why it's bad for America to be friends with Russia, and seems to think that people distrust Putin because they don't like the President of America, a man named Donald Trump. Stephen disagreed, saying it's because Putin is really mean and oppressive, which means he's very strict and unfair. So, to sum it all up, this story is about an argument that people are having about how a man named Oliver Stone made a movie about another man named Vladimir Putin. Some people think he was too nice to Putin and Oliver is defending what he did. Does that make a bit more sense, honey?"},{"question":"Q:Please answer the following question about this movie plot. If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\". Question: Who turned Jenny in to the gang? Movie plot title: Eden Lake Movie plot: Nursery school teacher Jenny and her boyfriend, Steve, journey to a remote lake in the wooded English countryside. Hiking to the lakeside, they meet Adam, a young boy gathering insects. Relaxing beside the lake, the setting is disrupted by delinquent teenagers and their dog, who have ridden their bicycles to a spot within a few metres of the young couple. After they sleep overnight in their tent, they find their food infested with insects and their car tire damaged by a bottle left behind by the teens. Returning to town for breakfast, Steve spots a house with the bikes he thinks belongs to the kids. When no one answers the door, he walks into the house, narrowly escaping as the surly homeowner returns. Back at the lake, Steve goes scuba diving while Jenny sleeps on the shore. Steve returns to find the bag with their car keys, phone and wallet is missing, soon confirming that their car is gone. Returning to town on foot, they avoid collision with their car, driven recklessly through the woods by the gang's leader, Brett. Finding the gang in the woods after nightfall, Steve demands the return of his belongings, only to be attacked by the knife wielding teens. In the scuffle, Brett's dog is mortally knifed, fuelling Brett's lust for revenge. The couple grab their keys and drive off, but the gang attacks with stones and Steve crashes in the dark forest. Steve is trapped and Jenny runs for help. At daybreak, Jenny sees Steve tied up in barbed wire in a small clearing. Brett forces each (reluctant) teen to torture Steve while female gang member (and Brett's psychopathic equivalent) Paige records it on her phone, so that they now have no choice but to kill him. The gang spots Jenny and gives chase, giving Steve time to free himself. Jenny evades the gang and finds Steve, unable to nurse his many deep wounds and finds an engagement ring, leading Steve to propose even as he is in severe pain. After Jenny again heads off for help, she injures her foot on a large spike, her scream attracting the gang. She soon runs into... A:","response":"In the movie plot of Eden Lake, it is not explicitly mentioned who turned Jenny in to the gang. However, it can be inferred that the gang found her on their own while searching for her, following the scream she let out after injuring her foot on a large spike. This scream likely alerted the gang to her location, leading them to pursue and find her."},{"question":"Review: This movie blows - let's get that straight right now. There are a few scene gems nestled inside this pile of crap but none can redeem the limp plot. Colin Farrel looks like Brad Pitt in \\"12 Monkeys\\" and acts in a similar manner. I normally hate Colin because he is a fairy in general but he's OK in this movie. There were two plot lines in this movie-= one about a kid who throws rocks through windshields of moving vehicles and the other about a woman with a moustache. Let's face it- this movie has no freaking idea of what it wanted to say or where it wanted to go. THe characters story lines intertwine on some levels but are in no means worthy of being included in a script. The whole thing is weak and pointless and then there is an occasional OK scene. But overall- Don't bother unless you love irish accents so much that you can watch mediocrity and it is rescued by everyone sounding like the Lucky Charms elf -an American fetish that has catapulted some truly crappy movies to success. Now, what is this review like? pick from the following. a). negative. b). positive.","response":"This review can be categorized as a negative review.

The show documents RuPaul in the search for \\"America's next drag superstar.\\" RuPaul plays the role of host, mentor, and head judge for this series, as contestants are given different challenges each week. RuPaul's Drag Race employs a panel of judges, including RuPaul, Michelle Visage, Ross Mathews, Carson Kressley, and a host of other guest judges, who critique contestants' progress throughout the competition. Context: The first season of Drag Race was accompanied by a seven-episode web series, titled Under the Hood of RuPaul's Drag Race. LOGOonline published a webisode of Under the Hood after each episode of Drag Race. In this companion series, RuPaul presents a documentary of contestants' conversation in the green room, replays pertinent moments from Drag Race, and airs deleted footage. Starting with the second season of Drag Race in 2010, Logo reformatted Under the Hood, increased its production budget, moved it from the web to television, and re-titled it to RuPaul's Drag Race: Untucked. Logo broadcast an episode of Untucked after each episode of Drag Race. Untucked replaces the basic green room of Under the Hood with two decorated rooms that were until season 6 sponsored by Absolut Vodka and Interior Illusions, Inc.: the Interior Illusions Lounge and the Gold Bar. FormDecor sponsored the Lounge for season 6. These two backstage areas allow for separated group conversation. At the start of the seventh season of the Drag Race, Untucked reverted to a webseries, as part of the World of Wonder YouTube page. Instead of two decorated rooms, Untucked was moved back to the one room, an empty backstage space that connects to the main stage and work room, with couches for contestants to chat on. The newly renovated version also follows contestants following their elimination from the show, documenting them packing their belongings and leaving the set. The webseries format continued for the eighth and ninth season. For the show's tenth season, Untucked returned to television. Question: Were there prizes? Answer:","response":"Yes, there were prizes for the contestants of RuPaul's Drag Race. The winners of the competition typically receive a cash prize, among other prizes like makeup supplies, clothing, and even vacations. The cash prizes have varied from season to season, but they often range from 20,000 to 100,000. In addition to the grand prize for the overall winner, contestants may also win smaller prizes for winning individual challenges during each episode."},{"question":"In week 12, the Lions flew east for another battle of division leaders, this time with the AFC East's 8-2 New England Patriots.

Solve this problem.","response":"Okay, let's solve this little problem step by step. We want to find out the value of 'o'. Here's how we do it: 1. First, look at the equation: -32159 * o = -32172 * o + 104 2. Now, see that there is -32172 * o on one side. Move it to the other side, and it will become +32172 * o (it changes its sign when moved to the other side). So now we have: (-32159 * o) + (32172 * o) = 104. 3.

This esteem and prestige was based on both precedent and custom, as well as the caliber and reputation of the senators. The senate passed decrees, which were called senatus consulta. These were officially \\"advice\\" from the senate to a magistrate. In practice, however, they were usually followed by the magistrates. The focus of the Roman senate was usually directed towards foreign policy. Though it technically had no official role in the management of military conflict, the senate ultimately was the force that oversaw such affairs. The power of the senate expanded over time as the power of the legislative assemblies declined, and the senate took a greater role in ordinary law-making. Its members were usually appointed by Roman Censors, who ordinarily selected newly elected magistrates for membership in the senate, making the senate a partially elected body. During times of military emergency, such as the civil wars of the 1st century BC, this practice became less prevalent, as the Roman Dictator, Triumvir or the senate itself would select its members. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Who was responsible for overseeing a military action?","response":"Okay little buddy, imagine the Roman Senate like a big group of people who help make important decisions about what the country should do. They're kind of like older brothers and sisters giving advice to someone younger. Even though they don't actually control the army, they still help make choices about battles and stuff like that. Now, sometimes there was a person called a \\"magistrate\\" who would usually listen to the advice the Senate gave them and decide what to do in a battle. But other times, during really big, scary fights (like a civil war), people like Roman Dictators or Triumvirs would be the ones to pick who gets to be in the Senate and make decisions about the army. So, to answer your question, different people like magistrates, dictators, or triumvirs could be responsible for overseeing military actions, but the Roman Senate would often give them advice on what to do."},{"question":"Answer the following question: What type of details about graeme crossman can be gathered from the following bio?

Theodore Honey, an eccentric \\"boffin\\" with the Royal Aircraft Establishment, is working on solving a difficult aviation crash problem. A widower with a 12-year-old daughter, Elspeth, Honey is sent from Farnborough to investigate the crash of a Rutland Reindeer airliner in Labrador, Canada. He theorizes the accident happened because of the tailplane's structural failure, caused by sudden metal fatigue after 1440 flight hours. To test the theory in his laboratory, a rear airframe is being vibrated at a very high rate in daily eight-hour cycles. It is not until Honey finds himself on board a Reindeer airliner that he realizes he is flying on an early production aircraft that is close to the number of hours his theory projects for the metal fatigue failure. Despite the fact that his theory is not yet proven, he decides to warn the aircrew and Hollywood actress Monica Teasdale, a fellow passenger. After the Reindeer safely lands at Gander Airport in Newfoundland, an inspection clears the aircraft to continue on its route. Honey then takes drastic action to stop the flight by activating the Reindeer's undercarriage lever, dropping the airliner on its belly and seriously damaging it. Shocked by the act, some of his colleagues demand that he be declared insane to discredit his unproved theory and save the reputation of British passenger aviation now awash in a sea of bad press. Teasdale and an airline stewardess Marjorie Corder both take a liking to Mr. Honey and Elspeth, who they discover is lonely and isolated from her schoolmates. Teasdale speaks to Honey's superiors on his behalf, claiming she believes in him. Corder, meanwhile, has stayed on with Honey and his daughter as a nurse. Having now observed Honey's many qualities beyond his minor eccentricities, and after becoming very close to Elspeth, she decides to make the arrangement permanent by marrying the engineer.

Thutob ascended to the throne succeeding his half - brother Sidkeong Namgyal who died issueless . Differences between the Nepalese settlers and the indigenous population during his reign led to the direct intervention of the British , who were the de facto rulers of the Himalayan nation . The British ruled in favour of the Nepalese much to the discontent of the chogyal , who then retreated to the Chumbi Valley and allied himself with the Tibetans . The British sent a military force ( Sikkim Expedition ) , and after a series of skirmishes between the Tibetans and the British near Jelep La , the Tibetans were pushed back and the Chogyal was put under the supervision of John Claude White , who had been appointed Political Officer in 1889 .

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect","response":"Climate change can have a significant impact on the formation of sedimentary rocks, depending on the specific changes that take place. The effects can be more, less, or even no influence, depending on the nature of the climate change. Here's how different climate change scenarios can affect sedimentary rock formation: 1. More effect: If climate change causes an increase in precipitation and/or more extreme weather events such as storms and hurricanes, there will likely be more erosion of rocks due to the enhanced wind and water activity. This would result in an increased amount of sediment being picked up and transported by wind, water, air, or ice. Consequently, more sediment would be deposited in areas, leading to a higher rate of sedimentary rock formation as the sediment layers are compressed under the weight of new deposits. 2. Less effect: Conversely, if climate change results in a decrease in precipitation, reduced water and wind erosion would lead to less sediment being generated and transported. In areas where ice plays a significant role in transporting sediment, climate change may also cause the melting of glaciers and ice sheets, resulting in a decrease in sediment carrying capacity. Ultimately, this would lead to a reduced rate of sedimentary rock formation due to less sediment deposition and compression. 3. No effect: In some cases, climate change may not have a significant impact on sedimentary rock formation. This could occur in regions where the changes in temperature and precipitation do not drastically alter the erosion rates or the transportation and deposition of sediment. In these cases, the formation of sedimentary rocks would continue at a similar pace, regardless of climate change. In summary, the impact of climate change on sedimentary rock formation can be more, less, or no effect depending on the specific changes to precipitation, temperature, or other aspects of the climate. Changes in precipitation patterns and the intensity of erosive forces like wind and water tend to have the most significant influence on the formation of sedimentary rocks."},{"question":"Given the following question, let's solve step-by-step.

The increased bombing is the latest evidence the 17-year-old war in Afghanistan is significantly intensifying since U.S. President Donald Trump announced his new military strategy for the country in August. Coalition planes dropped 1,186 weapons on Afghanistan during the first three months of 2018, according to figures released by U.S. Air Forces Central Command. The previous record (1,083) was set during the height of the war in 2011. The U.S. has not released 2001 to 2003 airstrike data. Those figures do not include activity by the Afghan Air Force (AAF), which has stepped up its aerial bombardment since gaining the ability to conduct airstrikes two years ago. The AAF carries out between 4 to 12 airstrikes every day, according to the Afghan Ministry of Defense. If recent trends are any indication, 2018 is likely to get even more violent. Fighting traditionally picks up during the warmer months, and the coalition has expanded its bombing campaign against the Islamic State group, as well as narcotic labs and other Taliban revenue sources. But there is little indication the expanded airstrikes are helping end the conflict, says Thomas Johnson, an Afghanistan specialist who teaches national security affairs at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California. \\"It's basically a tactic of desperation,\\" said Johnson, author of Taliban Narratives: The Use of Power and Stories in the Afghanistan Conflict. \\"There's never been an insurgency in history that's been defeated purely through air power.\\" Even high-level U.S. military officials concede the conflict remains a stalemate. According to the latest U.S. military estimate, the Afghan government controls 56 percent of Afghanistan's districts, with insurgents controlling or contesting the rest. Insurgent attacks also have continued. Nearly 60 people died Sunday when an Islamic State... Question: What will Afghanistan probably due to the US due to airstrikes? === The answer to the above question is Options: I. will love Trump; II. have increased tensions with them; III. will say it's okay and obey; IV. not enough information; The answer is:","response":"II. have increased tensions with them; The increased airstrikes by the U.S.-led coalition in Afghanistan during the first quarter of 2018 have undoubtedly had a significant impact on the country, its people, and the ongoing conflict with the Taliban and other insurgent groups such as the Islamic State. As a result, it is highly likely that Afghanistan will experience increased tensions with the United States and other coalition countries due to the escalated bombings. The reasoning behind this anticipated increase in tensions can be attributed to several factors: 1. Civilian casualties and collateral damage: With the record number of airstrikes being conducted, the probability of civilian casualties and infrastructure damage is higher, leading to potential resentment and anger among the Afghan population. Civilian casualties undoubtedly fuel dissatisfaction and mistrust, not only with the foreign forces but also with the Afghan government, which is seen as allowing and tolerating these bombings. 2. Effect on the peace process: As the military strategy intensifies, the possibility of reaching a negotiated peace settlement between the Afghan government and insurgent groups may be negatively affected. The increased bombings could cause these groups to become more aggressive and less willing to engage in peace talks. 3. Ineffectiveness of airstrikes alone: As mentioned by Thomas Johnson, an Afghanistan specialist, there has never been an insurgency in history defeated solely through air power. Relying primarily on airstrikes will not resolve the conflict in Afghanistan, and it may lead to a perception among Afghans that the coalition forces are not genuinely committed to finding a lasting and effective solution. 4. Perception of foreign interference: The escalating airstrikes will likely contribute to the ongoing narrative concerning foreign interference in Afghanistan's internal affairs. As in other countries, such perceptions can easily foster anti-American sentiment, undermining the U.S.'s long-term goals and objectives in the region. In conclusion, the increased airstrikes in Afghanistan by the U.S.-led coalition during the first quarter of 2018 are expected to have a notable impact on the relationship between Afghanistan and the United States. It is most likely that these bombings will lead to increased tensions between the two countries, particularly if civilian casualties and collateral damage continue to rise without significant progress made towards a lasting peace."},{"question":"Translate the following sentence to Turkish: Current law recognises a single religious community for people of a particular denomination.","response":"Step 1: Understand the sentence structure and meaning In this sentence, we are stating that according to the current law, a single religious community is recognized for people who belong to a specific denomination.

Continuation of the text: As they walked together towards the spring house, Chris couldn't help but steal glances at her. Her presence had always had a profound effect on him, making him feel both nervous and inexplicably drawn to her. The sun was setting, casting a warm, golden hue across the land, and he couldn't help but think that it perfectly suited her radiance. The spring house was nestled amongst a grove of trees, a small and charming building that had seen its fair share of years gone by. Chris, having never been there before, was struck by the beauty of the location and couldn't help but agree with her earlier statement - this truly was a treat. As they entered, a cool, refreshing air greeted them from the natural spring within. She skillfully collected the milk they needed, and Chris was mesmerized by how at ease she seemed in this serene environment. He thought to himself how much he wished he could be more like her, confident and kind in any situation - never faltering. With the milk in hand, they made their way back to the house, and Chris knew this experience would forever be etched in his memory - a simple task made unforgettable by her enchanting presence. And as he lay in bed that night, he thought of her, and his heart soared with both hope and longing."},{"question":"Definition: You will be given a text in the Russian language, and you should classify the given input text to one of the emotion labels from this list of emotion labels- ['joy', 'sadness', 'surprise', 'fear', 'anger'].

UPDATED:. 05:07 EST, 9 April 2013. A man went berserk and stabbed his fiancée because of the stress of trying to win a £25,000 ‘dream wedding’ contest, a court heard yesterday. Lee Rowlands and Madelaine Moir, both 37, were one of five couples in the competition final who were attempting to win the prize by raising the most money for charity in a week. They were working 20 hours a day to try to raise the money when Rowlands suffered a ‘psychotic episode.’ He allegedly began hearing voices and attacked Miss Moir with two kitchen knives as she cowered on the floor. Strain: Lee Rowlands, right, and his fiancée Madelaine Moir, he he attacked with two kitchen knives during a psychotic episode while desperately trying to win a radio competition for a 'Dream Wedding' She was wounded on her breast, arm, fingers and knee and he ran into the street believing he had killed her, Sheffield Crown Court was told. Yesterday Rowlands was jailed for 28 months after admitting unlawful wounding. He will be released in a few weeks because he has been in custody for 13 months and would have been automatically freed at the halfway point of his sentence. Miss Moir is said to have stood by him and they still hope to get married. The couple had been together for two years before the attack on March 14 last year. They entered the competition run by Sheffield-based independent radio station Hallam FM in the hope of winning the £25,000 wedding package, including a honeymoon in Sri Lanka, venue hire, dress, flowers and photographer. In her application Miss Moir wrote: ‘We wish we had met years ago, we love each other and want to shout it to the world.’ Stand by your man: Miss Moir arrives at Sheffield Crown Court to see Rowlands sentenced. The pair still hope to marry one day. Alison Dorrell, prosecuting, said the couple had a happy relationship and Rowlands had become the father figure to the divorcee’s two children. But Miss Moir had noticed her partner’s heart beating irregularly and he began to speak about hearing voices. He also threatened to jump out of the window and harm himself. During the 25-minute ‘episode’ Rowlands attacked his fiancée with two kitchen knives at their home in Armthorpe, Doncaster. He then ran outside in his boxer shorts ‘saying he had killed her’. Rowlands was found by police sobbing in the street. Miss Dorrell said: ‘He was making no sense at all.’ Miss Moir needed hospital treatment and later had surgery on a finger injury. She said later she didn’t recognise the man who attacked her. ‘He wasn’t himself and she was of the view that he didn’t want to hurt her and he wasn’t thinking rationally,’ said Miss Dorrell. Miss Moir wrote in her victim statement: ‘We never argued. This is why I can’t say what happened. It is as if somebody else had taken over his body.’ The court heard she had helped turn Rowlands’ life around. He had served time in jail, and they entered the wedding contest because he was desperate to prove himself. Richard Barradell, defending, said the couple aimed to raise £2,000 each a day to win the wedding prize. However, it became clear ‘things were getting to Lee Rowlands’. Mr Barradell said ‘something snapped’ and Rowlands had a ‘psychotic mental breakdown of rapid onset’. ‘He is desperately sorry for what he did. He can’t explain it.’ Judge Robert Moore said Rowlands had been receiving mental health treatment and his release in a few weeks under licence would enable him to continue his rehabilitation.

The President and the Vice President The President was seated in a classroom when, at 9:05, Andrew Card whispered to him: \\"A second plane hit the second tower. America is under attack.\\" The President told us his instinct was to project calm, not to have the country see an excited reaction at a moment of crisis. The press was standing behind the children; he saw their phones and pagers start to ring. The President felt he should project strength and calm until he could better understand what was happening. The President remained in the classroom for another five to seven minutes, while the children continued reading.

Many educators today are looking for evidence to support the case for homework, but are coming up empty-handed. Mary Jane Cera is the academic administrator for the Kino School, and she maintains a no-homework policy across all grades. The purpose of the policy is to make sure learning remains a joy, not a thing that discourages social time and creative activity. At the Kino school, Cera says children often choose to take their favorite parts of school home. \\"A lot of what we see kids doing is practicing music with their friends, and taking experiments home to show their parents,\\" she says. Surveys of Kino graduates suggest that the early control they are given over their education continues to serve them well into college. \\"One of the reasons that we continue to assign much homework is our obsession with tests, although we can agree on the importance of kids doing better on tests through proper homework to some degree,\\"says author Alfie Kohn. In his book The Homework Myth, Kohn points out that no study has ever found a relation between homework and academic achievement and that if kids have no choice in the matter of homework, they're not really exercising judgment, and are instead losing their sense of self-control. However, many supporters of homework argue that life is filled with things we don't like to do, and that homework teaches self-discipline, time management and other non-academic life skills. Wherever the homework debate goes next, it's worth taking a moment to examine if we're doing the right thing about our children's education. The good news is -- it's never too late to start. Answer:","response":"Which statement aligns with the Kino School's no-homework policy? A) The policy was implemented because students were underperforming.

Explanation: The Kino School has a no-homework policy to ensure that learning remains a joy, instead of discouraging social time and creative activities. As mentioned in the article, children at Kino School often choose to take their favorite parts of school home, such as practicing music with friends or taking experiments home to show their parents.

Context: Earlier this year my depression got very bad, very quickly. I’d been having intrusive suicidal thoughts for a while. It was a combination of a bad medication regimen and lots of little stressors—school, work, a car accident, you name it. I took to a very private social media account that only those I was closest to could see. I used that account to rant about my problems. It was my coping mechanism and how I kept myself sane. Somehow just typing it out got it off my chest in ways writing in a journal couldn’t (now, I try to use Quora for this purpose instead). One night in early March I went to a performance that my friends were part of. I went alone. While I was there, I got a series of texts regarding my girlfriend. I knew that what those texts said would cause me an immense amount of stress and sleepless nights. I went onto my social media account. I don’t remember exactly what I posted. It wasn’t specific, but rather something along the lines of “I’m stressed, this is the cherry on top, I honestly don’t know how I’m going to handle this.” Whatever it was, someone who followed that account knew I was at my breaking point. They called an anonymous tip line and reported that they believed I was in danger of killing myself. I got home from the performance at midnight and my dad was in my driveway. I asked him why. He told me he’d been contacted and that someone reported a concern about me. I was admitted to the hospital the next day, and I spent a week an an inpatient psychiatric unit where I received better medication, therapy and coaching on positive coping mechanisms.

Monoamniotic twins are always identical, always monochorionic and are usually termed Monoamniotic-Monochorionic (\`\`MoMo'' or \`\`Mono Mono'') twins. They also share the placenta, but have two separate umbilical cords. Monoamniotic twins develop when an embryo does not split until after formation of the amniotic sac, at about 9-13 days after fertilization. Monoamniotic triplets or other monoamniotic multiples are possible, but extremely rare. Other obscure possibilities include multiples sets where monoamniotic twins are part of a larger gestation such as triplets, quadruplets, or more. Can we conclude that can there be twins in one yolk sac?","response":"Based on the information about monoamniotic twins, it is important to differentiate between amniotic sacs and yolk sacs as they serve different purposes during pregnancy. Monoamniotic twins, as explained earlier, share the same amniotic sac but have separate umbilical cords. However, the question of whether twins can be in one yolk sac addresses a different aspect of pregnancy and development. The yolk sac forms early during pregnancy and plays a crucial role in providing nutrition to the developing embryo before the placenta is fully formed. Once the placenta takes over, the yolk sac is no longer needed and is gradually absorbed. In the case of twins or higher-order multiples, the development scenario can vary: 1. Dichorionic-Diamniotic (DiDi) twins: These twins have separate placentas, separate amniotic sacs, and separate yolk sacs. These can be either identical (if the split occurs within 72 hours of fertilization) or fraternal twins. 2. Monochorionic-Diamniotic (MoDi) twins: These identical twins share a placenta but have separate amniotic sacs and separate yolk sacs. The embryo splits between 4-8 days after fertilization. 3. Monochorionic-Monoamniotic (MoMo) twins: As discussed earlier, these identical twins share both the amniotic sac and the placenta but have two separate umbilical cords. The embryo splits between 9-13 days after fertilization. Regarding the possibility of twins sharing a yolk sac, it is extremely rare, and there's limited literature discussing this scenario. It is generally considered that each embryo has its own yolk sac for nourishment during early development. In some twin pregnancies, two separate yolk sacs can be seen within the gestational sac. This can be observed during early ultrasound assessments and usually indicates the presence of monochorionic-diamniotic or dichorionic-diamniotic twins. In summary, while it is extremely rare for twins to share a single yolk sac, it cannot be completely ruled out due to the complexity and variability of multiple gestations. Nonetheless, it is more common for each twin or embryo to have its own yolk sac during early development."},{"question":"Monique Brumby (born 16 September 1974, Devonport) is an Australian Indie pop/rock singer-songwriter, guitarist and producer.

A high moisture content usually prevents ignition and slows propagation, because higher temperatures are needed to evaporate any water in the material and heat the material to its fire point. Dense forests usually provide more shade, resulting in lower ambient temperatures and greater humidity, and are therefore less susceptible to wildfires. Less dense material such as grasses and leaves are easier to ignite because they contain less water than denser material such as branches and trunks. Plants continuously lose water by evapotranspiration, but water loss is usually balanced by water absorbed from the soil, humidity, or rain. When this balance is not maintained, plants dry out and are therefore more flammable, often a consequence of droughts.A wildfire front is the portion sustaining continuous flaming combustion, where unburned material meets active flames, or the smoldering transition between unburned and burned material. As the front approaches, the fire heats both the surrounding air and woody material through convection and thermal radiation. First, wood is dried as water is vaporized at a temperature of 100 °C (212 °F). Next, the pyrolysis of wood at 230 °C (450 °F) releases flammable gases. Finally, wood can smoulder at 380 °C (720 °F) or, when heated sufficiently, ignite at 590 °C (1,000 °F). Even before the flames of a wildfire arrive at a particular location, heat transfer from the wildfire front warms the air to 800 °C (1,470 °F), which pre-heats and dries flammable materials, causing materials to ignite faster and allowing the fire to spread faster. High-temperature and long-duration surface wildfires may encourage flashover or torching: the drying of tree canopies and their subsequent ignition from... Now, I have a new situation: Near the city of Middleton, there are two forests. The Trine forest is a forest tightly packed with trees. Trine has hardly any large open spaces on the ground. The Jimpy forest, on the other hand, is much more open. It has some large areas in the forest that are perfect for camping or for children to play in due to the lack of trees. Answer this question please: Which forest provides more shade? Answer:","response":"The Trine forest provides more shade. This can be inferred based on the given information: 1. Trine forest is tightly packed with trees, meaning there are more trees in close proximity, creating a dense canopy that blocks sunlight. 2. The dense canopy of trees in Trine forest results in lower ambient temperatures and increased humidity as mentioned, which also implies more shade is provided in comparison to the more open Jimpy forest. 3. Jimpy forest has large areas with a lack of trees, making it less dense and providing less shade overall. In conclusion, the Trine forest, with its densely packed trees, provides more shade than the more open Jimpy forest."},{"question":"Data: name = The Punter, priceRange = more than £30, area = riverside, familyFriendly = yes, near = The Portland Arms.

To begin to appreciate the role of oxygen inside your body, think about when your breathing rate increases: climbing a steep slope, running a race, or skating a shift in a hockey game. Respiration rate correlates with energy use, and that correlation reflects the link between oxygen and energy metabolism. For this reason, the chemical process inside your cells that consume oxygen to produce usable energy is known as cellular respiration . During this process, energy is converted from glucose , in the presence of oxygen, into numerous ATP molecules. The glucose, of course, comes from the food you eat. In biological terms, you do not eat because you are hungry, you eat to get energy. Other heterotrophic organisms also acquire glucose from other organisms, whereas autotrophic organisms make their own glucose, mostly through photosynthesis. Bob is a biologist. Today, he has four samples of organisms to test, sample A, sample B, sample C, and sample D. He induced higher respiration rate in sample A. Then he induced no respiration rate in sample B. Next, he classified sample C as heterotrophic and sample D as autotrophic. In which organism ATP molecules would be produced, sample A or sample B? Answer:","response":"ATP molecules would be produced in sample A. To understand why ATP molecules would be produced in sample A and not in sample B, we need to consider the conditions set by Bob and the process of cellular respiration. Sample A has a higher respiration rate, while sample B has no respiration rate induced. Cellular respiration is essential for all living organisms because it is the process by which cells generate ATP molecules, serving as the primary energy currency for various cellular activities. This process occurs in three main stages: glycolysis, the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle), and the electron transport chain. Oxygen plays a crucial role in cellular respiration, particularly in the last stage, the electron transport chain, where it accepts electrons and combines with hydrogen ions to form water, thus enabling the production of ATP molecules. In sample A, the higher respiration rate indicates an increased consumption of oxygen. This increased oxygen demand occurs to meet the energy requirement during periods of heightened cellular activities. As a result, more oxygen is consumed, enabling more efficient completion of the electron transport chain and leading to the production of a larger number of ATP molecules. In contrast, sample B has no induced respiration rate, meaning that oxygen consumption is minimal or non-existent in this case. This absence of oxygen consumption disrupts the electron transport chain, effectively halting the production of ATP molecules. Consequently, sample B is unable to produce the energy needed to fuel cellular activities. Taking into account the information provided regarding sample A and sample B, it is evident that ATP molecules would be produced in sample A, where there is a higher respiration rate. This increased rate enables efficient cellular respiration, allowing for the production of energy in the form of ATP molecules. On the other hand, sample B, with its lack of induced respiration, is unable to generate ATP and thus cannot produce energy for cellular activities."},{"question":"Scotland Yard chief Bernard Hogan Howe said it was time for the police to get a pay rise. Britain's top cop Bernard Hogan Howe has said it is time for the police to get a pay rise. The Scotland Yard chief said police officers had been hit by years of pay freezes and had seen their standard of living deteriorate 'like everybody else'. His remarks came in response to David Cameron's call for businesses to hand their staff a pay rise in a major speech today. Sir Bernard, appearing on LBC radio this morning, was also grilled on Scotland Yard's battle to combat terrorism. But the Scotland Yard chief was left red-faced after forgetting the number of the anti-terror hotline set up for people to report their concerns about extremism. It came after he was asked by a caller what he made of the Prime Minister's urge for pay rises. The Metropolitan Police Commissioner said: 'I think it's a very good idea, particularly for police officers.' He added: 'I think the point he is making … is that as business costs reduce through fuel and other things, our interest rates down that some of the profits that have been made should be shared with their staff. 'Well I don't suppose that applies to the police but it's certainly true that our officers and staff have seen fixed salaries now for a number of years and like everyone else has seen their standard of living deteriorate. 'So anything that would help them I support. And if that, if it's possible to get a pay rise of course we'd support it.' Sir Bernard said the police had only received a below-inflation 1 per cent pay rise last year after 'two to three years of a pay freeze' following the 2008 recession. He added: 'I think it would be helpful, particularly with the London property market, to make sure that you know our officers are properly rewarded.' The police chief's intervention came after Mr Cameron urged booming businesses to pass on their profits in bigger pay cheques to their staff. In an attempt to create an election feed-good factor, the Prime Minister insisted trading conditions in Britain have 'not been this good for a long time', and it is time employees saw wage rises after years of a squeeze living conditions. It comes as a sharp fall in oil prices is helping to fuel the fastest growth in the UK economy since before the financial crisis. The Prime Minister was accused of hypocrisy after calling for a pay rise for private sector workers, while overseeing continuing wage restraint in the public sector. Bernard Hogan Howe was left red-faced this morning after admitting he could not remember the anti-terrorism hotline number he has urged Londoners to use. The Metropolitan Police commissioner was asked to repeat the freephone number by LBC host Nick Ferrari after a former serviceman called in to say he had not seen it publicised. Sir Bernard said: 'At this second I must admit I haven't got it with me - it's an 0800 number, so it's free ... Every other time I've been in (to the LBC phone-in) I think I have actually mentioned it. 'You could argue it's an unmemorable number.' The commissioner was later informed the hotline number is 0800 789 321. He added: 'It's ascending and descending numbers. It is probably not that easy to remember - as I've just highlighted.' Latest figures show that average wages rose by 1.8 per cent in the year to November, while the CPI rate of inflation stands at just 0.5 per cent. Mr Cameron said: 'The most recent figures show that wages are already growing faster than inflation, and as the economy continues to grow it's important this continues and that everyone benefits. Put simply – it's time Britain had a pay rise.' But it comes after years of prices rising faster than pay, leaving families worse off each month. Critics accused the government of double standards, because pay in the public sector has been frozen or slated to rise by just 1 per cent. Unions claim the average wage is worth £2,500 less a year as a result of pay failing to keep pace with inflation. The TUC's general secretary Frances O'Grady dismissed Mr Cameron's call as 'no more than pre-election mood music'. She said: 'Since David Cameron became Prime Minister, the average wage is worth £2,500 less a year, the worst fall in living standards since Queen Victoria was on the throne. 'Saying it would be nice if wages went up is no more than pre-election mood music. If elected again his policies would do the opposite. 'Huge cuts would take spending back to the same share of the economy as in the 1930s. This would depress the economy and mean public sector wages would fall every year. On top of that he would make strikes almost impossible, holding back pay across every sector.' Unite general secretary Len McCluskey added: 'If Cameron was serious about giving Britain a pay rise then he'd put his money where his mouth is and immediately boost the minimum wage by at least £1.50 an hour with the promise of a living wage. Instead we have empty words, which don't put food on the table or pay the rent.' Unison's general secretary Dave Prentis said: 'If Jeremy Hunt was following David Cameron's lead, he would have implemented the NHS pay review body's recommendations in full last month.' The round-the-clock police operation to guard fugitive WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is a drain on taxpayers' money and is being reviewed, the UK's most senior officer has said. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe told LBC radio that the force is assessing its options due to the pressure the operation at the Ecuadorian embassy in London is putting on resources. He said: 'We won't talk about tactics but we are reviewing what options we have. It is sucking our resources.'

Mr Assange has been at the embassy since June 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden where he faces questions over claims of sexual assaults, which he denies. Last week Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the cost of the operation was around the £10 million mark. Australian Mr Assange came under intense scrutiny after WikiLeaks began releasing a selection of more than 250,000 classified US diplomatic cables passed to the whistle-blowing website back in 2010.

Season-ticket holders at clubs like Borussia Dortmund are paying an average of just £9 a match compared to some English fans who regularly have to part at least four or five times that amount to see their favourite team. Alarmingly, the cheapest match-day ticket price across the top four divisions of English football has increased by an average of 4.4 per cent over the last 12 months - nearly three times the rate of inflation - the BBC Price of Football survey revealed. English football fans are flocking to places like Dortmund due to the increase in Premier League tickets. Dortmund's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang celebrates during the Champions League match against Arsenal. The cheapest match ticket across all four English divisions has increased by an average of 4.4 per cent over the last month - nearly three times the rate of inflation. A large number of football fans in England regularly have to pay upwards of £40 to see their club in action. Arsenal £2,013. Tottenham £1,895. Chelsea £1,250. Manchester United £950. Queens Park Rangers £949. West Ham £940. Liverpool £869. Manchester City £860. Southampton £853. Leicester City £730. Crystal Palace £720. Everton £719. Newcastle United £710. Burnley £685. Aston Villa £615. Stoke City £609. Hull City £574. Sunderland £525. Swansea City £499. West Brom £449. Source: BBC Price of Football survey 2014.

Burnley £42. Crystal Palace £40. Sunderland £40. West Bromwich £39. Source: BBC Price of Football survey 2014. Add the price of food and travel to the initial cost of the matchday ticket and the overall total of following a Premier League team can easily reach three figures for many supporters. Astonishingly, fans can fly out and enjoy a weekend trip to watch one of Europe's powerhouses for roughly the same price it costs to purchase a ticket to a Premier League game. 'We jump on the Channel Tunnel train,' one fan told the BBC. 'We make a weekend of it. With tickets, accommodation, transport, this trip will cost £65. When you think it cost me £51 to see the Arsenal game last season, you can see the benefits.' Some fans can travel abroad - paying for flights, accomodation and a match ticket - for the same price it costs to watch a Premier League match. Dortmund are keen to keep their prices down for fans and even refused PUMA's request to increase the price of the club's replica shirts. While prices continue to rise, Dortmund would prefer to ask sponsors for an injection of cash rather than their loyal followers. The Bundesliga side's marketing director Carsten Cramer said: 'Why are tickets cheap? Football is part of people's lives and we want to open the doors for all of society. We need the people, they spend their hearts, their emotions with us. They are the club's most important asset.' 'What is the economic sense for the club to increase the price by 10 cents? For the overall economic success of the club it is not important to increase the price of a litre of a beer. It is still money, but not a lot to the club. But it does affect our fans, if they are spending their money match after match.' Manager Jurgen Klopp is one of Dortmund's main attractions and has been with the club for the last six years.

Title: Blind Dating Movie plot: Danny Valdessecchi (Chris Pine) is an intelligent, handsome, charming boy who happens to be blind. Having been blind from birth, he volunteers for a risky experimental visual prosthesis that may restore his sightâhaving a microchip installed in the visual cortex of his brain that connects to a camera that would give him only, at best, fuzzy black and white images. During the tests he meets a beautiful Indian nurse, Leeza (Anjali Jay). Meanwhile, because Danny is a virgin at 22, his brother Larry (Eddie Kaye Thomas), who runs a limousine service, gets him a string of hilariously disastrous blind dates in between rentals. When Danny finally realizes that he is falling for Leeza, she tells him she cannot see him anymore because she has been promised in an arranged marriage. Believing that Leeza did not pursue their relationship because of his being blind, Danny becomes depressed and stops taking the necessary tests for his brain surgery. Danny's family, his eccentric psychotherapist Dr. Evans (Jane Seymour) and eye doctor Dr. Perkins (Stephen Tobolowsky) advise him to continue because it is his only chance of seeing, and soon Danny is successfully operated on.

B). the longest daylight. C). growing daylight hours. D). short daylight.","response":"D). Short daylight. On continents nearer the north pole than the south, winter months such as November see short daylight. This is because, during the winter months, the Earth is tilted away from the sun for the regions closer to the north pole. As a result, the amount of daylight experienced in these areas decreases, leading to shorter days and longer nights. The Earth's axial tilt plays a significant role in the changing amount of daylight throughout the year. The tilt causes the northern and southern hemispheres to receive varying amounts of light and warmth from the sun. When one hemisphere is tilted toward the sun, it experiences more direct sunlight, leading to longer days and warmer temperatures. This is referred to as summer. Conversely, when the hemisphere is tilted away from the sun, it receives less sunlight and warmth, resulting in shorter days and cooler temperatures. This is known as winter. Seasonal fluctuations in daylight also affect the other options mentioned: A). The most daylight - This occurs during the summer months for regions closer to the north pole when the Earth is tilted towards the sun. During this time, the days are longer and nights are shorter. B). The longest daylight - This statement refers to the summer solstice, which typically occurs around June 21st in the northern hemisphere. During the solstice, the Earth's northern hemisphere experiences its most extreme tilt towards the sun, resulting in the longest daylight hours of the year. C). Growing daylight hours - As the northern hemisphere transitions from winter to spring, the days gradually become longer, and daylight hours increase. This is due to the Earth's tilt changing such that the regions nearer to the north pole start receiving more sunlight. In conclusion, on continents nearer the north pole than the south, winter months such as November see short daylight because the Earth is tilted away from the sun for those regions. This results in less daylight and longer nights, causing cooler temperatures and shorter days throughout winter."},{"question":"Tweet: @MsToT definitely no REAL friends that's for sure.... Predict the sentiment of this tweet. 1). negative 2). positive","response":"1). negative This tweet has a negative sentiment because the person is saying that someone doesn't have any real friends. The other option, positive, is not the right answer because there's nothing good or friendly about saying someone doesn't have real friends. So, the correct answer is negative, like feeling sad or upset."},{"question":"Article: Give yourself at least fifteen extra minutes to make sure you have time to get your act together. The first day can already be a little bit stressful, and you’ll feel more relaxed if you’re not running around. This extra time will help you perfect your look, have enough time to eat breakfast, to have a nice shower, and do anything else you need to do to start that first day off on the right foot. It's a good idea to pack your bag the night before school, to make sure you have all the supplies you need. You'll be able to save time in the morning so you won't be rushed. You should know where your first class, or your homeroom is before you walk into the halls of your middle school. If you’re lost, however, just ask a teacher, administrator, or even an older student for help. It’s important to know where you’re headed so you don’t wander around aimlessly or miss out on something important. It’s likely you’ll go to homeroom first, where you’ll meet your homeroom teacher and will get important information about your day. Though having a plan is important, you also don’t have to worry if things don’t go as planned. Even the beginning of your first day of middle school can throw you some surprises, and that won’t be a bad thing. Though you may be feeling shy, you should do the best you can to be as nice and friendly to the new students in your classes as you can. Introduce yourself, ask them about themselves, and talk about what you think of middle school, so far. Smile and wave at people, and make them feel welcome in your presence. Don’t be intimidated by people who seem too cool or too stuck up, either. Just make an effort to be approachable and easygoing. People will be more receptive to new friendships at the beginning of the year, before too many cliques form. The sooner you talk to new people, the more likely you’ll be to connect for real. If you see a cute guy or girl, don’t be afraid to say hi. People like confidence, and you don’t have to be shy about talking to people. Though you may not think it’s cool to care, if you want to get through middle school and start off on the right foot, it’s far better to listen to your teachers, to participate when they ask questions, to take notes, and to avoid any distractions than to act like a know-it-all or like you couldn’t care less. Make an effort to be a good student and to make the most of each class you take. If you care about the material, you’ll have more fun in the process than you would if you were just sulking and waiting for the bell to ring. Though there may not be too many opportunities to participate on the first day, you should do the best you can to show that you care, even if you just ask a question about the syllabus. Make sure you show up to class on time and that you make a good impression right away. You may accidentally make a bad first impression by laughing too much or chattering with your friends even if you’re normally a good student. Unfortunately, first impressions are notoriously hard to break, so try to put your best foot forward when you step into the classroom. You don’t have to suck up to your teachers, either. Just pay attention and act like you really care and you’ll be on your way. Each middle school is different. You should get a sense of how the seating in your cafeteria works. If you can choose a new seat every day, try to plan to meet up with your friends in advance so you can sit together. If you have to choose the same table for the entire year, see if you can get together a group of people to make it work. If you don’t know many people in your new school yet, then don’t worry. Just be friendly, find some people who look nice, and ask if you can sit next to them. If you can, you should try to get to the cafeteria as early as you can. That way, you’ll be more likely to find your friends or to find a place to sit. If you want to make the most of your first day, then you should try to get through it with a big smile on your face. Don’t complain to your friends, criticize your teachers, or dread every one of your classes. Instead, try to approach everything with a “can do” attitude and don’t ever feel like people will never give you a chance. If you smile, expect only the best, and try to stick to optimistic topics, you’ll be having a much better day. Besides, people are drawn to positive people; the more upbeat you are, the easier it will be for you to make new friends. Don’t compare yourself to other people. You may feel like you’re not as good-looking or as well-dressed as some of the people in your school, but this kind of thinking is pointless and will only get you down. Remember that you have a lot to offer, too, and the well-dressed girl in your French class may have her own set of problems. Unfortunately, not every person is at his best in middle school. It’s easy to fall into cliques, to gossip, or just to judge other people you don’t really know. However, if you want to make it through your first day in a good mood, you should avoid judging anyone before you get to know him or her or even being a part of any silly gossip. You wouldn’t want people who barely know you to gossip about you, would you? You don’t know who your best friends will be yet, and you don’t want to find yourself making fun of someone who could have been your best friend if you had only given her a chance. What is a summary?","response":"A summary is a brief statement or account that covers the main points of a longer piece of writing, such as an article, book, or report. In the context of the article provided, a summary would highlight the key points and advice for having a successful first day of middle school, such as arriving early, being friendly and approachable, participating in class, maintaining a positive attitude, and refraining from judgment and gossip."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Information: - Christian democracy is a political ideology which emerged in nineteenth-century Europe under the influence of conservatism and Catholic social teaching, as well as Neo-Calvinism. It was originally conceived as a combination of traditional Catholic beliefs and modern democratic ideas, and it grew to incorporate the social teaching of other Christian denominations, such as the Lutheran Church and the Reformed Church. After World War II, the Protestant and Catholic movements of the Social Gospel and Neo-Thomism, respectively, played a role in shaping Christian democracy. Christian democracy continues to be influential in Europe and Latin America, although it is present in other parts of the world too. - The Centrist Democrat International is Christian Democrat political international. Until 2001 it was known as the Christian Democrat International (CDI) and before that the \\"Christian Democrat and People's Parties International\\" (until 1999) (this earlier name is, since October 2000, still sometimes used colloquially). It was formed in 1961 in Santiago, Chile as the \\"Christian Democrat World Union\\", building on the legacy of other Christian Democrat internationals who tried to create a Christian-inspired third way alternative to the socialist internationals; in 1982 it was renamed for the first time Christian Democrat International. The name officially changed due to the participation of groups of various faiths. It is the global international political group dedicated to the promotion of Christian democracy. Although it gathers parties from around the globe, its members are drawn principally from Europe and Latin America. Some of them are also members of the International Democrat Union (IDU), although the CDI is closer to the political centre and more communitarian than the IDU. - A European political party (formally, a political party at European level; informally a Europarty) is a type of political party organisation operating transnationally in Europe and in the institutions of the European Union. They are regulated and funded by the European Union and are usually made up of national parties, not individuals. Europarties have the exclusive right to campaign during the European elections and express themselves within the European Parliament by their affiliated political groups and their MEPs. Europarties, through coordination meetings with their affiliated heads of state and government, influence the decision-making process of the European Council. Europarties also work closely and co-ordinate with their affiliated members of the European Commission and, according to the Lisbon Treaty the Europarty that wins the European elections has the right to nominate to the European Council its candidate for President of the European Commission. - The Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) is a global inter-parliamentary institution established in 1889 by Frédéric Passy (France) and William Randal Cremer (United Kingdom). It was the first permanent forum for political multilateral negotiations. Initially, the organization was for individual parliamentarians, but has since transformed into an international organization of the parliaments of sovereign states. The national parliaments of 170 countries are members of the IPU, and 11 regional parliamentary assemblies are associate members. The IPU has permanent observer status at the United Nations General Assembly and general consultative status with the Economic and Social Council. - Santiago de Chile is the capital and largest city of Chile. It is also the center of its largest conurbation. Santiago is located in the country's central valley, at an elevation of above mean sea level. - The European People's Party (EPP) is a European political party. A transnational organisation, it is composed of other political parties, not individuals. Founded by primarily Christian democratic parties in 1976, it has since broadened its membership to include liberal-conservative parties and parties with other centre-right political perspectives. - Lorenzo Cesa (born 16 August 1951 in Arcinazzo Romano, Rome) is an Italian politician, and was elected to the Italian Chamber of Deputies in the 2006 General election representing the Union of Christian and Centre Democrats.

The Hindu-Arabic numerals, a positional numeral system, originated in India and was later transmitted to the West through the Arabs. Early Hindu numerals had only nine symbols, until 600 to 800 CE, when a symbol for zero was developed for the numeral system.

An independent Arab Kingdom of Syria was proclaimed in Damascus on March 8, 1920, in an apparent dispute with the French over the nature of its rule. This action was immediately repudiated by the British and French and the San Remo Conference was called together by the League of Nations in April 1920 to explicitly establish the mandate of the French over Syria. Shortly, the war of Syrian Arab nationalists with the French became a devastating campaign for the new proclaimed Arab Kingdom of Syria. Several violent incidents in the region initiated by Arab militias, like the Battle of Tel Hai, led to further international support of the French. The League of Nations having given the French Mandate of Syria as planned, the French General Gouraud issued an ultimatum to the Syrian government to disband its troops and submit to French control. Worried about the results of a long bloody fight with the French, King Faisal himself surrendered on July 14, 1920, but his message would not reach the general and King Faisal's defense minister Yusuf al-'Azma, who ignoring the King, led an army to Maysalun to defend Syrian Arab Kingdom from French advance. The Hashemite government of Damascus submitted reluctantly to the French ultimatum and disbanded its troops. How many months after being appointed king of Syria did Faisal surrender?","response":"To answer this question, we need to identify the dates of Faisal's appointment as king of Syria and his surrender. From the text: \\"the Syrian Congress assembled in March 1920 to declare Faisal the king of Syria\\" and \\"King Faisal himself surrendered on July 14, 1920\\". With this information, we can find the period between Faisal's appointment as king and his surrender: 1. Faisal was declared king in March 1920. 2. Faisal surrendered on July 14, 1920. Now let's calculate the number of months between these dates: - April, May, and June are the full months between March and July. - Since part of March and part of July are also included, we can approximately consider these two parts to be equivalent to another full month. Therefore, Faisal surrendered approximately 4 months after being appointed king of Syria."},{"question":"This is a correct answer to the following question about Scream 3. Yes or no?

Cust was a distinguished politician active during the politically turbulent 1760s, and his monument at Belton blames his death at the age of 51 to the \\"unusual fatigues of his office\\". His heir was created Lord Brownlow in 1776, and Belton was owned by successive Lords Brownlow for the next 200 years.In the last three decades of the 19th century the 3rd Earl Brownlow spent much time and money restoring Belton, and consequently the house entered the 20th century in a good state of repair and preservation. However, the 20th century was to present Belton and its estate with serious problems. These included the introduction of income tax and death duties which would leave the finances of the Brownlow family severely depleted.At the beginning of World War I, like many other British landowners, the 3rd Earl Brownlow offered his house and park to the Government for war service. The offer was accepted, and the largest and most drastic changes were made in the park since the time of Viscount Tyrconnel's folly building. In August 1914, the house and park were used as the assembly point for the 11th (Northern) Division before its deployment. In 1915, the home depôt and training ground of the Machine Gun Corps were established in the southern part of Belton park.

Grumman adds that the Mandela Effect is described as “false memory” by those skeptical of it and an example of a multiverse by others, and defines the term:The Mandela Effect is named for South African statesman and civil rights activist Nelson Mandela. When he died in 2013, news of his death stirred up some surprising — and mysterious — memories. People around the world reported that they remembered hearing of his death decades earlier, in the 1980s. Some even vividly recalled watching his funeral on television … Thus, people who remember seeing Mandela’s funeral in the 1980s may not be simply misremembering. They might have somehow slipped across from an alternate history where Nelson Mandela did die in the 1980s. In our world, he was imprisoned for many years. Likewise, people who recall “The Berenstein Bears” may have grown up in a parallel world where the bears’ name really did end in -stein.Threads about the claim regularly appear on Reddit subs such as r/retconned (devoted to what it calls “the retcon effect” in reality), r/MandelaEffect, and metaphysics-related subreddits in general:Scary Movie – Shorty’s Line \\"\\"I see Dead People\\"\\" from RetconnedSome posters share their commentary with “residue,” trace examples of the alternate-reality version they recall:The \\"\\"I see white people\\"\\" ME from Scary Movie, with decade old residue from MandelaEffectOn Twitter, users frequently tweeted as they happened upon their own alternate memory:I've seen the theory about the Hadron super collider causing us to shift dimensions and that this one isnt 'right'.

The freakiest one yet! !Other commenters blamed CERN, an aspect of the conspiracy discussed in broader detail on our page “Did the World End in 2012?” One sub-theory around the Mandela Effect is that European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) experiments with particle physics in 2012 managed to alter reality in minor ways:Mandela Effects like this is why I believe someone (most likely CERN) is doing this intentionally.However, there are non-conspiracy theory answers to many of these questions. One response in objection to this particular claim involves the 2002 movie Undercover Brother. In a March 22 2019 r/MandelaEffect thread, a commenter claimed that the exact line appeared in a portion of Undercover Brother:I see white people: SOLVED from MandelaEffectAn embedded YouTube clip uploaded on March 22 2009 (approximately around the time the Yahoo Answers thread appeared, but several years before Mandela’s death coined the term and popularized the theory and ten years to the date of the thread citing it) was cued to a part where the main character says “I see white people.”The line also appeared in a similar clip uploaded in July 2014. Comments on that thread were divisive, with some users positing Undercover Brother‘s trailer contained the line and caused Mandela Effect proponents to conflate their memories, a theory vociferously rejected by fellow commenters:haha,so you are suggesting to people who NEVER saw the undercover brother movie and vividly feel as if they heard the line in scary movie that they instead had their memories contaminated by “possibly” seeing the trailer for a completely different movie perhaps once or a few times? ?….bahahaha….oooooooookay then….and they say believers have some out-there theories.Scary Movie was released in July 2000, and preceded by trailers; one of the lines the film parodied was from The Sixth Sense, released in August 1999. The Sixth Sense was a breakout hit, which is why the very next year it was parodied in Scary Movie. Another hugely well-received 1999 film was novella adaptation The Green Mile, by Stephen King; it was another runaway hit, and both were widely viewed by moviegoers.Both of these films were large presences at the 72nd Academy Awards ceremony in March 2000, honoring film efforts from the previous year, 1999. Of note is while the 72nd Academy Awards in 2000 was not the most viewed (viewership peaked in 1998), an estimated 46 million Americans watched the ceremony — a number which dropped each year, clocking in at 29 million in 2019.People who have watched the Oscars are likely aware the program’s host typically intersperses announcement and distribution of the awards with entertainment segments, featuring musical numbers and comedy sketches. Comedian Billy Crystal hosted the 72nd Academy Awards in 2000, and one of his comedy bits was a segment panning various celebrities in the audience, musing about what they might be thinking.That segment was uploaded to YouTube in October 2010 (prior to the death of Mandela and the ensuing “Mandela Effect” theory). One joke in particular was well-received by both ceremony attendees as well as YouTube commenters commenting — often before the Mandela Effect Scary Movie rumor took root. At around the 1:15 mark, the camera panned to The Green Mile‘s Michael Clarke Duncan, who died in 2012. As Duncan’s face appeared on the screen, Crystal quipped:I see white people.On a side note, Crystal’s joke was incidentally prescient; the 88th Academy Awards in 2016 (for films released in 2015) led to controversy and boycotts due to the snubbing of nominees of color. In response, the hashtag #OscarsSoWhite was used to voice frustration in the entertainment industry, ushering in changes in the coming years.Regarding the Scary Movie “I see white people” Mandela Effect rumor, it is impossible to assign a truth value to a claim hinging on the possible existence of multiple parallel universes. It is, however, true that a large number of people recall the line and feel the “I see dead people” joke didn’t “work” on the same level as the other did. In discourse, some have speculated that “Mandela Effected” people conflated that line with another in 2002’s Undercover Brother.It also seems possible that some of the 46 million viewers of the 72nd Academy Awards in 2000 remembered Duncan reacting to Crystal’s “I see white people” quip, the two films, and later conflated the joke with Scary Movie.But since it’s impossible to prove a negative, we also can’t really rule out the possibility the line truly was spoken as it is commonly remembered — but in an alternate timeline.\\"","response":"Claim: Many people recall a line from the 2000 film Scary Movie as \\"I see white people\\" instead of \\"I see dead people,\\" and attribute this discrepancy to the Mandela Effect."},{"question":"Generate a sentence that describes the following data: Allama Iqbal International Airport, operatingOrganisation, Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority; Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority, location, Jinnah International Airport.

Max Cady (Robert De Niro) is a former client whom Bowden defended 14 years earlier when he was working as a public defender in Atlanta. Cady was tried for the violent rape and battery of a young woman. Bowden, appalled by Cady's crime, buried evidence that might have lightened Cady's sentence or even secured his acquittal. After his release from prison, Cady tracks down Bowden. He studied law in prison and assumed his own defense, unsuccessfully appealing his conviction several times. Cady hints he has learned about Bowden burying the report. Several incidents involving Cady impact the Bowden family, which consists of Bowden's wife Leigh (Jessica Lange) and their teenage daughter Danielle (Juliette Lewis). The family dog is poisoned. Cady lurks near their property. Bowden attempts to have Cady arrested, but police lieutenant Elgart (Robert Mitchum), says there is no evidence of a crime. At a bar, Cady meets Lori Davis (Illeana Douglas), a colleague of Bowden with whom she might be having a love affair. At her house, Cady cuffs her hands behind her back, breaks her arm and rapes her. Lori refuses to press charges, ashamed of what happened. Bowden hires private investigator Claude Kersek (Joe Don Baker) to follow Cady. Cady next approaches Danielle at her school by impersonating her new drama teacher and kisses her. Bowden warns him to leave his family and him alone or suffer the consequences. Cady secretly tapes the conversation with a hidden recorder. Kersek persuades Bowden to hire three men to beat Cady and intimidate him, but as Bowden watches from a hiding place, Cady turns the tide on his attackers and viciously beats them. Cady uses the recording of Bowden's threat and an exaggerated display of his own injuries to file for a restraining order against Bowden. Cady's new lawyer, Lee Heller (Gregory Peck), files a complaint with the North Carolina State Bar, vowing to have Bowden disbarred. Kersek reasons that Cady may try...

If gays didn’t like it, he added, they could eat something else. But in a sign of how toxic it has become for a company to be viewed as unfriendly toward gays, Barilla has made a dramatic turnaround in the space of one year, expanding health benefits for transgender workers and their families, contributing money to gay rights causes, and featuring a lesbian couple on a promotional Web site. Barilla has journeyed from gay rights pariah to poster child — on Wednesday it received a perfect score from a prominent gay rights group that rates companies on their gay-friendliness. It is an about-face that highlights how companies, which typically shy away from controversy, are increasingly being forced to take sides in the cultural battle over gay rights and same-sex marriage — and how decisively pro-gay forces have gained the upper hand. Other household-name brands have also found themselves in hot water over actions that were perceived to be anti-gay. Target, for example, strived to make amends after coming under fire in 2010 for political contributions that supported a Minnesota gubernatorial candidate who opposed same-sex marriage. Chick-fil-A stopped giving to certain organizations in 2012 after earning the ire of gay rights groups that accused the fast-food chain of supporting anti-gay causes. Both companies were subject to boycotts, though there has been a counter effort by socially conservative groups to support and embrace Chick-fil-A. The peril for companies is not short-term profits, because boycotts rarely affect revenue directly, said Mary-Hunter McDonnell, a professor of strategy at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business. “Really, boycotts are about threatening a company’s public image and reputation,” she said, and a tarnished brand can ultimately hurt the bottom line. In the past, companies had to be careful not to offend groups that opposed homosexuality, said Bob Witeck, a corporate crisis consultant who specializes in gay issues. Two decades ago, Witeck helped American Airlines weather criticism over its decision to market to gays. His advice at the time was for the company to explain to the opposition that this was simply a good business decision. But more recently, opinions have shifted dramatically to the point that it is a positive for some companies to be viewed as supportive of gay rights, particularly among young customers, who might view incidents such as the one articulated a year ago by Barilla as “stupid and backwards,” he said. Starbucks, Nike and Microsoft, for instance, endorsed legalizing same-sex marriage in Washington state in 2012. In the case of Barilla — a 130-year-old company based in Parma, Italy, that is the world’s largest pasta manufacturer — the blowback was fierce in September 2013 when Guido Barilla told an Italian radio host, “I would never do [a commercial] with a homosexual couple, not for lack of respect, but because we don’t agree with them,” according to reports. “Ours is a classic family where the woman plays a fundamental role.” He continued: “If [gays] don’t like it, they can go eat another brand.” The remarks grabbed headlines around the world and prompted boycotts in the United States, where the firm has 30 percent of the pasta market with 430 million in sales in 2013, and elsewhere. Harvard University dumped Barilla from its cafeterias, gay rights groups promoted names of other brands of pasta, and Barilla’s competitors seized on the opportunity to present themselves as more forward-thinking, with Bertolli Germany posting a comment on its Facebook page promoting “pasta and love for all!” Guido Barilla issued multiple video apologies in the wake of the scandal. Barilla Group did not make Guido Barilla available for an interview, but in a statement, he apologized again, adding: “I am proud to say that, as a result of these discussions, we have all learned a great deal about the true definition and meaning of family, and over the past year we have worked hard to reflect that throughout our organization.” Some of the gay advocates who have worked with Guido Barilla since his comments believe his contrition is sincere. “He was horrified at the consequences and his personal beliefs,” said David Mixner, a veteran gay rights activist and author who served as a consultant for Barilla. He called the recent diversity initiative “the most all-encompassing effort to bounce back from an unfortunate misstatement that I’ve ever been part of.” Seth Adam, a spokesman for GLAAD, a gay advocacy group that has also met with Barilla, said it is important to acknowledge someone when they have undergone an “evolution” in support of gay rights. “I’m not giving anyone license to say things that are discriminatory,” he said. “However, I do think it’s okay to learn, and I think we’ve seen that in elected officials to everyday families.” The company’s 100 rating in the Human Rights Campaign’s annual Corporate Equality Index, which is based on internal company policies as well as corporate citizenship, is remarkable, said Deena Fidas, director of the workplace program for the Human Rights Campaign. Last year, Barilla did not even ask to be rated. Of the 781 companies that volunteered to be rated this year, fewer than half got a perfect score. “It is very unusual for a business to take on the full spectrum of CEI criteria in one year,” she said. “Some people may certainly speculate about the motivations here, but at the end of the day it’s irrefutable that at Barilla, you have LGBT-inclusive policies and practices . . . that were not there a year ago.” Talita Erickson, chief diversity officer for Barilla, said that the company has demonstrated its sincerity with its actions. It has expanded its health benefits to include transgender-related care. It has instituted a thorough diversity training that all 8,000 of its workers will eventually undergo. It has broadened its anti-discrimination policy to cover gay and transgender people. The company also has donated money to the Tyler Clementi Foundation, an anti-bullying organization founded by the parents of a gay Rutgers University student who committed suicide, and featured a lesbian couple on a Web site devoted to urging families to eat more meals together. But will same-sex couples be turning up in any television commercials? Not immediately, said Erickson, who explained that the company did not want to be “reactionary” in light of the criticism. “My understanding is we’re absolutely open to having the LGBT community represented in our ads in the future,” she said. “It’s going to happen gradually.” Title:","response":"From Unfriendly to Supportive: Barilla's Turnaround in Embracing the LGBTQ Community"},{"question":"Use evidence from the fact that when light enters the eye through the pupil , that light falls on the retina to answer this question: \\"A retina may be illuminated by\\"","response":"Alright, little buddy!

It is the driest place in North America with an average rainfall of only 1.96 inches a year. Death Valley also boasts the lowest point in the western hemisphere. Death Valley got its name in 1849, when a group of emigrants were looking for a short cut to the gold fields of California. They were given the bad advice and went into the valley. Some of them were killed by the bad weather and harsh roads. When the rest finally walked out, they gave the area its name by saying to it \\"goodbye, Death Valley\\". As the name might suggest, there is very little apparent vegetation within Death Valley. First impression, however, can be deceiving . Death Valley includes more than 1,000 species of plants that have adapted to the harsh conditions. Death Valley is also a land of beauties. Sunrise and sunset are two of the most spectacular attractions. Depending on different angles, they show many of the area's different moods. For the best viewing, plan to be there approximately one hour before sunset or before sunrise. Death Valley National Park is open year round.

Despite the stark and desolate appearance of the landscape, Death Valley boasts a surprisingly diverse array of flora. Over 1,000 plant species have adapted to the region's harsh conditions, proving that life can indeed thrive in such a seemingly inhospitable environment. One of the most awe-inspiring aspects of Death Valley, as noted by the author, is the breathtaking beauty of its sunrises and sunsets. The ever-changing angles of the sun cast a myriad of colors and moods across the landscape, making it a sight to behold. To catch the best display of this natural spectacle, the author recommends planning your visit about an hour before sunset or sunrise.

Sumitra Bhave has always made sensible cinema and this is my favourite film by her. This movie should have won the National Award and would have been my pick to represent India at the Oscars. It is at least a thousand times better than 'Shaaws', which is going to the Oscars, from India, this year. It is such a pity that the information about this (and all other Indian movies) on IMDb is lacking and sometimes even wrong. Sadashiv Amrapurkar played a very important character in this movie and he is not even credited on these pages. The rest of the cast and crew too are not mentioned at all. Awards and nominations for this movie are not given even when Sonali Kulkarni won the Indian National Award for this movie. There was not even a single vote cast for 'Doghi'. 'Doghi' is not a Hindi movie. It is Marathi, and thankfully escapes the song and dance sequence, does not get tangled up in glitzy glamour and half-witted designer ware. It is a real life, soulful story that is made with a rare understanding and respect. 'Doghi' which can roughly be translated as 'two women' is a story of two sisters, Gauri and Krishna. It is actually a very simple story, Sumitra Bhave does not venture into many sub plots, and that makes it a very difficult film to direct. The entire movie is set in a non-descript remote village in Maharashtra and the screen rarely ventures far from the house of the two female protagonists. No aesthetic sunsets in this one. The movie opens and we are introduced to the entire house, which is preparing for Gauri's wedding. Gauri and Krishna's father being a hard working farmer, the house is full and happy; there is nothing wanting in their simple lives. However on the eve of the wedding Gauri's to-be-husband meets with a fatal accident. Gauri's father cannot bear the tragic news and suffers a major stroke. Without a strong, working member the house could have fallen apart but Gauri's mother shoulders the responsibility. She works as and when she can, but cannot make ends meet. But her life still, is easier than Gauri's. Superstitions, that people half-heartedly try to forget, make Gauri an evil luck bringer. She is outcast from the society. Gauri's mother writes to her brother. Desperate for help she accepts his suggestion. He takes Gauri off to Mumbai where she is made to work in brothels. Gauri sends home the money she earns and their conditions improve. Gauri gives her life for that of her family's. However when Gauri returns home for Krishna's wedding, her mother does not come out to meet her. She does not allow Krishna near her and does not allow Gauri in front of the guests. She loves Gauri but fears for Krishna's life. This breaks Gauri completely and she decides to return to her unfortunate life. But Krishna runs out and holds Gauri. She begs her beloved sister to return. Krishna promises to stand by her. Promises that they would face the world  together. There is nothing that is not required in this movie. Everything is necessary and sufficient. Gauri goes off to Mumbai but what she does there is never told  the subtle dialogues tell us what there is to know. It just the bare story, which is profound in its simplicity. 'Doghi' is responsible cinema. It is respectful to the subject it handles. It is respectful towards its audience  it does not think them to have the mental capability of a four year old. The acting is first rate. The direction is marvelous  the silences carry the story forward in a way, no words could have. The script is well researched. Anyone who appreciates good cinema is bound to like 'Doghi'.

This development follows a series of recent incidents and intelligence reports that suggest an increase in radicalization and terrorism activities within the region. This situation has led to growing concerns among US officials and the citizens living in the country. The text below will explore the reasons behind this warning and the implications it carries for both the US and Indonesia. Background: Over the past few years, Indonesia has faced a surge in extremist activities, and the terror threat seems to be on the rise. Recent incidents include attacks on churches, suicide bombings, and plots to target government buildings and foreign establishments. Many of these incidents have been linked to various local and regional terrorist groups, including the Islamic State (IS) and Jemaah Islamiyah (JI). Despite the authorities' efforts to tackle this problem, radicalization and extremism still persist in some pockets of Indonesian society, highlighting the challenges faced by the government in combating terrorism. Reasons for the Warning: Several factors can be attributed to the issuance of this warning by the US government. These include: 1. Intelligence Reports: The US government is likely acting on specific intelligence reports that it has received about potential terrorist activities targeting US interests in Indonesia. These reports may have come from various sources such as intercepted communications, informants within terrorist networks, or shared intelligence from partner nations. 2. Recent Attacks and Incidents: Over the past few years, there have been numerous incidents of terrorist activity in Indonesia, and US interests have not been exempt from these attacks. There have been plots to target US diplomatic missions and other establishments. These indicate the likelihood of more terrorism-related incidents in the future. 3. The Involvement of Terrorist Groups: Terrorism in Indonesia is not primarily the result of lone-wolf attacks or uncoordinated small groups. Instead, there are organized terrorist networks perpetrating these acts, and many of them have affiliations with international organizations like the Islamic State. Their increasing influence in the region poses a genuine concern for the US and its interests. Implications and Concerns: This warning issued by the US government carries several implications and concerns for both American and Indonesian people: 1. Heightened Security Measures: As a result of the warning, US establishments and interests (e.g., embassies, consulates, businesses, and schools) in Indonesia will most likely experience heightened security measures. These precautionary steps would ensure the safety of their citizens and employees but might also cause discomfort and inconvenience. 2. Impact on Tourism and Economics: The US warning could lead to a lower number of American tourists visiting Indonesia and potential investors considering alternative options, potentially impacting the Indonesian economy. 3. Strained US-Indonesia Relations: The terror warning might strain the otherwise positive relationship between the two countries. While the US's primary concern is the safety of its citizens and interests, there might be a perceived negative impact on Indonesia's image internationally, leading to potential political tensions between the governments. 4. Additional Challenges for Indonesian Government: The warning issued by the US places added pressure on the Indonesian government to address their terrorism issue and protect foreign interests on their soil. This includes not only US interests but also the interests of other foreign governments and organizations that might see the warning as a reason for concern. Conclusion: The recent warning by the US government regarding potential terror attacks against its interests in Indonesia is indicative of the persistent terror threat experienced by the Southeast Asian nation. Given the complex factors involved and the implications of the warning, it is essential for governments, security forces, and citizens to remain vigilant against terrorism and work together to strengthen security measures, curb radicalization, and promote peace within the region."},{"question":"What's the most logical way to complete this passage?

Lisa Lavoie, a 24-year-old teacher, is charged with enticement of a child. Lisa Lavoie and the male student were found in Morgantown, West Virginia, Monday night after apparently being together for a week, Holyoke Mayor Michael Sullivan said.

ALBANY — State Chief Judge Jonathan Lippman is one of three judges on the state’s top court who say they intend to serve past 70 if a constitutional amendment to raise the retirement age for some judges to 80 passes Tuesday. Lippman originally pushed to hike the retirement age for all judges to 80, saying he would be willing to exempt himself and his six colleagues on the Court of Appeals. But ultimately, the Legislature agreed to put a more limited amendment before voters that would only affect state Supreme Court judges. It also allows Court of Appeals judges to complete their 14-year terms even if they pass the current retirement age of 70. Lippman, who would get to serve an additional seven years, and two other Court of Appeals judges, Robert Smith and Eugene Pigott — who both hit 70 within the next three years — said through a spokesman that they plan to continue to serve if the measure passes. That has led some critics of the plan to question Lippman’s lobbying to increase the retirement age for judges. “Was this all about them staying on the court?” asked one insider. A Court of Appeals spokesman said Lippman was serious about exempting that court if the Legislature agreed to try to raise the retirement age for all judges. But that didn’t happen and Lippman — who is close to Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver — believes he has more to accomplish before retiring, the spokesman said. Lippman has argued that mandatory retirement at 70 is outdated. If the three Court of Appeals judges were forced to retire at 70 and Gov. Cuomo is reelected next year, he would get to replace all of them, giving him all seven appointments on the court. Cuomo hasn’t taken a position on the amendment but has raised reservations and questioned whether the state wants judges in their late 70s. Currently, state Supreme Court judges must retire at 70, though they can seek a special re-certification every two years that allows them to serve until 76. The measure to up the retirement age to 80 has the support of the court system and many in the legal community. Critics argue the measure excludes judges who work in criminal, county and family courts, which have the largest caseloads and backlogs. Summary:","response":"Three justices from the New York's Supreme Court, including Chief Judge Jonathan Lippman, have expressed their intention to serve beyond the age of 70 if a constitutional amendment raising the retirement age for certain judges to 80 is approved. The proposed amendment, which originally included all judges but later limited to state Supreme Court judges, also permits Court of Appeal judges to complete their 14-year terms even if they surpass the current retirement age of 70. Critics have questioned the motives behind these potential changes, pointing out that they exclude judges from criminal, county, and family courts, which carry the heaviest caseloads. Governor Cuomo has yet to express his view on the amendment, but raised concerns about having judges working in their late 70s."},{"question":"Write a dialog about anything you want","response":"Little Timmy: Hey, what are those big animals with long necks?

A. bus depot B. train station C. beach D. bridge E. taxi The best answer is A:","response":"A. bus depot A bum who wishes to ride for free would likely choose a bus depot as the best location. Bus depots are where buses are stored, maintained, and prepared for service. As a central transportation hub, they may offer the most opportunities for the individual to sneak onto a bus or find a vehicle that is currently not in use. Additionally, there may be less strict security measures at a bus depot compared to other options on the list. While some of the other options mentioned, such as a train station or taxi, do provide transportation services, they tend to have more secure and monitored boarding processes, making it more difficult for someone to ride for free. The beach and bridge, on the other hand, are not direct sources of transportation and therefore may not be the best choices for obtaining a free ride."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Information: - Brandenburg-Prussia is the historiographic denomination for the Early Modern realm of the Brandenburgian Hohenzollerns between 1618 and 1701. Based in the Electorate of Brandenburg, the main branch of the Hohenzollern intermarried with the branch ruling the Duchy of Prussia, and secured succession upon the latter's extinction in the male line in 1618. Another consequence of the intermarriage was the incorporation of the lower Rhenish principalities of Cleves, Mark and Ravensberg after the Treaty of Xanten in 1614. The Thirty Years' War (161848) was especially devastating. The Elector changed sides three times, and as a result Protestant and Catholic armies swept the land back and forth, killing, burning, seizing men and taking the food supplies. Upwards of half the population was killed or dislocated. Berlin and the other major cities were in ruins, and recovery took decades. - The Dutch Republic, also known as the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands ('), Republic of the United Netherlands or Republic of the Seven United Provinces ('), was a republic in Europe existing from 1581, when part of the Netherlands separated from Spanish rule, until 1795. It preceded the Batavian Republic, the Kingdom of Holland, the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, and ultimately the modern Kingdom of the Netherlands. Alternative names include the United Provinces ('), Seven Provinces ('), Federated Dutch Provinces ('), and Dutch Federation ('). - A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \\"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years. United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice. - Maine Maritime Academy is a public post-secondary college and nautical training institution with approximately 900 students, located in Castine in Hancock County, Maine, USA. The Academy was established by the 90th Maine Legislature on March 21, 1941. Maine Maritime Academy is a public college. Costs of admission are comparable to the nearby University of Maine. Unlike federal service academies, a congressional recommendation is not required to attend this state school. Students are not obligated to go to sea or into the military after graduation, and a large portion of the graduating class chooses shore-side employment, often in maritime related fields or the power generation industry. - The Holocene is the geological epoch that began after the Pleistocene at approximately 11,700 years before present. The term \\"Recent\\" (usually capitalised) has often been used as an exact synonym of \\"Holocene\\", although this usage is discouraged in 21st-century science. The Holocene is part of the Quaternary period. Its name comes from the Ancient Greek words (\\"holos\\", whole or entire) and (\\"kainos\\", new), meaning \\"entirely recent\\". It has been identified with the current warm period, known as MIS 1, and can be considered an interglacial in the current ice age based on that evidence. - Penobscot Bay originates from the mouth of Maine's Penobscot River. 11,000 years ago, at the beginning of the Holocene era, the Gulf of Maine's sea level fell as low as 180 feet (55 m) below its present height. Penobscot Bay was then a continuation of Penobscot River that meandered through a broad lowland extending past present day Matinicus Island. Penobscot Bay is between Muscongus Bay and Blue Hill Bay. - New France was the area colonized by France in North America during a period beginning with the exploration of the Saint Lawrence River by Jacques Cartier in 1534 and ending with the cession of New France to Spain and Great Britain in 1763. At its peak in 1712 (before the Treaty of Utrecht), the territory of \\"New France\\", also sometimes known as the \\"French North American Empire\\" or \\"Royal New France\\", extended from Newfoundland to the Canadian prairies and from Hudson Bay to the Gulf of Mexico, including all the Great Lakes of North America. - Fort Pentagouet (Fort Pentagoet, Fort Castine, Fort Penobscot, Fort St. Pierre) was a French fort established in present-day Castine, Maine, which was the capital of Acadia (16701674). It is the oldest permanent settlement in New England. - Acadia was a colony of New France in northeastern North America that included parts of eastern Quebec, the Maritime provinces, and modern-day Maine to the Kennebec River. During much of the 17th and early 18th centuries, Norridgewock on the Kennebec River and Castine at the end of the Penobscot River were the southernmost settlements of Acadia. The actual specification by the French government for the territory refers to lands bordering the Atlantic coast, roughly between the 40th and 46th parallels. Later, the territory was divided into the British colonies which became Canadian provinces and American states. The population of Acadia included members of the Wabanaki Confederacy and descendants of emigrants from France (i.e., Acadians). The two communities intermarried, which resulted in a significant portion of the population of Acadia being Métis. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - The Franco-Dutch War (167278), often called simply the Dutch War, was a war fought by France, Sweden, Münster, Cologne and England against the Dutch Republic, which was later joined by the Austrian Habsburg lands, Brandenburg-Prussia and Spain to form a Quadruple Alliance. The war ended with the Treaty of Nijmegen, by which Spain ceded the Franche-Comté and some cities in Flanders and Hainaut to France, while France returned some of its conquests (Maastricht and the Principality of Orange) to the Dutch. - Castine is a town in Hancock County in eastern Maine, USA, which served from 1670 to 1674 as the capital of Acadia. The population was 1,366 at the 2010 census. Castine is the home of Maine Maritime Academy, a four-year institution that graduates officers and engineers for the United States Merchant Marine and marine related industries. Approximately 1000 students are enrolled. During the French colonial period, Castine was the southern tip of Acadia and briefly served as the regional capital. - Münster (Low German: \\"Mönster\\"; Latin: \\"Monasterium\\", from the Greek \\"monastrion\\", \\"monastery\\") is an independent city in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. It is in the northern part of the state and is considered to be the cultural centre of the Westphalia region. It is also capital of the local government region Münsterland. Münster was the location of the Anabaptist rebellion during the Protestant Reformation and the site of the signing of the Treaty of Westphalia ending the Thirty Years' War in 1648. Today it is known as the bicycle capital of Germany. - The Principality of Orange (in French \\"la Principauté d'Orange\\") was, from 1163 to 1713, a feudal state in Provence, in the south of modern-day France, on the left bank of the river Rhone north of the city of Avignon. - Jurriaen Aernoutsz ( or Aernouts ) was a Dutch colonial navy captain , who briefly conquered the capital of Acadia , Fort Pentagouet in Penobscot Bay ( present day Castine , Maine ) and several other villages , and renamed the colony New Holland during the Franco - Dutch War . The commander of the frigate Flying Horse , based at Curaçao during the Third Anglo - Dutch War , Aernoutsz was dispatched by the governor of Curaçao to fight French and English ships in the North Atlantic after the Netherlands recaptured New York City . By the time he reached New York , however , the English and the Dutch had made peace in the Treaty of Westminster -- but with the Franco - Dutch War still underway , Aernoutsz met with John Rhoades and decided to attack Acadia . On August 10 , 1674 , Aernoutsz and the crew of the Flying Horse captured Fort Pentagouet in two hours . He then sailed up the Bay of Fundy , pillaging several French posts along the coast and ending at Fort Jemseg , which he also captured . Aernoutsz claimed Acadia as the Dutch territory of New Holland , burying bottles at both Pentagouet and Jemseg to assert his claim , and remained in Acadia for about a month . He subsequently returned to Boston in mid-September , disposing of his pillage and selling the cannon from Pentagouet to the government of Massachusetts . Aernoutsz then returned to Curaçao in October , leaving Rhoades and company in Boston with orders to return to Acadia to maintain possession of the territory . Once in Acadia , Rhoades began seizing New England vessels coming to trade with the Wabanaki Confederacy . As a result , the government of Massachusetts apprehended the party and tried them as pirates , during which time the French regained control of the territory without any military opposition . The Dutch continued to consider New Holland part of their colonial empire in North America , appointing Cornelius Van Steenwyk as Dutch governor of the territory in 1676 , but this was largely a paper designation -- in actual practice , the region... - Franche-Comté (literally \\"Free County\\", Frainc-Comtou dialect: \\"Fraintche-Comtè\\"; ) is a former administrative region and a traditional province of eastern France.

For what it's worth, I found it more touching and memorable than his more acclaimed films like L'AVVENTURA, perhaps because he shows more emotion & empathy here than anywhere else. The story is simple, but it is used as a frame for Antonioni's brilliant observations of, and critique on American consumerist culture, student life, the counter-culture, and the whole anti-establishment, anti-war backlash that was so prominent then. Even from a purely technical point of view, it is a remarkably crafted film; from the opening credits sequence to the bizarre desert 'love-in', to the use of billboards, and right down to that jaw-dropping, cathartic finale that used 17 camera set-ups (in it's own way, as powerful as the climax of The Wild Bunch). Also, Antonioni chose one hell of a leading lady with Daria Halperin, one of the most beautiful ever to grace the screen. There isn't much 'acting' involved, as this feels more like a docu-drama, and so the use of non- professionals as the lead couple works quite effectively within that context. And the soundtrack is not only filled with marvelous music, its use is impressive as well (I can't forget the start of the film, mostly due to the selection of music - by Pink Floyd - that grooms the visuals so well). Contrary to popular opinion, this is quite an achievement in cinema, and one I would enthusiastically recommend to anyone with a taste or tolerance for the off- beat. Well worth seeking out, and one of those key films of the 60s that demands a DVD restoration/release.","response":"To analyze the sentiment of this review, let's break it down step by step: 1. The reviewer acknowledges that most critics dismiss the film quickly, but they personally found it more touching and memorable than more acclaimed films. This demonstrates a positive sentiment. 2.

This showcases an appreciation for the film's content, indicating another positive sentiment. 3. From a technical standpoint, the reviewer considers the film to be remarkably crafted, praising various aspects such as its opening credits, use of billboards, and the climactic finale. This demonstrates the reviewer's admiration, marking another positive sentiment. 4. The reviewer also compliments the choice of the leading lady Daria Halperin, stating that she is one of the most beautiful to grace the screen. Additionally, they believe the use of non-professionals fits the docu-drama style, contributing to the film's effectiveness. These statements represent further positive sentiments. 5.

In conclusion, the reviewer's sentiment is overwhelmingly positive.

Memling almost certainly was apprenticed to van der Weyden in Brussels until setting up his own workshop in Bruges sometime after 1465. Memling's Annunciation is more innovative, with motifs such as the attendant angels that were absent in the earlier paintings. According to Till-Holger Borchert, not only was Memling familiar with van der Weyden's motifs and compositions, but he might have assisted with the underdrawing in van der Weyden's workshop.

Much to his surprise, the dog remained undeterred by this new development, zigzagging across the lawn effortlessly catching the frisbee each time it's thrown. Despite the unpredictability of the throws, the dog excelled at the task, displaying a natural athleticism that was both joyous and fascinating to the man. As time passed, the bond between the man and the dog grew and their simple game of fetch slowly transformed into more than just a playful activity. It became a moment of communion, a moment when the boundaries between man and animal seemed to evaporate. The man, who was initially just passing time, grew fascinated with the dog's keenness and intellect. The man then decided to introduce some new elements to the game. He began trickily hiding the frisbee behind his back or tossing it into the trees. However, the clever dog unfailingly located the frisbee each time, much to the amusement and delight of the man. Buoyed by these results, he then began teaching him other tricks. The rest of the afternoon was spent instructing the dog to sit, roll over, and jump through hoops. The dog, showing the same energy and intelligence that it exhibited during their game of fetch, was quick to learn these new tricks. It responded to the man's positive reinforcement with a wagging tail and happy barks, the noises echoing through the nearby woods. As the sun drifted towards the horizon, casting long shadows across the field, the man and dog continued their playful interaction. It was clear that an understanding, love and mutual respect had formed. This day was a turning point for the man and the dog. It was the day of that unconditional bond that develops between humans and their pets. Tired and satisfied, they ended their day with a long, tranquil walk back home, the frisbee held triumphantly in the dog's mouth. The simple game of fetch had now become their shared ritual, a cherished routine that would strengthen their bond with each passing day. Through these proceedings, it appeared as if the frisbee was not just a toy anymore. It had become a symbol of their partnership; a vessel of their shared experiences. The day had progressed from an ordinary afternoon to one filled with teaching, learning and mutual growth, a beautiful memory that the man would carry in his heart, and evidently, the dog too. Thus, what began as a simple act of throwing a frisbee evolved into an adventure exploring the intelligence and companionship of animals, demonstrating the profound connection that can be established between humans and their furry companions.

It's one of the most popular cruise destinations in Europe. And for many, the sail-away from Venice, through its Giudecca Canal, is an awe-inspiring experience. Venice may be known as La Serenissima, or \\"the most peaceful,\\" which, however, isn't entirely accurate these days. Venetians have been increasingly concerned about the impact of tourism and the potential for an environmental disaster off its shoreline due to the number of cruise ships that enter and exit its lagoon . That's why earlier last month, Venice announced a new policy to forbid the transit of cruise ships to the city via the Giudecca Canal. It's not that the city wants to shun the cruise industry altogether: It simply wants to force traffic further away from the landmarks along the shoreline. City officials say that most ships will now transit the Contorta Sant'Angelo Canal. Additionally, the city is _ the size of ships that can visit Venice, as well as the total number of ships that call on it on a daily basis. As of January 2014, Venice plans to reduce the visitations of larger ships (those that are 40,000 tons or heavier) by 20 percent. This effectively caps the number of ships that can enter per day to five. In November, ships heavier than 96,000 tons will not be allowed to enter Guidecca Canal at all. How the city plans to carry out the new five-ships-per-day rule remains to be seen and have yet to be announced. Which ships will be allowed passage? Will it be first-come, first-served? However they proceed, cruise line executives want their passengers to know that Venice will remain a regular port of call--even if the transit to and from the city must evolve.

The ship is the second to be located off southern Japan from two massive armadas – each reputedly made up of more than 4,000 ships and with an invasion force of 140,000 men – sent by the emperor of the Yuan Dynasty to conquer Japan in 1274 and 1281. Both invasion fleets were destroyed by devastating typhoons, with the storms going down in Japanese history as \\"kamikaze\\", or divine wind, that saved the nation from foreign invasion. The kamikaze were again invoked in the dying days of the Second World War, with the crew of aircraft and miniature submarines carrying out suicide missions against the Allies. The Mongolian vessel has been located in a bay close to the city of Matsuura, on the west coast of the island of Kyushu, and archaeologists believe it was taking shelter from the storm when it foundered. Part of the hull of the ship was found beneath a thin layer of sediment around 75 feet beneath the surface. • Pinning down Kublai Khan Porcelain that was made in China was found around the remarkably well-preserved wreck, including a vase and a white bowl, Atsuyuki Nakata, the head of the cultural properties division of the Matsuura city board of education, told The Telegraph. Kublai Khan, grandson of Genghis Khan \\"One thing that we hope to learn from the wreck is the kind of materials that were used by the Mongolians 730 years ago, as well as the techniques used in the construction of the ship,\\" he said. \\"In the first ship that we located, in 2011, we found a number of coins, but we have yet to find any on this latest vessel,\\" he added. Other finds on the new discovery include roof tiles and iron utensils. The wreck found in 2011 (Ryukyu University) The ship is estimated to have measured 65 feet from bow to stern and had a beam of around 23 feet, making it smaller than the vessel found four years ago. The hull was divided by nine wooden bulkheads, which remain clearly visible, and laden with rocks that appear to have served as ballast. The local board of education has been working with archaeologists from Okinawa's University of the Ryukus, with Prof Yoshifumi Ikeda claiming that his team has already identified three more sites that may be the wrecks of Mongolian ships and that the search for more, using ultrasound equipment, continues. • Travelling hopefully with Marco Polo History does not record how many of the two fleets managed to return to mainland Asia, but Mr Nakata is convinced that many more wrecks remain to be found in the bays of western Kyushu. \\"We have covered the wreck with silt again, in order to preserve the timber, and we are having discussions about whether we should attempt to raise it,\\" he said. ||||| For centuries the imperial palace of Kublai Khan’s Yuan dynasty was shrouded in mystery. After the dynasty collapsed, there were no clues as to where it was and it lived on only in legend through writings such as those of 13th century Venetian merchant Marco Polo. If Polo is to be believed, the walls of “the greatest palace that ever was” were covered with gold and silver and the main hall was so large that it could easily seat 6,000 people for dinner. Chinese archaeologists solve mystery of Beijing’s Forbidden Palace “The palace was made of cane supported by 200 silk cords, which could be taken to pieces and transported easily when the emperor moved,” he wrote in his travel journal. It was a vision of grandeur but the palace disappeared, seemingly without trace. Explore the Forbidden City dig The Yuan dynasty lasted for a less than a century, spanning the years from 1279 to 1368, and it is widely believed that the capital of the empire was Beijing. But in the centuries since, one question has dogged historians and archaeologists in China: just where was the dynasty’s palace? Craftsmen who built China’s Terracotta Army ‘ate dogs’: study Now experts at the Palace Museum in Beijing believe that they have some answers, clues they stumbled upon during upgrades to the heritage site’s underground power and fire-extinguishing systems. According to historical records, the Yuan palace in Beijing was abandoned by its last emperor, Toghon Temür, who was overthrown by rebel troops that established the Ming dynasty in the 14th century. Some experts believe the palace was razed by Ming soldiers who took over the city, while others insist the buildings were removed by Ming workers on the site of what was to become the Forbidden City. The foundations for the sprawling Forbidden City were laid in 1406 and construction continued for another 14 years. It was the imperial palace for the Ming rulers and then the Qing dynasty until 1912. Light finally shed on some of the wonders of Beijing’s Forbidden City The complex has been built up, layer by layer, but researchers sifting through the sands of archaeological time said last month that they had found evidence that at least part of the Yuan palace was beneath the site. The researchers from the museum’s Institute of Archaeology said the proof was a 3 metre thick rammed earth and rubble foundation buried beneath the layers of Ming and Qing dynasty construction. Institute deputy director Wang Guangyao said the foundation unearthed in the central-west part of the palace was in the same style as one uncovered in Zhangjiakou, Hebei province, in the ruins of Zhongdu, one of the four capitals of the Yuan dynasty. Some of the rubble in the newly discovered Yuan foundation dated back even further to dynasties such as the Liao (907–1125) and the Jin (1115–1234), Wang said. Wang said a foundation of such size was rare in Yuan buildings and could have been used to support a palatial hall. More exploration of the dig at the Forbidden City At the very least, the find proved that the Yuan palace was built on the same site as the Ming palace, though it was still too early to say these two completely overlapped. At least we now know that the palace was not built somewhere else but here Wang Guangyao, deputy director of the Palace Museum’s Institute of Archaeology “At least we now know that the palace was not built somewhere else but here,” Wang said. “From a historical perspective, it gives us evidence that the architectural history runs uninterrupted from the Yuan, to the Ming and Qing dynasties.” The discovery has also revived debate about the Central Axis of Beijing – a 7.8km strip that runs from Yongding Gate to the Drum and Bell towers and included the Forbidden City, the Temple of Heaven and Zhongnanhai, the Communist Party leadership compound. Many Chinese believe the axis has been the city’s “sacred backbone” since the Ming dynasty but others argue that it goes back further to the mid-13th century. Wang said it was still too early to conclude whether the Yuan, Ming and Qing were built along the same axis. “As archaeologists, we can only define what we have found,” Wang said. “But it gives us a direction for future exploration.” Wang said it wasn’t easy to excavate in one of the country’s most important cultural sites and more work was still to be done. Amazing journey: how China hid palace artefacts from Japanese invaders “Even if we think a certain site is important for an archaeological finding, we can’t just dig the ground up because it is not allowed,” Wang said. “All we can do is to wait and collect as much evidence as we can until sometime later, probably in a generation or two, work is done in those places and we can put all the finds together to see if they are all connected.” The new discovery would be open to the public soon, Wang said. ||||| Chinese archaeologists believe they may have solved one of the great mysteries of antiquity in Beijing – the site of the imperial palace of the Yuan dynasty established by Kublai Khan in the 13th century. And while the Yuan palace was always believed to have been located near the present Forbidden City, experts from the Palace Museum now think it was under their feet, literally, in the centre of China’s most famous royal residence, Youth.cn reports. Undersea treasure: archaeologists find submerged Qin dynasty ‘seaside palace’ of China’s first emperor Announcing the rare find yesterday, the experts said they had uncovered the foundations of a royal residence seven centuries old at the bottom layer of an archaeological dig in the centre of the Forbidden City. The sprawling complex, built between 1406 and 1420, was the imperial palace of the Ming dynasty (1368–1644) and then the Qing dynasty until 1912. The exact site of the Yuan imperial palace had remained a mystery but was thought to be close to the Forbidden City. However, Palace Museum experts started a series of archaeological digs at the centre of the complex in 2014 in the hope of learning more about its construction history. Locked tomb in eastern China may hold key to fate of little-known emperor 2,000 years ago One of the excavation sites, in the centre of the Forbidden City, revealed four layers of historic foundations – starting with Qing at the top, late Ming then early Ming, and finally the Yuan at the bottom. Li Ji, director of the museum’s archaeology department, told the news website Youth.cn that workers from the Ming dynasty removed all the Yuan era buildings on the site before they started construction of the Forbidden City, so such a discovery was extremely rare. Other recent discoveries nearby include the ruins of a garden palace for the emperor’s mother, as well as a refuse pit for abandoned Qing Dynasty porcelain. . ||||| China has a love-hate relationship with what is foreign. Traditionally all people beyond the Great Wall were barbarians - only part human. But invaders have sometimes been welcomed, in time, into the Chinese family. One was Kublai Khan. In the 13th Century, no-one knew how big the world was so it was not so wild for the Mongols to set off from the grassland with the idea that they were going to conquer all of it. When the mighty Genghis Khan died in 1227, he had already claimed an empire stretching from the Pacific to Europe. His grandson Kublai set out to finish the job, and started by moving south to attack China's Song dynasty. But China had been a united empire on and off for more than 1,000 years. So what did the Song dynasty rulers make of Kublai's ambition? \\"For the Song, it would been absolutely inconceivable that the Mongols could take over the whole of China,\\" says John Man, author of a biography of Kublai Khan. \\"It would have been like, I don't know, the Picts taking over the Roman Empire or the Sioux in North America taking over the whole of Canada and the United States - inconceivable. So when it actually happened, the shock was catastrophic.\\" The child emperor committed suicide. So did many loyal officials and their families. Over centuries, the Chinese had got used to regarding themselves as THE world civilisation, and now this civilisation was at the mercy of people they viewed as barbarians. \\"Barbarians are these people who are not Chinese - savages, hovering between human and some kind of beast,\\" says Xun Zhou, a historian at Hong Kong University. As History is My Witness Former BBC Beijing correspondent Carrie Gracie presents a 10-part series on figures from Chinese history who reveal something about China Programmes can be heard every weekday on BBC Radio 4 at 13:45 BST Alternatively, listen again on the BBC iPlayer China: As History Is My Witness Download the podcast She points out that unease about the barbarian or foreign devil is embedded in Chinese writing. Part of the character used to refer to them is the one used for animals. \\"These people looked different. And that difference proposed a problem,\\" says Xun Zhou. \\"For China, they don't really know how they should react to these people.\\" Mongol pleasures included wrestling, fermented mare's milk and throat singing, where the singer sings chords instead of single notes. All very different from the southern Chinese elites who wore exquisite silks, admired each other's poetry and went to art exhibitions. They paid armies to do the fighting. Kublai was hugely outnumbered. The Song dynasty was a \\"a monumental culture\\" of 70 million people, says Man, and 10 to 100 times stronger in military terms. The Mongols had to be clever. One major battle took place at Xiangyang, a city with impenetrable walls dominating the Han River, a tributary of the Yangtze. Having a porous sense of what is Chinese is itself part of the Chinese tradition \\"This turned into a sort of a mini Troy,\\" says Man. \\"The siege went on for five years. The Chinese could not break out, the Mongols could not break in. There were countless attempts to sneak in, to break in, to break out - all foiled. So there had to be some sort of a new initiative, and the initiative was suggested by the empire itself.\\" The Mongol empire, that is. Kublai's relatives ruled all the way to Eastern Europe and he had heard of great catapults the Christians had used during the Crusades. He summoned two Persian engineers, who built the equivalent of heavy artillery - a catapult that could sling 100kg (220lb) of rock over 200m-300m (650ft - 1,000ft). After a few shots to get the range, it brought down a mighty tower in a cloud of dust. The capture of the city allowed the Mongol fleets access to southern China which, for the first time, was taken by barbarians. Kublai, in fact, ruled over all of present-day China. Yunnan in the south-west bordering Vietnam and Burma, Xinjiang stretching into central Asia, and of course Tibet. It is paradoxical that the country owes its enormous size to invaders with expansionist ambitions. Kublai Khan's pleasure dome The Venetian merchant Marco Polo left a description of Kublai Khan's palace which, slightly shortened, goes like this: \\"It is enclosed all round by a great wall with five gates on its southern face, the middle one never opened on any occasion except when the Khan himself goes forth or enters. This is the greatest palace that ever was. The roof is very lofty, and the walls of the palace are all covered with gold and silver. The hall is so large that it could easily dine 6,000 people. The roof is vermilion, yellow, green and blue, the tiles fixed with a varnish so fine that they shine like crystal and can be seen from a great distance.\\" Kublai's capital was Beijing. The city today goes on putting up scaffolding and high-rises. But it was Kublai who gave it its first big makeover. He gave his dynasty a Chinese name, Yuan, and he ruled through a Chinese civil service. Chinese history has returned the compliment by absorbing the Mongol dynasty into its own imperial story - and absorbing part of Mongolia itself into the Chinese state. Today the Mongolians form one of China's 56 ethnic groups, along with Tibetans, Uighurs and the dominant Han. Having a porous sense of what is Chinese is itself part of the Chinese tradition. The same applies to innovations the barbarians brought with them and which China found useful. Chinese medicine absorbed Islamic medicine, points out Xun, \\"but they never talk about it\\". Galloping as they did from one end of Eurasia to the other, the Mongols had picked up plenty of useful novelties. \\"They introduced buttons,\\" says Verity Wilson, an expert on Chinese clothes and textiles. \\"Prior to this time, men and women had always closed their robes with some sort of belt. But, the Yuan dynasty is credited with bringing to China the toggle-and-loop button, which now today we just call Chinese. It's a real marker of Chinese dress that they're closed with these toggle-and-loop buttons. But they didn't really come in until the Yuan dynasty.\\" This process of assimilation has continued ever since. Chillies are a later example, arriving from the New World in the Ming dynasty of the 15th and 16th centuries. \\"But now they've been absolutely incorporated into the Chinese way of life, and we can't really think about Chinese cooking without chillies,\\" says Wilson. \\"And the other thing we think about is teapots. Teapots have very much become an item associated with China. But pre-Ming dynasty, there were no teapots in China. So I think all those things which we take to be quintessentially Chinese have actually been absorbed by the Chinese from other cultures.\\" The arrival of the bicycle some 500 years later was initially greeted with scorn. To begin with, it was only so-called \\"foreign devils\\" who rode them. No self-respecting Chinese gentleman - and even less a woman - would be seen sweating under their own locomotion. But soon it would become the Chinese worker's vehicle of choice. Just 50 years ago, if a Chinese had declared a preference for American food, it might have cost them their liberty, if not their life. China rid itself of Japanese occupation at the end of World War II and the communists had thrown out Westerners after 1949. Soon, even the Soviets were sent packing. It was part of the party's narrative of a united China standing up to foreign aggressors. But by the 1980s, foreigners were being welcomed back. Which is why, 20 years ago, I attended the opening of the first McDonald's restaurant in Beijing. Now it feels as if there is American fast food or coffee on every corner. Image caption McDonalds has more than 1,400 restaurants in China In some ways, today's penetration of foreign products - American fast food, German cars and Japanese electronics - mirrors that of a century ago when the colonial powers had forced open Chinese ports to trade. The difference is that this time it is at China's invitation. Columbus heads for China History throws up some very strange ironies. If it was not for Kublai Khan, the Western powers might never have got to China by the 19th Century. It was his legend which inspired the European age of exploration. \\"Because of Marco Polo's account of Kublai Khan, Columbus decided to head to China,\\" says John Man. \\"He headed west and discovered that China was not where he thought it was, that America was in the way and so in the end it was Kublai through Marco Polo that inspired Columbus to discover America.\\" Kublai's own dream of world domination would never be realised. Twice he launched an armada against Japan, the largest the world had ever seen or would ever see again until the Allied invasion of Europe 700 years later. And twice his navy was scattered by what the Japanese called their kamikaze, or \\"divine wind\\". The Mongol dream of world conquest sank with Kublai's ships. \\"He became old, he became fat, he became ill. His only son and heir died, his wife died, and he himself died in 1294 and left this part of the empire to his heirs, and none of them matched him in competence,\\" says Man. \\"So 80 years later, they were chased out in a revolution and went back to the grassland from which they originally emerged.\\" The revolution put a home-grown emperor on the throne, but only until the next foreign dynasty which again brought China new territory and ideas. The very last emperor of all loved bicycles, by the way. He is said to have removed doorstops in the Forbidden City so that he could cycle around, but that is another story. The point I want to make is that there is complicated history around what is Chinese… and what is not.

Question: Who fires Lansdale when the test boards deal off? Movie plot title: The Hand Movie plot: Jon Lansdale is finishing up a famous work of his called \\"Mandro\\", a Prince Valiant/Conan The Barbarian type of character. (In the film the actual \\"Mandro\\" artwork was drawn by real life Marvel Comics Conan artist Barry Windsor-Smith.) Lansdale is married to a beautiful woman named Anne (Andrea Marcovicci) and they have a child named Lizzie (played by Mara Hobel). While they are driving, Anne and Lansdale end up behind a slow-moving truck and an impatient driver behind them. In the heat of argument, Anne, who is driving, gets distracted and pulls out from behind the truck. Another truck comes up in the other lane. Anne attempts to get back behind the other truck but the impatient driver has pulled up too far. Lansdale waves his hand to the impatient driver to move back, and when she does not and Anne has to slam on the brakes, his hand is caught behind the truck, which also stops. The hand is severed completely in a bloody, violent scene. Anne attempts to find the severed hand but it is too late. Lansdale then starts a painful adjustment to not having his right hand, which so happened to be his drawing hand. Anne also adjusts to her guilt of being responsible for the accident and tries to get closer with Lansdale. In a separate instance, he attempts to find the hand himself but does find his signet ring that Anne gave him. They move to New York and Lansdale is approached by his friend and agent Karen Wagner (Rosemary Murphy) to co-produce his comic strip with another cartoonist. But when the test boards are discovered marked up, the deal is off and Karen fires Lansdale. Lansdale, however, is certain HE did not mark them up and questions his daughter about the incident. He also loses the signet ring once again. During his recovery, Lansdale discovers that Anne has started moving away from him like before the accident. He becomes jealous of Anne's yoga instructor and also seems to begin a slow descent into darkness when an encounter with a homeless man (played by writer/director Oliver Stone) leaves the man...

Which group of antelope is less adapted to the environment? In sub-Saharan Africa there are two predominant groups of antelope present. The first group of antelope, group A, have long necks and strong teeth. The second group of antelope, group B, have shorter necks and weaker teeth. Because of their longer necks and stronger teeth, the antelope from group A are more easily able to pick fruit and leaves from the tall trees in the region compared to antelope from group B. Hint: The theory of evolution by natural selection was proposed at about the same time by both Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace, shown in Figure below , and was set out in detail in Darwin's 1859 book On the Origin of Species . Natural selection is a process that causes heritable traits that are helpful for survival and reproduction to become more common, and harmful traits, or traits that are not helpful or advantageous for survival to become more rare in a population of organisms. This occurs because organisms with advantageous traits are more \\"fit\\" to survive in a particular environment and have \\"adapted\\" to the conditions of that environment. These individuals will have greater reproductive success than organisms less fit for survival in the environment. This will lead to an increase in the number of organisms with the advantageous trait(s) over time. Over many generations, adaptations occur through a combination of successive, small, random changes in traits, and natural selection of those variants best-suited for their environment. Natural selection is one of the cornerstones of modern biology. The answer is:","response":"The group of antelope that is less adapted to the environment is group B. To determine this, I examined the information provided in the given paragraph. It states that in sub-Saharan Africa, there are two primary groups of antelope- Group A and Group B. Group A has long necks and strong teeth, which allows them to easily pick fruits and leaves from tall trees in the region, while Group B, with their shorter necks and weaker teeth, struggle to do so. From this, we can infer that Group A is more \\"fit\\" for the environment they're in as they can utilize resources (like tall trees) that Group B cannot due to their physical attributes. This notion ties back to the theory of evolution by natural selection, also mentioned in the paragraph. According to this theory, traits that are advantageous for survival and reproduction become more common over time because they enhance an organism's fitness. Therefore, organisms with such traits are more \\"adapted\\" to their environment, and have greater reproductive success. In this context, the advantageous trait would be having long necks and strong teeth, which Group A possesses. As a result, they're likely to be more successful in this environment than Group B, making Group B the less adapted group."},{"question":"In this task, you're given passages that contain mentions of names of people, places, or things.

Passage: Owing to a long-running royalty disagreement, the Beatles were among the last major artists to sign deals with online music services. Residual disagreement emanating from Apple Corps' dispute with Apple, Inc., iTunes' owners, over the use of the name \\"Apple\\" was also partly responsible for the delay, although in 2008, McCartney stated that the main obstacle to making the Beatles' catalogue available online was that EMI \\"want[s] something we're not prepared to give them\\". In 2010, the official canon of thirteen Beatles studio albums, Past Masters, and the \\"Red: and \\"Blue\\" greatest-hits albums were made available on iTunes.In 2012, EMI's recorded music operations were sold to Universal Music Group. In order for Universal Music to acquire EMI, the European Union, for antitrust reasons, forced EMI to spin off assets including Parlophone. Universal was allowed to keep the Beatles' recorded music catalogue, managed by Capitol Records under its Capitol Music Group division. The entire original Beatles album catalogue was also reissued on vinyl in 2012; available either individually or as a box set.In 2013, a second volume of BBC recordings, titled On Air – Live at the BBC Volume 2, was released.

When a car bomb explodes outside one of Komarov's pharmaceutical companies, and a virus is stolen from inside, an investigation by the FSB ensues headed by FSB agents Sonia Astrova and Andrei Kasanov. Their investigation is obstructed by the Director of the FSB, Anatoly Grishin. A British Embassy worker from Moscow, Sir Nigel Irvine, tracks down Jason Monk, a former CIA operative, who ran double agents in the Soviet Union and convinces him to investigate the incident. Once in Moscow, Jason finds an old friend, Viktor Akopov, who agrees to hide Jason from Komarov's men.

Translate to Russian","response":"\\"Друзья, мы будем бороться за справедливость и правду!\\" Here is the comprehensive breakdown of the translation: 1. \\"Друзья\\" - This term stands for \\"Friends\\" in English. Russian language often uses a friendlier and more personal approach in communications, even when it comes to political or motivational speeches. Thus, the beginning of a speech with an intimate address to the audience helps to bond with them, make them feel involved, and ensure that they are valued and important. 2. \\"мы будем бороться\\" - This phrase translates as \\"we will fight\\". Here, \\"мы\\" means \\"we\\", \\"будем\\" is a future tense form of the auxiliary verb \\"be\\", and \\"бороться\\" is an infinitive form of the verb \\"to fight\\". In Russian language, the future tense is often formed by using the future form of the auxiliary verb “быть” (to be) and the infinitive of the main verb. 3. \\"за\\" - This preposition translates to \\"for\\" in English, used in the context of advocating or expressing support. 4. \\"справедливость\\" - This noun stands for \\"justice\\". The concept of justice plays a significant role in Russian society, being a frequent topic in Russian literature, arts, and public speeches. 5. \\"и\\" - This conjunction translates as \\"and\\". It is used to connect words of the same part of speech, clauses, or sentences that need to be considered together. 6. \\"правду\\" - Lastly, this word stands for \\"truth\\". Please note that in Russian language, nouns do change their endings to align with the grammatical rules of the language, which is why \\"правда\\" (truth) becomes \\"правду\\" in this specific syntax. The statement \\"Друзья, мы будем бороться за справедливость и правду!\\" is a powerful and direct call to action. Its purpose is to galvanize the listeners and inspire them to strive for justice and honesty. It carries strong emotional undertones, which would be especially effective during a speech or discourse aimed at motivating or mobilizing a group of people."},{"question":"What gangs rep which colors? What do the colors in the St. Louis Cardinals team represent? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","response":"Hey there, little buddy! Let me help you understand this. 1. Gangs that rep (represent) colors: Some groups of friends, called \\"gangs,\\" like to wear special colors to show they belong together. It's like having a team uniform! For example, two famous gangs are the \\"Crips\\" who wear a lot of blue clothes, and the \\"Bloods\\" who wear a lot of red clothes. But remember, it's not a good idea to be in a gang, as they may cause trouble. 2. Colors in the St. Louis Cardinals team: Sports teams also have their own special colors! The St. Louis Cardinals is a baseball team, and they wear red and white. The red color represents a bird called a \\"cardinal,\\" which is their team mascot, and the white color is often used in their uniforms to balance out the bold red. Now, about your last question: No, these two questions are not the same. The first one is about gangs and the colors they wear, while the second one is about a sports team and the colors in their uniforms.

The given sentence only mentions two people but does not specify their relationship or their feelings in that moment. They could be a couple, friends, family members, or even strangers. 2. While the sunset might be considered romantic by some, the sentence does not explicitly mention any romantic context. They could be simply amazed by the natural beauty of the landscape or just be there coincidentally at sunset. 3. Additionally, the term \\"enjoying\\" suggests a positive experience or emotion. In the given sentence, there is no information about the emotions or thoughts of the two people mentioned. It is possible that they are enjoying the moment, but it cannot be confirmed based on the provided information.

Let's break it down step by step: Premise: \\"Man on an atv catching air!\\". This implies that the man is riding an ATV (all-terrain vehicle) and is jumping or going over a bump, causing the ATV to become airborne momentarily. Hypothesis: \\"The atv is out of gas and stationary.\\" This implies that the ATV is not moving and has no fuel to operate.

While that information circulated within the FAA, we found no evidence that the hijacking was reported to any other agency in Washington before 8:46. Most federal agencies learned about the crash in New York from CNN. Within the FAA, the administrator, Jane Garvey, and her acting deputy, Monte Belger, had not been told of a confirmed hijacking before they learned from television that a plane had crashed. Others in the agency were aware of it, as we explained earlier in this chapter. Inside the National Military Command Center, the deputy director of operations and his assistant began notifying senior Pentagon officials of the incident. At about 9:00, the senior NMCC operations officer reached out to the FAA operations center for information. Although the NMCC was advised of the hijacking of American 11, the scrambling of jets was not discussed. In Sarasota, Florida, the presidential motorcade was arriving at the Emma E. Booker Elementary School, where President Bush was to read to a class and talk about education. White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card told us he was standing with the President outside the classroom when Senior Advisor to the President Karl Rove first informed them that a small, twin-engine plane had crashed into the World Trade Center. The President's reaction was that the incident must have been caused by pilot error. At 8:55, before entering the classroom, the President spoke to National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, who was at the White House. She recalled first telling the President it was a twin-engine aircraft-and then a commercial aircraft-that had struck the World Trade Center, adding \\"that's all we know right now, Mr. President.\\" At the White House, Vice President Dick Cheney had just sat down for a meeting when his assistant told him to turn on his television because a plane had struck the NorthTower of the World Trade Center. The Vice President was wondering \\"How the hell could a plane hit the World Trade Center\\" when he saw the second aircraft strike the South Tower. Elsewhere in the White House, a series of 9:00 meetings was about to begin. In the absence of information that the crash was anything other than an accident, the White House staff monitored the news as they went ahead with their regular schedules.

Step-by-step justification for the answer \\"200\\": 1. The human body consists of an intricate structure of interconnected bones that form a strong and flexible skeletal framework. 2. Bones in the human body are classified as long, short, flat, and irregular bones. 3. When considering the bone count in a typical adult human body, we usually state the number as 206 bones. 4. However, the adult human body and the body of an infant at birth have significantly different bone counts. 5. This disparity is due to the fact that some bones in infants have yet to fully fuse and later merge into single structures. In particular, bones in the skull, spine, and pelvis fuse and develop as a child grows. 6. At birth, a baby possesses more than 270 bones, which gradually decrease as the infant develops. 7. One of the major factors that contribute to this reduction is the conversion of some cartilaginous structures into bones through a process known as ossification. 8. For instance, the bones in a baby's skull are separated by fontanelles or \\"soft spots.\\" As the child matures, these fontanelles close up, and the bones fuse together. 9. Taking all these factors into account, a reasonable estimate for the number of bones present in a human body at birth is approximately 200 bones. 10. Thus, the answer \\"200\\" is justified as an estimation of the number of bones in a human body at birth."},{"question":"Answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.

If you see holes in one sweater, you'll probably find more.","response":"Cocoons, webbing, or tiny white larvae on clothes or nearby walls. These are indicators of a moth infestation, as the larvae are responsible for damaging the fabric. The presence of moth droppings, tiny cylindrical fecal pellets, may also indicate a moth problem. An unusual and musty odor in closets or drawers, which may make your clothes smell unpleasant even after washing. Now that you've gotten familiar with the signs of a moth infestation, here's how you can get rid of them effectively: 1. Clean and wash all clothing and fabrics: Take all affected clothes out from the closet or drawers and thoroughly wash or dry clean them. This will help kill off any larvae or eggs hidden within the fabric. Regularly vacuum your wardrobe, making sure to get into the corners and crevices to remove any eggs and cocoons. 2. Seal off non-washable items: Place non-washable items in an airtight container or sealed plastic bag and freeze them for several days. The freezing temperatures will kill off any moth eggs and larvae. Alternatively, you can place the items in direct sunlight for a few hours as the heat also can kill them. 3. Use moth traps: Pheromone-based moth traps can help you get rid of adult moths. These traps can be found at home improvement stores and are effective at attracting male moths, reducing their chances of reproducing. 4. Leverage natural repellents: Use natural moth repellents like cedarwood, lavender, or mothballs to deter moths from returning to your wardrobe. Cedarwood and cedar chips repel moths and can be added to drawers and closets. Lavender sachets or essential oils can also repel moths, but make sure to replace them regularly. 5. Get professional help: If your moth problem persists or you find that natural remedies aren't working, consider reaching out to a professional exterminator to address the issue. They can help you assess the extent of the infestation and provide a tailored solution to eliminate the pests. 6. Prevent moths from returning: Once you've gotten rid of the moths, you'll want to prevent them from coming back. Take preventative measures such as: - Regularly cleaning and vacuuming your home, especially closets and other areas with fabrics. - Regularly washing and airing out your clothes to eliminate any potential moth eggs or larvae that might be present. - Storing seasonal clothing in airtight containers or vacuum-sealed bags to protect them from moth infestation. - Maintaining low humidity levels in your home by using a dehumidifier or air conditioner, as moths thrive in humid environments.

Passage:Badree first played for an overseas Twenty20 franchise in January 2013, when he played for the Khulna Royal Bengals in the 2013 Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) season. Later in the year, he signed with the Rajasthan Royals for the 2013 Indian Premier League (IPL), although he played only a single game (against the Delhi Daredevils). In the 2014 IPL auction, Badree was bought by the Chennai Super Kings for US50,000. He went on to play four matches for the team during the 2014 season, but took only two wickets, with Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravi Jadeja being the preferred spin options. Later in 2014, Badree signed with the Brisbane Heat for the 2014–15 Big Bash League season in Australia. He was unable to play any matches due to a shoulder injury, but re-signed for the 2015–16 season. He struggled for form early in the season, going wicketless in his first three games, but eventually bounced back to finish as his team's leading wicket-taker, with nine wickets from eight matches. This included 5/22 in the final game of the season, against the Melbourne Stars. Links: a. 2014 Indian Premier League b. Brisbane Heat c. Chennai Super Kings d.

The statement indicates that the woman is dressed in formal clothing, which typically refers to attire that is appropriate for more elegant or sophisticated events and settings. Jeans are generally considered casual wear and are usually not associated with formal events or attire. Formal clothing for women may include garments such as evening gowns, cocktail dresses, tailored suits, or dressy separates. These clothing items are often made of luxurious fabrics, such as silk, satin, or fine wool, and may feature embellishments like lace, beads, or sequins to enhance their elegance. The style and level of formality may vary depending on the specific event or occasion, cultural norms and expectations, as well as personal preferences and fashion trends. Jeans, on the other hand, are typically made of denim, a casual fabric that is associated with everyday wear, leisure activities, and informal settings. While jeans can be dressed up with accessories or combined with more formal pieces for a smart-casual look, they are generally not considered appropriate attire for formal events where more refined and sophisticated clothing is expected. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the woman in the given scenario is wearing jeans based on the description provided. Her attire, being described as formal, is more likely to consist of outfits that are traditionally associated with evening wear, dressy events, or sophisticated occasions. To assert that she is wearing jeans, we would need additional contextual information, a specific mention of jeans within the description, or a deliberate clarification stating that the event has a unique dress code that accepts jeans as a part of formal attire."},{"question":"Q:In 1975, George Carlin appeared on a popular TV show, Saturday Night Live, with his famous words about blue food. \\"Why is there no blue food? I can't find blue food--I can't find the flavor of blue! I mean yellow is lemon; orange is orange and red is cherry. Where is the blue food? \\" Well, Carlin pretty much has it right--there's not no blue food, but there's certainly not a lot of it. Fresh-picked blueberries are blue, though they become purple when they are turned into jam. The blue in blueberries--like the purple in grapes and the red in tomatoes--is found in nature. But it isn't a hot color for food. People don't seem to prefer blue food. Some diet programs even suggest that those determined to lose weight should make their food blue. Eating, in part, begins with our eyes. Charles Spence--an experimental psychologist from Oxford University--points out that color can change our taste experience. Commonly, we consider red-colored foods up to 20% sweeter than they actually are; and green foods as being more sour. Spence suggests: human expectations may be influenced by our long history of watching - green fruits can become sweet as they grow up and turn red. But what about blue? Except blueberries, much of the blue food we see these days _ blue artificially. Food producers argue that artificial color doesn't do much harm to health. A lot of research shows that some physical problems of kids are related to food dyes--while other studies show no effects at all. Blue birthday cake or even blue-dyed chicken can be served on the dinner table. So what? Eating sometimes begins with our eyes because _ .

For example, we may perceive red-colored foods to be up to 20% sweeter than they actually are, and green foods as being more sour.

It involves a variety of considerations and steps, and knowing what the different physical objects are and how they are used is an essential part of the process. Firstly, understanding what the final product is supposed to look like is important. This requires knowledge of what a certain type of furniture looks like, for example, a chair, a table, or a bookshelf. The person performing the task must have a mental model of the object they are creating, which involves understanding of the physical attributes and characteristics of the objects involved. Secondly, knowing the function of each component is vital. A flatpack furniture set often contains several different types of components – panels, screws, dowels, brackets, and more. Knowledge of these physical objects is important in order to understand what each item is for and where it needs to go. For instance, knowing that screws are typically used to hold two pieces of material together, while dowels are often used for alignment. Next, the person needs a basic understanding of the tools required for assembly - screwdrivers, hammers, or maybe even an Allen wrench. Recognizing these items, knowing what they are called, and having an idea of how to use them is a fundamental part of the process. Also, having the ability to follow the detailed visual instructions that come with the flatpack would be impossible without knowing how to interpret two-dimensional drawings of the objects, and turn them into three-dimensional reality. Then there is the physical manipulation of the objects – moving them into the correct position, applying force to insert one part into another, maintaining balance and support of the objects while they are partially assembled, and so forth. Understanding the physicality of the objects, such as their weight and balance, is a crucial part of the task. Without knowledge of this, it would be very difficult to successfully build the piece of furniture. Lastly, problem-solving and critical thinking skills come into play when things don’t go as expected or there are missing or left-over pieces. Knowing how these physical objects work together, deducing where the problem originated, and finding a way to resolve it, are all parts of the process. Therefore, building a piece of furniture from a flatpack is a complex task that requires a deep understanding and knowledge of various physical objects for successful completion. This task is a perfect demonstration of how important physical object knowledge and understanding can be in practical, everyday activities."},{"question":"The other day I was semi - focussed on Kill Bill , starring Uma Thurman .

She is one of the youngest people who have arrived on top of Snowdon, Scafell Pike and Ben Nevis, the three highest mountains in Britain. Rebecca and her dad finished the climb, a total of about 11,000 feet (3,353 metres), in 23 hours and 15 minutes. That includes the time spent driving to each mountain: a distance of 500 miles! Climbing isn't new to this schoolgirl. She took her first trip up a mountain in her dad's backpack when she was just six months old! \\"One of the best parts about this climb was Scafell Pike,\\" said Rebecca. \\"I've never walked in the dark before, and it was fun seeing all the sheep eyes as they ran around in the dark.\\" Rebecca brought along food, water, a medical kit , a hat, a map, a lamp, a camera to take photos and even a mobile phone in case something went wrong. Along the way, she and her dad had fun by making up mountain songs. \\"All my friends like to stay inside playing computer games, but I like being outdoors best,\\" says Rebecca.

Turn on your TV as soon as the pre-game starts. Place a friendly bet on the game’s outcome for extra fun. Play a Super Bowl drinking game so even non-fans are invested. Set up a beer pong game for guests who want to be active. Hand out commercial bingo sheets to every guest.","response":"Sure, kiddo! Let's imagine we're planning a real fun party for the Super Bowl, and we want everyone to have a really good time. Remember, you're too young to do some of these things, like the drinking games, but we can still talk about them. First, we need to make sure everyone can see the television. Do you know when you sit on the floor to watch your favorite cartoon? It's exactly like that, but it's grown-ups watching a football game on the television. So we need to move the chairs and sofas around the TV. The idea is to create a cozy and comfortable place like a mini movie theater. Super fun, huh? Now, remember when we turn on the television to watch your favorite show as soon as it begins? The same goes for the grown-ups; they would start watching the television as soon as the pre-game show starts. This is because they are excited about the game, just like you get excited for the new episode of your cartoon. Next up, you know how we play board games, and the winner gets a small treat as a prize? Similarly, adults might place a friendly bet on what team might win the game. It makes the game more exciting, just like a surprise at the end of your game. Okay, now this part is a bit tricky because it's for adults only. It's like a drinking game, and how it works is that whenever something specific happens in the game, like a touchdown or a penalty, the adults take a sip of their drink. This way, even the ones who are not big fans of the sport can have a kind of fun game to play. Now let's imagine a fun game of ping pong. The adults can play a game called beer pong which is similar but instead of hitting the ball in a direction they try to hit it into cups filled with beer. It's an activity for people who like to keep playing while watching the game. Remember how we play bingo? The Super Bowl party can have something similar too. The adults get bingo sheets, however, they aren't listening for numbers. The squares on their sheets have different things that might happen during the Superbowl commercials, like if a dog appears in a commercial or someone says a specific word. Just like you look for your numbers, they look for these to get a bingo! All in all, it's all about having fun and enjoying the party, just like you would at a birthday party with your friends.

Chinese people \\"cross roads without thinking about traffic lights, so long as they are part of a crowd\\", said a post on Sina Weibo. A CCTV news program showed that in only an hour, more than 600 people ran red lights when crossing a road in Shijiazhuang, Hebei. Many people say that they jaywalk because the red light lasts too long. Such an opinion is supported by a research team at Tongji University. The team did research on people's waiting times at different road crossings from 2008 to 2010. They found that Chinese people would wait for 70 to 90 seconds before they lost their patience. \\"People are likely to run the red light when the waiting time is longer than they can bear ,\\"said Ni Ying, a member of the research team. However, a survey on Sina Weibo shows that nearly half of respondents believe that people jaywalk mainly because they disregard rules. \\"I always obey traffic rules.

He first takes Iron Bar A and puts it out on his porch on a rainy day. Then he puts Iron bar B in an airtight bag and removes all of the oxygen and air to vacuum seal it. After some time passes the bar he left outside is completely covered in rust. He removes the bar in the vacuum sealed bag and to his surprise it has no rust at all. Because there was no oxygen and water in the air tight bag, iron bar B has no rust at all. Iron bar A was exposed to a lot of water and oxygen and there for it rusted completely. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which iron bar was exposed to more water and oxygen, Iron Bar A or Iron Bar B? Hint: Iron is first oxidized to iron(II) ions by oxygen. In the second step, the iron(II) ions are further oxidized and combine with water and oxygen gas to produce a hydrated form of iron(III) oxide known as rust. Rusting is one of many example of corrosion. Corrosion is the deterioration of metals by redox processes. Corrosion causes enormous amounts of damage to buildings, bridges, ships, cars, and other objects. It has been estimated that corrosion costs the U.S. economy over 100 billion dollars each year.

A subscribes 1/3 of the capital B 1/4, C 1/5 and D the rest. How much share did A get in a profit of Rs.2460? Options: (A) 750 (B) 277 (C) 262 (D) 231 (E) 123 Let's think first. Some random reasoning:","response":"To find the share of A in the profit, we first need to determine the share of each partner in terms of fractions and then apply those shares to the profit amount. Given: A subscribes 1/3 of the capital. B subscribes 1/4 of the capital. C subscribes 1/5 of the capital. D subscribes the rest of the capital. Since A, B, and C together subscribe (1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5) of the capital, let's calculate this sum: LCM of 3, 4, and 5 = 60 (20/60) + (15/60) + (12/60) = (20+15+12)/60 = 47/60 Now, A, B, and C together subscribe 47/60 of the capital. Therefore, D subscribes the rest of the capital, which is: 1 - 47/60 = 13/60 Now we have the following shares for A, B, C and D in the capital: A: 1/3 (20/60) B: 1/4 (15/60) C: 1/5 (12/60) D: 13/60 Next, we need to find the share of A in the profit of Rs.2460. The profit amount must be divided among all the partners in the same proportion as their shares in the capital. So let's calculate A's share of the profit: A's share = (A's capital share) x (total profit) A's share = (20/60) x Rs.2460 To get the value of A's share, we now need to multiply the fraction (20/60) by Rs.2460: A's share = (20/60) x Rs.2460 = (1/3) x Rs.2460 = Rs.820 Therefore, A got Rs.820 in the profit of Rs.2460.

The premise provided recounts the experience of convincing someone to go see the movie \\"Rain Man.\\" The initial reluctance of this individual indicates that they may not have been immediately enthusiastic about watching the film. The statement \\"it was like pulling teeth to go get him to see it\\" implies difficulty in persuading him to watch the movie. However, it is mentioned that this person eventually gave \\"the best response that I've heard him give of this type of movie for Rain Man.\\" This suggests that his reaction to the movie was surprisingly positive, compared to other similar movies he has watched. Additionally, the statement \\"he said he enjoyed it\\" directly reflects that the person positively described his experience watching the movie \\"Rain Man,\\" supporting the hypothesis. While it is worth noting that this person only saw the movie one time and did not return for a second viewing, their expressed enjoyment provides evidence to validate the hypothesis \\"He said that he enjoyed seeing Rain Man.\\" as true."},{"question":"Kevin Hart Opens Up About His Painful Childhood and Ex-Drug Addict Dad : People.com 01/12/2016 AT 08:00 PM EST had a difficult childhood, but if he could do it all over again, he wouldn't change a thing. \\"I wouldn't change it one bit,\\" he says on His father was a serious drug addict: \\"heroin, coke, crack, you name it, he did it,\\" Hart says, \\"nothing else mattered [to him].\\" During one of his childhood birthdays, Hart says his dad even stole 20 someone had given him as a present.

Compare the subjects: - Simon Butler (d. 1755) in Sentence 1 - Simon Mathews (b. 1755) in Sentence 2 The subjects have different names and different life events associated with them (death and birth, respectively), so the subjects are different. 2.

Compare the qualifiers: - Both individuals are defined as Welsh immigrants and came with their cousin.

She had studied it in school, so she thought herself as an expert. I once had a neighbor who played it constantly, loudly, and badly, so I thought I knew it better. Malaquez tried to mediate, but I saw him as siding with Tasha. So, I think, did she. The subject shifted from music to Tasha's obsession with fame, undoubtedly by a leap that I made. She had no choice but to follow. (I do not remember any of this well, just now, nor do I care to. Those who are truly curious may look at the last act of \\"Captured Moments.\\") I remember suggesting, with characteristic tact, that she add Emil to her small list of major accomplishments. Malaquez glanced away, embarrassed. Tasha looked at me as if to say, \\"I will.\\" She said, \\"I feel sorry for you, Nardo.

Think carefully first, then make a decision:","response":"To determine if seven McDonald's hamburgers exceed the USDA recommended fat allowance, we first need to know the fat content of one McDonald's hamburger and the recommended daily fat intake. According to the McDonald's website, a basic hamburger has approximately 8 grams of total fat, with 3 grams of saturated fat. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2020-2025 suggests that adults should consume 25-35% of their daily calorie intake from fat. Assuming a daily calorie intake of 2000 calories, the recommended fat intake would be between 56 and 78 grams per day. Now, let's calculate the total fat content of seven McDonald's hamburgers: 7 hamburgers × 8 grams of fat per hamburger = 56 grams of total fat. By consuming seven McDonald's hamburgers, an individual would intake 56 grams of total fat, which is within the USDA recommended fat allowance (25-35% of daily calories) for someone on a 2000 calorie diet. However, it's important to note that this calculation does not account for any other fat sources consumed during the day. It's also worth noting that the saturated fat content in these hamburgers (21 grams) is almost close to the American Heart Association's recommendation of less than 22 grams of saturated fat per day for someone on a 2000 calorie diet. In conclusion, whereas seven McDonald's hamburgers do not necessarily exceed the USDA's recommended total fat allowance, this consumption does get close to the saturated fat limit suggested for a 2000 calorie daily diet. It's essential for individuals to monitor other sources of fat (especially saturated fat) consumed throughout the day to maintain a balanced and healthy diet."},{"question":"English Conversation Leader: Mandi Ashmore english@ iwc-lausanne. org We meet on Mondays at 14:30 at the IWC clubhouse.

He occasionally sang lead vocals, usually for one song on an album, including \\"With a Little Help from My Friends\\", \\"Yellow Submarine\\", \\"Good Night\\", and their cover of \\"Act Naturally\\". He also wrote the Beatles' songs \\"Don't Pass Me By\\" and \\"Octopus's Garden\\", and is credited as a co-writer of others, including \\"What Goes On\\" and \\"Flying\\". Starr was twice afflicted by life-threatening illnesses during childhood, and he fell behind in school as a result of prolonged hospitalisations. Starr and the other members of the Beatles were appointed Members of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1965 Birthday Honours; they received their insignia from Queen Elizabeth II at an investiture at Buckingham Palace on 26 October. He and the other Beatles were cumulatively nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Newcomer for their performances in the 1964 film A Hard Day's Night. In 1971, the Beatles received an Academy Award for Best Original Song Score for the film Let It Be. The minor planet 4150 Starr, discovered on 31 August 1984 by Brian A. Skiff at the Anderson Mesa Station of the Lowell Observatory, was named in Starr's honour. Starr was nominated for a 1989 Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Performer in a Children's Series for his role as Mr. Conductor in the television series Shining Time Station. In 2015, twenty-three years after he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as one of the Beatles, Starr became the last Beatle to be inducted for a solo career. During the 50th Grammy Awards, Starr, George Martin and his son Giles accepted the Best Compilation Soundtrack award for Love. On 9 November 2008, Starr accepted a Diamond Award on behalf of the Beatles during the 2008 World Music Awards ceremony in Monaco. On 8 February 2010, he was honoured with the 2,401st star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce. It is located at 1750 North Vine Street, in front of the Capitol Records building, as are the stars for Lennon, McCartney and Harrison. Starr was appointed a Knight Bachelor in the 2018 New Year Honours for services to music.

Reviewing the album for Esquire, Gary Giddins hailed it as another landmark recording from Coleman and his most accomplished work of harmolodics, partly because of compositions which he found clearly expressed and occasionally timeless. In his opinion, the discordant keys radically transmute conventional polyphony and may be the most challenging part for listeners, who he said should concentrate on Coleman's playing and \\"let the maelstrom resolve itself around his center\\". Giddins also highlighted the melody of \\"Sleep Talk\\", deeming it among the best of the saxophonist's career. Kofi Natambu from the Detroit Metro Times wrote that Coleman's synergetic approach displays expressive immediacy rather than superficial technical flair while calling the record \\"a multi-tonal mosaic of great power, humor, color, wit, sensuality, compassion and tenderness\\". He found the songs inspirational, danceable, and encompassing developments in African-American music over the previous century. Robert Christgau called its \\"warm, listenable harmolodic funk\\" an artistic \\"breakthrough if not a miracle\\". He found its exchange of rhythms and simple melodies heartfelt and sophisticated, writing in The Village Voice, \\"the way the players break into ripples of song only to ebb back into the tideway is participatory democracy at its most practical and utopian.\\"Purist critics in jazz complained about the music's incorporation of danceable beats and electric guitar. In Stereo Review, Chris Albertson deemed the combination of saxophone and bizarre funk occasionally captivating but ultimately unfocused. Dan Sullivan of the Los Angeles Times believed the album's supporters in \\"hip rock circles\\" had overlooked flaws, arguing that Tacuma and Coleman's playing sound like a unique \\"beacon of clarity\\" amid an incessant background.

In the first sentence, \\"The country set,\\" the word \\"set\\" refers to a group of people - often of a specific social class, interest, or lifestyle - that forms a distinctive, informal group. In this context, the \\"country set\\" most likely refers to a group of people who share a common interest in country life, outdoor activities, and events typical of a rural or country setting. The word \\"set\\" in this case represents a social context. In the second sentence, \\"He did four sets of the incline bench press,\\" the word \\"set\\" refers to a grouping of repetitions of a specific exercise. In the context of weightlifting or exercise routines, \\"set\\" is a term used to describe a series of repetitions performed without stopping or resting. For example, if a person performs 10 repetitions of an exercise, takes a break, and then does another 10 repetitions, they have completed two sets of the exercise. The word \\"set\\" in this scenario represents an exercise context. These two meanings are quite distinct, even though the word \\"set\\" is used in both sentences. This showcases the versatility of the English language, where words can adopt various meanings depending on the specific context in which they are being used."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: This article: The first live performance of the Ray Davies Quartet, the band that would become the Kinks, was at a dance for their school, William Grimshaw, in 1962. The band performed under several names between 1962 and 1963—the Pete Quaife Band, the Bo-Weevils, the Ramrods, and the Ravens—before settling on the Kinks in early 1964. Ray has stated that a performance at Hornsey Town Hall on Valentine's Day 1963 was when the band were truly born. The Kinks made their first tour of Australia and New Zealand in January 1965 as part of a \\"package\\" bill that included Manfred Mann and the Honeycombs. They performed and toured relentlessly, headlining package tours throughout 1965 with performers such as the Yardbirds and Mickey Finn. Tensions began to emerge within the band, expressed in incidents such as the on-stage fight between drummer Mick Avory and Dave Davies at The Capitol Theatre, Cardiff, Wales on 19 May. After finishing the first song, \\"You Really Got Me\\", Davies insulted Avory and kicked over his drum set. Avory responded by hitting Davies with his hi-hat stand, rendering him unconscious, before fleeing from the scene, fearing that he had killed his bandmate. Davies was taken to Cardiff Royal Infirmary, where he received 16 stitches to his head. To placate police, Avory later claimed that it was part of a new act in which the band members would hurl their instruments at each other. Following their summer 1965 American tour, the American Federation of Musicians refused permits for the group to appear in concerts in the United States for the next four years, possibly due to their rowdy on-stage behaviour.In April 1969 Davies helped negotiate an end to the American Federation of Musician ban on the group, which allowed plans for a North American tour. However, over the next few years, Davies went into a state of depression, not helped by his collapsing marriage, culminating in his onstage announcement that he was \\"sick of it all\\" at a gig in White City Stadium in 1973.

To make things easier for him he chose two elements from the table, element A and element B. Element A has higher electronegativity and element B has lower eletronegativity. David found it easier to learn about elements by comparing their properties. Which element would have more protons in the nucleus, element A or element B? Answer:","response":"The number of protons in the nucleus, also known as the atomic number, determines an element's position in the periodic table. Generally, electronegativity increases as you move across a period from left to right and decreases as you move down a group. So if element A has a higher electronegativity than element B, it is likely located more to the right and/or higher up in the periodic table, meaning it would have more protons in the nucleus. Therefore, element A would have more protons in the nucleus than element B."},{"question":"Translate the following sentence to Czech: 3. COMMENTS ON THE COMMON POSITION 3.1. Czech:","response":"3.

Realize that 'You' are consciousness.\\"","response":"Title: Embracing the Power of Consciousness: Moving Deeply into the Now Introduction: The human mind often finds itself lost in a tangled web of thoughts, memories, and future plans. However, the true essence of our being lies in living in the present moment. A simple yet profound idea to achieve this state is to move deeply into the Now and realize that 'You' are consciousness itself. This article delves into the transformative power of this realization and how it can help us live a more balanced, fulfilling, and mindful life. Step 1: Understanding Consciousness Before we explore how we can access the power of being present and embracing consciousness, it is essential to understand what consciousness is. Consciousness is the state of being aware, capable of thought, perception, and feeling. It is your mind's subjective experience of the world that creates your reality. Embracing the idea that 'You' are consciousness helps us realize that we are not just separate individuals confined to physical bodies, but a collective field of awareness experiencing the world through various perspectives. Step 2: Accepting the Present Moment One of the most crucial elements of moving deeply into the Now is accepting the present moment as it is. Many people spend most of their lives trapped in the regrets of the past or the anxieties of the future, thereby missing the beauty and depth of life happening right now. Acceptance doesn't mean giving up; instead, it means acknowledging the current situation without judgment, resistance, or denial. Step 3: Redirecting Your Attention To move deeply into the Now, start by redirecting your attention to the present moment. Pay attention to your breath, your bodily sensations, and the sounds and sights around you. This practice helps you withdraw focus from the continuous loop of thoughts and take refuge in the peace and silence of the present moment. Step 4: Engaging in Mindful Activities Incorporating mindfulness into everyday activities, such as walking, cooking, or even washing dishes, can help bring your attention to the present moment. For example, when you walk, observe each step, feel the ground beneath your feet, and notice the rhythm of your breath. These simple acts will gradually enhance your awareness of the present and deepen your connection with the Now. Step 5: Cultivating Gratitude and Compassion By embracing our consciousness, we can develop a greater sense of gratitude for the present moment and deepen our connections with others. As we become more in tune with our conscious selves, our compassion grows. We become more sensitive to the feelings and needs of others, and their suffering becomes ours. This interconnectedness propels us to serve and help others and fosters a more harmonious and compassionate society. Conclusion: Moving deeply into the Now and realizing that 'You' are consciousness is a powerful idea for leading a mindful and transformative life. By cultivating presence, fully embracing the present moment, and developing a deeper connection with our true self and others, we can unlock the potential to live a more balanced, fulfilled, and blissful existence."},{"question":"Math Problem Solve 1503*r + 4601 - 8502 + 32166 = -21334 for r.","response":"To solve this equation for r, we'll follow step-by-step procedures to isolate r. The equation is: 1503*r + 4601 - 8502 + 32166 = -21334 Step 1: Combine the constants on the left side of the equation. 4601 - 8502 + 32166 = 23665 So our equation now looks like this: 1503*r + 23665 = -21334 Step 2: Subtract the constant 23665 from both sides to isolate the term with r. 1503*r = -21334 - 23665 1503*r = -44999 Step 3: Divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of r, which is 1503. r = -44999 / 1503 Step 4: Calculate the value of r. r ≈ -29.94 So the solution is r ≈ -29.94."},{"question":"Here is some data about a restaurant: name = Strada, priceRange = £20-25, customer rating = 3 out of 5, familyFriendly = no.

We introduce our main characters: a small-town detective named Sarah, a renowned chef named Antonio, the ship's captain Justin, and a diverse group of passengers, each with their individual backgrounds, motives, and secrets. Step 2: The incident On the second night of the voyage, a large number of passengers fall sick, experiencing severe food poisoning. The common link between them is that they all ate one of the meal options at the exclusive gala dinner held earlier that evening. Step 3: Investigation begins Sarah, the detective, is called in to find out what caused the food poisoning, as the situation falls under her jurisdiction. The captain, Justin, coordinates with her and provides her access to the kitchen, staff, and passenger manifests. Step 4: Unraveling the mystery Sarah interviews the affected passengers and confirms that the poisoned dish was, in fact, a seafood platter prepared by Chef Antonio. Antonio is questioned and claims that he prepared the dish according to standard procedure, with fresh ingredients, and maintains his innocence. Step 5: Background checks and discovering motives Sarah begins to look into the backgrounds of the passengers and crew members, seeking any potential motives or connections to the incident. During her investigation, she discovers that a few passengers have criminal records or suspicious past activities, including fraud, theft, and even poisoning. These passengers become her primary suspects. Step 6: Distractions and red herrings As the investigation continues, several red herrings emerge, such as false confessions and planted evidence, to divert Sarah's attention. However, she remains undeterred in her pursuit of the truth. Step 7: Tension and climax The tension escalates as Sarah narrows down her suspects and confronts each of them, but none provide concrete evidence of involvement. Gradually, the poisoned passengers begin to recover, leading to the belief that the perpetrator will get away with the crime. But Sarah discovers a crucial clue in the form of security footage, where one of the suspects is seen tampering with the seafood before it was prepared by Chef Antonio. Step 8: Resolution and aftermath Sarah apprehends the perpetrator, revealing their motive – a twisted form of revenge against another passenger who has caused them great suffering in the past and happened to be among those poisoned. The passengers' food poisoning incident was an elaborate setup to target one specific individual. In the end, the movie reaches its conclusion as the suspect is taken into custody, and the ship resumes its journey, albeit with a renewed sense of caution and appreciation for the fragility of human life."},{"question":"Question: Norm and Ian were two brothers. Norm was a totally normal individual, while Ian had Down syndrome. Their parents loved them both equally. Which brother had an extra complete chromosome 21? Hint: One of the most common chromosome abnormalities is Down syndrome , due to nondisjunction of chromosome 21 resulting in an extra complete chromosome 21, or part of chromosome 21 ( Figure below ). Down syndrome is the only autosomal trisomy where an affected individual may survive to adulthood. Individuals with Down syndrome often have some degree of mental retardation, some impairment of physical growth, and a specific facial appearance. With proper assistance, individuals with Down syndrome can become successful, contributing members of society. The incidence of Down syndrome increases with maternal age. The risk of having a child with Down syndrome is significantly higher among women age 35 and older. Answer:","response":"The brother who had an extra complete chromosome 21 was Ian. This statement can be supported by the hint provided, which narrates that Down syndrome is one of the common chromosome abnormalities that result from \\"nondisjunction\\" of chromosome 21, leading to either an extra complete chromosome 21 or part of chromosome 21. The scenario depicted above closely matches with that of the two brothers. Norm was described as a totally normal individual, which typically implies someone without any known genetic or developmental anomalies. On the other hand, Ian was characterized as having Down syndrome. Down syndrome is an autosomal trisomy condition that allows the affected individual to survive into adulthood, even though they might face some degree of mental retardation, physical growth impairment, and distinctive facial features. It is the result of an additional copy of chromosome 21, which alters the typical development of the individual. The extra genetic material impacts every aspect of development, leading to characteristic physical abnormalities, cognitive difficulties, and a general slowing of physical growth. While living with Down syndrome can pose significant challenges, with adequate support and assistance, individuals with Down syndrome can achieve considerable success and contribute positively to society. They can pursue education, work, participate in decisions that affect them, have relationships, vote, and contribute to society in many wonderful ways. Further, it is important to note that the incidence of Down syndrome increases with maternal age. Women aged 35 and older carry a significantly higher risk of having a child with Down syndrome. However, because younger women generally have more children, about 80% of children with Down syndrome are born to women under 35 years of age. In conclusion, based on the provided hint and understanding of Down syndrome, it is clear that Ian, the brother with Down syndrome, had an additional complete chromosome 21, because such a condition is a key characteristic of Down syndrome."},{"question":"Premise: A guy wearing a blue t-shirt, a green and white hat, shorts and sandals is cleaning out an enclosed pool.

Article: We know, painkillers in a tablet can make your headache go away, and antibiotic from a tube can prevent your cuts from becoming infected. Can medicine come in chicken eggs? A team of scientists from Scotland says \\"yes.\\" They've kept some special chickens that lay eggs with disease-treating drugs inside. These drugs are made of molecules called proteins. Animals make thousands of proteins--they're the main ingredients in skin, hair, milk, and meat. Since animals can make proteins easily, they're good animals for making protein drugs. Researchers have already made cows, sheep, and goats that pump out protein drugs in their milk. But chickens are cheaper to take care of, need less room, and grow faster than these other animals. \\"Those qualities could make chickens a better choice to become living drug factories.\\" says Simon Lillico of the Roslin Institute near Edinburgh, Scotland. Lillico and a team of researchers changed chickens' DNA--the code that tells cells how to make proteins--so that the birds' cells made two protein drugs. One drug can treat skin cancer, and the other treats a nerve disease called multiple sclerosis. The scientists changed the chickens' DNA so that the birds made these drugs only in their egg whites. This protects the chickens' bodies from the drugs' possible harmful effects and makes it easy for scientists to collect the drugs. These special chickens can pass on their drug-laying abilities to their chicks. So far, the Scottish researchers have kept five generations of drug-producing chickens. But the scientists need to improve these chickens. The chickens don't make enough drugs to treat people yet. Once the researchers perfect their technique, you might eventually take your medicine from chicken eggs. Question: Which of the following is Not True according to the passage? - It takes much shorter time for chickens to grow than cows, sheep and goats. - Compared to cows, sheep and goats, chickens are less expensive to be raised. - Chickens can produce the best quality of drugs among the drug-producing animals. - Chickens are smaller in size than cows, sheep and goats and therefore need less room. A:","response":"Chickens can produce the best quality of drugs among the drug-producing animals."},{"question":"How does the sentence end?

Christopher isn't a plumber himself, so it wouldn't make sense for Matthew to call Christopher for help with plumbing. Step 1: Identify the subject who needs help with plumbing (Christopher) Step 2: Recognize that Matthew is the one with plumbing skills Step 3: Determine who should call whom based on the context, logically Christopher calls Matthew, since Matthew has the skills needed. So the sentence should end with: Christopher called him to fix his sink."},{"question":"Doresc, de asemenea, să evidenţiez faptul că am întocmit un registru. Translate to English","response":"I would also like to point out that I have compiled a registry. In this sentence, the speaker is emphasizing that they have created a registry, which is a collection of records or data. This could refer to a variety of situations, such as compiling a list of people, items, or resources. The term \\"registry\\" is often used when referring to official or organized records, and creating a registry can serve different purposes, such as better organization, improved communication, or facilitating collaboration between different entities. The process of compiling a registry typically involves several steps: 1.

The man leading the Royal Ontario Museum’s effort to dismember and transport those remains to Toronto says he must review plans to handle both carcasses. “My commitment when I came in was to do at least one whale and my hope is to do both of them,” Mark Engstrom, deputy director of collections and research for the museum, said during a break from the huge, smelly job. “We’re doing the Trout River whale and then I have to reassess my budget and see where I am in terms of whether or not I can actually do the Rocky Harbour whale,” he said. “I’ve incurred a few expenses that I hadn’t expected so it’s going to be tight to do both whales.” Those extra costs include towing the first carcass from Trout River to adjacent Woody Point where it could more easily be worked on, Engstrom said. The second body is still resting in shallow water near the Rocky Harbour fish plant in Gros Morne National Park. They are among nine rare and endangered whales that became trapped in pack ice earlier this spring. It’s believed they were either crushed or drowned as they tried to surface to breathe. Removing pieces of bone. This one is a piece of the spinal cord. @romtoronto #bluewhale http://t.co/NWktYM92gE — (@ROMBiodiversity) May 09, 2014 Rocky Harbour Mayor Walter Nicolle had expressed relief when the museum offered to add the whales to its collection and make scientific data available to global researchers. Local officials had raised concerns about health hazards and the impact on crucial tourism if the carcasses were left to rot. “We’re only a small town,” Nicolle said earlier this month. “We don’t have a budget large enough to take care of that whale.” But Engstrom, who has dealt with the remains of several other whale species, said even he was surprised at the huge challenge posed by the biggest animal on the planet. Squawking sea gulls feasted Sunday as Engstrom’s team of museum staff and several local men used flensing knives to remove tonnes of blubber and skeletal muscle from the 23-metre female whale. She is now exposed past her enormous rib cage as her bones are removed, labelled and stored in an 18-wheel truck. The stench has been powerful enough at times that even seasoned fishermen have gagged. Woody Point Mayor Ken Thomas approved the messy project as long as it was done in five days, ending Monday. He doubts the community of 300 could have taken on such a task alone. “Looking at the magnitude of the job and getting to understand the skill sets that are required, it’s highly unlikely that this could have been done with a local effort. “The cost is certainly piling up.” Engstrom declined to discuss budget details. But he had said in an earlier interview that expenses to be absorbed by the museum would reach tens of thousands of dollars and he hoped they wouldn’t exceed 100,000. Local businesswoman Jenny Parsons is part of the new Trout River Blue Whale Committee that wants to establish its own exhibit. The idea that both whales would go to Ontario was seen by many residents as a lost opportunity. But as the federal government passed responsibility to the province and provincial officials stayed quiet, the museum stepped in. “It’s this once-in-a-lifetime event and we would hope and keep our fingers crossed that nothing like this ever happens to the blue whale population ever again,” Parsons said in an interview. “But I believe from the tragic event there can be a very positive outcome for this, not only for the Royal Ontario Museum but also for the town of Trout River. “With the fishery dying more each day, and with the cutbacks that government is giving us, this blue whale exhibit in the enclave of a national park could be nothing but a positive thing for this little town.” The big question is who would pay to take responsibility for the second whale. Parsons’ group hasn’t got to that point yet. They want to start a non-profit corporation and see about raising funds and resources. Northwest Atlantic blue whales are endangered with an estimated population of just 250 before the nine known deaths. ||||| It’s been a tough, awe-inspiring and stinky operation – and by the time it’s over, the biggest animal to grace the Earth will be packed into travel-sized parts on an unlikely journey across Canada. Workers expect to complete the transformation of a blue whale from sea-dwelling leviathan to highway cargo on Tuesday, the latest chapter in a tragic and curious tale that has travelled the globe. The dead whale was one of nine caught in unusually heavy sea ice this spring, and one of two to wash ashore in Newfoundland. Towed by trawler from the community of Trout River to Woody Point, it is being dissected by a team headed by Mark Engstrom, an evolutionary biologist at the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto. The task of carving and dismantling a whale carcass is not simple – workers have faced hail, cold, marauding seagulls and a stench described at best as gut-wrenching – but Mr. Engstrom sees the exercise as being all in the service of science. He is collecting the bones as well as tissue samples to make them available for researchers. “It is a positive from the tragedy of the death,” he said Monday while taking a break from the job. “It’s very unfortunate that the whales died, but we’re trying to get as much information as we can out of this animal, so that it comes to some good use.” Beheld, the blue whale is an animal of superlatives. It can stretch to 30 metres and weigh up to 180 tonnes. Its tongue is as heavy as an entire elephant, its heart as hefty as a car. On Monday, the team was taking apart the last part of the beast’s skeleton – the skull, which is so large it will probably require its own transport truck. “The animal is absolutely gigantic. I’m awed by the physical size,” said Mr. Engstrom, who should know – he more typically studies mice and bats. On Monday, Mr. Engstrom had also stripped the carcass of a blood vessel. “I could put my head inside of it,” he said over the phone. “And I have a big head.” The fate of the second beached whale remains uncertain. Mr. Engstrom says he is likely to know by Tuesday whether he will have the funds to relocate and dismantle the animal, which is in the town of Rocky Harbour. He said he has come up against “unexpected” costs, including the towing operation from Trout River and the price of burying the whale blubber in a local landfill. Each specimen is considered a gift to researchers. Only about 250 blue whales remain in the North Atlantic, the remnants of a once-thriving population devastated by whaling. The nine whales killed this year represent about 5 per cent of the entire North Atlantic population, Mr. Engstrom said. “Blue whales are extremely rare. The population just hasn’t been recovering,” he said. “I think we really have to be super careful about anything that we introduce into their environment, because we might lose them. We can’t assume that they’ll be okay.” Ultimately, Mr. Engstrom, deputy director of collections and research at the ROM, would like to see the whale skeleton put on display at the museum. (That possibility remains in the distant future, since it takes years to fully strip the skeleton.) Transporting the Earth’s largest animal across a portion of the world’s second-largest country was never going to be easy. Each bone is being loaded by front-end loader into a tractor trailer and wrapped in plastic. The tissue samples, meanwhile, will travel in liquid nitrogen by plane. But Mr. Engstrom considers the undertaking a fitting reflection of the nation. “Whales are very iconic for Canada. We have three coasts, and there are whales on each of them,” he said. “They’re something Canadians can relate to.” |||||Summary:","response":"In Newfoundland, a team led by Mark Engstrom, the deputy director of collections and research for the Royal Ontario Museum, is working to dismember and transport the remains of two giant blue whales that washed ashore on the island's west coast. While their plan was initially to transport both specimens, budget constraints may limit the operation to one.

Daniel Miller. UPDATED:. 06:45 EST, 17 February 2012. Nerves of steel: Nik Wallenda will be the first to tightrope walk over the falls for a century. It may not have been the most appropriate choice of phrase. But when Nik Wallenda was told he was to be allowed to attempt a tightrope walk across Niagara Falls, he said: ‘I’m thrilled to death.’ If the 33-year-old daredevil survives his 1,800ft-long walk on a two-inch thick rope over the famous site, he will become the first to ever achieve the feat. After months of campaigning, Mr Wallenda was yesterday given permission by Canadian officials to attempt the death-defying stunt this summer. He had already secured support from the American side of the falls last year. Mr Wallenda, who comes from a long line of circus performers, will walk across the most powerful waterfall in the world on a wire rope without a safety net. The stunt will take up to 40 minutes through mist and spray, 220ft above the bottom of the gorge. It is the first time anyone has attempted to walk on a tightrope over the actual waterfall – in 1859 the acrobat Charles Blondin crossed the gorge on a tightrope, but his stunt was downstream from the actual waterfall. Stunts over the iconic attraction, which forms the international border between the Canadian province of Ontario and the U.S. state of New York, have been prohibited for more than 100 years. After giving Mr Wallenda permission to perform his stunt, the Niagara Parks Commission insisted it could be attempted only once every 20 years. Last night Mr Wallenda, from Florida, said: ‘It’s been a dream of mine since I was six years old. I haven’t had a chance for it to settle in yet. I’m thrilled to death. 'This was a dream many told me was impossible. I’m blessed, that’s all I can say.’ Don't look down: This will be the first time anyone has tried to walk over the falls themselves rather than downstream in the gorge. Mr Wallenda, who lives with his wife Erendira and their three children, has been tightrope-walking since he was two. In 2008 he walked and then cycled across a high-wire suspended from skyscrapers in Newark, New Jersey. The feat won him a place in the Guinness Book Of Records for the longest and highest bicycle ride on a high-wire. He currently holds six Guinness World Records. His great-grandfather Karl founded the Flying Wallendas, the family’s daredevil circus act. However, he fell to his death aged 73 from a tightrope in high winds in Puerto Rico in 1978. His great-grandson said: ‘My family has always been taught to never give up. We’ve gone through it all, triumph and tragedy. So at no point did I think I would throw in the towel.’ Delight: Daredevil Nik Wallenda has finally been granted permission to attempt to tightrope walk across the Niagara Falls. Mr Wallenda will wear suede shoes designed to grip the wire in the wet and will train on a full-scale high-wire rig on an airport runway in Pittsburgh, with simulated mist. ‘I’ll be walking through the mist thrown off by the falls,’ he added. ‘I’ve done walks further and higher. This will be the most iconic.’ Last September New York Governor Andrew Cuomo signed a bill giving him one year to perform the feat. Feat: Maria Spelterini walks across a suspension bridge on a tightrope. Very high wire: Wallenda tightropes 12 stories above a street in Newark with no safety net in 2008 before riding a bicycle on the way back. Yesterday Janice Thomson, chairman of the Niagara Parks Commission, said: ‘This decision was approved in part in recognition of the role that stunting has played in the history and promotion of Niagara Falls. ‘We have made it clear that this is a very unique one-time situation. It’s not an everyday activity and will not be allowed to become an everyday activity.’ The area around the falls has suffered from a decline in industry and struggles to attract visitors despite its world famous centrepiece featuring in films such as Superman II and 1953’s Niagara, starring Marilyn Monroe. French acrobat and tightrope walker Charles Blondin was the first ever person to cross a section of Niagara Falls on a 1000 foot long tightrope in 1859. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","response":"This article is about a brave man named Nik Wallenda, who wants to walk over Niagara Falls on a tightrope!

People haven't been allowed to do stunts like this at Niagara Falls for more than 100 years, but Nik got permission to do it.

Question 2: Can I use prime minister picture as my WhatsApp profile picture? Select from the following. a). no. b). yes. Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","response":"Answer to Question 1: People call it \\"DP\\" or \\"display picture\\" in Facebook and WhatsApp instead of \\"profile picture\\" primarily due to the origin of the term. Display picture, or DP, has its roots in instant messaging and chat platforms of the past, such as AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) and Yahoo! Messenger. These platforms described a user's profile image as a display picture, and the term became popular among users of these early chat applications. As social media platforms like Facebook and WhatsApp gained widespread popularity, many users - particularly those who were familiar with earlier chat services - continued using the term \\"display picture\\" or its abbreviated form, \\"DP,\\" even though the platforms formally label the image as a \\"profile picture.\\" The term \\"display picture\\" has thus become a colloquial expression to describe a user's profile picture, even though its usage may not be as widespread as the official \\"profile picture\\" terminology. Answer to Question 2: Regarding the use of a prime minister's picture as your WhatsApp profile picture, the answer depends on the context and purpose for using the image, as well as the applicable laws in your country. b). Yes - You can generally use the prime minister's picture as your profile picture, assuming you are using the image to express admiration or support for the person or to promote healthy debate, discussion, or information sharing. If your use of the photograph is respectful and not damaging to the prime minister's reputation, there is no legal issue in most countries. However, it is always advisable to check your local laws and regulations regarding the use of public figures' images. On the other hand, the answer might be different under specific circumstances, such as: a). No - If the prime minister's image is altered or used in a way that is offensive, insulting, or defamatory, it may be considered inappropriate and potentially illegal in certain jurisdictions. Suppose you are using the prime minister's photograph to spread fake news, incite violence, or otherwise create harm to the figure's reputation or the nation. In that case, your actions may be subject to legal consequences. In conclusion, the answer to Question 2 is based on specific circumstances. You can use the prime minister's picture as your profile picture, provided the usage conforms to local laws and the purpose is respectful and considerate. However, you should avoid using public figures' images in any manner that may be considered harmful, offensive, or illegal."},{"question":"The work of Valentina Borok and her school on boundary value problems in layers forms an important chapter in the general theory of partial differential equations Could you correct the punctuation please?","response":"The work of Valentina Borok and her school, on boundary value problems in layers, forms an important chapter in the general theory of partial differential equations."},{"question":"Question: The name sounds funny but the idea is no joke: it's a personal toilet called the pee-pool, Anders Wilhelmson, a Swedish architect, is the inventor of the pee-pool. He became interested in the idea of sanitation after taking part in a research project on the social and political development of cities, One of the most common problems he found in developing countries was the lack of toilets, He wanted to do something to help, So working with others, he started the project in 2005, and the next year started a company called Peepoolple. The toilet is a single--use bag made of environmentally friendly plastics, The inside is treated with urea , a chemical commonly used as fertilizer, The hotter the weather, the more quickly the waste turns into what is needed by plants The sanitation process can be as soon as a couple of hours or as long as two to four weeks ,You can just bury it in a pot and grow whatever you like. The company expects to start selling the bags in August in Kenya and Bangladesh, But it is just beginning production and sales in Nairobi now, Full production could reach about half a million bags a day and people may be able to buy the pee-pool in countries Vietnam, Bangladesh, etc. The United Nations says more than two and a half billion people around the world do not have good sanitation .Many have no choice but to use the outdoors, which is not only bad for the environment ,but also harmful to people's health, Each year, poor sanitation leads to three fifths of those people getting an infectious disease which on average causes one out of 1,000 patients to die.

Give the answer on a scale from 0 - 5, where 0 is \\"not similar at all\\" and 5 is \\"means the same thing\\".","response":"I would rate the similarity between the two sentences as a 1 out of 5. The two sentences describe different subjects, actions, and contexts, but they share a connection through the theme of \\"black and white\\" colors. The first sentence describes a tattooed man dressed in black playing a white guitar and singing. It paints a picture of a musician or performer, possibly in a live setting or during a practice session. It highlights the contrast between the man's attire and his instrument and engages the reader's senses by providing information about actions, like playing and singing. The second sentence describes a woman wearing a black and white coat and earmuffs, perhaps during cold weather or winter. This sentence is more focused on the woman's clothing and appearance rather than her actions or the atmosphere she is in. It also uses the colors black and white, but in relation to her coat, which suggests the weather might be cold, or that she is situated in an outdoor environment. The main similarity between the two sentences is the mention of \\"black and white,\\" which forms the basis for any connection. However, the subjects of the sentences (a tattooed man vs. a woman), the activities they are engaged in (performing music vs. wearing a coat and earmuffs), and their contexts (musical vs. cold weather) are entirely different. Therefore, I would give a rating of 1 out of 5 for similarity between these two sentences. Although both mention colors black and white, the subjects, actions, and scenarios depicted in each sentence are notably different and cannot be considered equivalent at any deeper level."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: This article: Another major influence in his work was the rise of interest in vernacular architecture. By the time Douglas moved to Chester, the black-and-white revival using half-timbering was well under way, and Douglas came to incorporate this style in his buildings in Chester and elsewhere. The black-and-white revival did not start in Chester, but it did become Chester's speciality. The first Chester architect involved in the revival had been Thomas Mainwaring Penson, whose first work in this genre was the restoration of a shop in Eastgate Street in the early 1850s. Other early Chester architects involved in the revival were T. A. Richardson and James Harrison and it came to be developed mainly by T. M. Lockwood and by Douglas. Part of Douglas's earliest work for the Grosvenor family, the entrance lodge to Grosvenor Park, used half-timbering in its upper storey; this is the first known use by Douglas of black-and-white. Other vernacular motifs were taken from earlier styles of English architecture, in particular, the Tudor style. These include tile-hanging, pargetting and massive brick ribbed chimney stacks. In this style, Douglas was influenced by the architects Nesfield and Shaw. Douglas also used vernacular elements from the continent, especially the late medieval brickwork of Germany and the Low Countries.A characteristic of Douglas's work is his attention to both external and internal detailing. Such detailing was not derived from any particular style and Douglas chose elements from whichever style suited his purpose for each specific project. His detailing applied particularly to his joinery, perhaps inspired by his experience in his father's workshop, and was applied both to wooden fittings and to the furniture he designed. A further Continental influence was his use of a Dutch gable. The most important and consistently used element in Douglas's vernacular buildings was his use of half-timbering, which was usually used for parts of the building. However, in the cases of Rowden Abbey and St Michael and All Angels... contains an answer for the question: Who showed a Continental influence in his use of the Dutch gable?, what is it ?

It is vital to wait for this before starting any digging, to avoid serious injury or property damage. In the U.S. and Canada, you can call the toll-free \\"Digline\\" number at 811. Knowing the depth, width, and length of your trench will help you save effort and keep your trench the shape you desire. It may help you to mark widths, lengths and route of your trench using stakes and string. If available, you can use sandbags or other markers to outline the path of your trench. If you are using the trench to install or replace electrical utilities or pipelines, you will want to dig at least 2.5 feet deep in order to protect the pipes from frost, but no deeper than 4 feet. The width of your trench will depend on your pipes, but will likely be narrow. If you are digging a trench for a sprinkler system, you may only need to dig 9-12 inches deep depending on the height of the sprinkler, and 5 inches wide depending, again, depending on your sprinkler system. Consult the instructions that came with your sprinkler system before installation. You’ll need a D-handle sharp shooter shovel and a trenching or clean-out shovel. These can be purchased at any hardware or gardening store. For clearing roots, pruning shear or a Pulaski digging tool can help you quickly remove this obstruction. Wearing gloves will protect your hand from blisters and splinters, and comfortable work boots will provide foot protection and traction. Be careful when you dig around trees or other pipes. Roots can add a significant time to your excavation, and a ruptured gas line will require you to call your gas provider immediately. Severed utility lines could also leave you without power until your electric company can fix the problem. If you're digging near trees, make sure that your trench will not invade the tree’s protected root zone (usually the part of the roots that lie directly below its branches). If you're digging near pipes, try to determine where any other pipes may be. New pipes should be at least 1.5 feet away from another. Use the D-handle shovel to loosen the dirt along both sides of the soon-to-be trench. This will make it easier to dig out the dirt in the middle while physically establishing your dig line alongside the guideline you laid. Cut both sides of the hole with your shovel, break up the topsoil, and then work both sides of your trench until you have loosened enough soil to merit clearing. Once you have accumulated enough loose soil, use the trenching shovel to remove it out of your way. This may be a pile off to the side, or it may be a location you choose prior specifically for backfill. Depending on the depth and length of your trench, this could take a considerable amount of time and effort. Use your D-handle shovel to break up the soil and the trench shovel to clean it out until your trench is the desired length and depth. Running into roots might require you to place the pointed end of your shovel on the root and stomp, which should sever most small-medium sized roots. More developed root systems might require a Pulaski digging tool. Pruning shears are another good option, if your shovel fails and you do not have a Pulaski digging tool on hand. An unsupported trench can be extremely dangerous, as collapsing soil can kill someone standing in the trench. Any trench 3 feet (0.91 m) (0.9m) deep, and some shallower trenches in soft soil, should be supported by side walls (such as timber posts and panels) before digging any deeper. You can increase safety by \\"benching\\" (digging in tiered levels), or by digging the walls at a slope instead of vertically. An experienced trench excavator may choose to keep the trench unsupported at depths up to 5 ft (1.5 m), but only under stable soil conditions. Follow the 3 ft (0.9 m) rule if you do not have expert supervision. Summary:","response":"Before digging a trench, it's important to check for underground power lines, pipes, and other utilities by calling \\"Digline\\" at 811. To dig a trench, first, mark the path with stakes and string. The depth and width of the trench will depend on what it's for. You'll need a D-handle sharp shooter shovel, a trenching shovel, gloves, and work boots. Be careful around trees and existing pipes. Start by loosening the dirt along both sides of the trench with the D-handle shovel, then use the trenching shovel to remove the loose soil. You might need to cut through roots or use a Pulaski digging tool for bigger roots. If your trench is deeper than 3 feet or in soft soil, make sure to support the walls with side walls or by digging in tiers or at a slope. Remember, safety is always important when digging trenches."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Generate a question that has the following answer: To see many trees similarly attached to the cliff for the following movie plot: The video begins with the title character dragging a rope that is obviously attached to something heavy. He ties the rope to a tree, and we see that the trailing end leads over a cliff. He runs to the edge of the cliff and slides down the rope to a brown platform below. The platform is perpendicular to the cliff and supported using only the aforementioned rope. Using a hammer and nails, he proceeds to nail the end of the platform to the cliff face, holding the hammer in his foot. The view zooms out to show us the platform is a tree, now nailed to the cliff by its roots. The kiwi climbs back over the cliff edge and looks over, to see many trees similarly attached to the cliff. He claps his feet together in a form of applause at the completion of his task, and proceeds to remove the rope. He runs out of frame, and returns wearing an aviators hat and goggles. He takes one final look over the edge, before moving back, and then taking a running dive over the cliff edge. We see him diving straight downwards, falling past numerous trees nailed to the cliff. The frame slowly rotates 90 degrees to the left, and suddenly the scene seems to show the kiwi soaring above a flat landscape and trees. The shot zooms in close to the kiwi, and we see him extend his small and flightless wings and proceed to flap them rapidly as though flying. He closes his eyes and a single tear escapes.

There were no public systems of education before the 19th century. They all came into being to meet the needs of industrialism. So the most useful subjects for work are at the top and you were probably driven away from what you did as a kid at school--things you liked--because you would never get a job doing that. Is that right? Don't do music. You're not going to be a musician. Don't do art. You're not going to be an artist. In addition, the whole system of public education around the world is a process of university entrance. And the consequence is that many highly talented, brilliant, creative people think they're not because the thing they were good at wasn't valued at school. I think we can't afford to go on that way. In the next 30 years, more people worldwide will be graduating through education than since the beginning of the history. Suddenly, degrees aren't worth anything. When I was a student, if you had a degree, you had a job. But now you need a Master's degree where the previous job required a Bachelor, and now you need a Ph.D. for the other.

All the great teachers I've ever met and worked with are people who can inspire interest and curiosity and light up people's imaginations with the interests they themselves have for a particular field of work.

The idea behind this trend came from a forwarded Facebook message, which encouraged women to simply post the color of their bra without any other context. The message also advised recipients to forward this message only to women, thus creating a sense of curiosity and confusion amongst men on the platform. This trend featured various colors from the simple \\"black\\" and \\"white\\" to more humorous options such as \\"Gilligan's Island coconuts\\". A fan club titled \\"I Really Dont Care What Color Your Bra Is\\" also accumulated members quickly.

A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output. Input: run left twice and run left thrice Output:","response":"Part #1: 'left' and 'right' as a direction for an action. Usage: If the command is \\"run left\\", the action would be \\"I_RUN_LEFT\\". This meets the criteria because the agent executes the action \\"I_RUN\\" in the \\"left\\" direction. Part #2: The word 'opposite'. Usage: For the command \\"run opposite left\\", the agent will first turn around by executing \\"I_TURN_LEFT\\" and \\"I_TURN_LEFT\\" and then \\"I_RUN_LEFT\\". It meets the criteria since the agent turns backward in the specified direction before running left. Part #3: The word 'around'. Usage: Given the command \\"run around left\\", the agent will execute the action \\"I_RUN_LEFT\\" while turning around, which results in \\"I_RUN_LEFT\\", \\"I_TURN_LEFT\\", and \\"I_TURN_LEFT\\". This meets the criteria because the agent performs the action while turning around in the specified direction. Part #4: The word 'and'. Usage: For the command \\"run left and run right\\", the agent will perform the \\"I_RUN_LEFT\\" action followed by the \\"I_RUN_RIGHT\\" action. It meets the criteria as it executes the next scope of the command after the previous one. Part #5: The word 'after'. Usage: In the command \\"run left after run right\\", the agent will first execute the \\"I_RUN_RIGHT\\" action, and then the \\"I_RUN_LEFT\\" action. This meets the criteria since the agent performs the previous scope of the command after the next one. Part #6: The words 'twice' and 'thrice'. Usage: If the input is \\"run left twice and run left thrice\\", the output will be \\"I_RUN_LEFT\\", \\"I_RUN_LEFT\\", \\"I_RUN_LEFT\\", \\"I_RUN_LEFT\\", and \\"I_RUN_LEFT\\". The first two actions are the agent running left twice, and the next three actions are the agent running left thrice. This meets the criteria because the command asks the agent to repeat the specified action two and three times, respectively."},{"question":"Given the question: - The liver takes in blood from the rest of the body - The liver uses enzymes to clean the blood - The cleaned blood is expelled - The liver creates bile from the items filtered - The liver takes energy and stores it as glycogen What might be the last step of the process? The answer is:","response":"The last step of the process in the liver's functioning involves converting excess glycogen back into glucose and releasing it into the bloodstream to maintain balanced blood sugar levels. After the liver has taken in blood from the rest of the body, used enzymes to clean the blood, expelled the cleaned blood, created bile from filtered items, and stored energy as glycogen, it continuously monitors the body's blood sugar levels. When the blood sugar levels drop, the liver plays a crucial role in maintaining the balance, ensuring that the body has a consistent supply of energy to function effectively. This final step is called glycogenolysis. During glycogenolysis, the liver breaks down the stored glycogen into glucose molecules. This is done by the action of specific enzymes, such as glycogen phosphorylase, that cleave the glycogen molecule's glucose units, one at a time. Once the glucose molecules are free, they are released into the bloodstream to regulate blood sugar and provide energy for various bodily functions, especially the brain which heavily relies on glucose as an energy source. The liver's ability to maintain blood sugar levels is an essential part of its overall functioning and plays a significant role in ensuring the body's energy needs are met, contributing to the body's overall metabolism and homeostasis. In summary, the last step of the liver's process is the conversion of excess glycogen back into glucose and releasing it into the bloodstream when needed, to maintain balanced blood sugar levels and provide necessary energy for the body to function effectively."},{"question":"I agree, it's a very nice resort.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Jackson had 13 number-one singles in the US in his solo career—more than any other male artist in the Hot 100 era—and estimated sales of over 350 million records worldwide making him one of the best-selling artists in music history. In 1989, Jackson's annual earnings from album sales, endorsements, and concerts were estimated at 125 million. Forbes placed Jackson's annual income at 35 million in 1996 and 20 million in 1997. In the year after his death, more than 8.2 million of Jackson's albums sold in the US, and 35 million albums worldwide, more than any other artist in 2009. In 2014, Jackson became the first artist to have a top ten single in the Billboard Hot 100 in five different decades. He became the first artist to sell one million music downloads in a week, with 2.6 million song downloads. Thriller, Number Ones and The Essential Michael Jackson became the first catalog albums to outsell any new album. Jackson also became the first artist to have four of the top 20 best-selling albums in a single year in the US.Forbes reported in August 2018 that Jackson's total career pretax earnings in life and death were 4.2 billion. Sales of his recordings through Sony's music unit earned him an estimated 300 million in royalties.

Does toasting or microwaving sourdough bread kill the beneficial bacteria (probiotics)? Why is it so difficult to toast bread while cutting it? Options: (a). no (b). yes","response":"(a) No These two questions do not have the same meaning. They are different in their focus and the concepts they explore. Let me explain each question in more detail: Question 1: Does toasting or microwaving sourdough bread kill the beneficial bacteria (probiotics)? This question is concerned with the impact of toasting or microwaving sourdough bread on the beneficial bacteria present in it. Sourdough bread contains probiotics, which are live microorganisms that can provide various health benefits, such as improving digestion and boosting the immune system. The person asking this question wants to know if the heat generated during toasting or microwaving the bread damages or destroys these beneficial bacteria, potentially reducing the health benefits of eating sourdough bread. To answer this question, it is important to understand that probiotics are sensitive to heat. When sourdough bread is toasted or microwaved, the temperature can reach levels that destroy these microorganisms. Generally, probiotics are most effective when consumed alive, and they may lose their efficacy or be entirely inactive if exposed to high temperatures for an extended period. Thus, toasting or microwaving sourdough bread can indeed kill the beneficial bacteria present in it, especially if the bread is exposed to high heat for an extended period. Question 2: Why is it so difficult to toast bread while cutting it? This question addresses a practical challenge of toasting bread and cutting it simultaneously. This situation seems unusual and might be the result of a misunderstanding or misinterpretation. However, if we take the question literally, it involves the difficulty of performing both actions at once, which are not intended to be carried out together. Toasting bread is typically done in a toaster, toaster oven, or even on a stovetop using a pan for a few minutes each side. The purpose of toasting is to achieve a crispy texture on the outside of the bread while maintaining a tender and moist inner crumb. On the other hand, cutting bread involves the use of a knife to slice it into desired sizes. Attempting to toast bread while cutting it would be difficult for several reasons: 1. Safety: Toasting typically requires heat which means that you would have to hold and cut the bread while it is being exposed to a heat source, posing a risk of burns or accidents. 2. Practicality: Toasting bread requires a consistent and even heat applied over a specific period. Moving the bread around while cutting it would make it difficult to achieve an even and consistent toasting. 3. Convenience: Cutting bread is best done on a cutting board or another stable surface, while toasting requires a toaster or pan. Attempting to perform both tasks simultaneously would be quite cumbersome and inefficient. In summary, these two questions do not have the same meaning. While the first question relates to the impact of toasting or microwaving sourdough bread on its probiotic content, the second question deals with the difficulty of toasting bread while cutting it. They focus on different aspects of bread preparation and consumption, so the appropriate answer is (a) no."},{"question":"Here is an article: Coming into the final stretch of Season 6 of The Good Wife, \\"Loser Edit\\" felt like a slower-paced episode in the midst of a season that has been full of adrenaline and conspiracy. Yet once the hour concluded, so many things had been set into motion that it was clear the action is nowhere near slowing down. Yet again, Alicia's storyline doesn't feel like the central story — not just because it's not any more compelling than the other characters', but because for only the second or third time this season she isn't getting the majority of the screen time. The illicit emails from last week's FLG hack come back to haunt Alicia. A reporter has received the emails and will take the story public. Eli's plan is, of course, to spin the emails before they're released: Alicia must deny that she had a physical affair, and say that the emails were the product of an office flirtation. The episode opens with Alicia's antagonistic reporter sitting in an edit room cutting the footage of their interview, which starts as a puff piece. We watch the colors of the piece flip as the story spins in a different direction after the emails come to light. During Alicia's campaign, episode after episode focused on the importance of perception, and the difference between what we believe and what the truth is. Alicia's campaign may be over, but she won't be able to leave politics behind her. The episode's closer is the airing of the reporter's story: Instead of the emails, she attacks Alicia with the accusation that she cheated at the polls. This is a crisis for which team Alicia was not prepared. Alicia isn't the only one with an old ghost resurfacing in this episode. The evidence Kalinda faked to prove Carey's innocence has come back to haunt them in the form of the investigator Andrew Wiley. It only takes a couple loose threads for the entire story to unravel, and Wiley finds them and pulls them (with two leashed kids in tow). It's a catastrophic situation, not just for Kalinda, but also for Diane, who could be disbarred for her participation in the fraud. This episode was jam-packed — we haven't even gotten to the C-plot involving Diane and her conservative client Reese Dipple. This was much more \\"case-of-the-week\\" driven than Alicia and Kalinda's stories, but in many ways it was the most satisfying, with Diane getting to stretch her muscles in a hypothetical lawsuit involving gay marriage. \\"The law is supposed to be fair,\\" she tells Dipple when he accuses her of manipulating him by casting his gay nephew as her plaintiff. \\"That doesn't mean it's not supposed to be personal.\\" Things have gotten very personal for Alicia as she's sought the office of State's Attorney, and for Kalinda as she tried desperately to save Carey from paying for a crime he didn't commit. Alicia and Kalinda both strayed from their moral code in their pursuit of a nobler aim, Alicia by lying about her affair with Will and Kalinda by faking evidence. There may not be enough distance for the two of them to outrun their demons, which are drawing closer as we approach the end of Season 6. Have something to add to this story?

Movie title: Priest Context: Father Greg Pilkington, newly assigned to St. Mary's parish in inner-city Liverpool, is startled to discover Father Matthew Thomas is engaged in a sexual relationship with rectory housekeeper Maria Kerrigan. Moreover, Father Thomas is a left-wing radical and an outspoken proponent of Liberation Theology, leading him to constant clashes and bickering with the Bishopâwho nevertheless appreciates his abilities. While the young protagonist's personal traditional conservatism and religious beliefs are offended by the older priest's blatant disregard for his vow of celibacy, he struggles with his own homosexual urges, especially after he meets Graham at a local gay hangout and the two embark on a physical relationship. Meanwhile, student Lisa Unsworth has confided she was sexually abused by her father, who confirms her story. Both have revealed their secret in the confessional, however, so Father Greg is required to honour the sanctity of the Sacrament of Penance and not reveal what he has been told. He tries to warn her mother to keep a close watch on her, but the naive woman believes her daughter is safe while in the care of her husband. When Mrs. Unsworth discovers her husband molesting Lisa and realises the priest knew what was happening, she lashes out at him. Adding to his torment is his arrest for having sex with Graham in a parked car. When he pleads guilty to the charge, the story is headlined on the front page of the local newspaper and, unable to face his parishioners, Father Greg relocates to a remote rural parish headed by a disapproving and unforgiving priest.

To start, the premise explicitly states that they don't need a seven day waiting period. This directly contradicts the hypothesis that claims they need a long seven day waiting period. Furthermore, the use of the word \\"long\\" in the hypothesis could imply that even if there were any potential need for a waiting period, a seven day duration would be considered excessive. However, since the premise already establishes that they don't need a seven day period, there's no reason to discuss whether it's \\"long\\" or not. It is also essential to understand the context in which the premise is being expressed. If the statement refers to a scenario where a waiting period might be optional or unnecessary, then it further supports the idea that the hypothesis is not true. On the other hand, if the premise is addressing a situation where a waiting period is generally expected or required, it might be possible that a shorter waiting period is appropriate but not one as long as seven days. However, given that the premise explicitly states \\"they don't need that seven day waiting period,\\" it is safe to infer that the hypothesis \\"They need a long seven day waiting period\\" is not true based on the information provided. The premise contradicts the hypothesis directly, and without any additional context or information that could potentially modify the interpretation of the statement, we can confidently conclude that the hypothesis is not true."},{"question":"Please capitalize where necessary: beautiful and exciting exhibition, but there could have been a few more amphibians and reptiles, snakes less to my taste.","response":"The Beautiful and Exciting Exhibition was impressive.

Step-by-step process for c): 1. Justification: We have a situation where a man is in a bike shop holding a bike tire. It is likely that he is going to explain or demonstrate something related to bike tires which makes option 'c' the most relevant. 2. The man places the bike with the tire that needs replacing onto a bike repair stand, so it becomes easier to demonstrate the process. 3. He addresses everyone in the shop and starts explaining how to remove the rubber of a tire from the frame. 4. First, the man loosens the bolts holding the wheel to the bicycle frame. This allows for the removal of the wheel that contains the tire needing replacement. 5. The man then uses a tire lever to carefully separate the tire's bead from the rim of the wheel. 6. He goes around the rim with the tire lever until the entire tire is detached from the wheel. 7. The man removes the inner tube from the removed tire. 8. Next, he shows people around a new tire that will be used as a replacement and explains the importance of checking for proper fit and compatibility before installing the new tire. 9. The man now starts the process of installing the new tire onto the wheel. He places one side of the tire's bead onto the wheel rim. 10. He reinserts the inner tube into the new tire and ensures it is properly positioned. 11. The man proceeds to fit the second side of the new tire's bead onto the wheel rim. He makes sure the tire is seated evenly around the wheel. 12. Once the tire is properly installed, the man inflates it using a bicycle pump to the recommended pressure specified on the tire's sidewall. 13. Finally, he remounts the wheel onto the bicycle frame and tightens the bolts to secure the wheel in place. 14. The man concludes his demonstration by reiterating the importance of proper tire maintenance and replacement for a safe and smooth bike riding experience. This scenario aligns with option 'c' as it demonstrates how to remove the rubber of a tire from the frame and replace it."},{"question":"Din materialele şi proviziile de care oamenii au nevoie, mai puţin de un sfert trece de punctele de control - în total doar 18 articole.

In this case, the description of a female guitarist as \\"petite\\" and \\"delicate\\" can be seen as a stereotype, as it may perpetuate the idea that women are expected to be delicate and not typically associated with traditionally male-dominated professions, such as guitarists. Step 4: Classify the passage into one of the three categories (stereotype, anti-stereotype, or unrelated) based on the identified stereotypes or anti-stereotypes. As the passage presents a female guitarist as delicate, which may strengthen the stereotype that women are inherently delicate even if they are in male-dominated professions, I would classify this passage as a \\"stereotype.\\""},{"question":"Answer the following question: Is this product review positive?

But it was firmly critical of the decision-making process and behaviour of the UK government both in the run-up to, conduct of, and aftermath of one of the most controversial conflicts in British foreign policy - what many now regard as one of the UK's biggest foreign policy mistakes. In the immediate aftermath of the inquiry itself, Sir John, a former Whitehall permanent secretary who had worked for decades at the highest level of government, declined to take further part in the debate, as his and his panels' conclusions were digested. But in the run-up to the report's anniversary, he agreed to speak for the first time about the inquiry's conclusions, its criticisms and consequences for us all. Exactly a year ago, he produced two million words in 12 volumes, to detail a seven-year long study of the tumultuous political and diplomatic events in the run-up to, conduct, and aftermath of the 2003 Iraq War. But what was implicit in the lengthy pages of that document is now crystal clear in his personal, succinct and unvarnished view of the hours of evidence, thousands of documents, and witness accounts of one of the country's most significant public inquiries. He defends its duration, its conduct, and believes strongly that the work could stop another rush to war in the future. Sir John told me believes the \\"rising generations\\" of the military have understood and absorbed the lessons of the inquiry so much that they would demand and insist that future governments would be required to be more rigorous, more thorough in their examinations of the case for war. He explained his exhaustive criticism of the relationship between Tony Blair and George W Bush, his shock on seeing their private correspondence for the first time. He also spoke of his own relief at how the families of those killed in the conflict received his report when it was finally published. But he speaks plainly on perhaps the most fundamental political question of all, the role of the former prime minister. When asked if Tony Blair had been as straight with the country and the inquiry as he ought to have been, Sir John told me, 'any prime minister taking a country into war has got to be straight with the nation and carry it, so far as possible, with him or her. I don't believe that was the case in the Iraq instance.\\" He went on to say he believed Tony Blair had given an \\"emotional truth\\" to the inquiry, and had been \\"suffering\\" during its sessions - Tony Blair was always, he said ,\\"the advocate\\" for whom, \\"persuasion is everything\\". A spokesperson for the former prime minister referred us to his comments when the inquiry was published, when he said the report showed there were no lies, and no deceit, but that he took responsibility for the criticisms of how decisions had been made. You won't be surprised, having undertaken such a huge task, that Sir John speaks on a massive range of issues concerned with the Iraq war. The conflict may have begun 14 years ago now, the inquiry taking longer than the war itself. But for our politics, our diplomacy, and our military, this new more personal account will still resonate today.","response":"Sir John Chilcot, the former Whitehall permanent secretary who led the inquiry into the UK's role in the 2003 Iraq War, has said the country’s government needs to be more thorough in their examinations of potential military actions.

Although his mainstream career spanned only four years, he is widely regarded as one of the most influential electric guitarists in the history of popular music, and one of the most celebrated musicians of the 20th century. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame describes him as \\"arguably the greatest instrumentalist in the history of rock music\\". Born in Seattle, Washington, Hendrix began playing guitar at the age of 15. Jimi Hendrix had a diverse heritage. His paternal grandmother, Zenora \\"Nora\\" Rose Moore, was African American and one-quarter Cherokee. Hendrix's paternal grandfather, Bertran Philander Ross Hendrix (born 1866), was born out of an extramarital affair between a woman named Fanny, and a grain merchant from Urbana, Ohio, or Illinois, one of the wealthiest men in the area at that time. After Hendrix and Moore relocated to Vancouver, Canada, had a son they named James Allen Ross Hendrix on June 10, 1919; the family called him \\"Al\\". In 1941 after moving to Seattle, Al met Lucille Jeter (1925-1958) at a dance; they married on March 31, 1942. Lucille's father (Jimi's maternal grandfather) was Preston Jeter (born 1875), whose mother was born in similar circumstances as Bertran Philander Ross Hendrix. Lucille's mother, nee Clarice Lawson, had African American and Cherokee ancestors. Al, who had been drafted by the U.S. Army to serve in World War II, left to begin his basic training three days after the wedding. Johnny Allen Hendrix was born on November 27, 1942, in Seattle; he was the first of Lucille's five children. In 1946, Johnny's parents changed his name to James Marshall Hendrix, in honor of Al and his late brother Leon Marshall. Stationed in Alabama at the time of Hendrix's birth, Al was denied the standard military furlough afforded servicemen for childbirth; his commanding officer placed him in the stockade to prevent him from going AWOL to see his infant son in Seattle. He spent two months locked up without trial, and while in the stockade received a telegram announcing his son's birth. During Al's three-year absence, Lucille struggled to raise their son. When Al was away, Hendrix was mostly cared for by family members and friends, especially Lucille's sister Delores Hall and her friend Dorothy Harding. Al received an honorable discharge from the U.S. Army on September 1, 1945. Two months later, unable to find Lucille, Al went to the Berkeley, California, home of a family friend named Mrs. Champ, who had taken care of and had attempted to adopt Hendrix; this is where Al saw his son for the first time. After returning from service, Al reunited with Lucille, but his inability to find steady work left the family impoverished. They both struggled with alcohol, and often fought when intoxicated. The violence sometimes drove Hendrix to withdraw and hide in a closet in their home. His relationship with his brother Leon (born 1948) was close but precarious; with Leon in and out of foster care, they lived with an almost constant threat of fraternal separation. In addition to Leon, Hendrix had three younger siblings: Joseph, born in 1949, Kathy in 1950, and Pamela, 1951, all of whom Al and Lucille gave up to foster care and adoption. The family frequently moved, staying in cheap hotels and apartments around Seattle. On occasion, family members would take Hendrix to Vancouver to stay at his grandmother's. A shy and sensitive boy, he was deeply affected by his life experiences. In later years, he confided to a girlfriend that he had been the victim of sexual abuse by a man in uniform. On December 17, 1951, when Hendrix was nine years old, his parents divorced; the court granted Al custody of him and Leon.

Based on the premise that \\"The artist's tomb was installed in the church in 1919,\\" one can infer that the church indeed has an artist's tomb on its premises. Assuming that the artist is of some significance and has had their tomb installed in the church, it is reasonable to deduce that it could be a popular attraction for those who appreciate the artist's work, art aficionados, or visitors interested in the history associated with the church. However, it is essential to note that public interest and the extent to which the tomb can be considered a \\"popular attraction\\" would depend on several factors. Factors such as the artist's popularity and recognition, the location of the church, and how well the tomb has been preserved and promoted would significantly influence the tomb's status as a popular attraction. Nevertheless, if we base our conclusion solely on the given premise and hypothesis, it can be concluded that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis, which states, \\"The church has an artist's tomb, a popular attraction,\\" is also true to a certain extent.

Context: How to chill champagne<br>Chill vintage champagne between 54 and 57 degrees fahrenheit. Vintage champagne, which comes with years printed on the label, should be served between 54 and 57 degrees fahrenheit. This temperature is best achieved by using an ice bucket. Hypothesis: old champagne is more expensive than new","response":"Okay little one, let's understand this together. The context talks about how to chill vintage champagne and the temperature it should be served at. Vintage champagne means it comes from a specific year, so it has a year label on it, like a bottle saying 2010 or 2012. But, the context doesn't specifically say how much an old or vintage champagne costs compared to a new one. So, we can't really say that old champagne is always more expensive than new champagne just from this information. There could be other factors that affect the price too! So our hypothesis \\"old champagne is more expensive than new\\" cannot be confirmed with the given context. We need more information to know about the prices of different champagnes."},{"question":"Philip Morris cited strong volume gains in Germany, Italy, France, Spain, central and eastern Europe, Russia, the Middle East, Japan, Korea, Argentina and Brazil.

A computer-generated image of Club Watt, Rotterdam's human-powered club. Couch potatoes will be horrified, but fresh advances in human-powered technology -- where users power appliances through their own motion -- could one day see a 'workout-to-watch' scenario become reality. Human power is rapidly gaining in popularity worldwide as businesses seek 'greener' methods of operating. The profile of the technology is set to receive a further boost this month when a human-powered gym opens in Portland, Oregon, and again in September when the human-powered 'sustainable dance club', Club Watt, opens its doors in Rotterdam, Netherlands. Human power is already being used to run the 'California Fitness' gym in Hong Kong, and to power the recently opened 'Club Surya' in London. iReport.com: Can you predict what the future will be like? Beyond all of this, further concepts have been developed for human-powered 'river gyms' for the waterways of New York. But, how does your sweat and strain turn into power for lights, music and machines? The general concept is known as energy harvesting, which simply refers to the gathering of energy from one source and applying it to power an object. Italian inventor Lucien Gambarota, who designed California Fitness's method of storing energy and using it to power lights and music in the gym, told CNN the concept is straightforward. \\"One of the oldest types of energy used by people is muscular energy -- so this is nothing new.\\" Gambarota said machines such as exercycles created a load, used as a counter-force by means of a resistor. \\"I disconnected the resistor and started storing the energy into a battery... that is then used as power. It was a way to show there can be very simple solutions. It doesn't always have to be high-tech,\\" he said. Portland's 'green' gym will have spinning bikes connected to wind-generator motors. The users should generate enough electricity to power the gym's music system or run personal DVD players on the machines, the gym's manager Adam Boesel predicts. While harnessing the energy from people working out at a gym seems logical, utilising the movement of clubbers at dance clubs is a little more complex. Two methods have developed -- the first of which is piezoelectricity, used by Club Surya, where crystals in blocks under the dance-floor rub together with the assistance of dancers on the floor. This generates an electrical charge which is then fed into batteries. A second method using wheels to generate energy under a slightly moving floor will be used at the soon-to-be-opened Club Watt. This model involves coils and magnets which move under the dance-floor to create a charge. Vera Verkooijen, spokeswoman for Sustainable Dance Club, the company which is behind the floor for Club Watt and produces smaller, portable floors, said the human power would be enough to power about 30 percent of the club's requirements. Verkooijen admitted the first floors were not very efficient, and said the designers were already working on new models to improve the amount of energy captured. \\"This is just the first version. We are willing to take it further,\\" she said. At Club Surya the power shortfall is made up by solar panels and a wind turbine. Putting the current buzz aside, how far could this human-powered technology develop? And how widely can it be applied? Verkooijen told CNN she already had some indications of where the technology was heading. \\"We receive a lot of requests from other companies for people who want to use the floors. We get many of these for bus and train stations -- places where there are lots of people.\\" Lights and display boards at those spaces could be powered applying the same concept as that being used in Club Watt, she said. Evert Raaijen, technical director of energy conversion company Exendis, felt the technology could have a number of different applications. From pedal-powered computers on bicycles, to self-powered soldiers in militaries, Raaijen predicted human power would be developed widely in coming years. \\"I think it's a science field which will be one of the future,\\" he said. Gambarota believed there were ways human power could be brought into practical use in the home. He had generated an idea of using human-powered batteries for television or portable video game consoles. \\"With so many kids not exercising enough, a battery could be created for these devices so they had to create the energy to use them. The same could be done for television sets. \\"We could get the situation where people have to cycle so they can use it,\\" Gambarota said. Despite these potential developments, human-power is attracting its share of criticism. Although he shows enthusiasm for the battery project, Gambarota, who now spends much of his time developing micro wind turbines, is sceptical about the future of human-power on a mass-scale. He raises doubts about the efficiency of human power and questioned its economic viability. The average amount of power one person could produce going about normal activities on any given day was about one kilowatt-hour (kWh), which only amounted to about € 0.10 worth of electricity, Gambarota said. \\"It's a very good marketing tool for businesses, but in terms of economics it does not make sense at all.\\" The main reason it was being used was because companies wanted to \\"look green, taste green and smell green\\", he said. Raaijen, who was consulted on the Sustainable Dance Floor project, agreed that opting for human-powered technology at present was not a financially-based decision. \\"The project (dance floor) in itself doesn't save a lot of energy. It's more of a statement than anything.\\" Observing recent trends, the sustained drive for 'green energy' should continue to push human-powered technology forward, and despite the limitations to development, human-powered gyms, dance clubs, and maybe even video game consoles are likely to feature strongly in our immediate future. What are the important parts of this article?","response":"This article talks about human-powered technology, where people create energy through their own movements, like exercising or dancing.

Grey island contributed way more because they were more careless. But I can use this background: Another major cause of extinction is global warming , which is also known as global climate change. During the past century, the Earth's average temperature has risen by almost 1°C (about 1.3°F). You may not think that is significant, but to organisms that live in the wild and are constantly adapting to their environments, any climate change can be hazardous. Recall that burning fossil fuels releases gasses into the atmosphere that warm the Earth. Our increased use of fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, is changing the Earth’s climate. Any long-term change in the climate can destroy the habitat of a species. Even a brief change in climate may be too stressful for an organism to survive. For example, if the seas increase in temperature, even briefly, it may be too warm for certain types of fish to reproduce. What is an answer for this question: Which island burned less fossil fuels?

Just after he bought the house with his ill gotten gains from his band's over-hyped, over-marketed, and over-bought sophomore Disc, he drove me out to see it in his beautiful but nauseating '70 Datsun 240 Z. All the smog combined with the pinball effects of winding up the hill at teeth-numbing speeds had me puking for an hour after we got there. I took the last turn at the top of the hill and watched the rising sun crest over the black blocks of the city, her angel wings soiled and cheapened with the soot of 12 million get-away drivers.

I parked between a blue hatchback and Rick's favorite toy: a 350 horsepower Impreza he had smuggled here from Japan. All his more expensive rides were in the garage, collecting dust and gaining vintage resale value. I rang the bell. I waited and watched a couple of squirrels fight over a small treasure in the bushes.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","response":"The supposed perturbation of utilizing less heat in the process of boiling water would indirectly impact a step of the process. This is because the amount of heat applied to the water influences how quickly and effectively the water heats up and ultimately reaches the boiling point, which then results in the formation of bubbles. When less heat is applied, the water will take longer to reach the boiling point, and thus, bubbles will take longer to appear. This change in the rate at which bubbles form does not directly impact any specific step of the process, but rather it affects the overall efficiency and timing of the entire process. In summary, the perturbation of using less heat in this process is indirectly impacting a step of the process, as it influences the rate at which the water heats up and subsequently affects the formation of bubbles in the water."},{"question":"Given the question: Facts: - death place: augusta , michigan - order: 40th - successor: g. mennen williams - party: republican - death date: november 30 , 1953 -lrb- aged 59 -rrb- - predecessor: harry kelly - office: governor of michigan - lieutenant: eugene c. keyes - spouse: mae l. pierson - term end: january 1 , 1949 - term start: january 1 , 1947 - birth date: may 2 , 1894 - name: kim sigler - birth place: schuyler , nebraska - religion: methodist - alma mater: university of michigan Based on these bullet points, write a short biography describing the life of kim sigler .

Democrats don’t have the manpower to block Trump’s nominees on their own, but they signaled early on that Mnuchin would be a top target of opposition. They’re using the Senate’s procedural rulebook to drag out debate on most Trump’s picks for days, arguing they deserve higher scrutiny because of their vast financial holdings and business ties. Sen.

Adam Green, a co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, warned the Democratic senator — who is up for reelection in 2018 — that he will hear from his constituents over the vote. \\"Manchin's vote will not just hurt millions of people — it will hurt Democrats in 2018.

Schumer lumped Mnuchin in with Andy Pudzer, Trump’s pick to lead the Labor Department, and Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.), nominated to lead the Office of Management and Budget, as three finance-related picks who Democrats believe will hurt working Americans.

But the Columbus Dispatch reported last month that Mnuchin misled the committee, pointing to documents from 2010 that showed the company used robosigning “frequently.” Mnuchin also pushed back against Democratic grilling about foreclosures, arguing he inherited the bank’s bad loans and he tried to help families when federal rules allowed.

The vote was 100-0 for Shulkin, a holdover from the Obama administration who has served as VA undersecretary of health since 2015. A physician and former health care executive, Shulkin will be the first VA secretary in the department's history never to have served in the military. Story Continued Below Shulkin's confirmation Monday was swift — the Senate set aside just 10 minutes for debate on his nomination after spending several days on a handful of contentious Trump nominees. The Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee unanimously approved Shulkin's nomination last week, and he earned the support of all Senate Democrats Monday despite concerns over whether Trump might move to privatize the VA. During his Feb. 1 confirmation hearing, Shulkin allayed Senate Democrats' concerns that the VA system would be privatized, describing himself as \\"a strong advocate of the VA.\\" \\"There will be far greater accountability, dramatically improved access, responsiveness and expanded care options, but the Department of Veterans Affairs will not be privatized under my watch,\\" Shulkin testified. Shulkin's confirmation drew mostly praise from veterans service organizations. \\"Veterans are very fortunate to have Dr. Shulkin voluntarily stay in what has evolved into the most scrutinized and criticized position in the country,\\" Veterans of Foreign Wars National Commander Brian Duffy said in a statement. \\"And it should be,\\" he added. The conservative Concerned Veterans for America, which has pushed for veterans to obtain greater health care from the private sector and has criticized the VA for not holding problem employees accountable, said Monday it was \\"encouraged\\" Shulkin had \\"acknowledged systemic failures within the VA and the need for transformational reforms to fix them.\\" \\"We look forward to partnering with Secretary Shulkin to bring real accountability to the department and empower veterans who wish to use their benefits to access care in the private sector,\\" CVA Policy director Dan Caldwell said in a statement. \\"We remain optimistic that Dr. Shulkin will embrace the bold reforms President Trump laid out on the campaign trail, so that American veterans will begin to see a more transparent, efficient, and customer-focused VA.\\" In assuming the top job at VA, Shulkin pledged to work to regain the trust of the veterans that had been lost in the department's 2014 wait-times scandal, which exposed problems with access to medical treatment and resulted in the resignation of then-Secretary Eric Shinseki. Shulkin also will take over as Congress considers whether to extend the Veterans Choice Program, created in the wake of the scandal to reduce VA appointment wait times. He told the Senate the program had added more complexity for veterans trying to access care. The 10 billion emergency program, which subsidizes non-VA medical care for veterans who face lengthy waits for appointments or live long distances from a VA hospital or clinic, is set to expire in August or when it runs out of money, whichever comes first. Lawmakers, however, have floated extending the program. A hiring freeze ordered by Trump during his first week as president also drew concerns from both Democrats and Republicans that services for veterans would suffer if open positions went unfilled. But Shulkin estimated that of an estimated 45,000 open positions, 37,000 positions were exempted due to public safety. Shulkin also told senators at his confirmation hearing he was concerned with a growing backlog of disability claims appeals and urged Congress to overhaul the appeals process, a key legislative priority for the VA and veterans groups. |||||","response":"Steve Mnuchin has been confirmed as US Treasury secretary after the Senate voted 53-47 in favour of his appointment on Monday.

Can we infer the following? Nobody knows who painted the fake cave art","response":"Based on the information provided, we can infer that the fake prehistoric rock art of a caveman with a shopping trolley at the British Museum is likely to be a contemporary creation that is intended to deceive, mislead, or provoke thought. However, the specific artist or group who painted the fake cave art is not mentioned in the statement. While it is not definitively stated that nobody knows who painted the fake cave art, it is reasonable to assume that the artist's identity is either unknown or deliberately kept anonymous. Their anonymity may be due to various reasons, such as protecting their identity for legal reasons (given that their work could potentially be considered vandalism or forgery), or to maintain an air of mystery and intrigue surrounding their creation. The presence of a shopping trolley in the artwork is anachronistic and deliberately out of place, inviting discussion and interpretation from the audience. As a modern object, the shopping trolley represents a stark contrast to the prehistoric setting, thereby pointing out that the work is a deliberate fake. The humor and novelty of the painting may also be intended to draw attention to the importance of scrutinizing and critically analyzing historical artifacts, rather than accepting them at face value. Regardless of the anonymous nature of the artwork's creator, the fact that it has been hung on the walls of the British Museum holds significance. The museum could be using this as a platform for discussion, or it might even have been placed there without the museum's consent, in which case it would become a form of guerrilla art. In any case, the artwork achieves its goal of encouraging interpretation, drawing attention to the relationship between past and present, and challenging our understanding of history, authenticity, and artistic expression. In conclusion, while the artist's identity is not explicitly confirmed, it can be inferred that the creator of the fake prehistoric rock art displaying a caveman with a shopping trolley may be unknown or intentionally anonymous. The image serves as a thought-provoking piece that underscores the importance of scrutinizing and critically interpreting historical artifacts, challenging our notions of authenticity, and engaging in dialogue about the past, present, and the role art plays in our understanding of history."},{"question":"I heard that Addison would teach Sydney to read every afternoon after getting home from work.

However, only after rigorous study and testing, which takes 10 to 15 years on average, will governmental authorities grant permission for the company to market and sell the drug. Patent protection enables the owner of the patent to recover the costs of research and development through high profit margins for the branded drug. When the patent protection for the drug expires, a generic drug is usually developed and sold by a competing company. The development and approval of generics is less expensive, allowing them to be sold at a lower price. Often the owner of the branded drug will introduce a generic version before the patent expires in order to get a head start in the generic market. Restructuring has therefore become routine, driven by the patent expiration of products launched during the industry's \\"golden era\\" in the 1990s and companies' failure to develop sufficient new blockbuster products to replace lost revenues.

Purvis shares Hoover's belief in using scientific methods to battle crime, ranging from cataloging fingerprints to tapping telephone lines. In between a series of bank robberies, Dillinger meets Billie Frechette at a restaurant and woos her by buying her a fur coat. Frechette falls for Dillinger even after he reveals his identity, and the two become inseparable. Purvis leads a failed ambush at a hotel where he believes Dillinger is staying, and an agent is killed by Baby Face Nelson, who escapes with Tommy Caroll. Purvis requests that Hoover bring in professional lawmen who know how to catch criminals dead or alive, including Texan Charles Winstead. Police arrest Dillinger and his gang in Tucson, Arizona, after a fire breaks out at the Hotel Congress, where they are staying. Dillinger is extradited to Indiana, where Sheriff Lillian Holley has him locked up in the Lake County Jail in Crown Point. Dillinger and other inmates use a fake gun to escape. Dillinger is unable to see Frechette, who is under tight surveillance. Dillinger learns that Frank Nitti's associates are unwilling to help because his crimes are motivating the FBI to prosecute interstate crime, which imperils Nitti's bookmaking racket, thus severing his connections with the Mafia. Carroll goads Dillinger into robbing a bank in Sioux Falls with Baby Face Nelson. During their escape, both Dillinger and Carroll are shot, and they have to leave Carroll behind. The group retreats to the Little Bohemia Lodge in Manitowish Waters, Wisconsin and realize their haul is significantly less than Nelson said it would be. Dillinger hopes he can free the rest of his gang from prison, including Pierpont and Makley, but Red Hamilton convinces him this is unlikely.

The Eisenhower Pine, a loblolly pine tree located on the 17th hole of the golf course, was nicknamed after President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who was an Augusta National member. The tree earned its name because Eisenhower often hit his golf shots into the tree and famously proposed that it be removed during a 1956 club meeting. However, his request was denied. Over the years, the tree became a part of Augusta National's history and was an iconic feature of the golf course.

My Friends Were Scared\\"","response":"Title: Charlie Hunnam -- Internet Death Hoax Was Lame ... My Friends Were Scared Introduction Nowadays, the Internet is filled with an unbelievable amount of information, and sadly, quite a lot of it is misleading or simply false. One such recent example is the death hoax of the talented and well-known actor Charlie Hunnam. The Internet went into a frenzy when a false report about his death started circulating, leaving everyone, including his friends, horrified. However, this incident proved to be nothing but a cruel prank, and the actor himself came forward to clear the air. Let's take a closer look at the events that unfolded during this bizarre Internet death hoax and how it affected those close to the actor. The Hoax The cruel death hoax of Charlie Hunnam began as online rumors, eventually spreading like wildfire after being picked up by a few websites dedicated to reporting celebrity-related news. These sources claimed that the actor had died in a rather tragic accident, leading to an outpour of grief among his fans and colleagues. Some even began posting condolence messages on their social media accounts, further fueling the false news. However, the lack of any verifiable information, as well as the seemingly bizarre circumstances surrounding his so-called death, made people question the authenticity of these reports. Additionally, there were no concrete statements from his representatives or family members, which raised further suspicions about their validity. Charlie Hunnam's Reaction In order to calm the situation down and to quell the growing concerns, Charlie Hunnam himself took to social media to address the rumors. He confirmed that the reports of his death were nothing but a cruel hoax, and he was alive and in good health. The actor went on to express his disappointment with the people who had initiated the hoax and inadvertently terrified his family, friends, and loyal fans. In a candid and heartfelt message, Hunnam mentioned the emotional turmoil his close ones went through upon hearing the false news about his supposed demise. In particular, he emphasized how scared his friends were, which made the entire situation even more upsetting for him. Community Response As soon as the news of the hoax began to unwrap, fans and fellow celebrities came out to support Charlie Hunnam and voice their concerns about the growing problem of fake news. Many shared their relief with learning the truth, but also expressed their disappointment with the individuals who knowingly spread such emotionally distressing hoaxes across the Internet. Lessons Learned This Charlie Hunnam death hoax serves as a reminder of the pitfalls and the potential harm the unchecked dissemination of false information can cause. In a world where news spreads quickly through social media, it is vital that a healthy level of skepticism and fact-checking be practiced before believing in or sharing any piece of information, regardless of how plausible it may seem. If anything good can come from this unfortunate event, it lies in the valuable lesson it imparts to everyone - the necessity of verifying the truthfulness of information available online. Conclusion We live in an era where the spread of false news is a pressing concern. Hoax incidents such as the one involving Charlie Hunnam's death are prime examples of how falsehoods can take root and grow rapidly in the public consciousness. Thankfully, the actor is alive and in good health, but the mental and emotional impact the incident had on his friends and family can never be taken too lightly. It is now more important than ever for individuals to be responsible sharers of information and to always question the authenticity of what they encounter in the digital sphere."},{"question":"Q:I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

He studied under David Grene, Leo Strauss, Richard McKeon, and Alexandre Kojeve. He subsequently taught at Cornell University, the University of Toronto, Yale University, Ecole Normale Superieure of Paris, and the University of Chicago. Bloom championed the idea of Great Books education and became famous for his criticism of contemporary American higher education, with his views being expressed in his bestselling 1987 book, The Closing of the American Mind. Allan Bloom was born in Indianapolis, Indiana in 1930 to second-generation Jewish parents who were both social workers. The couple had a daughter, Lucille, two years earlier. As a thirteen-year-old, Bloom read a Readers Digest article about the University of Chicago and told his parents he wanted to attend; his parents thought it was unreasonable and did not encourage his hopes. Yet, when his family moved to Chicago in 1944, his parents met a psychiatrist and family friend whose son was enrolled in the University of Chicago's humanities program for gifted students. In 1946, Bloom was accepted to the same program, starting his degree at the age of fifteen, and spending the next decade of his life enrolled at the University in Chicago's Hyde Park neighborhood. This began his lifelong passion for the 'idea' of the university. In the preface to Giants and Dwarfs: Essays, 1960-1990, he stated that his education \\"began with Freud and ended with Plato\\". The theme of this education was self-knowledge, or self-discovery--an idea that Bloom would later write, seemed impossible to conceive of for a Midwestern American boy. He credits Leo Strauss as the teacher who made this endeavor possible for him. Bloom graduated from the University of Chicago with his Bachelor's Degree at the age of 18. One of his college classmates was the classicist Seth Benardete. For post-graduate studies, he enrolled in the University of Chicago's Committee on Social Thought, where he was assigned Classicist David Grene as tutor, and went on to write his thesis on Isocrates. Grene recalled Bloom as an energetic and humorous student completely dedicated to studying classics, but with no definite career ambitions. The Committee was a unique interdisciplinary program that attracted a small number of students due to its rigorous academic requirements and lack of clear employment opportunities after graduation. Bloom earned his Ph.D. from the Committee on Social Thought in 1955. He subsequently studied under the influential Hegelian philosopher Alexandre Kojeve in Paris, whose lectures Bloom would later introduce to the English-speaking world. While teaching philosophy at the Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris, he befriended Raymond Aron, amongst many other philosophers. Among the American expatriate community in Paris his friends included leftist writer Susan Sontag.

The Institute was instrumental in initiating studies of healthy development, in contrast to previous work that had been dominated by theories based on pathological personalities. The studies looked at human development during the Great Depression and World War II, unique historical circumstances under which a generation of children grew up. The Oakland Growth Study, initiated by Harold Jones and Herbert Stolz in 1931, aimed to study the physical, intellectual, and social development of children in the Oakland area. Data collection began in 1932 and continued until 1981, allowing the researchers to gather longitudinal data on the individuals that extended past adolescence into adulthood. Jean Macfarlane launched the Berkeley Guidance Study, which examined the development of children in terms of their socioeconomic and family backgrounds. These studies provided the background for Glen Elder in the 1960s, to propose a life-course perspective of adolescent development. Elder formulated several descriptive principles of adolescent development. The principle of historical time and place states that an individual's development is shaped by the period and location in which they grow up. The principle of the importance of timing in one's life refers to the different impact that life events have on development based on when in one's life they occur. The idea of linked lives states that one's development is shaped by the interconnected network of relationships of which one is a part; and the principle of human agency asserts that one's life course is constructed via the choices and actions of an individual within the context of their historical period and social network.

I’d always been curious to learn more about Chihuly, after being introduced to his incredible sculpture suspended over the V&A Museum information desk, a glowing confection of green and white glass whisps. In 1968, after receiving a Fulbright Fellowship, he went to work at the Venini glass factory in Venice, observing the team approach to blowing glass, which is critical to the way he works today. In 1971, Chihuly cofounded Pilchuck Glass School in Washington State. With this international glass center, Chihuly has led the avant-garde in the development of glass as a fine art. His work is included in more than 200 museum collections worldwide.

Photograph: Franck Fife/AFP/Getty Images Just ask any Irishman: the play-offs are not a place you want to be when France are standing puff-chested in the path of World Cup qualification but should the unthinkable happen for England and they fail to beat Poland, then the prospect of facing a revitalised but lowly ranked French side for a place in Brazil is something Roy Hodgson's side must consider. Under Fifa's seeding system, the four top-rated sides will take on the four bottom-rated teams, and the draw to see which four of the eight group runners-up will qualify for next summer's finals will take place on 21 October in Zurich. Although there could be some movement in the Fifa rankings according to the current batch of fixtures, as things stand the seeded teams would be Croatia (10th), Portugal (11th), one of Greece (12th) or Bosnia (18th) and Sweden (22nd). England are 17th in the rankings. France are 25th. It is a controversial system, one the Republic of Ireland fell foul of when they were drawn against France for the 2010 World Cup play-off. The \\"death of football\\", the Republic's then manager Giovanni Trapattoni called it. It could be harsh for England since, even though France are in second place in Group I, behind holders Spain, they demolished Australia 6-0 in a friendly on Friday night. Franck Ribéry gave a sparkling performance, Karim Benzema ended his 15-months international goal drought and Arsenal's Olivier Giroud struck twice. The crushing result, coming in the aftermath of another 6-0 hammering in Brasilia last month, cost Australia's German coach Holger Osieck his job – sacked in the Parc de Princes dressing room after the match – eight months before the Socceroos embark on their fourth World Cup finals campaign. As for Portugal, a hint of sulphur hangs over their camp after Cristiano Ronaldo refused to comment on claims that he deliberately got himself booked in the 1-1 draw with Israel to ensure his availability for the play-offs. The Real Madrid forward will miss the last qualifier at home to Luxembourg on Tuesday through suspension after receiving a yellow card for protesting in the dying minutes against Israel on Friday. \\"I can't talk about that [booking],\\" Ronaldo said. \\"Fifa is always very attentive to those situations. But the play-off is the most important and I don't want to be out. I will be at those two matches.\\" And just who are booking flights to Rio next year after Friday's games? Holland signed off with an 8-1 mauling of Hungary, which was enough for the Magyars' coach, Sandor Egervari, who resigned. Also on their way are Germany after topping Group C with a 3-0 win over the Republic of Ireland. Switzerland, Italy and Belgium are likewise confirmed for Brazil.

Article: The man who invented Coca-Cola was not a native Atlanta, but on the day of his funeral every drugstore in town shut up the shop in honor of him. He was John Styth Pemberton, born in 1833 in Knoxville, Georgia, eighty miles away. Pemberton was a chemist, sometimes known as Doctor, who, during the Civil War, became an officer and led a cavalry troop. He settled in Atlanta in 1869, and soon began making such patent medicines as Triplex Liver Pills and Globe of Flower Cough Syrup. In 1885, he registered a trademark for something called French Wine Coca-Ideal Nerve and Tonic Stimulant. A few months later, he formed the Pemberton Chemical Company, and hired an accountant named Frank M. Robinson, who had not only a good head for figures, but, attached to it, so unique a nose that he could judge the ingredients of a batch of syrup merely by sniffing it. In 1886 --- a year in which, as contemporary Coca-Cola officials like to point out, the English writer Conan Doyle made Sherlock Holmes known publicly and France found the truth about the Statue of Liberty --- Pemberton invented a syrup that he called Coca-Cola. It was a change of his French Wine Coca. He had taken out the wine and added a bit of caffeine, and, when the end product tasted awful, had thrown in some cola nut oil and a few other oils, mixing the mixture in a three-legged iron pot in his back yard and swishing it around with an oar. He distributed it to soda fountains in used beer bottles, and Robinson, with his elegant account's script, instantly designed a label, on which \\"Coca-Cola\\" was written in the style which is still employed. Pemberton looked upon his mixture less as a drink than as a headache cure. One morning in 1886, a man suffering from a headache dragged himself into an Atlanta drugstore and asked for a bottle of Coca-Cola. According to usual practice, druggists should pour a teaspoonful of syrup into a glass of water, but at that time, the man on duty was too lazy to walk to the fresh-water tap. Instead, he mixed the syrup with some soda... Question: How did Pemberton change French Wine Coca formula to make it taste delicious? Answer: The answer is:","response":"Pemberton changed the French Wine Coca formula to make it taste delicious by removing the wine and adding a bit of caffeine. When the end product still tasted awful, he added some cola nut oil and a few other oils, mixing the mixture in a three-legged iron pot in his backyard and swishing it around with an oar.

The American-English Dictionary defines total war as \\"war that is unrestricted in terms of the weapons used, the territory or combatants involved, or the objectives pursued, especially one in which the laws of war are disregarded.\\" - Nazi Germany is the common English name for the period in German history from 1933 to 1945, when Germany was governed by a dictatorship under the control of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party (NSDAP). Under Hitler's rule, Germany was transformed into a fascist state in which the Nazi Party took totalitarian control over nearly all aspects of life. The official name of the state was \\"Deutsches Reich\\" from 1933 to 1943 and \\"Großdeutsches Reich\\" (\\"Greater German Reich\\") from 1943 to 1945. The period is also known under the names the Third Reich and the National Socialist Period (abbreviated as \\"NS-Zeit\\"). The Nazi regime came to an end after the Allied Powers defeated Germany in May 1945, ending World War II in Europe. - Blitzkrieg (German, \\"lightning war\\") is a method of warfare whereby an attacking force, spearheaded by a dense concentration of armoured and motorised or mechanised infantry formations with close air support, breaks through the opponent's line of defence by short, fast, powerful attacks and then dislocates the defenders, using speed and surprise to encircle them. Through the employment of combined arms in manoeuvre warfare, blitzkrieg attempts to unbalance the enemy by making it difficult for it to respond to the continuously changing front and defeating it in a decisive (\\"battle of annihilation\\"). - The Waffen-SS (Armed SS) was the armed wing of the Nazi Party's SS organisation. Its formations included men from Nazi Germany, along with volunteers and conscripts from both occupied and un-occupied lands. - The Luftwaffe was the aerial warfare branch of the combined German Wehrmacht military forces during World War II. Germany's military air arms during the First World War, the \\"Luftstreitkräfte\\" of the Army and the \\"Marine-Fliegerabteilung\\" of the Navy, had been disbanded in May 1920 as a result of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles which stated that Germany was forbidden to have any air force. - The Wehrmacht (lit. \\"defence force\\") was the unified armed forces of Nazi Germany from 1935 to 1946. It consisted of the \\"Heer\\" (army), the \\"Kriegsmarine\\" (navy) and the \\"Luftwaffe\\" (air force). The designation \\"Wehrmacht\\" for Nazi Germany's military replaced the previously used term, \\"Reichswehr\\" (191935), and was the manifestation of Nazi Germany's efforts to rearm the nation to a greater extent than the Treaty of Versailles permitted. - Strategic bombing is a military strategy used in a total war with the goal of defeating the enemy by destroying its morale or its economic ability to produce and transport materiel to the theatres of military operations, or both. It is a systematically organized and executed attack from the air which can utilize strategic bombers, long- or medium-range missiles, or nuclear-armed fighter-bomber aircraft to attack targets deemed vital to the enemy's war-making capability. - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - Carl Philipp Gottfried (or Gottlieb) von Clausewitz (1 June 1780 16 November 1831) was a Prussian general and military theorist who stressed the \\"moral\\" (meaning, in modern terms, psychological) and political aspects of war. His most notable work, \\"Vom Kriege\\" (\\"On War\\"), was unfinished at his death. Clausewitz was a realist in many different senses and, while in some respects a romantic, also drew heavily on the rationalist ideas of the European Enlightenment. - A great power is a sovereign state that is recognized as having the ability and expertise to exert its influence on a global scale. Great powers characteristically possess military and economic strength, as well as diplomatic and soft power influence, which may cause middle or small powers to consider the great powers' opinions before taking actions of their own. International relations theorists have posited that great power status can be characterized into power capabilities, spatial aspects, and status dimensions. - The Holocaust (from the Greek ': \\"hólos\\", \\"whole\\" and \\"kaustós\\", \\"burnt\\"), also referred to as the Shoah\\"' (Hebrew: , \\"HaShoah\\", \\"the catastrophe\\"), was a genocide in which Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany and its collaborators killed about six million Jews. The victims included 1.5 million children and represented about two-thirds of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe. Some definitions of the Holocaust include the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders, bringing the total to about 11 million. Killings took place throughout Nazi Germany, German-occupied territories, and territories held by allies of Nazi Germany. - A military alliance is an international agreement concerning national security, when the contracting parties promise to support each other in case of a crisis that has not been identified in advance. Military alliances differ from coalitions, as coalitions are formed for a crisis that are already known. - Panzer - Division Clausewitz was a German panzer division during World War II , named for Carl von Clausewitz . It was formed in central Germany area at the beginning of April 1945 under the command of Generalleutnant Martin Unrein , from the 233rd Panzergrenadier Division and also drawing Panzergrenadier troops from the 233rd Reserve Panzer Division and vehicles from the Panzer training school at Putlos . Other elements came from the reserve brigade of the Großdeutschland division , the remnants of the Holstein panzer division , the Panzerkorps Feldherrnhalle , and units drawn from Army Group Blumentritt . Most of the infantry were front - line veterans who had been posted to reserve divisions after recovering from injuries , and the tank crews were mostly composed of instructors . However , the unit was heavily deficient in equipment - overall , only around 20 % of the assigned vehicles were available . The equipment was also often outdated - several tanks were Panzer IIIs or Panzer IVs - and in a bad state of repair . Individual units were equipped with a variety of vehicles , making maintenance difficult , and ammunition was in short supply . There were no artillery pieces , very little signals equipment , and no supply troops . It first saw action in the northern front , fighting British armoured units from the 10th to the 12th , before being assigned to the XXXIX Corps . The XXXIX Corps was ordered to push south to cut the supply lines of the leading American divisions , which had now reached as far as the Elbe river , and attempt to link up with the 11th SS Panzer Army , which was fighting in the Harz mountains . Most division 's personnel were killed , wounded or taken prisoner in this push , and by the 20th it had split into small disorganised groups . On the 24th , the divisional commander was captured by American troops . - Hiroshima is perhaps best known as the first city in history to be targeted by a nuclear weapon when the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped an atomic bomb on the city (and later on Nagasaki) at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, near the end of World War II. - During World War II, the American atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki made Nagasaki the second and, to date, last city in the world to experience a nuclear attack. - A tank is an armored fighting vehicle designed for front-line combat, with heavy firepower, strong armour, and tracks providing good battlefield manoeuvrability. The first tanks were designed to overcome the deadlock of trench warfare; now they are a mainstay of modern ground forces and a key part of combined arms combat. - The term panzer division as commonly used in English language refers almost exclusively to the armored (tank) division in the army branch of the Wehrmacht and of Nazi Germany during World War II. The panzer divisions were the key element of German success in the Blitzkrieg operations of the early years of the war. Later the Waffen-SS formed panzer divisions, and even the Luftwaffe fielded a panzer division, the Herman Goring Division. The term \\"Panzerdivision\\" is still used in today's Heer of the Bundeswehr (for example 1. Panzerdivision). In German speaking countries the term is not immediately associated with the Wehrmacht as it is in English speaking nations, as the word simply means 'armored division' and has no additional connotation. - In politics and military planning, a war effort refers to a coordinated mobilization of society's resourcesboth industrial and humantowards the support of a military force. Depending on the militarization of the culture, the relative size of the armed forces and the society supporting them, the style of government, and the popular support for the military objectives, such war effort can range from a small industry to complete command of society. - The United States dropped nuclear weapons on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively, during the final stage of World War II. The United States had dropped the bombs with the consent of the United Kingdom as outlined in the Quebec Agreement. The two bombings, which killed at least 129,000 people, remain the only use of nuclear weapons for warfare in history. - The Bundeswehr (\\"Federal Defence\\") is the unified armed forces of Germany and their civil administration and procurement authorities. The States of Germany are not allowed to maintain armed forces of their own, since the German Constitution states that matters of defense fall into the sole responsibility of the federal government. - Vom Kriege is a book on war and military strategy by Prussian general Carl von Clausewitz (17801831), written mostly after the Napoleonic wars, between 1816 and 1830, and published posthumously by his wife Marie von Brühl in 1832. It has been translated into English several times as On War. \\"On War\\" is actually an unfinished work; Clausewitz had set about revising his accumulated manuscripts in 1827, but did not live to finish the task. His wife edited his collected works and published them between 1832 and 1835. His 10-volume collected works contain most of his larger historical and theoretical writings, though not his shorter articles and papers or his extensive correspondence with important political, military, intellectual and cultural leaders in the Prussian state. \\"On War\\" is formed by the first three volumes and represents his theoretical explorations. It is one of the most important treatises on political-military analysis and strategy ever written, and remains both controversial and an influence on strategic thinking.

However, I can offer some general insight on how someone in Bailey's situation who heard God's voice and was believed to be insane might feel afterward. 1. Relief: If Bailey truly believes that they heard God's voice, they might feel a sense of relief and consolation, even if others think they are insane. The spiritual experience could provide comfort and a sense of purpose for them. 2. Isolation: If Bailey's friends and family consider them to be insane, Bailey could feel socially isolated and disconnected. They might struggle to talk about their experience or feel misunderstood and ostracized. 3. Confusion: Bailey might experience confusion over their mental state, as they might question whether their experience was truly divine or a symptom of a mental health issue. 4. Fear: If Bailey becomes convinced that their experience was a symptom of mental illness, they might be afraid of the potential consequences, such as stigmatization, losing their support network, or being confined to a psychiatric institution. 5. Hope: Depending on the message that Bailey believes they received from God, they might also feel a sense of hope for the future, whether for personal growth, healing, or their life's journey. Ultimately, it is essential to remember that Bailey's emotions would likely be complex and multifaceted, making it difficult to predict their exact feelings.

A gallant college student was punched in the face and thrown onto the subway tracks after coming to the aid of a woman being beaten on a Manhattan platform Thursday night. Jered Harvey, 19, never panicked and managed to get back onto the platform at Fulton St., on the 2 and 3 line, before a train roared into the station. He escaped from the railbed despite the madman trying to prevent him from climbing back up, Harvey said. The hero may have picked up his calm demeanor from his stepfather, Olivier Busquet, an accomplished professional poker player who has earned over 3 million in his career. Rayfield Grant, 29, who is homeless and has a history of drug-related arrests, was collared following the dramatic confrontation and arraigned Friday on charges of second-degree attempted murder and first-degree attempted assault. Harvey, a 5-foot-8, 135-pound economics student at Pace University, said he had just finished an evening class and was headed back to his residence hall in Brooklyn when he saw Grant punching a woman on the platform about 10 p.m. Some 20 straphangers turned a blind eye to the melee. RELATED: FAMILY OF QUEENS MAN CRUSHED BY TRAIN SUES MTA “It seemed like everybody was walking away, just ignoring it, which was crazy because they were beating the hell out of each other,” Harvey said. So he took it upon himself to intervene — though the chivalrous student was careful not to appear threatening. “I walk up to them and say, ‘I don’t know you, I don’t want any trouble, but come on, let’s not do anything rash,’” Harvey recalled. But his soft talk did little to soothe Grant’s rage. “Oh, you want to help?” Grant said, according to Harvey. Then Grant started swinging, grabbed the teen by the neck and pushed him to the tracks, Harvey said. The Good Samaritan landed hard on one knee but was able to avoid rolling onto the third rail. He immediately scoped out his surroundings, and decided he needed to ditch his backpack. A woman sitting on a bench stared blankly at Harvey as he tried to escape the tracks, the teen said. “Can you hold my bag? Can you please just hold my bag?” Harvey pleaded. But the woman ignored him. As he tried to clamber back onto the platform, Grant allegedly stood in his way. “He was boxing me out,” Harvey said. “I moved right, he moved right. I moved left, he moved left.” RELATED: SUBWAY PUSHER IN COURT Harvey decided if a train arrived, he would be safe in deep drainage ditches on the tracks. “Worst-case scenario, I figured I could lay down,” he said. “I’d be dirty, but I’d be fine.” Eventually, Harvey was able to climb to safety as the commotion over the shocking turn of events grew. Once on the platform, the student ran into a friend from Pace, and Grant began getting in both of their faces and swinging wildly, Harvey said. The friends ran aboveground and called the police. Bizarrely, Grant did not flee on an arriving train, but instead walked right into the clutches of authorities swarming the scene, Harvey said. The suspect was held in lieu of 75,000 bond or 50,000 cash after his arraignment. “The defendant is a predicate felon,” Assistant District Attorney Andrew Stengel told the judge. “This defendant has a bench warrant history. He is a probation violator.” Harvey didn’t require medical attention.

The film centers around anthropological professor Conrad Hamilton (F. Murray Abraham) attempting to study a new species of primate, possibly the missing link between humanity and the great ape, found in a hidden valley deep within the jungles of Thailand. The movie opens into action with Hamilton's initial research team trying to capture one of these new (and very large) primates, but fails and is apparently wiped out. Hamilton and his assistant Chenne (Prapimporn Karnchanda) survive and scour the camp site looking for clues and remains of their team. Meanwhile, another research team is inbound, this one a motley crew of incredibly naive college anthropology students with no idea of what they're in for. The students Seth, Amy, Greg, Sydney, Josh, and Dani are flown into a remote region of the Thai jungle, and picked up by a guide who drives them deeper into bush. He drops them off in a panic at the edge of trail/road, which leads further still into the foliage, claiming \\"bad things\\" are in there and won't go any further. He high-tails it back the way he came, leaving the students to march forth into the unknown. They walk until they reach the end of trail and set up camp. As evening sets in, noises from the jungle raise suspicion until a set of glowing green eyes can be seen close by, watching. Just before the unknown creature attacks, Chenne arrives with a flare that scares off the unseen menace. Chenne escorts the students to the relative safety of Professor Hamilton's camp, and the following day they meet the obsessed man and learn of his mission and their purpose...sort of. Hamilton professes of dream findings in a uncharted region of the jungle and their potential for career-launching documentation.

In recent years, technological developments have dramatically reshaped the way we live, work, and communicate. With the rapid rise of smartphones and the internet, today's teenagers are more connected than ever before. While technology has brought about various benefits, such as increased access to information and seamless communication, concerns have emerged regarding its potential impact on the mental health of teenagers. The prevalence of social media, online gaming, and the constant exposure to various media sources play an integral role in the daily lives of young people, potentially leading to significant changes in their psychological well-being. Hypothesis: The excessive use of modern technology, such as smartphones and social media, has a detrimental impact on the mental health of teenagers. To study this hypothesis, researchers can investigate the correlation between screen time, social media use, and the incidence of mental health issues in teenagers, such as anxiety, depression, and sleep disorders. They might also delve into the role of technology in the development of addictive behaviors and the ways in which some online platforms, like social media, can promote comparison, feelings of inadequacy, and low self-esteem. Variables to consider in this study could include the time spent using various forms of technology, the nature and content of that usage, the age and developmental stage of the teenagers, as well as social and economic factors that may be contributing to their mental health. By analyzing the data collected, researchers can determine whether the hypothesis is supported, and if so, identify ways in which parents, educators, and policymakers can address the issue and promote healthier technology habits among teenagers. Possible solutions may involve developing strategies for managing screen time, promoting more balanced and age-appropriate use of technology, and implementing interventions to support mental health in adolescents. In conclusion, the context of this study revolves around the impact of modern technology on the mental health of teenagers, while the hypothesis suggests that excessive use of such technology may have negative consequences for their psychological well-being. Through careful study and analysis, we can seek to better understand the relationship between technology and mental health, ultimately helping us to foster a healthier and more balanced approach to technology use for future generations."},{"question":"Please answer the following question by reasoning step-by-step.

In this task, you're given a paragraph from the research paper and your task is to generate a suitable title for the research paper based on the given paper. Under 100 words is a good title length. We investigated whether circulating osteopontin (OPN) could be used as a biomarker for cervical cancer. We employed a monoclonal antibody (mAb 659) specific for the unique and intact thrombin-sensitive site in OPN using an inhibition ELISA. We found significantly higher levels of OPN in 33 cervical cancer patients in both the plasma (mean +/-SD, 612 +/-106 ng/ mL) and serum (424 +/-121 ng/mL) compared to healthy subjects [409 +/-56 ng/mL, from 31 plasma samples (P < 0.0001), and 314 +/-98 ng/mL, from 32 serum samples (P = 0.0002), respectively]. Similar results were obtained when the plasma from a bigger group (147 individuals) of cervical cancer patients (560 +/-211 ng/mL) were compared with the same plasma samples of the healthy individuals (P = 0.0014). More significantly, the OPN level was highest in stage III-IV disease (614 +/-210 ng/mL, from 52 individuals; P = 0.0001) and least and nondiscriminatory in stage I (473 +/-110 ng/mL, from 40 individuals; P = 0.5318). No such discrimination was found when a mAb of a different specificity (mAb 446) was used in a similar inhibition ELISA to compare the two groups in the first study; a commercial capture ELISA also failed. The possibility that the target epitope recognized by the antibody probe in these assays was absent from the circulating OPN due to protein truncation was supported by gel fractionation of the OPN found in patients' plasma: 60-64 kDa fragments were found instead of the presumably full-length OPN (68 kDa) seen in healthy people. How these fragments are generated and what possible role they play in cancer biology remain interesting questions. . As a member of the family of small integrin-binding ligand, N-linked glycophosphoproteins (SIBLINGs), OPN is highly conserved among mammals [3] . Human OPN has 314 amino acids, including a unique and conserved thrombin-sensitive site. Cleavage of this site by thrombin, which normally occurs in the circulation, fragments the protein roughly into two equal halves, each with different biological activities. The amino-terminal half of the protein binds to a variety of cell surface integrins, such as αvβ1, αvβ3, αvβ5, αvβ6, and α8β1, through the arginine-glycine-aspartate ( 159 RGD 161 ) motif in the protein, and also with α4β1 and α9β1 integrins, through the thrombin-generated site ( 162 SVVYGLR 168 ). The carboxy-terminal half interacts with the CD44 cell surface splice variants, CD44v6 and CD44v3 [4, 5] . Through these various extracellular interactions, thrombin-activated OPN plays pivotal roles in diverse physiological processes, such as bone remodeling, inflammation, and wound healing [6], as well as in various pathologies, including autoimmunity [7-9] and tumor metastasis [10] or progression [11, 12] . Thrombin-activated OPN has also been reported to inhibit the apoptosis in, or promote the survival and proliferation of, cancer cells [3] . More recently, OPN was shown to exert an intracellular function which can affect diverse cellular processes such as tumor progression [13] and interferon-α production in dendritic cells [14] . Here, too, these functions require the OPN protein to be appropriately cleaved, not by thrombin, but by various caspases [15] or produced as appropriate truncates from RNA splice variants [16] [17] [18] . Extracellularly, various metalloproteinases (MMPs) also cleave OPN into various types of fragments which have various tumorigenic or biological activities [19, 20] . Overexpression of OPN in the form of mRNA transcripts or intracellular proteins was observed in tumor tissues derived from breast or lung cancer [21, 22] , ovarian cancer [23] , and cervical cancer [24] [25] [26] [27] . Significantly increased levels of circulating OPN were also reported for several types of cancer including cervical cancer [26] , prostate cancer [28] , and colorectal cancer [29] . However, there were conflicting reports regarding head and neck squamous cell carcinoma [30, 31] . In addition, different diagnostic kits were found to yield quite different results from one another for the same patient samples [32] . We were interested to use this non-invasive method to examine our cervical cancer patients. This type of cancer is very common in Hong Kong [24]; it is highly invasive and lethal since the disease can progress rapidly and asymptomatically from preclinical-lesion to overt cancer. We were disappointed with the results obtained initially using a commercial OPN detection kit, and consequently decided to devise our own detection assays. We herein describe the development of such an assay based on the use of a unique monoclonal antibody and an assay format that is used infrequently-inhibition ELISA.","response":"Title: \\"Circulating Osteopontin as a Potential Biomarker for Cervical Cancer: Detection using Inhibition ELISA with a Unique Monoclonal Antibody\\""},{"question":"USS Adela - USS Adela (1862) was a steamer captured by the Union Navy during the American Civil War.

Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","response":"No, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. In logic and reasoning, for a hypothesis to be entailed by a premise, the conclusion (hypothesis) should necessarily follow from the given statement (premise). The premise and the hypothesis should be intrinsically connected in such a way that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis must be true. In simpler terms, the hypothesis should not introduce any new information not provided or implied by the premise. From the premise, \\"I guess I can bear the cold it's just when it does the wind hits,\\" we understand that the speaker can tolerate cold temperatures but struggles when there's wind during cold weather. This premise implies that the difficulty in enduring the cold arises when there is wind, regardless of the wind's speed, which is not specified. However, the hypothesis, \\"I can bear the cold until the wind goes above 10 miles per hour,\\" introduces a specific wind speed (\\"above 10 miles per hour\\") that wasn't indicated in the premise. The premise makes no mention of difficulty dealing with a specific wind speed, but rather the presence of wind in general during cold weather. Hence, we cannot infer this wind speed limitation from the given premise.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose \\"mushrooms dont have much nutrition\\" happens, how will it affect less spores germinate. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","response":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests that if \\"mushrooms don't have much nutrition,\\" it may lead to fewer spores germinating. This could happen because the lack of nutrients may weaken the overall health and vitality of the mature mushroom, possibly resulting in the production of fewer spores, or the spores produced might be less viable due to the lack of nutrients in the parent mushroom. If fewer spores germinate, it would affect the process, as there would be fewer mycelium growing, which could potentially lead to fewer new mushrooms being formed. The perturbation does have an indirect effect on the process, as it influences the germination and subsequent growth of the spores. However, the relationship between the nutritional content of mushrooms and spore germination could be influenced by other factors such as environmental conditions, the presence of other organisms, and the specific species of mushroom involved."},{"question":"How does this story end?

The officials who issued these orders did not know that there were additional hijacked aircraft, or that one such aircraft was en route to Washington. These measures were precautionary steps taken because of the strikes in New York. The FAA and White House Teleconferences. The FAA, the White House, and the Defense Department each initiated a multiagency teleconference before 9:30. Because none of these teleconferences-at least before 10:00- included the right officials from both the FAA and Defense Department, none succeeded in meaningfully coordinating the military and FAA response to the hijackings. At about 9:20, security personnel at FAA headquarters set up a hijacking teleconference with several agencies, including the Defense Department. The NMCC officer who participated told us that the call was monitored only periodically because the information was sporadic, it was of little value, and there were other important tasks. The FAA manager of the teleconference also remembered that the military participated only briefly before the Pentagon was hit. Both individuals agreed that the teleconference played no role in coordinating a response to the attacks of 9/11. Acting Deputy Administrator Belger was frustrated to learn later in the morning that the military had not been on the call. At the White House, the video teleconference was conducted from the Situation Room by Richard Clarke, a special assistant to the president long involved in counterterrorism.

Saving Money I would be lying if I didn’t say that I was financially driven to prepare a kit. The state of Virginia has one three-day sales tax holiday weekend beginning the first Friday in August. Yes, saving on tax pushed me to buy a bunch of stuff that I just may need one day.

The plot revolved around Drake, a character who aroused in her a mixture of sentiments ranging from curiosity and interest to bewilderment and unsettled unease. It wasn’t merely the psychological aspect of Drake that intrigued her, it was the underlying thought, the undisclosed suspicion he held against Harg Tholan that caught her attention. Harg Tholan was not an innocent character, to begin with. Even though not explicitly guilty, his demeanor and actions were questionable enough to cast doubts upon him. His name resonated with uncanny vibrations, and his existence added a sense of mystery to the intrigue, making the situation even more perplexing and cryptic. In the confusion of this commotion, the pencil was her only companion. It was a tool that helped her connect the tangled loop of thoughts, much like a lighthouse guides a ship struggling amidst a tempestuous sea. But her weapon, her guide, had somehow failed her. The point of her pencil had broken, leaving her feeling restless as if a warrior left defenseless in face of an approaching threat. However, her spirit did not dwindle. She realized that the obstacle was merely a broken pencil tip and not her fervent will to resolve the conundrum before her. Unlocking a new pencil, she wrote under Drake’s column, questioning why he was suspicious of Harg Tholan. The words, finely etched on the paper, looked back at her as if mocking her inability to comprehend the situation. The crisp edges of the freshly sharpened pencil burnt the accumulating cloud of doubts, fuelling her determination to unravel the truth. Feeling accomplished yet anxious, she put an arrow pointing to the other column, a path that had to be followed, another riddle that demanded a solution. The entire scenario appeared as a labyrinth, with multiple lanes and various turns. It was challenging, yes, but it was the kind of stimulation she thrived in. Despite the confusion, she found herself immersed in the joy of the unexplored, a mystery that begged her curiosity. Each name, each suspicion, each underscored doubt was a piece of the puzzle, and she was engrossed in assembling the fragments to form a coherent picture. In essence, she was playing according to her age, nineteen. Full of life, she thrived in adventures and mysteries, finding joy in pursuing the unknown. It was a dance with thoughts and words, a rollercoaster ride into the darkest secrets and shared suspicions. And thus, with a charged belief and armed with a newly sharpened pencil, she was ready to confront the subsequent mysteries that awaited her discerning eyes and speculative mind. The relief of venting out her feelings on paper was inevitably energizing and thrilling, promising her the thrill of the chase she so desired."},{"question":"Question: how big did girl scout cookie boxes used to be?

The ceiling of the apartment has a leak, which worsens on a daily basis. Matsubara complains to the janitor but he does nothing to fix the leak. She then tries to go to the floor above her apartment to find out the root of the leak, and discovers that the apartment is locked. Strange events then happen repeatedly: a red bag with a bunny on the front reappears no matter how often Yoshimi tries to dispose of it. Hair is found in tap water.

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","response":"If the moss is affected by a moss-killing disease, it will result in a reduction or cessation of moss growth in the affected area. Since mosses play an active role in causing rocks to split apart through their root growth, the reduction in moss growth will have a direct impact on the extent to which rocks break apart due to the penetration of roots. When the number of mosses and their roots decreases, there will be less force exerted by the roots on the rock's pores and crevices, thereby leading to a decrease in the splitting of rocks. This perturbation, or disturbance, of the moss population would have a lessening effect on the rate at which rocks crack and break apart. Moreover, mosses and lichens are significant agents of physical and chemical weathering processes that contribute to the breakdown of rocks. They produce organic acids that dissolve minerals in the rocks, further weakening the structure of the rocks. With the moss-killing disease affecting the moss population, the overall weathering process on the rocks will be slowed, leading to a lessened rate of rock degradation and cracking. The overall combined effect will be less damage to the rocks, as the potential for root penetration and subsequent biological weathering processes will be diminished. In conclusion, if the moss is afflicted with a moss-killing disease, it will lead to reduced growth and population of mosses, ultimately resulting in a lessened effect on the roots growing into rocks and a decreased rate of rock splitting and weathering processes."},{"question":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Samantha was taking cooking classes..","response":"Maria cooked less of a variety of foods than Samantha, even though Maria was taking cooking classes. This puzzled many of the people around them, considering one would expect Maria to be the better cook. Step 1: Address the choice that has been made. In this case, the choice is [a]. Maria was taking cooking classes. Step 2: On the basis of the choice made, expand the story logically. Since Maria was taking cooking classes, people around her expected her culinary skills to improve and for her to prepare a variety of delicious dishes. However, it was intriguing to see that her cooking still lacked the diversity that Samantha naturally seemed to have. Step 3: Justify the reason or discuss the effects of the choice made. There could be several reasons why Maria's cooking remained less diverse despite taking classes. Perhaps she lacked the passion and creativity required to experiment with new ingredients and recipes. Another possibility was that the cooking classes were focused on a specific cuisine or type of dish, limiting Maria's overall growth as a cook. Step 4: Develop a comparison between the choice made ([a]) and the alternative option ([b]), if possible. In contrast, Samantha had not taken any cooking classes but displayed a natural ability to create elaborate dishes with ease. She seemed to have an innate love for cooking and constantly experimented with new flavors and ingredients. Samantha's enthusiasm and sense of adventure in the kitchen could be part of the reason behind her broader range of dishes. Step 5: Introduce a possible outcome or event occurring due to the choice made. As Maria noticed the stark difference in their culinary abilities, she decided to engage more with Samantha and learn new recipes from her. She realized that while her cooking classes provided her with essential skills and techniques, it was the passion and creativity that she had to cultivate on her own. By spending more time with Samantha, Maria hoped to ignite her latent culinary passion and ultimately become a better cook, capable of creating a rich variety of foods, just like her friend.

Answer:","response":"The family that holds the hereditary right to the office of Earl Marshal of England is the Howard family, specifically the Dukes of Norfolk. The office of Earl Marshal, a prestigious and powerful position within the English aristocracy, has been intimately connected to the Howard family since the late 15th century. The Howards are an English noble family with a long and storied history in British politics, military engagements, and culture. Their origins can be traced back to the 10th century, but it was in the late medieval period that the family rose to prominence under the guidance of John Howard, who became the 1st Duke of Norfolk in 1483. The position of Earl Marshal dates back to the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. Initially, the responsibilities of the Earl Marshal included overseeing the royal household, managing the monarchy's horses and hounds, commanding the army, and overseeing state occasions, such as the coronation of the monarch. The office's role has evolved over time, and today, the Earl Marshal is responsible for organizing significant ceremonial events, including the coronation of a new monarch, the State Opening of Parliament, and state funerals. The Earl Marshal is also the head of the College of Arms, which oversees heraldry in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. The hereditary nature of the office of Earl Marshal was established in the 14th century, and the Mowbray family initially held the title. However, when the Mowbray line became extinct in 1481, the title passed to the Howard family through the marriage of John Howard's son, Thomas Howard, to Anne Mowbray, the last Mowbray heiress. Since that time, the successive Dukes of Norfolk have held the title, with two notable interruptions. First, the attainder (confiscation of titles and properties) of Thomas Howard, the 3rd Duke of Norfolk, in 1547 led to a temporary suspension of the title. The restoration of the dukedom and the position of Earl Marshal occurred in 1559 when Elizabeth I came to the throne. The second interruption occurred in 1694 when the 9th Duke of Norfolk died without a direct heir, and the title was held in abeyance until 1731, when the dukedom was restored to the Howard family. Currently, the 18th Duke of Norfolk, Edward Fitzalan-Howard, holds the hereditary right to the office of Earl Marshal. Throughout the centuries, the Howard family has played a prominent role in British history and has been closely linked to the monarchy. As the office of Earl Marshal continues to have both historical significance and modern-day responsibilities, the connection between the Howard family and this essential role remains a key part of the English aristocracy and its heritage."},{"question":"What's an example of a movie review?","response":"Sure, my little friend!

The music in the movie is really nice too and it makes you feel like you're swimming along with them. Finding Nemo teaches us about the love of family and the importance of never giving up. It can be a bit scary at times, especially when there are big sharks, but it always stays exciting and fun. In the end, this movie makes you laugh, cry, and cheer. I think \\"Finding Nemo\\" is a must-see movie, especially for those who love amazing sea adventures!\\""},{"question":"I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot. Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: The Age of Stupid Movie plot: The film begins in the year 2055, in a world ravaged by catastrophic climate change; London is flooded, Sydney is burning, Las Vegas has been swallowed up by desert, the Amazon rainforest has burnt up, snow has vanished from the Alps, and nuclear war has laid waste to India. An unnamed archivist (Pete Postlethwaite) is entrusted with the safekeeping of humanity's surviving store of art and knowledge. Alone in his vast repository off the coast of the largely ice-free Arctic, he reviews archival footage from back \\"when we could have saved ourselves\\", trying to discern where it all went wrong. Amid news reports of the gathering effects of climate change and global civilization teetering towards destruction, he alights on six stories of individuals whose lives in the early years of the 21st century seem to illustrate aspects of the impending catastrophe. These six stories take the form of interweaving documentary segments that report on the lives of real people around the year 2008 and switch the film's narrative form from fiction to fact. In addition to the framing narrative in 2055, the news clips and the documentary footage of the six personal stories, the films includes animated segments and brief interviews with Mark Lynas and George Monbiot, created for the film.[citation needed] My question: What country has nuclear war destroyed?","response":"In the movie plot of \\"The Age of Stupid,\\" the country that has been destroyed by nuclear war is India."},{"question":"Audra Ann McDonald (born July 3, 1970) is an American actress and singer.

From the sentence, we can infer that the Bulblins take the children from Ordon Village. To elaborate further, the sentence describes an attack on Ordon Village (assumingly from a video game or story) where these creatures called Bulblins invade and kidnap the village children. Link, presumably a protagonist in the story, pursues the Bulblins in an effort to save the kidnapped children. However, his pursuit is hindered when he encounters a wall of Twilight, which likely creates a barrier or some form of obstacle that prevents him from chasing the Bulblins directly.

Lublin is the largest Polish city east of the Vistula River, and is located approximately to the southeast of Warsaw by road. One of the events that greatly contributed to the city's development was the Polish-Lithuanian Union of Krewo in 1385. Lublin thrived as a centre of trade and commerce due to its strategic location on the route between Vilnius and Kraków; the inhabitants also had the privilege of free trade in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The Lublin Parliament session of 1569 led to the creation of a real union between the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, thus creating the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Lublin also witnessed the early stages of Reformation in the 16th century. A Calvinist congregation was founded and certain groups of radical Arians also appeared in the city, making it an important global centre of Arianism.

Answer choices: - planted - dead - fertile - observed - ruined - dormant - reproduce - food The answer is:","response":"reproduce. To elaborate further on the answer, a flower's purpose is indeed to be planted. However, analyzing the intrinsic function of a flower in the plant kingdom allows us to deduce a more precise purpose. The ultimate aim of a flower is to reproduce and ensure the continuity of the plant species. To achieve this, flowers play a critical role in the process of pollination, leading to the development of seeds, and consequently, new plants. Plants produce flowers in order to create reproductive structures that facilitate pollination – the transfer of pollen from the male reproductive organ (anther) to the female reproductive organ (stigma) of the same or another flower. This process is essential for the production of seeds, which guarantee the continuity of the plant species. Pollination is often facilitated by various agents, such as insects, birds, and wind, which carry pollen from one flower to another. Each of the given answer choices can be evaluated in relation to the reproductive purpose of a flower: 1. Planted: While planting a flower is significant, as it helps secure the flower's place in the soil and its access to necessary resources, it is an action performed by humans or other agents and is not the purpose of the flower itself. 2. Dead: Death is an inevitable part of a flower's life cycle, as it is for any other living organism. However, death does not define the purpose of a flower. 3. Fertile: Fertility is a vital aspect of a flower's ability to reproduce; however, it is a condition that enables the flower to fulfill its purpose, rather than being the purpose itself. 4. Observed: Flowers are undoubtedly beautiful and can be a source of pleasure for humans and other animals that appreciate their visual appeal. However, the primary purpose behind their colorful and fragrant features is to attract pollinators, which help facilitate the reproductive process. 5. Ruined: Ruining a flower is detrimental to its reproductive purpose and works against its natural function. 6. Dormant: While some plants, including flowers, become dormant, particularly during winter months, dormancy is a survival mechanism rather than the ultimate purpose of the flower. 7. Food: Many flowers serve as a source of food for various animals, including insects, birds, and humans. However, while providing food was a way to attract pollinators, it is not the primary purpose of a flower. Its underlying function remains oriented toward reproduction. In conclusion, the most accurate answer choice is \\"reproduce,\\" as the intrinsic function of a flower is to play a vital role in the plant's reproductive process, ensuring the continuity and survival of the plant species."},{"question":"Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: In a great many cities, hundreds of people ride bicycles to work every day.

Michael Williams is a drifter living out of his car after being discharged from the Marine Corps. A job on an oilfield falls through due to his unwillingness to conceal a war injury on his job application, so Michael wanders into rural Red Rock, Wyoming, looking for other work. A local bar owner named Wayne mistakes him for a hit man, \\"Lyle from Dallas\\", whom Wayne has hired to kill his wife.

Michael visits Wayne's wife, Suzanne and attempts to warn her that her life is in danger instead of killing her. She offers him more money to kill Wayne.

Lyle and Wayne quickly figure out what has transpired, while Michael desperately tries to warn Suzanne before Lyle finds her. The next morning, when Lyle comes to get money from Wayne, he kidnaps both Suzanne and Michael, who are trying to retrieve hidden cash from Wayne's office. Wayne and Suzanne are revealed to be wanted for embezzlement and Wayne is arrested by his own deputies. Lyle returns with Michael and Suzanne hostage and gets Wayne out of jail to retrieve their stash of money.

Ernest Answer:","response":"Title: The Hand of Fate Genre: Mystery/Thriller/Drama Plot: Act 1: Introducing Ernest Hollway Ernest Hollway is a talented, but struggling artist living in a small suburban town. He is an introvert and keeps to himself, spending most of his time in his studio, creating compelling, dark, and surreal paintings. Ernest's work has long been unpopular, received by his conservative community with fear and disapproval. However, deep inside, Ernest knows his works hold immense significance and he is determined to prove that his artistic vision is meaningful. Act 2: The Anonymous Letter One day, Ernest receives an anonymous letter in the mail. The letter states that his artwork has caught the attention of a powerful and wealthy art patron who wants to showcase his paintings in a prestigious international art gallery. The only condition mentioned in the letter is that Ernest must produce a masterpiece that represents the ultimate self-sacrifice, something that pushes the boundaries of human emotions and physical limitations. Feeling inspired and determined to make the most of this opportunity, Ernest plunges himself into his work, becoming more isolated and detached from reality in the process. Act 3: The Accident As Ernest desperately tries to create his defining piece, he has an epiphany. He believes that true art must come from the depths of the soul, and to fully express himself, he must sacrifice a part of himself to his art. In a moment of madness, Ernest severs his right hand, his painting hand, and incorporates it in his painting, which he now considers his masterpiece. He titles the work \\"The Hand of Fate.\\" Act 4: The Exhibition Ernest's dedication pays off when his masterpiece is accepted into the exclusive international art exhibition. His work garners massive attention, creating controversy and intrigue in the art world. This attention comes with its fair share of suspicion, leading to an investigation to verify the authenticity of Ernest's claim about his hand. Act 5: The Truth Unfolds The police detective, Jessica Adams, assigned to the case is not just interested in confirming the authenticity of Ernest's story – she's determined to discover the true identity of the mysterious art patron behind the anonymous letter. Using the clues she finds, Jessica eventually discovers the patron's identity: it's none other than a local doctor who is known for his eccentric art collection and who has secretly admired Ernest's work for years. Act 6: The Confrontation When Ernest learns about the identity of his secret benefactor, he is both grateful and conflicted. He confronts the doctor, accusing him of taking advantage of his vulnerability and desperation. The doctor, however, insists that he truly believes in Ernest's art and his capacity to change the world through it; he claims that the choice to sever his hand was a test for Ernest — a test of his commitment to his work. The doctor sincerely apologizes for pushing Ernest to such extremes. Act 7: The Aftermath As the film concludes, Ernest is left to grapple with the consequences of his life-altering choice. His artwork is now both famous and infamous, with some praising him for his bravery and others denouncing him as a madman. Ernest and the doctor remain in touch, with the doctor offering to fund an exhibition of Ernest's future works. Ernest begins to find new ways to create art with his remaining hand, coming to terms with the fact that the physical act of creating art is but one aspect of what it truly means to be an artist. \\"The Hand of Fate\\" serves as a turning point in his life, but despite the notoriety and fame it has brought him, Ernest knows he'll never create a piece like it again. Ernest's story stands as a testament to the thin line between artistic vision and self-destruction, showing the audience the depths of commitment and sacrifice one can make in pursuit of their passion."},{"question":"What is different between Microsoft excel 2007 and Microsoft excle 2013?

Frenchman Karim Benzema scores only goal after 19 minutes. Cristiano Ronaldo returns from injury to help inspire Spanish side. Bayern Munich dominate possession but cannot convert chances. Article:","response":"Title: Real Madrid Triumphs Over Bayern Munich in Champions League Semi-Final First Leg In what proved to be a nail-biting encounter, Real Madrid clinched victory against Bayern Munich in the first leg of the Champions League semi-final, held at the iconic Santiago Bernabeu stadium. The Spanish giants edged out the German powerhouse with a well-fought 1-0 win, placing them in a favorable position as they head to the second leg of the semi-final clash. The only goal of the game was netted by French striker Karim Benzema, making a crucial impact on the game as early as the 19th minute. A brilliantly executed play by Los Blancos opened up a scoring opportunity for Benzema, who proved clinical as he headed the ball past Bayern Munich's goalkeeper, Sven Ulreich, thereby sealing the match for Real Madrid. Adding to the excitement of the game was the return of Cristiano Ronaldo to the Real Madrid lineup. The Portuguese superstar, who had been sidelined due to injury, was in fine form throughout the match, continuously inspiring and motivating his teammates. His presence on the field was palpable, and his unmatched skill and determination played a crucial role in Real Madrid's triumph over the formidable Bayern Munich. Bayern Munich, however, did not go down without a fight. Despite the early setback, the German outfit showcased a dominant performance, as they monopolized ball possession for the majority of the 90 minutes. Their relentless effort to penetrate the Madrid defense, led by the likes of Robert Lewandowski and Thomas Müller, was a reflection of their unwavering determination to claw their way back into the game. Nonetheless, Bayern Munich was unable to capitalize on their chances, as a toothless attack and the inability to convert opportunities into goals ultimately let them down. Real Madrid's defensive line, led by captain Sergio Ramos, played a critical role in thwarting multiple advances by the Bavarian side. This tightly contested semi-final encounter, which saw two of Europe's most decorated and successful clubs vying for a spot in the ultimate stage of the competition, did not disappoint. The first leg displayed a perfect blend of tactical football, individual brilliance, and heart-stopping moments, a fitting testimonial to the stature and prestige of the UEFA Champions League.

Looking for a harder-hitting rock sound than that of All That You Can't Leave Behind, U2 began recording their eleventh studio album, How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb, in February 2003 with producer Chris Thomas. After nine months of work, the band had an album's worth of material ready for release, but they were not satisfied with the results; Mullen said that the songs \\"had no magic\\". The group subsequently enlisted Steve Lillywhite to take over as producer in Dublin in January 2004. Lillywhite, along with his assistant Jacknife Lee, spent six months with the band reworking songs and encouraging better performances. Several other producers received credits on the album, including Lanois, Eno, Flood, Carl Glanville, and Nellee Hooper; Bono acknowledged that the involvement of multiple producers affected the record's \\"sonic cohesion\\". Released in November 2004, How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb received favourable reviews from critics. The album featured lyrics touching on life, death, love, war, faith, and family. It reached number one in 30 countries, including the US, where first-week sales of 840,000 copies nearly doubled those of All That You Can't Leave Behind, setting a personal best for the band. Overall, it sold 9 million copies globally. For the album's release, U2 partnered with Apple for several cross-promotions: the first single, \\"Vertigo\\", was featured in a television advertisement for the company's iPod music player, while a U2-branded iPod and digital box set exclusive to the iTunes Store were released. \\"Vertigo\\" was an international hit, topping the charts in Ireland and the UK, while reaching number two in Canada, number five in Australia, and number 31 in the US.

He hides from the dog in a delivery truck, which drives to New York City. The tomcat hears the disembodied voice of a young girl (Drew Barrymore) pleading for help because something is threatening her. The cat is then captured by an employee from Quitters, Inc. \\"Quitters, Inc.\\"[edit] Cigarette smoker Dick Morrison (James Woods) is advised by a friend to join Quitters, Inc. to kick his habit. Clinic counselor Dr. Vinnie Donatti (Alan King) explains that the clinic has a 100% success rate due to a uniquely persuasive method: every time Dick smokes a cigarette, horrors of increasing magnitude will befall his wife and child. Using the tomcat that Donatti's assistant Junk has caught in the street, Donatti demonstrates the first of these horrors: the cat is locked in a cage and tormented with electric shocks. Donatti explains that if his new client should be caught with a cigarette, Dick's wife Cindy will be subjected to the same shocks while he is forced to watch. For subsequent infractions, his young daughter afflicted with Down Syndrome will be subjected to the shocks, then his wife raped, and after the fourth infraction, they give up (i.e. kill him). Not wanting to worry them, Dick hides the looming threat from his family. That night, Dick is angered by the methods Quitters uses and notices an undisposed pack of cigarettes in his desk. He prepares to smoke it, but notices a set of feet in his closet, realizing Quitters Inc. is serious about their threat to ensure he is not smoking. The following day, Dick visits his daughter (also played by Drew Barrymore) and gives her a doll. Donatti is also at the school, warning Dick that if he strays the only thing his daughter would understand is that someone is hurting her because her father misbehaved.

Stream of Consciousness Reasoning: The initial thought stems from the curiosity about how scientists can measure and predict the behavior of subatomic particles such as electrons. We've been able to study the nature of atoms and their constituents, which has led to advances in our understanding of the universe on a deeper, more fundamental level. This further leads me to recall the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle in quantum mechanics. According to this principle, it is impossible to determine the exact position and velocity of a particle, such as an electron, simultaneously. This is primarily due to the fact that electrons, like other particles, exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behaviors which cause them to exist in a state of uncertain probability until they are observed or measured. When we try to measure an electron's position with high accuracy, it requires higher energy, which disturbs the electron's momentum. The more accurately we measure the position, the less certain we become about the electron's velocity, and vice versa. This inherent trade-off makes it impossible to know both quantities exactly. Additionally, this principle does not stem from a lack of precision in our measuring instruments, but rather it arises from the fundamental nature of quantum mechanics. Even if we were to develop more advanced or precise tools, we would still face the same fundamental limitation imposed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. In conclusion, based on the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and our understanding of quantum mechanics, it is not possible to tell the exact position and velocity of an electron at the same time using current scientific knowledge and methods."},{"question":"Generate a short movie review that has \\"positive\\" sentiment (Select from the following. + negative + positive).","response":"\\"Positive sentiment\\" movie review: This movie is super fun!

Context: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — Final preparations are underway for Friday’s historic third summit between the leaders of North and South Korea. In the morning, North Korea Leader Kim Jong Un will cross the military demarcation line that divides the two Koreas at the village of Panmunjom, the historic site where the Korean War armistice was signed in 1953. He will be met by South Korean President Moon Jae-in on the South Korean side of the heavily fortified demilitarized zone. This will be the third inter-Korean summit, but it will be the first time that a leader from the communist North will enter the democratic South. The summits in 2000 and 2007 were held in North Korea. Kim will travel with an official delegation that includes his sister, Kim Yo Jong, who led the North’s delegation to the Winter Olympics in South Korea, Kim Yong Nam, the North’s nominal head of state, and Kim Yong Chol. Kim Yong Chol was previously the head of the North’s military intelligence agency and has been named by South Korea as being responsible for ordering the deadly 2010 sinking of the Cheonan, a South Korean navy vessel. It is unclear if Kim Jong Un’s wife, Ri Sol-ju, will be part of the official delegation from the North. She recently traveled with Kim when he visited Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing. South Korea will hold a welcoming ceremony for the North Korean leader that will include a military honor guard review. During past summits, North Korea also organized the same level of ceremonial guard used to underscore friendly relations with an important visiting head of state. The two leaders will pose together for pictures, and plant a pine tree in the DMZ to symbolize Korean reconciliation. The leaders from the North and South may also walk together along a historic footbridge called the “Bridge of No Return” that was used for prisoner exchanges at the end of the Korean War.

Stream-of-consciousness explanation: Sleep is a fascinating and essential part of the human experience, and when we think about our daily routine, sleep is one of the central components. It is well studied and well known that during sleep, our bodies undergo a variety of critical processes, such as consolidating memories, metabolic regulation, and restoration of cognitive function. In addition to that, sleep allows our muscles and other tissues to repair and regenerate, while our brain clears away potentially harmful waste products. Chronic sleep deprivation is highly detrimental to physical and mental health, leading to severe consequences, such as cognitive decline, mood disorders, decreased immune function, and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. The record for the longest period of time without sleep is held by Randy Gardner, who, in 1964, managed to stay awake for 11 days, after which he suffered from severe exhaustion, mood disturbances, and cognitive impairment. Several medical conditions, such as insomnia and sleep apnea, contribute to inadequate or disrupted sleep. However, total sleep abstinence, known as fatal familial insomnia (FFI), is a rare genetic disorder that progressively destroys the brain's ability to sleep and eventually leads to death. This proves that the absence of sleep is not sustainable for human life. Given this, it is clear that sleep is an essential part of human life and maintaining our overall well-being. Therefore, the answer to the question - \\"can a person survive without needing to sleep?\\" - would be a definitive no."},{"question":"What are good horror movies to watch?

Instead, they present different perspectives on the person's emotional reactions. The premise is: \\"I was afraid she might get a bit rattled.\\" This statement suggests that the speaker had a concern or worry that she would be rattled by something, i.e., they had doubts about her ability to remain calm and composed in a particular situation. The hypothesis is: \\"I'm not afraid at all, she's hardly ever rattled.\\" This statement exhibits confidence in the person's emotional stability, indicating that they usually do not get rattled. The hypothesis then contradicts the premise, which conveys a level of fear on the speaker's part. Reviewing the options to determine if it is possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis: (A) Yes: This option would imply that accepting the premise as true confirms the hypothesis as true as well. However, since the premise expresses concern and fear that she might get rattled and the hypothesis confidently states that she's not usually rattled, it is not an accurate conclusion or relationship. (B) It is not possible to tell: This option denotes that there is not enough information provided to establish a clear logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, which is correct, as the given statements relay different perspectives and emotions. The possibility of the person getting rattled or not would depend on contextual information not provided in the premise or hypothesis. (C) No: This option would entail that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is false. However, we cannot determine that the hypothesis is false solely based on the premise. The two statements address different viewpoints and portray contrasting emotions.

A:","response":"Part #1: argmax { all_rows; crowd } Usage: Find the row with the maximum crowd value. Example: Let's say there are 3 rows with crowd values 15, 30, and 45. The row with the crowd value of 45 would be chosen because it has the maximum crowd value. Part #2: hop { argmax { all_rows; crowd } ; venue } Usage: Get the venue value from the row with the maximum crowd value. Example: If the row with the maximum crowd value has the venue \\"punt road oval\\", then the value \\"punt road oval\\" is returned. Part #3: eq { hop { argmax { all_rows ; crowd } ; venue } ; punt road oval } Usage: Check if the venue value from the row with the maximum crowd value is equal to \\"punt road oval\\".

Part #5: the number of such rows is 2 Usage: Count the number of rows selected in Part #4. Example: If two rows are selected with fuzzy matches to \\"grass\\", this statement is true. Overall, the interpretation does not match the command because the command checks if the venue of the row with the maximum crowd value equals \\"punt road oval\\" while the interpretation refers to selecting rows based on a fuzzy match to the surface record. The correct interpretation would be \\"Check if the venue of the row with the maximum crowd value is equal to 'punt road oval'.\\""},{"question":"Write an article based on this summary: Relegated National League side Altrincham have appointed Neil Young as their new manager.

The agreement entitled Evergreen to 33% of Yao's earnings, but the contract was later determined to be invalid. When Yao decided to enter the 2002 NBA draft, a group of advisers was formed that came to be known as \\"Team Yao\\". The team consisted of Yao's negotiator, Erik Zhang; his NBA agent, Bill Duffy; his Chinese agent, Lu Hao; University of Chicago economics professor John Huizinga; and the vice president for marketing at BDA Sports Management, Bill Sanders. Yao was widely predicted to be picked number one overall. However, some teams were concerned about Yao's NBA eligibility because of uncertainty over whether the CBA would let Yao play in the United States. Shortly after Wang Zhizhi refused to return to China to play for the national team and was subsequently banned from playing for China, the CBA stipulated that Yao would have to return to play for the national team. They also said they would not let him go to the United States unless the Houston Rockets would take him first overall.

Unseasonably warm temperatures with very little wind across northeastern China coincided with the smoke from local farmers' burning straws and the start-up of Harbin's coal-powered central heating system. Record densities of fine particulates were measured in the city. In Harbin, the levels of PM2.5 (particulate matter) rise to 1,000 micrograms per cubic meter, worse than Beijing's historic highs.

Select from the following. --the cookies will be firm and the bottoms are golden brown.. --the cookies will be firm and the bottoms are black.","response":"To accomplish the goal of knowing when the top of the super mario mushroom cookie is done, the first option makes more sense: the cookies will be firm and the bottoms are golden brown. When baking cookies, it is important to look for visual cues and texture changes that indicate doneness, such as color, firmness, and moisture. A well-baked cookie should typically have a golden brown color, a firm yet tender texture, and no excess moisture on the surface. In this context, the super mario mushroom cookies should be firm to the touch, which suggests they have baked long enough to set their shape and develop a crispy exterior. Additionally, the bottoms of the cookies should be golden brown, which is a common indication of proper baking. This coloration implies that the heat has been distributed evenly throughout the cookie and that both the top and the bottom have reached the desired doneness level. On the other hand, the second option -- the cookies will be firm and the bottoms are black -- is not advisable. Blackened bottoms of the cookies typically indicate that they have been overbaked or burnt. This not only results in an unpleasant taste but may also make the cookies difficult to consume, as they could become excessively hard or dry. Additionally, burnt cookies may lose some of their nutritional value and possibly produce harmful compounds. Several factors can lead to cookies having blackened bottoms: 1. Incorrect oven temperature: An oven that is too hot can cause the bottoms of the cookies to burn before the rest of the cookie is fully cooked. To avoid this issue, ensure that your oven is set to the right temperature as indicated in the recipe. 2. Baking time: Leaving the cookies in the oven for too long can cause them to overcook and burn. Always set a timer and check for doneness regularly. 3. Baking sheet type: Dark-colored baking sheets tend to absorb more heat, which can cause the bottoms of your cookies to burn more easily. Alternatively, you can use parchment paper or silicone baking mats to help prevent cookies from sticking and ensure even baking. 4. Oven rack position: If your oven has uneven heat distribution, placing your baking sheet on a rack that is too close to the heating element can result in burnt bottoms. Adjust the position of your oven rack to ensure even baking. In conclusion, knowing when the top of the super mario mushroom cookie is done can be best determined by observing when the cookies are firm and the bottoms are golden brown. Burning or overbaking the cookies will likely result in an unpleasant taste and texture, and sticking to golden brown bottoms is a much better indicator of proper doneness. Remember to check your oven temperature, baking time, and use proper baking tools to get well-done and delicious cookies every time."},{"question":"By. Sophie Jane Evans. Action: Obese children have been taken away by social workers after being overfed by their families, a survey has revealed. Obese children have been taken away by social workers after being overfed by their families, it has been revealed. The super-size youngsters were placed in care across the UK amid fears their weight was wrecking their health. One child had a Body Mass Index (BMI) measurement of 35 - the equivalent of a six-foot man weighing 19st. It comes as an increasing number of parents give in to their children's cravings for unhealthy food - a phenomenon known as 'killing with kindness' In the past year alone, five British children have been taken from their. families because of overfeeding, according to a survey by the Sunday Express. These include two in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, one. in Oxfordshire, one in Salford, and one in Hounslow, London. And the year before, five other obese youngsters were placed in care in Sheffield, Portsmouth, Lincolnshire, Slough and Harrow, London. Professionals say families' gross over-eating can be one of the factors that leads to their children being taken into care. A social worker told the Sunday Express: 'Only in extreme cases would we take a child into care just. because of their weight as we would seek to work with the family to. improve their eating habits.' Britain's child obesity epidemic - which has seen hospitals deal with nearly 1,000 children in the past three years - is now thought to cost the NHS around Â£4.2billion every year, according to estimates put forward by the Royal College of Paediatrics. Warning: In 2006, ex-Chief Medical Officer Sir Liam Donaldson (left) warned that health chiefs would consider removing children from their families if they became super-sized, risking their health. Alarmingly, children as young as. ten months old have been admitted to hospital because they are. dangerously overweight, according to figures released in October. Portsmouth. Hospitals NHS Trust revealed that during the past year, doctors. have found themselves having to treat a ten-month-old baby for obesity â€“ with a. one year old also being referred to Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust as a. result of her weight. And a staggering 45 youngsters aged 17 or under have had fat-fighting operations on the NHS in the past five years, according to Conservative MP Priti Patel. However the true. scale of the problem is likely to be much higher, as less than a third. of hospital trusts have released information about the number of young. children whose weight has spiralled out of control. As well as being overfed, many overweight youngsters have also been fed a high-fat, sugary diet. In 2006, ex-Chief Medical Officer Sir Liam Donaldson warned that health chiefs would consider removing children from their families if they became super-sized, therefore risking their health. The first reported case was an eight-year-old girl in Cumbria, who became so obese that she was forced to wear size 16 clothes. She was taken into care in 2007 weighing a staggering 10st. A Department of Health spokesman said England has one of the highest rates of obesity in the western world, but health professionals and voluntary groups are working together to help individuals 'improve their diet and lifestyles'. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","response":"The article discusses the increasing issue of childhood obesity, particularly in the UK, with some children being taken into care by social workers due to concerns over their health and well-being.

Language Identification: Before classifying the given text into the desired categories, it is important to identify whether the text is in Tamil or not. Step 1: - Utilize a language identification library, such as the langdetect library in Python, to identify the language of the comment. - If the identified language is not Tamil, classify the comment as Not in Expected Language and exit. 2. Text Preprocessing: Now that the text is confirmed to be in Tamil, we can proceed with preprocessing. Step 2: - Tokenize the text into words. - Remove any stop words and punctuation from the text. We can use a Tamil stop words list to perform this action. - Normalize the text, such as converting uppercase letters to lowercase. 3. Text Classification: We can now perform the classification. There are two main approaches to classify the preprocessed text: (a) Rule-Based Classification or (b) Machine Learning-Based Classification. Step 3a - Rule-Based Classification: - Create a list of terms and phrases that are specific to Hope speech (encouraging, positive, supportive, equality, diversity, and inclusion). - If the preprocessed text contains any words from this list, classify the comment as Hope speech. - If not, classify the comment as Not Hope Speech. Step 3b - Machine Learning-Based Classification: - Create a training dataset consisting of labeled Tamil comments in the two categories: Hope speech and Not Hope Speech. - Train a machine learning model, such as logistic regression, Naive Bayes, or a neural network, on the training dataset. The preprocessed text will be the input features, and the corresponding category labels will be the output. - Use the trained model to predict the category of the given preprocessed Tamil comment. - If the model predicts the comment as Hope speech, classify the comment as Hope speech. - If not, classify the comment as Not Hope Speech.

He pays them to take him to the border  but things get out of hand. It starts well enough, but quickly struggles and dies. **SPOILER** The eventual relationship twist is badly set up and difficult to believe. An absence of passion, and essentially no reasoning behind her leaving one man for the other, made it ridiculous - and the ending was predictable and dull. **END SPOILER** Harvey Keitel is the US agent on the hit-man's trail, but he seems a little confused as to how boring and slow the script is...

Step 2: Consider the context in which the words are used In this case, the words are used together in a two-word phrase. The phrase combines both positive (ambitious) and negative (failure) connotations. Step 3: Determine the overall sentiment The overall sentiment of the phrase \\"ambitious failure\\" would likely be perceived as mixed or neutral. This is because the positive sentiment from the word \\"ambitious\\" might balance out the negative sentiment of the word \\"failure.\\" However, the interpretation could vary depending on an individual's perspective. Some may lean towards viewing it more negatively due to the word \\"failure,\\" while others may appreciate the positive connotation of \\"ambitious\\" and interpret the phrase as a noble or well-intentioned failure."},{"question":"Where could you find a very large amount of air?

The England cricket team won by defeating New Zealand in the final, held at Lord's Cricket Ground in London on 14 July 2019. This was the 12th Cricket World Cup competition, and the first time that the England cricket team won the tournament. They did so in an incredibly exciting and very closely contested match that ended in a tie twice and eventually had to be decided by a Super Over. A brief overview of the final match: England batted first, setting a target for New Zealand. However, the New Zealand team were able to match England's score, resulting in a tie. A Super Over was then played by both teams. Once again, both England and New Zealand scored the same number of runs. However, based on the rule of boundary count back, England was declared as the winner of the World Cup final. The England team was led by captain Eoin Morgan, and major key players in the final included Ben Stokes, who was awarded the man of the match for his fighting innings, and Jos Buttler. This particular Cricket World Cup was notable due to the incredibly close nature of the final. It is particularly significant as it was England's first win despite having invented the sport and having hosted the tournament multiple times.

Its formal, serious style closely matches its content, a school-masterly book on schooling.The author, W.H.Armstrong, starts with the basics: reading and writing.In his opinion, reading doesn't just mean recognizing each word on the page; it means taking in the information, digesting it and incorporating it into oneself just as one digests a sandwich and makes it a part of himself.The goal is to bring the information back to life, not just to treat it as dead facts on paper from dead trees.Reading and writing cannot be completely separated from each other; in fact, the aim of reading is to express the information you have got from the text.I've seen it again and again:some-one who can't express an idea after reading a text is just as ineffective as someone who hasn't read it at all. Only a third of the book remains after that discussion, which Armstrong devotes to specific tips for studying languages, math, science and history.He generally handles these topics thoroughly and equally, except for some weakness in the science and math sections and a bit too much passion regarding history to his students, that was a hundred times more than my history teachers ever got across.To my disappointment, in this part of the book he ignores the arts.As a matter of fact, they demand all the concentration and study that math and science do, though the study differs slightly in kind.Although it's commonly believed that the arts can only be naturally acquired, actually, learning the arts is no more natural than learning French or mathematics. My other comment is that the text aged.The first edition apparently dates to the 1960s--none of the references seem newer than the late 1950s.As a result, the discussion misses the entire computer age. These are small points, though, and don't affect the main discussion.I recommend it to any student and any teacher, including the self-taught student. This Passage can be classified as _ .

Question: suppose desalination is quicker happens, how will it affect MORE salt being removed from the water. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","response":"To answer the question, let's break down the process step-by-step and consider the effect of quicker desalination on the removal of salt from the water. Process: 1. Saltwater is contained in a factory or plant. 2. The water is boiled to a very high temperature. 3. The salt becomes separated from the water. 4. The salt is removed. 5. The water is drinkable at this point. Now, let's suppose desalination happens more quickly. Question: How will quicker desalination affect the removal of MORE salt from the water? When desalination happens more quickly, the separation of salt from water will occur at a faster rate. However, the efficiency of salt removal may not increase proportionally to the speed at which desalination occurs. There may be limitations to how quickly salt can be separated and removed from the water. The speed at which desalination occurs mainly influences the rate at which saltwater is processed. Faster desalination could potentially result in a higher volume of salt being removed in a shorter amount of time. However, this does not necessarily imply that a greater percentage of salt will be removed during the process. Considering the steps in the desalination process and the potential constraints on the rate of salt removal, the supposed perturbation of quicker desalination might lead to more salt being removed from the water in terms of volume per unit of time, but not necessarily in terms of overall efficiency or percentage of salt removal.

Students and faculty raced out of harm's way, ducked under furniture, barricaded doors and hid in interior rooms, bathrooms and labs. The short-lived nightmare on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles came one day before Wear Orange: National Gun Violence Awareness Day. Wear Orange was inspired by friends of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old Chicago high school student killed by gunfire in 2013. The group decided to honor her life by wearing orange — the color worn by hunters in the woods to protect themselves and others. While the idea has been embraced by civic organizations, politicians and celebrities, it has been rejected by gun rights advocates. The National Rifle Association has attacked the campaign as \\"pointless,\\" and said \\"participating is an easy way of scoring points for being 'socially conscious.'\\" Here is a look at the unique relationship between Americans and their guns. Any law-abiding citizen in the United States is allowed to own or carry a gun. That right comes from the U.S. Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It says: \\"A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\\" The Second Amendment was based partially on English common law, which describes an auxiliary right, supporting the natural rights of self-defense, resistance to oppression, and the civic duty to act in concert in defense of the state. To purchase a gun in the majority of states, a person needs to be of age, pass the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check and fill out a firearms transaction record. However, background checks are not currently required for private sales, including those conducted at gun shows. Certain people are banned from owning weapons, including convicted criminals, people with mental health illnesses or non-U.S. citizens. But the system has major holes in it. Why did the group pick the color orange? A. Because the FBI likes it B. not enough information C. Because hunters wear it while hunting D. Because the NRA likes it Answer:","response":"C. Because hunters wear it while hunting"},{"question":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task. In this task, you are given an input list.

Though wind and hydroelectric power are abundant and underdeveloped, proposals for statewide energy systems (e.g. with special low-cost electric interties) were judged uneconomical (at the time of the report, 2001) due to low (less than 50¢/gal) fuel prices, long distances and low population. The cost of a gallon of gas in urban Alaska today is usually 30–60¢ higher than the national average; prices in rural areas are generally significantly higher but vary widely depending on transportation costs, seasonal usage peaks, nearby petroleum development infrastructure and many other factors. Why were alternative energy sources judged uneconomical in 2001?","response":"In 2001, alternative energy sources like wind and hydroelectric power were considered uneconomical in Alaska because of a few reasons. First, the fuel prices were low, at less than 50 cents per gallon. This made using diesel fuel cheaper than investing in alternative energy. Second, Alaska has long distances and low population, which means setting up new energy systems would be expensive compared to the low demand. So, back then, it didn't make financial sense to use other energy sources."},{"question":"I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot. Could you help me answer this question?

Add - This is an action verb, which is crucial to understanding the instruction. Without this component, we wouldn't know what to do with the items. 2. Some - This is a determiner that adds context to the quantity of the items, but it's not vital to understanding the overall meaning of the sentence. 3. Artful - This adjective describes the visual qualities of the throw pillows, which is an essential aspect of the request and adds helpful context to the type of pillows. 4. Throw pillows - This is the main object of the sentence and the target of the action. This component is significant because it identifies what type of items we are adding. 5. To - This preposition is essential to understanding the direction of the action, so it's an important component. 6. Your - This possessive pronoun indicates who the bed belongs to, which aids in our understanding but isn't crucial to the overall meaning. 7. Bed - This is the secondary object and the place where the action is happening. This component is vital because it pinpoints the target location. With this evaluation, the most important words in the sentence are: 1. Add 2. Artful 3. Throw pillows 4. To 5. Bed These words together convey the core instruction: \\"Add artful throw pillows to bed.\\""},{"question":"Given the question: Process: - An isotope has too many protons - The isotope is unstable - The isotope emits radiation - The isotope decays - The isotope loses some atomic particles - The isotope turns into a different element - The isotope is finished decaying and emitting radiation. Question: suppose isotope is less stable happens, how will it affect MORE radioactive decay occurring. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect The answer is:","response":"A: More When an isotope is less stable, it means that it has an unstable nucleus containing an excess number of protons (or neutrons) compared to a stable isotope of the same element. This instability causes the isotope to decay over time by emitting radiation in the form of particles or electromagnetic waves. The process continues until the isotope reaches a stable state and stops decaying or turns into a different element. If an isotope is less stable, it implies that it has a higher tendency to undergo radioactive decay due to the imbalance of protons and neutrons in the nucleus. The excess number of protons or neutrons results in a repulsive force between the particles, making the nucleus unstable. As a result, the isotope seeks to reach a more stable configuration through radioactive decay. The effect of an isotope being less stable on radioactive decay is an increase in the likelihood of decay events occurring. On a statistical level, less stable isotopes have shorter half-lives, which means they decay more rapidly than more stable isotopes of the same element. Consequently, isotopes with shorter half-lives undergo a higher number of decay events per unit of time. It is important to note that the rate of decay for a specific isotope is constant and not influenced by external factors such as temperature, pressure, or chemical reactions. Therefore, the statement \\"an isotope is less stable\\" is essentially saying that an isotope has a greater probability of undergoing radioactive decay when compared to a more stable isotope of the same element. In conclusion, if an isotope is less stable, it will lead to more radioactive decay occurring due to the unstable configuration of protons and neutrons in the nucleus. The higher probability of decay and the shorter half-life of the less stable isotope result in a greater number of radioactive decay events taking place over a given period. Hence, the answer is A: More."},{"question":"Sentence 1: Unfortunately, it seems to have failed its first test. Sentence 2: It seems that it passed the first test. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","response":"No, the second sentence is not entailed by the first one. Entailment in a linguistic context refers to a relationship where the truth of one sentence guarantees the truth of another sentence. In this case, the two sentences you provided express entirely contradictory information about the same event. In the first sentence, \\"Unfortunately, it seems to have failed its first test\\", it is stated that a test has been failed. The adverb \\"unfortunately\\" suggests a negative outcome - presumably one that was not wished for or expected. The main verb \\"seems\\" suggests that based on available information or evidence, this is the case. It does not offer absolute certainty but implies a strong likelihood towards the stated outcome. The key message however remains that the first test was not passed or successfully completed. The second sentence, \\"It seems that it passed the first test\\", conveys the exact opposite information: that the test was passed, or successfully completed. As in the first sentence, the verb \\"seems\\" is used to show that this is a probable conclusion based on available evidence or information. So, the two sentences are providing different outcomes for a likely shared event. Therefore, one cannot be the entailment of the other. Rather, they contradict each other. So if the first statement is true, the second one must be false, and vice versa, as they describe directly opposing results."},{"question":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Only two people in the world still speak it, and they won't talk to each other. Spoken in Mexico for centuries, Ayapaneco is one of 68 surviving languages in the mainly Spanish-speaking nation. The two speakers are Manuel Segovia and Isidro Velazquez. Though they live only 500 meters from each other in the village, the two men seldom talk to each other. Daniel, an American expert, who is working to make a dictionary of Ayapaneco, says the two men \\"don't have a lot in common,\\" and that Segovia can be \\"active\\" while Velasquez tends to mind his own business and stay at home. While Segovia still speaks to his wife and son in Ayapaneco, neither of them can manage more than a few words. Velasquez hardly speaks his native tongue any more. Daniel is working to preserve the language in dictionary form before its last surviving speakers pass away. According to Daniel, Ayapaneco and the other languages began dying out with the introduction of public Spanish education in the mid-20thcentury. For decades, local children weren't allowed to speak anything else. Many people to cities, starting in the 1970s, also helped the dying out of native languages. Ayapaneco is the name given to the language; Segovia and Velazquez call it \\"Nuumte Oote\\", which means \\"true voice\\". Neither man, however, speaks the same language. The dictionary will contain two versions of the language when it comes out later this year. Those behind the dictionary aren't the only ones trying to save Ayapaneco. The National Language Institute plans to hold classes so that Segovia and Velasquez can pass on what they know to children. It is thought that there are about 6,000 languages spoken on earth and that about half will disappear over the next 100 years. Let's hope the \\"true voice\\" isn't one of them. Question: Segovia and Velasquez seldom talk to each other in Ayapaneco because they _ .

An American study suggests that being surrounded by happy friends and neighbours could have more of an effect on your happiness than money.That is the finding of researchers from Harvard University and the University of California at San Diego. Nicholas Christakis and James Fowler studied the emotional health of more than 4,700 people.They used information from the Framingham Heart Study.That study began sixty years ago in the American community of Framingham.Massachusetts.It was started to learn more about the risks of heart attack and stroke. For the new study,the researchers examined the emotions of the men and women in the Framingham Heart Study.The information was gathered from 1983 to 2003. The researchers found that friends of happy people had a greater chance of being happy themselves.That means that happiness spreads,or has a contagious effect,among people.And,the smaller the physical distance between friends,the larger the effect they had on each other's happiness. Sadness was also contagious among friends,but not as much as happiness.The researchers say social groups did not influence happiness as much as personal situations. However,people removed by as much as three degrees of separation still had an effect on one's happiness.The expression three degrees of separation means the friends of an individual's friends. In fact,persons with three degrees of separation had a greater effect on an individual's happiness than having five thousand dollars.The researchers say the study is historic because it shows that social effects on health can be spread among people. Another finding is that people who work together or are married do not have as much of an effect on happiness levels as friends.The researchers say this is often true among friends of the same sex.

Correction: This story has been updated to reflect that the NSF, NSO and AURA decided to evacuate the observatory without advisement or assistance from the FBI. Mystery solved. Authorities say it wasn’t aliens, but a janitor’s unsavory tastes that ultimately led to the closure of an observatory in southern New Mexico. ADVERTISEMENTSkip The Sunspot Observatory was evacuated when that same janitor made veiled threats against the facility after federal agents seized a laptop he used to access child pornography. The closure on Sept. 6 sparked international attention since authorities refused to release any details, while news outlets and conspiracy theorists filled in the blanks with rumors of geomagnetic storms, alien sightings and apocalyptic asteroids. According to a search warrant filed in U.S. District Court in Las Cruces, the FBI began investigating after a wireless signal at the observatory, located on Sacramento Peak in the Lincoln National Forest, accessed child porn multiple times since January. During an interview on Aug. 21, the facility’s chief observer told agents he had found a running laptop with child porn on it in an empty office several months before. Agents say the chief observer believed the laptop belonged to a research student and didn’t report it at the time because he was “distracted by an urgent matter within the facility.” The chief observer told agents that only one person had access to the facility around the time of the child porn being accessed: a janitor who started working at the facility a year ago and cleans for a couple of hours a day. The janitor’s parents own the janitorial contract for the observatory. ADVERTISEMENTSkip Agents say the janitor has a key and “unlimited access” to the building. According to the search warrant, agents seized the laptop. Agents say that when the janitor returned the next morning, unaware of the seizure, he claimed to be “missing some cleaning supplies” and asked if anyone had been in the office. The chief observer told agents the janitor began complaining about “lax security” at the facility and claimed someone was breaking into the facility at night to steal internet service and toilet paper. As time went on, agents say the janitor’s actions grew increasingly “frantic” and he continually approached the chief observer with questions and comments about missing items. “(The janitor) had continued to look feverishly through the facility and continued to make comments about the lax security,” an agent wrote in the search warrant. ADVERTISEMENTSkip Agents say the janitor mentioned that decoy security cameras “were a joke” and it was only “a matter of time” until the facility “got hit.” The agencies that oversee the observatory, National Science Foundation, National Solar Observatory and Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, decided to evacuate and close the facility after the janitor spoke of a serial killer in the area and was fearful that the killer might “enter the facility and execute someone.” While authorities maintain their silence, the observatory reopened Monday. “Sunspot is now open, and we’re ready to show you all the great science and public outreach we do at this fantastic facility!” says a statement on the facility’s website. ||||| A federal search warrant reveals that Sunspot Solar Observatory was shut down as FBI agents conducted computer forensic searches for child pornography. The source of child pornography was traced to an IP address used at the observatory and a source within the building observed a computer with \\"not good\\" images on it, the warrant states. An investigation by the FBI revealed that a janitor is the main suspect in the search, however he has not been charged with a crime even though his name is on the warrant. The warrant states the suspect would use the observatory Wifi and a personal laptop to download the child pornography. A limited number of people have access to the observatory from dusk until dawn, which helped narrow their search. The observatory in the mountains of southern New Mexico had been closed since Sept. 6 because of an undisclosed security concern, but reopened on Monday. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","response":"The Sunspot Observatory in southern New Mexico was evacuated and closed due to a janitor's alleged involvement in accessing child pornography using the facility's Wi-Fi.

In an interview with Der Spiegel published on Friday, Paul Wolfowitz, who served as deputy secretary of defense during George W. Bush’s presidency, said he would likely vote for Hillary Clinton—though he noted he had “big reservations” about her. Wolfowitz said he agreed with those who deemed the Republican nominee a security threat. “The only way you can be comfortable about Trump's foreign policy, is to think he doesn't really mean anything he says,” he said. “Our security depends on having good relationships with our allies. Trump mainly shows contempt for them. And he seems to be unconcerned about the Russian aggression in Ukraine. By doing this he tells them that they can go ahead and do what they are doing. That is dangerous.” Wolfowitz is only the latest in his cohort to throw his support behind Clinton, or at the very least to declare public opposition to Trump. Neoconservative intellectuals and pundits like Bill Kristol, Max Boot, and Robert Kagan have also been particularly harsh in criticizing Trump. Richard Armitage, who is less associated with the group but served under Bush, has also announced he’ll support Clinton. Meanwhile, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and President Bush himself have remained pointedly silent, declining to back the Republican nominee. There are a few notable exceptions, and they are perhaps the two highest-profile neoconservatives: former Vice President Dick Cheney, and former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. Those two men were both in Republican politics before the rise of the neocons, and found that their belligerent style was well tailored to an alliance. They are also, as Jonathan Chait notes, among the Gentile members of a movement that originated with Jewish intellectuals. There are some straightforward reasons for the alliance with Clinton. Though they may disagree with her on many issues, particularly domestically, the neocons are focused more than anything on foreign policy. In that realm, Clinton represents a fairly standard, mainstream position, and in fact she has shown herself to be somewhat more hawkish than many Democrats, backing both the war in Iraq and intervention in Libya. Trump, on the other hand, has toppled pillar after pillar of policy orthodoxy, from his praise for Vladimir Putin to his dismissal of longstanding alliances. But the wave of neocon love also makes many of Clinton’s Democratic supporters uncomfortable. As the chaotic and failed attempts to stop Trump over the last year have shown, there’s no obviously right choice for how conservatives should respond. But which choice are people making? Here’s a list of some major figures and where they stand on Trump—right now. We’ll keep it updated as other important people take stances, or as these ones change their views about Trump. Party Elders Jason Reed/ Reuters George W. Bush: ABSTAIN The former president “does not plan to participate in or comment on the presidential campaign,” an aide told the Texas Tribune. (May 4, 2016) George H.W. Bush: ABSTAIN “At age 91, President Bush is retired from politics. He came out of retirement to do a few things for Jeb, but those were the exceptions that proved the rule,” an aide told the Texas Tribune. (May 4, 2016) Barbara Bush: NAY Unlike her husband and elder son, the former first lady has publicly disavowed Trump. “I mean, unbelievable. I don't know how women can vote for someone who said what he said about Megyn Kelly, it’s terrible,” she told CBS in February. “And we knew what he meant too.” (February 4, 2016) Marc Racicot: NAY Racicot, a confidant of former President George W. Bush who chaired the RNC from 2001 to 2003, tells Bloomberg, “I cannot and will not support Donald Trump for president.” (August 3, 2016) Vin Weber: NAY A former Minnesota congressman who helped Newt Gingrich bring the Republican Party to power and is now a lobbyist, Weber has ruled out Trump. “I won't vote for Trump,” he told CNBC. “I can't imagine I'd remain a Republican if he becomes president.” (August 3, 2016) Gordon Humphrey: NAY The former U.S. senator from New Hampshire says he cannot vote for Trump, calling him “a sociopath, without a conscience or feelings of guilt, shame or remorse.” Humphrey told NBC he may reluctantly vote for Hillary Clinton, but only if it’s a close contest. (August 4, 2016) George P. Bush: YEA The scion of the Bush family, who is currently Texas land commissioner, has broken with other members of the Bush clan, who have either pointedly abstained or said they would not vote for Trump. “From Team Bush, it's a bitter pill to swallow, but you know what? You get back up and you help the man that won, and you make sure that we stop Hillary Clinton,” he said. (August 6, 2016) Chris Shays: NAY A longtime moderate Republican U.S. representative from Connecticut who lost his seat in 2008, Shays has endorsed Hillary Clinton. “I think many Republicans know Donald Trump could cause great damage to our country and the world at large, and still plan to vote for him. But not me,” Shays wrote for CNN. He said he backs Clinton not reluctantly but with “strong conviction.” (August 10, 2016) Representatives Jonathan Ernst / Reuters Paul Ryan: YEA (was UNDECIDED) The House speaker once again affirmed his backing for Trump, offering the-less-than-resounding statement, “That’s not my plan. I don’t have a plan to do that.” (June 16, 2016) has condemned Trump’s attacks on Judge Gonzalo Curiel’s as “absolutely unacceptable,” saying, “Claiming a person can’t do their job because of their race is sort of like the textbook definition of a racist comment,” but adding that he isn’t dropping his support for Trump. (June 7, 2016) Ryan previously announced that he will vote for Trump: I'll be voting for @realDonaldTrump this fall. I'm confident he will help turn the House GOP's agenda into laws. https://t.co/LyaT16khJw — Paul Ryan (@PRyan) June 2, 2016 Ryan said he had become convinced that Trump would help Ryan enact his House agenda. (June 2, 2016) Ryan initially said he intended to support the Republican nominee, but after Trump clinched the nomination, he said he was not yet prepared to back Trump. “To be perfectly candid with you, I’m just not ready to that at this point,” he told CNN’s Jake Tapper. “I’m not there. I hope to, and I want to.” He said the party needs “a standard-bearer that bears our standards.” (May 5, 2016) Kevin McCarthy: YEA The House majority leader, a Californian, has broken with Speaker Paul Ryan and will back Trump. McCarthy has signed up as a prospective delegate for Trump in the Golden State. (May 10, 2016) Steve Scalise: YEA The House majority whip, a Louisiana representative, offered Trump a tepid endorsement. (The two men share the dubious distinction of being linked politically to David Duke.) “I've always said that I will support the Republican nominee,” Scalise said. “Now is the time for for our party to unite around Donald Trump so that we can focus on defeating Hillary Clinton in November to prevent another four years of job-killing, big government policies so we can get our economy back on track.” (May 5, 2016) Cathy McMorris Rodgers: YEA (formerly UNDECIDED) The Washington representative, who is chair of the House Republican Caucus, offered Trump a tepid endorsement, pointing out that he was the choice of primary voters, but adding, “In the months ahead, he will have to earn the presidency by demonstrating that he has the temperament for the job and plans to empower every American to pursue a future of opportunity and freedom.” (May 19, 2016) McMorris Rodgers previously said she had not made up her mind. “Before I endorse him, I would like to have a conversation with him. I would like to ask him questions about some of the statements he’s made,” she told The Spokesman-Review. (May 5, 2016) Raul Labrador: YEA The Idaho congressman, a Tea Party hero, tepidly backs Trump after opposing him in the primary and backing Cruz. “There are some things he doesn’t quite understand,” Labrador told The Huffington Post. “With Trump, I have at least some hope that he’s going to make the right choice.” Ileana Ros-Lehtinen: NAY The senior member of the Florida congressional delegation says she will write Jeb Bush’s name in on the ballot in November. (August 11, 2016) Ros-Lehtinen, who was born in Cuba and emigrated to the United States, has said she will not vote for Trump. “I will work with whomever is chosen by the American people to serve as president, because I deeply respect the American constitutional system,” she said in a statement. “In this election, I do not support either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton.” (May 6, 2016) Fred Upton: ABSTAIN The longtime Michigan congressman (and, true fact, uncle of Kate) says he will not endorse Trump, though he stopped short of saying he would not vote for him. “There’s a lot of things that folks are not happy about with either of these two candidates,” he said during a radio interview. “We’re running our own race, and don’t look for me to endorse anyone in this race probably the rest of the year.” (June 16, 2016) Richard Hanna: NAY Hanna, a retiring congressman who represents a swing district in central New York, is the first House Republican to say he will vote for Hillary Clinton. “For me, it is not enough to simply denounce [Trump’s] comments: He is unfit to serve our party and cannot lead this country,” Hanna wrote in the Syracuse Post-Standard. “Secretary Clinton has issues that depending on where one stands can be viewed as great or small…. While I disagree with her on many issues, I will vote for Mrs. Clinton.” (August 2, 2016) Charlie Dent: NAY Dent, a moderate Republican who represents southeastern Pennsylvania, said he doesn’t intend to vote for Trump or Clinton. “I’m not planning to vote for either of the two major-party nominees and I’m not ready to say I’m going to vote for the libertarians either,” he told Jake Tapper. (August 2, 2016) Adam Kinzinger: NAY The Illinois representative, a former Air Force pilot hails from a district west and south of Chicago, criticized Ted Cruz when he didn’t endorse Trump at the RNC. But then after Trump suggested not supporting NATO allies, Kinzinger described the idea as “utterly disastrous,” and he now tells CNN, “I don't see how I can get there anymore.” (August 3, 2016) Mike Coffman: UNDECIDED In a new television ad, the Colorado representative says, “People ask me, 'What do you think about Trump?' Honestly, I don't care for him much. And I certainly don't trust Hillary.\\" He promises to “stand up to” Trump. A spokeswoman says he is considering other candidates, but he has not ruled out voting for the nominee. (August 4, 2016) Bob Dold: NAY The Illinois congressman, who represents the northern suburbs of Chicago, was among the first Republicans to say he would not vote for Trump. “Whether it be Mr. Trump’s comments about women, his comments about Muslims, his comments about Latinos, for me it was very personal his comments about POWs,” Dold told WLS in May, adding, “I want to make that I’m clear about this, I’m not going to support Hillary Clinton either. I would write someone in.” (May 6, 2016) Scott Rigell: NAY The Virginia congressman, who represents the Virginia Beach area, has become the first Republican member of Congress to say that he will vote for Libertarian Gary Johnson. Rigell says he long ago decided he could not back Trump. “When their own conscience is seared by some statement that Trump has made, I have encouraged them to be direct and also, in a timely manner, repudiate what he said,” he told The New York Times. (August 7, 2016) Dave Reichert: UNDECIDED The Washington congressman, who represents a district just east of Seattle, said in an interview with KIRO radio that he would “never” endorse Trump. But he also said he wouldn’t vote for Clinton, and when pressed on whether he would vote for Trump, he added, “I never said I wouldn’t vote for him, I just said I wouldn’t endorse him.” (August 11, 2016) In dropping out of the Republican race after losing to Trump, Cruz did not make any indication whether he was willing to back his rival. (May 3, 2016) Jeff Sessions: YEA The Alabama senator was Trump’s first endorser from the Senate, and he has been a high-profile backer and adviser to Trump’s campaign. Susan Collins: NAY (was UNDECIDED) The moderate Maine senator writes in a Washington Post column that she has decided she cannot vote for Trump. “I have become increasingly dismayed by his constant stream of cruel comments and his inability to admit error or apologize,” she writes. “But it was his attacks directed at people who could not respond on an equal footing—either because they do not share his power or stature or because professional responsibility precluded them from engaging at such a level—that revealed Mr. Trump as unworthy of being our president.” She has not said for whom she will vote. (August 9, 2016) Collins previously told Time that she was in wait-and-see mode. “I’ve said from the point that it became obvious that Donald Trump was going to be the Republican candidate that I’d always supported previous presidential nominees of my party but that in this case I was going to wait and see what happened and that is what I am continuing to do.” (June 7, 2016) Having previously said that her backing from Trump would be contingent upon a shift in his rhetoric, Collins then said she would support the nominee. (May 6, 2016) Collins said: “I have always supported the Republican nominee for president, and I suspect I would do so this year, but I do want see what Donald Trump does from here on out.” To win her vote, “He’s going to have stop with gratuitous personal insults,” she said, amusingly. (May 4, 2016) John McCain: YEA The Arizona senator and 2008 GOP presidential nominee, who is in a tight reelection battle, released a scorching statement criticizing Trump for his comments about Gold Star parents Khizr and Ghazala Khan, but he did not revoke his support. (August 1, 2016) McCain has said publicly that he’ll back the nominee. In a private recording obtained by Politico, however, he frets that Trump endangers his reelection effort, while his former top aide Mark Salter is backing Clinton. (May 5, 2016) Kelly Ayotte: YEA Like her friend John McCain, the New Hampshire senator attacked Trump for his feud with Gold Star parents Khizr and Ghazala Khan, pronouncing herself “appalled” but giving no indication that she will withdraw backing for Trump.

(May 5, 2016) Rand Paul: YEA In a fascinating interview with WDRB (via Reason), the Kentucky senator and former presidential candidate said citizens should vote their conscience, while suggesting that he was only publicly backing Trump because he had pledged during the primary to support the nominee. “I've made my complaints about our nominee quite explicit. I continue to do so, but also don't see it as my job now—the thing is, is: I do think that my word is important. I signed a document, not under duress, but I signed a document saying I wouldn't run as a third party and I will support the nominee.” (August 2, 2016) Paul has said he will support Trump. (His father, ex-congressman and presidential contender Ron Paul, says he will not.) (May 4, 2016) Lindsey Graham: NAY The South Carolina senator and former presidential candidate blasted Trump following the nominee’s attacks on Judge Gonzalo Curiel, saying fellow Republicans should withdraw their endorsements. “This is the most un-American thing from a politician since Joe McCarthy,” he said. “If anybody was looking for an off-ramp, this is probably it. There’ll come a time when the love of country will trump hatred of Hillary.” (June 7, 2016) Graham was one of Trump’s most prominent critics during the primary, even endorsing Cruz even though he’d previously likened the choice between him and Trump to a choice between poisoning and being shot. The day Trump won Indiana, Graham tweeted: If we nominate Trump, we will get destroyed.......and we will deserve it. — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) May 3, 2016 Graham says he will not vote for either Trump or Clinton. (May 6, 2016) Pat Toomey: UNDECIDED The Pennsylvania senator, another endangered incumbent, has not made up his mind. “As I have said repeatedly, I have not endorsed Donald Trump,” he said at a press conference. “There are things that he has said, a number of things he has said and done that give me great pause and I have significant concerns about, so I remain in a mode of waiting to be persuaded. I’ve not made a final decision on what I’m going to do. Hillary Clinton is completely unacceptable to me.” (August 10, 2016) Toomey previously said: “It certainly looks like Donald Trump is on his way to the nomination .… Donald Trump was not my first choice. He wasn’t my second choice or third or fourth choice. I have lots have differences with Donald Trump and lots of problems with him but I am absolutely in the ‘never Hillary Clinton’ camp.” (May 4, 2016) Mark Kirk: NAY (was YEA) The Illinois senator, one of this year’s most endangered incumbents, says he will write in Colin Powell for president. (August 11, 2016) Kirk previously announced that he is no longer supporting Donald Trump—the first Republican to rescind his backing. “After much consideration, I have concluded that Donald Trump has not demonstrated the temperament necessary to assume the greatest office in the world,” he said. (June 7, 2016) Kirk previously said he’d back Trump if nominated. Tom Cotton: YEA The rising-star Arkansas senator weakly endorsed Trump. “I’ve long said that I will support the Republican nominee because we can’t afford a third Obama-Clinton term,” he said. He had previously criticized Trump for mocking John McCain, but also said Trump would be “a more serious leader for our country” that Clinton. (May 5, 2016) Bob Corker: YEA The Tennessee senator, who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has said he is willing to help Trump. Corker praised Trump’s otherwise widely panned foreign-policy address and is reportedly talking to him about overseas matters. He’s been mentioned as VP candidate.

I will not be voting for Donald Trump for president. This is not a decision I make lightly, for I am a lifelong Republican. But Donald Trump does not reflect historical Republican values nor the inclusive approach to governing that is critical to healing the divisions in our country. When the primary season started, it soon became apparent that, much like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Mr. Trump was connecting with many Americans who felt that their voices were not being heard in Washington and who were tired of political correctness. But rejecting the conventions of political correctness is different from showing complete disregard for common decency. Mr. Trump did not stop with shedding the stilted campaign dialogue that often frustrates voters. Instead, he opted for a constant stream of denigrating comments, including demeaning Sen. John McCain’s (R-Ariz.) heroic military service and repeatedly insulting Fox News host Megyn Kelly. With the passage of time, I have become increasingly dismayed by his constant stream of cruel comments and his inability to admit error or apologize. But it was his attacks directed at people who could not respond on an equal footing — either because they do not share his power or stature or because professional responsibility precluded them from engaging at such a level — that revealed Mr. Trump as unworthy of being our president. [When it comes to Trump, a Republican Treasury secretary says: Choose country over party] The number of influential Republican officials saying that they can't vote for either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton is growing as Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) pledges she won't vote for Trump. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) My conclusion about Mr. Trump’s unsuitability for office is based on his disregard for the precept of treating others with respect, an idea that should transcend politics. Instead, he opts to mock the vulnerable and inflame prejudices by attacking ethnic and religious minorities. Three incidents in particular have led me to the inescapable conclusion that Mr. Trump lacks the temperament, self-discipline and judgment required to be president. The first was his mocking of a reporter with disabilities, a shocking display that did not receive the scrutiny it deserved. I kept expecting Mr. Trump to apologize, at least privately, but he did not, instead denying that he had done what seemed undeniable to anyone who watched the video. At the time, I hoped that this was a terrible lapse, not a pattern of abuse. The second was Mr. Trump’s repeated insistence that Gonzalo Curiel, a federal judge born and raised in Indiana, could not rule fairly in a case involving Trump University because of his Mexican heritage. For Mr. Trump to insist that Judge Curiel would be biased because of his ethnicity demonstrated a profound lack of respect not only for the judge but also for our constitutional separation of powers, the very foundation of our form of government. Again, I waited in vain for Mr. Trump to retract his words. Third was Donald Trump’s criticism of the grieving parents of Army Capt. Humayun Khan, who was killed in Iraq. It is inconceivable that anyone, much less a presidential candidate, would attack two Gold Star parents. Rather than honoring their sacrifice and recognizing their pain, Mr. Trump disparaged the religion of the family of an American hero. And once again, he proved incapable of apologizing, of saying he was wrong. I am also deeply concerned that Mr. Trump’s lack of self-restraint and his barrage of ill-informed comments would make an already perilous world even more so. It is reckless for a presidential candidate to publicly raise doubts about honoring treaty commitments with our allies. Mr. Trump’s tendency to lash out when challenged further escalates the possibility of disputes spinning dangerously out of control. [Ghazala Khan: Trump criticized my silence. He knows nothing about true sacrifice.] I had hoped that we would see a “new” Donald Trump as a general-election candidate — one who would focus on jobs and the economy, tone down his rhetoric, develop more thoughtful policies and, yes, apologize for ill-tempered rants. But the unpleasant reality that I have had to accept is that there will be no “new” Donald Trump, just the same candidate who will slash and burn and trample anything and anyone he perceives as being in his way or an easy scapegoat. Regrettably, his essential character appears to be fixed, and he seems incapable of change or growth. 1 of 14 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × These Republicans refuse to vote for Donald Trump View Photos And they’ll tell you why.

Former Secretary of State Colin Powell “General Powell said at a meeting of the Long Island Association that he would be voting for Hillary Clinton,” a spokeswoman confirmed Oct. 25. Powell added in an interview that he picked Clinton “because I think she’s qualified, and the other gentleman is not qualified.” Nikki Kahn/The Washington Post Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. At the same time, I realize that Mr. Trump’s success reflects profound discontent in this country, particularly among those who feel left behind by an unbalanced economy and who wonder whether their children will have a better life than their parents. As we have seen with the dissatisfaction with both major- party nominees — neither of whom I support — these passions are real and the public will demand action. Some will say that as a Republican I have an obligation to support my party’s nominee. I have thought long and hard about that, for being a Republican is part of what defines me as a person. I revere the history of my party, most particularly the value it has always placed on the worth and dignity of the individual, and I will continue to work across the country for Republican candidates. It is because of Mr. Trump’s inability and unwillingness to honor that legacy that I am unable to support his candidacy. ||||| Fifty of the nation’s most senior Republican national security officials, many of them former top aides or cabinet members for President George W. Bush, have signed a letter declaring that Donald J. Trump “lacks the character, values and experience” to be president and “would put at risk our country’s national security and well-being.” Mr. Trump, the officials warn, “would be the most reckless president in American history.” The letter says Mr. Trump would weaken the United States’ moral authority and questions his knowledge of and belief in the Constitution. It says he has “demonstrated repeatedly that he has little understanding” of the nation’s “vital national interests, its complex diplomatic challenges, its indispensable alliances and the democratic values” on which American policy should be based. And it laments that “Mr. Trump has shown no interest in educating himself.” “None of us will vote for Donald Trump,” the letter states, though it notes later that many Americans “have doubts about Hillary Clinton, as do many of us.” While foreign policy elites in both parties often argue among themselves — behind closed doors, or politely in the pages of Foreign Affairs magazine — it is extraordinarily rare for them to step into the political arena so publicly and aggressively. Several former midlevel officials issued a similar if milder letter in March, during the primaries. But Monday’s letter included many senior former officials who until now have remained silent in public, even while denouncing Mr. Trump’s policies over dinners or in small Republican conclaves. ||||| Focused crawls are collections of frequently-updated webcrawl data from narrow (as opposed to broad or wide) web crawls, often focused on a single domain or subdomain. ||||| Summary:","response":"Hillary Clinton has the support of several key neoconservatives, including Paul Wolfowitz, who served as deputy secretary of defense under George W.

Movie title: Police Story 4: First Strike Movie plot: Whilst working for the CIA, Chan Ka-kui (Jackie Chan) is assigned to follow leads of a nuclear smuggling case. He follows a woman named Natasha to Ukraine, when he realizes that she had been hiding vital information, Ka-kui calls for backup and she is later arrested. However, Natasha's partner is an unknown man, who turns out to be Jackson Tsui (Jackson Liu), a Chinese American nuclear scientist with CIA links, suspected of stealing a nuclear warhead. Ka-kui follows Tsui to a restricted area, and after a trap set by Tsui, the CIA agents together with Ukrainian authorities engage in battle. Ka-kui finds a briefcase which contained evidence from Tsui, but as he is chased by unknown forces, Ka-kui loses the briefcase as he falls into frozen waters. When he recovers in Russia, he meets Colonel Gregor Yegorov (Yuri Petrov) who explains the situation. Ka-kui goes with the FSB and is taken to Moscow where he discovers he has been assigned to work with Gregor to solve a similar case involving nuclear weapons being smuggled out of Ukraine. His task is to track Tsui, who disappeared after their last encounter. He is taken by a Russian submarine to Brisbane, Australia, where Tsui's younger sister Annie (Wu Chen-chun) works at an aquarium doing shark shows. Uncle 7 (Terry Woo), the Tsuis' father and the local Triad boss, is seriously ill and Ka-kui suspects the criminal will show up soon. Unknown to Ka-kui, Tsui is hiding at the hospital and has given a nuclear warhead (disguised as a small oxygen tank) to Annie, who hides it at the aquarium. While following Annie, Ka-kui gets held up by Tsui, who claims to have a deal with Gregor. Ka-kui, after realizing he has been used by Gregor, decides to return home, but two men are sent to kill him, and he is framed for the murder of Uncle 7.

Answer:","response":"In the movie \\"Police Story 4: First Strike,\\" Jackson Tsui (played by Jackson Liu), a nuclear scientist with CIA links, is suspected of stealing a nuclear warhead. The film's plot revolves around main character Chan Ka-kui (played by Jackie Chan) pursuing leads in a nuclear smuggling case that takes him around the world. Working for the CIA, Ka-kui follows a woman named Natasha to Ukraine, only to find that she's hiding crucial information with regards to the case. When she's arrested, it's revealed that her accomplice is none other than Jackson Tsui. As Ka-kui continues to follow Tsui, he finds himself deep within a restricted area in Ukraine, where he eventually loses Tsui after a set trap and a battle with the CIA and Ukrainian authorities. Ka-kui later encounters Tsui in Brisbane, Australia, where Tsui's younger sister, Annie, works at an aquarium. It's discovered that Tsui has given the stolen nuclear warhead, disguised as a small oxygen tank, to Annie—keeping it hidden in the aquarium. Tsui is concealed in a hospital where their father, also a Triad boss named Uncle 7, lies seriously ill. The key part of the plot indicates Tsui's suspected theft of the nuclear warhead, which stirs much of the conflict in the film. This nuclear warhead not only acts as Tsui's defense but also becomes a primary threat for Ka-kui and other characters in the movie to neutralize. Simultaneously, Tsui's actions deceive and mislead Ka-kui, let alone the authorities pursuing him, creating further depth to his character and the overall story. Thus making the nuclear warhead an essential plot element for the film. While assessing the film proposal, it is vital to keep in mind the intricate intertwining of different elements such as the suspense developed by the nuclear warhead theft, the global chase, and the web of deceit spun by multiple characters. These factors may contribute to the film's success by sustaining audiences' interest and creating room for dramatic action scenarios."},{"question":"Select from: I. negative; II. positive; What would be an example of an I. review?","response":"I. negative An example of a negative review would be someone saying that they didn't like a movie because it was too long and boring.

The portraits include Cardinal-Elector Albert of Mainz; Frederick the Wise, elector of Saxony; the humanist scholar Willibald Pirckheimer; Philipp Melanchthon, and Erasmus of Rotterdam. For those of the Cardinal, Melanchthon, and Durer's final major work, a drawn portrait of the Nuremberg patrician Ulrich Starck, Durer depicted the sitters in profile, perhaps reflecting a more mathematical approach. Despite complaining of his lack of a formal classical education, Durer was greatly interested in intellectual matters and learned much from his boyhood friend Willibald Pirckheimer, whom he no doubt consulted on the content of many of his images. He also derived great satisfaction from his friendships and correspondence with Erasmus and other scholars. Durer succeeded in producing two books during his lifetime. \\"The Four Books on Measurement\\" were published at Nuremberg in 1525 and was the first book for adults on mathematics in German, as well as being cited later by Galileo and Kepler. The other, a work on city fortifications, was published in 1527. \\"The Four Books on Human Proportion\\" were published posthumously, shortly after his death in 1528.

However, finding ways to monetize your blog effectively without hampering the user experience is an ongoing challenge for many bloggers. One attractive option for generating additional revenue while adding value to your readers is incorporating affiliate marketing through affiliate ads. This article discusses how to add and manage affiliate ads to your blog, and how they can benefit both you and your readers. Understanding Affiliate Marketing Affiliate marketing is a performance-based marketing strategy that involves partnering with other companies or websites to promote their products or services on your blog. As an affiliate, you earn a commission for each sale or action (such as a newsletter sign-up) that takes place through your referrals. To get started with affiliate marketing, you first need to join affiliate programs that are relevant to your niche or your readers' interests. These programs provide you with unique tracking links that you can use to link to their products or services from your blog. The tracking links enable the affiliate platform to identify when a visitor from your blog has made a purchase, so you can be compensated accordingly. Adding Affiliate Ads to Your Blog Once you have joined suitable affiliate programs, consider the following tips while adding affiliate ads to your blog: 1. Choose Relevant Products and Services Keep your readers' interests and preferences in mind when selecting products or services to promote. This will not only ensure a seamless user experience but also increase the likelihood of your readers clicking on the ads and making a purchase. 2. Place Ads Strategically The placement of affiliate ads can significantly impact their effectiveness and your conversion rates. Ideally, you should place the ads within the content where they're contextually relevant, like in a product review or tutorial. You can also display ads in prominent areas like sidebars, headers, and footers to increase visibility. 3. Include a Mix of Text Links and Banners Diversify your ad formats by using both text links and image banners. This will allow you to cater to different reader preferences and seamlessly integrate ads into your content. 4. Be Transparent and Ethical Disclose your affiliate partnerships to your readers by including a disclaimer on your website. This will demonstrate your commitment to transparency and further build your readers' trust. The Benefits of Affiliate Ads Incorporating affiliate ads into your blog can be beneficial in various ways, including: 1. Increased Revenue Affiliate marketing serves as a passive income source, which can effectively supplement your earnings from other monetization methods like sponsored content or displaying display ads. 2. Monetizing without Detracting from User Experience Affiliate ads, when chosen wisely and implemented strategically, can add value to your readers by introducing them to relevant products and services that enhance or complement the content of your blog. 3. Strengthening Reader Loyalty By recommending specific products based on personal experience or in-depth research, you can further establish yourself as a trusted authority in your niche. This helps foster reader loyalty and increases the likelihood of repeat visits to your blog. 4. Opportunity for Growth As your blog grows and attracts more traffic, your affiliate earnings can increase without requiring any additional effort, making it a scalable monetization method. Conclusion Affiliate marketing offers a lucrative and low-maintenance way to monetize your blog while preserving the user experience. By carefully selecting the right products and services, strategically placing the ads, and remaining transparent about your partnerships, you can successfully cultivate a revenue-boosting strategy that aligns with your audience's interests and preferences. By adding relevant affiliate ads to your blog, you not only generate more income, but also build credibility, enhance reader loyalty, and create a more engaging experience for your visitors. As you continue to grow your blog, don't hesitate to explore new affiliate programs and partnerships to maximize the potential of your online presence."},{"question":"Why are we still religious even after science basically disproving major religious beliefs?

Answer:","response":"The historic home located at the Depot originally known as Letterkenny Ordnance Depot is the historic building known as the Chambers House. This notable structure is situated within the grounds of the Letterkenny Army Depot, which is a United States Army facility located in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania. The Chambers House serves as a symbolic representation of the Depot's extensive history and its role in the region's development. The Chambers House, built in the 18th century, is of great historical significance not only for the Depot but also for the wider community. Benjamin Chambers, the founder of the town of Chambersburg, constructed this Georgian-style structure as his residence, and it exemplifies the architectural trends of that era. The house also displays certain features that are typical of domestic architecture built by the early settlers of the region, such as Pennsylvania German-style log construction. The Letterkenny Ordnance Depot, which surrounds the Chambers House, was established during World War II to support the United States Army's artillery and ammunition needs. The 16,000 acre facility's primary functions were to carry out the maintenance, storage, and distribution of military supplies, equipment, and ordnance materials. The depot was named after the town of Letterkenny in Ireland, reflecting the Irish heritage of many immigrants in the surrounding area. Throughout its history, the Letterkenny Army Depot has undergone numerous expansions and changes in its role, in response to the evolving needs of the U.S. military. For instance, during the Korean War, the depot was a primary repair facility for tanks. During the Vietnam War, it shifted its focus to manage the refurbishment of large numbers of military trucks. In more recent times, the depot has been responsible for the maintenance and overhaul of tactical missile systems, such as the PATRIOT and the TOW unit. Today, the Chambers House serves as a valuable historical resource. It is important to preserve and study this house as it provides the community with a tangible link to the local history, military heritage, and architectural legacy of the Letterkenny Ordnance Depot and the town of Chambersburg. The ongoing efforts of the depot and local historians ensure the historical and cultural significance of the Chambers House is not lost, but rather celebrated and cherished by future generations."},{"question":"Write a sentence not in English.","response":"Je mange une pomme.

Following his death, during the entire 1998 season the Cubs wore a patch on the sleeves of their uniforms depicting a caricature of Caray. Cubs slugger Sammy Sosa dedicated each of his 66 home runs that season to Caray. Caray had five children, three with his first wife, Dorothy, and two with his second wife, Marian. He married his third wife Delores \\"Dutchie\\" (Goldmann) on May 19, 1975. His son Skip Caray followed him into the booth as a baseball broadcaster with the Atlanta Braves until his death on August 3, 2008.

Any dark green, black, gray or white growth on the outside of the root is an indication that it has spoiled. Hypothesis: lotus does not taste that good","response":"From the provided context, we cannot draw the hypothesis that \\"lotus does not taste that good.\\" The context focuses on identifying when a lotus root has gone bad or spoiled, not on the taste of the lotus root when it is fresh and in good condition. It is important to not confuse the signs of spoilage with the inherent characteristics of a food item. The context mentions the presence of mold, mildew, or any dark green, black, gray, or white growth on the outside of the root as indications of spoilage. These signs of spoilage may negatively affect the taste of the lotus root, but they do not provide information about the taste of a fresh and properly stored lotus root. Lotus root is a popular ingredient in many Asian cuisines due to its crunchy texture and mild, starchy taste. It can be steamed, stir-fried, braised, deep-fried, or used in soups, among other preparations. In all of these instances, the lotus root is cooked before consumption to enhance its flavor and make it more palatable. To accurately determine the taste of lotus root or gauge its popularity as a food ingredient, one would need more specific and inclusive context. This could include information about different recipes, traditional uses, flavor profiles and testimonials from those who have enjoyed lotus root dishes. Without such context, we cannot jump to the conclusion that lotus does not taste good based solely on the fact that spoiled lotus roots can exhibit mold and mildew."},{"question":"Read the following article and answer the question.

The use of recorded evidence was combined with an increased scepticism about two of the most colourful chroniclers of John's reign, Roger of Wendover and Matthew Paris. In many cases the detail provided by these chroniclers, both writing after John's death, was challenged by modern historians. Interpretations of Magna Carta and the role of the rebel barons in 1215 have been significantly revised: although the charter's symbolic, constitutional value for later generations is unquestionable, in the context of John's reign most historians now consider it a failed peace agreement between \\"partisan\\" factions.

He spends his days running small errands for people, but he is fascinated by the bridge shutters, as there are whispers that opening them holds the key to unlocking the lost secrets of the ancient architects. Meanwhile, Lord Verrick, an evil aristocrat with a thirst for power, has obtained a divine artifact - an ancient scroll that contains the final instructions for opening the shutters on the bridge windows. He enlists the help of a group of notorious criminals to decipher it, hoping to harness the untapped energy that lies behind the shutters to take control of the city. As Gallo learns about Lord Verrick's plans, he decides to embark on a daring quest to stop the villain and uncover the truth behind the bridge shutters. Along the way, he forms a ragtag group of allies, comprised of an eccentric inventor, a skilled swordsman, and a mysterious cloaked stranger who seems to have knowledge of the ancient architects. Together, they decipher the artifact before Lord Verrick can complete his plan, and night after night, they secretly open each window shutter, one at a time. As each shutter is opened, beams of otherworldly light illuminate the city, and a fantastic, never-before-seen transformation begins to take place.

On average, daytime highs in the Piedmont can often reach temperatures of over 90 °F (32 °C). However, these temperatures can vary depending on the specific location within the region. For instance, at the northern end of the Piedmont, daytime highs in cities like Newark, New Jersey, tend to hover around 80-87 °F (26-30 °C) during the hottest months of summer. Conversely, more southern locations, such as Charlotte, North Carolina, experience higher daytime averages of around 87-92 °F (30-33 °C) in the summer. In the Piedmont's southernmost portions, such as Atlanta, Georgia, summer temperatures often exceed 90 °F (32 °C), with some days even climbing to 95-100 °F (35-38 °C). It is essential to note that these temperatures can be subject to variations in urban heat island effects, particularly in heavily populated metropolitan areas. This phenomenon can cause temperature spikes in city centers compared to rural areas due to factors such as heat-absorbing asphalt and concrete surfaces and limited vegetation. Summertime in the Piedmont region is characterized not only by its hot and often humid conditions but also by the prevalence of thunderstorms and occasional severe weather events. The warmth and humidity can lead to increased instability in the atmosphere, which in turn can cause bouts of heavy rainfall, high winds, and sometimes hail or tornadoes. In conclusion, the Piedmont region experiences a wide range of temperatures throughout its vast area, with daytime highs often surpassing 90 °F (32 °C) in the summer months. It is essential to note that specific temperatures can vary depending on the precise location within the Piedmont and external contributing factors such as urban heat island effects."},{"question":"Pick one category for the following text.

So, this sentence is talking about a cute cat!"},{"question":"Select from the following. 1). negative; 2). positive;Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? get an ugly , mean-spirited lashing","response":"The phrase \\"get an ugly, mean-spirited lashing\\" would be considered negative. This is because it includes words and phrases that convey a sense of unpleasantness, harm, or potentially destructive emotions. Firstly, the word \\"ugly\\" is a term that often refers to something that is unattractive or unappealing in some way. In this context, it suggests that the lashing is not only harmful but also visually or emotionally distressing. Secondly, the term \\"mean-spirited\\" implies that the lashing is fueled by malicious intent or a desire to cause harm. This reinforces the negative tone of the phrase, as it implies that the person delivering the lashing is not acting from a place of concern or constructive criticism but rather from a desire to hurt or undermine the recipient. Lastly, the word \\"lashing\\" itself has negative connotations. While it can be used figuratively to describe harsh criticism or verbal attacks, it also has a more literal meaning of being struck with a whip or similar instrument. This imagery conveys a sense of physical pain and suffering, as well as a power imbalance between the person delivering the lashing and the person receiving it. Overall, the phrase \\"get an ugly, mean-spirited lashing\\" is undoubtedly negative, as it describes a situation or event that involves harm, negativity, and strong negative emotions. It is unlikely to be used in a context where the intended meaning is to uplift or encourage someone, but rather to highlight the severity of the hurt or harm being inflicted."},{"question":"Given the question: What's the answer to that question: what did amerigo vespucci explore?

Factual Answer: The Galapagos Islands are a group of volcanic islands located in the Pacific Ocean, about 906 km (563 mi) west of continental Ecuador. These islands are significant because they provided the foundation for Charles Darwin's groundbreaking theory of evolution by natural selection. When Darwin visited the islands during the Voyage of the Beagle in 1835, he observed several unique species of flora and fauna that had adapted to their specific habitats on different islands. Darwin's observations of the distinct differences in species between the islands led him to develop the idea of adaptive radiation, in which species evolve from a common ancestor and then diversify into multiple forms to adapt to different environmental conditions. A famous example of this adaptive radiation is the Galapagos finches. These birds evolved into 13 different species from a common ancestor, each with a unique beak shape that enabled them to eat specific types of food available on their respective islands. Another notable example of unique adaptation on the Galapagos Islands is the Galapagos tortoise, which is the largest living tortoise species in the world. The tortoises on different islands evolved to have distinctive shell shapes, neck lengths, and sizes depending on the availability and types of vegetation on each island. Through the study of these species and others on the Galapagos Islands, scientists have gained a deeper understanding of how natural selection and adaptive radiation drive biological evolution. This has allowed them to uncover critical insights into biodiversity, conservation, and the ecological processes governing life on our planet. The Galapagos Islands continue to be a focal point for evolutionary biology research and serve as a living laboratory for understanding the natural world."},{"question":"Given those answer options, answer the question: You are presented with the quiz \\"Where are deposits of gold found?\\" But you don't know the answer, so you turn to your teacher to ask for hints. He says that \\"vein deposits of gold and silver are formed by igneous intrusion\\" and \\"veins of Gold ore most commonly occur in cracks and fissures in igneous rocks\\". So, what's the best answer to the question? A:","response":"\\"Deposits of gold are found in areas where igneous rocks are prevalent and in cracks and fissures caused by igneous intrusion.\\" Based on the hints provided by the teacher, we can determine that the best answer to the question \\"Where are deposits of gold found?\\" is related to the presence of igneous rocks and the formation of vein deposits due to igneous intrusion. Igneous rocks are formed when magma (molten rock) cools and solidifies. These rocks are abundant in areas with high volcanic activity, such as around tectonic plate boundaries. The process of igneous intrusion occurs when magma penetrates into pre-existing rocks, forcing its way through cracks and fissures before cooling and solidifying. This intrusion can cause a network of veins, particularly in areas where the pre-existing rocks are brittle and susceptible to fracturing. Gold, along with other precious metals like silver, often forms in these veins. Due to the high temperatures and pressures involved in the formation of igneous rocks and the intrusion process, gold-bearing fluids are mobilized and migrate into the surrounding rocks. Cracks and fissures provide optimal pathways for these fluids to flow, and as the temperature and pressure decrease, gold is deposited in the form of metallic crystals within these veins. Vein deposits of gold and silver can be found in various locations worldwide, with notable examples including the Witwatersrand Basin in South Africa, the Carlin Trend in Nevada, USA, and the Super Pit in Western Australia. These regions bear the geological characteristics necessary for the formation of gold deposits, with a combination of igneous rocks and associated hydrothermal activity. So, to summarize, the best answer to the question, \\"Where are deposits of gold found?\\" is: Deposits of gold are found in areas where igneous rocks are prevalent and in cracks and fissures caused by igneous intrusion. This answer takes into account the teacher's hints regarding the importance of vein deposits, igneous rocks, and the processes of gold formation within these veins."},{"question":"Chris Nielsen (born April 2, 1955 in Aalborg, Denmark) is a Canadian country singer, who recorded both as a solo artist and as a duo with her husband R.

Nick is better at ping pong than Jason because","response":"Nick had been honing his skills from a very young age. Nick's father, a semi-professional player, would take him to the local sports center every weekend since he was seven. 1. First, I need to illustrate the extent of Nick's training and his dedication to ping pong. This helps me elevate Nick's competence beyond natural talent alone and reveal that he's been perfecting his skills over a significant period. His father passed on to him essential ping pong techniques right from holding the paddle correctly, mastering accuracy to controlling serve speed and spin. 2. Through this step, I'm establishing how Nick got to be so proficient. By specifying particular skills like accuracy and control, I further intensify his expertise. As he got older, Nick seized every opportunity to compete in local and state-level competitions, winning most of them. These experiences gave him the invaluable experience of pressure-packed situations and different playing styles. 3. Here I underline Nick's constant pursuit of improvement and willingness to challenge himself. This also emphasizes his ability to deal with different scenarios and player strategies, making him a more versatile player. In contrast, Jason started playing ping pong only in high school. Though he took quick strides due to his natural athleticism, his experience and training were significantly less than Nick's. 4. In this step, I introduce a comparison with Jason. Stressing on Jason's late start and less training stresses the difference in their experience and expertise even if Jason has natural athletic abilities. Moreover, Jason's limited participation in tournaments meant he lacked exposure to the same variety of situations and strategies that Nick had encountered. 5. Taking the comparison further, I contrast Jason's tournament experience with Nick's. This helps exemplify Nick's advantage in terms of the breadth of gameplay strategies and dealing with competitive pressure. Hence, Nick is certainly better than Jason at ping pong. However, both continue to enjoy the game and constantly learn from each other. 6. To wrap up the story, I reaffirm Nick's superiority, adding a harmonious note by acknowledging their common love for the game and the constant learning process. This leaves room for future developments and changes in the dynamics."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: Construct a question that every answer in the list is correct and reasonable for it.

Melbourne, the capital city of the Australian state of Victoria, has a rich and diverse history that spans from its indigenous roots to its modern evolution as a multicultural, thriving metropolis. Founded in 1835 by settlers from Van Diemen's Land, now Tasmania, Melbourne quickly grew into a major center of trade, arts, and sports, making it a significant player on the global stage. The history of Melbourne can be divided into several key periods: 1. Indigenous History: Prior to European settlement, the area that is now Melbourne was inhabited by the Wurundjeri and Boonwurrung people of the Kulin Nation for over 40,000 years. They maintained a nomadic lifestyle and focused on hunting, gathering, and fishing. Their spiritual connection to the land remains an essential aspect of their cultural identity today. 2. European Settlement and the Gold Rush: In 1835, a group led by John Batman founded a settlement which later became known as Melbourne in honor of British Prime Minister, William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne. The city expanded rapidly, due in large part to the successful gold rush in Victoria during the 1850s. The massive influx of both domestic and international settlers transformed Melbourne into one of the world's wealthiest cities for several decades. 3. The Late Victorian Era and Beyond: During the late 1800s, Melbourne experienced significant urban growth, leading to the development of impressive architectural achievements including the Royal Exhibition Building, Government House, and Parliament House, among others. Melbourne also cemented itself as a cultural and educational center with the establishment of key institutions, such as The University of Melbourne and the National Gallery of Victoria. 4. The 20th Century and Modern Melbourne: Throughout the 20th century, Melbourne played a vital role in Australia's political, cultural, and sporting landscape. In 1901, it became the first city to host the Parliament of Australia, highlighting a growing national importance. The city experienced significant growth following both World War I and II due to increased migration, which in turn contributed to the city's rich multicultural environment. Melbourne hosted the Summer Olympics in 1956, further cementing its global presence. Today, Melbourne is a diverse and thriving metropolis known for its arts, sports, and events. It is a cultural hub, home to vibrant street art, stunning architecture, a thriving music scene, and array of world-renowned galleries and museums. The city's gastronomic scene is acclaimed worldwide, reflecting its multicultural roots. Moreover, it has consistently been ranked as one of the world's most liveable cities, thanks to its high standard of living, excellent healthcare, and top-notch education system. In summary, Melbourne has a rich and varied history that encompasses indigenous culture, European settlement, an unparalleled gold rush, and rapid urban development. It has evolved into a major player on the international stage, boasting an eclectic mix of culture, architecture, and history that continues to attract millions of residents and visitors alike every year."},{"question":"The answer to the question: What is the name of the album that was left unaltered aside from a remastering which sharpened the bass guitar sound and increased the volume of the vocals by approximately three decibels? is inside the article: Soon afterward, in April 1993, Albini remarked to the Chicago Tribune that he doubted Geffen would release the completed album. Albini commented years later that in a sense he felt he spoke about the situation \\"from a position of ignorance, because I wasn't there when the band was having their discussions with the record label. All I know is ... we made a record, everybody was happy with it. A few weeks later I hear that it's unreleasable and it's all got to be redone\\". While Albini's remarks in the article drew no immediate reply from the group or its label, Newsweek ran a similar article soon afterwards that did. Nirvana denied there was any pressure from its label to change the album's sound, sending a letter to Newsweek that said that the article's author \\"ridiculed our relationship with our label based on totally erronous [sic] information\\"; the band also reprinted the letter in a full-page ad in Billboard. Rosenblatt insisted in a press release that Geffen would release anything the band submitted, and label founder David Geffen made the unusual move of personally calling Newsweek to complain about the article.Nirvana wanted to do further work on the recorded tracks, and considered working with producer Scott Litt and remixing some tracks with Andy Wallace (who had mixed Nevermind). Albini vehemently disagreed, and claimed he had an agreement with the band that it would not modify the tracks without his involvement. Albini initially refused to give the album master tapes to Gold Mountain, but relented after a phone call from Novoselic. The band decided against working with Wallace and chose to remix and augment the songs \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" and \\"All Apologies\\" with Litt at Seattle's Bad Animals Studio in May 1993. Furthermore, a remix of \\"Pennyroyal Tea\\" by Scott Litt (at Bad Animals on November 22, 1993) appears on the censored Wal-Mart and Kmart versions of In Utero; this remix is also available on the band's 2002 best-of compilation, Nirvana, and is the same mix that appeared on the single...., can you guess it ?

Should I validate this answer? A:","response":"Based on the given question and answer, I can understand that you are verifying the accuracy of the generated answer. It is crucial to evaluate the relevance of the given options (I. No; II. Yes) and the provided information concerning the release date of The Kite Runner on DVD. The initial question seeks information on the filming locations of The Kite Runner. However, the proposed answer provides details about the release date of the movie on DVD, which does not meet the requirement of the inquired topic. Consequently, the response is inadequate and fails to address the main query. To assist with answering the original question correctly, I have compiled relevant information: The Kite Runner is a film adaptation of Khaled Hosseini's best-selling novel of the same title. Directed by Marc Forster, this drama narrates the story of Amir, an Afghan refugee living in the United States, who is prompted to travel back to his war-torn homeland to make amends for a past childhood incident. Though the story is set against the backdrop of Afghanistan, it was not practical to shoot the movie in the actual country due to security concerns and ongoing unrest. Therefore, the filming of The Kite Runner took place in multiple locations: 1. Kashgar, Xinjiang, China: The majority of the movie was shot in Kashgar, an ancient Silk Road city in northwest China that shares a border with Afghanistan. The city's landscape, architecture, and cultural resemblance to Afghanistan made it an ideal choice for capturing the essence of the book. 2. Beijing, China: Some additional scenes were filmed in Beijing. 3. San Francisco Bay Area, California, USA: Since part of the story takes place in the United States, specific scenes representing Amir's life in America were filmed in various locations in the San Francisco Bay Area, including Golden Gate Park and the Cliff House restaurant. 4. Tilden Regional Park, Berkeley Hills, California, USA: The park served as the venue for the famous kite-flying sequence in the film. To answer your question whether to validate the suggested response or not, the appropriate choice would be I. No, as the provided information does not address the actual query. Instead, the correct answer should contain details about the different filming locations of The Kite Runner, as outlined above."},{"question":"pick from the following. a. Yes. b.

Chat Moss could also derive from Ceatta, an Old English personal name and mos, a swamp or alternatively the first element could be the Old English ceat meaning a piece of wet ground. It was recorded as Catemosse in 1277 and Chatmos in 1322. Moss is the local name for a peat bog.Daniel Defoe visited the area in 1724, on his way from Warrington to Manchester: From hence (Warrington), on the road to Manchester, we pass'd the great bog or waste call'd Chatmos, the first of that kind that we see in England ... The surface, at a distance, looks black and dirty, and is indeed frightful to think of, for it will bear neither horse or man, unless in an exceeding dry season, and then not so as to be passable, or that any one should travel over them ... What nature meant by such a useless production, 'tis hard to imagine; but the land is entirely waste, excep ... for the poor cottagers fuel, and the quantity used for that is very small. Peat bogs sometimes burst their boundaries, particularly after being subjected to heavy rainfall, and this seems to have happened with Chat Moss in the 16th century. John Leland, writing during the reign of King Henry VIII, described one such event: Chat Moss brast up within a mile of Mosley Haul, and destroied much grounde with mosse thereabout, and destroyed much fresh-water fishche thereabout, first corrupting with stinkinge water Glasebrooke, and so Glasebrooke carried stinkinge water and mosse into Mersey water, and Mersey corrupted carried the roulling mosse, part to the shores of Wales, part to the isle of Man, and some unto Ireland. Chat Moss presented a significant challenge to the engineers constructing the Liverpool and Manchester Railway in 1826 because of the difficulty in providing a solid base..., what would be the answer ?

It also has optional DRM features. MTP was designed for use with portable media players, but it has since been adopted as the primary storage access protocol of the Android operating system from the version 4.1 Jelly Bean as well as Windows Phone 8 (Windows Phone 7 devices had used the Zune protocol which was an evolution of MTP). The primary reason for this is that MTP does not require exclusive access to the storage device the way UMS does, alleviating potential problems should an Android program request the storage while it is attached to a computer. The main drawback is that MTP is not as well supported outside of Windows operating systems. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Why was Media Transfer Protocol designed?","response":"Imagine you have a toy box with many different toys inside. Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) is like a special helper who helps you take out specific toys to play with, without needing to take everything out of the box. Microsoft created MTP to make it easier for people to access their files (like photos, music, and videos) on devices like phones or music players when connecting them to a computer. Before MTP, there was another way called USB mass storage, which was like taking out the whole toy box, making it difficult to use other toys in the box while connected to the computer. MTP is smarter and lets you use toys (files) on your device even when it's connected to the computer. This made it suitable for devices like Android phones and portable media players."},{"question":"Given the question: - battles is world war ii - death date is 15 february 1942 - allegiance is united kingdom - rank is acting lieutenant‑commander - placeofburial is malta naval cemetery , kalkara - awards is 30px george cross distinguished service cross -lrb- dso -rrb- - birth date is 13 january 1886 - unit is hms '' st angelo '' -lrb- malta -rrb- - branch is united kingdom - death place is malta - birth place is dorchester , dorset Given the details above, guess who could this information be about.

For this review, I will assume I am reviewing a cozy Italian restaurant called \\"La Dolce Vita\\". Step 2: Mention the ambiance and atmosphere of the place. Upon entering La Dolce Vita, one immediately notices the warm and inviting atmosphere. The soft lighting creates a sense of intimacy, while the rustic decor and vintage furnishings add to the charm of the place. The gentle background music, often Italian classics, complements the dining experience by setting the mood without being overwhelming. Step 3: Highlight the quality of the service. One of the things that sets La Dolce Vita apart is the friendly and attentive service. The waitstaff are knowledgeable about the menu and eager to provide recommendations, always with the perfect balance of professionalism and genuine warmth. The attentive service extends beyond the table, as the manager often checks in to ensure that all guests are satisfied. Step 4: Discuss the food, focusing on specific dishes and the taste experience. The culinary prowess of La Dolce Vita truly shines through their mouthwatering dishes. The fresh Caprese salad bursts with flavor, thanks to the juicy tomatoes and the perfectly creamy mozzarella. The standout dish for me, though, has to be the homemade pasta, cooked to perfection every time and paired with a variety of robust and flavorful sauces. The restaurant's wood-fired pizzas are also a must-try, topped with an exciting combination of fresh ingredients that will delight any pizza lover. Step 5: Mention any additional factors that add to the overall experience. La Dolce Vita's reasonably priced menu and daily specials are yet another reason why it's a favorite among locals and visitors alike. Additionally, the extensive wine list features some of the finest Italian wines, which pair beautifully with the delicious cuisine the restaurant offers. Step 6: End the review by recommending the place and summarizing the positive experience. In conclusion, La Dolce Vita is a gem of an Italian restaurant, perfect for date nights, family gatherings, or simply enjoying a delectable meal in a comfortable atmosphere. With the combination of scrumptious food, extraordinary service, and the cozy ambiance, I highly recommend La Dolce Vita to anyone looking for an unforgettable Italian dining experience."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Who is nearly shot? Answer the above question based on the context below: Bingo is an outcast circus dog whose owners, Steve and Ginger, pay little attention to. Their star puppy, Lauren, develops an infection from having stepped on a nail, so they use Bingo in place of her for their next act, The Ring of Fire. But Bingo is afraid of fire (due to the fact that he experienced it as a young puppy and furthermore lost his own mother that way) and chickens out. In rage of the embarrassment, Steve gets ready to shoot him, but his wife, Ginger stops him and while trying to restrain him, tells Bingo to start over and find a family. Bingo does so when Ginger finally agrees with Steve to kill him when Bingo mistakes her orders several times. The next day, Chuckie and his brother, Chickie along with friends of his go for a bike ride but Chuckie is too slow.

For your understanding: Russian language, like many other languages, doesn't have direct equivalent sounds or letters for all English phonetics. Therefore, when translating names of people, places or institutions, it’s often necessary to transcribe, or phonetically replicate, how that word or name is pronounced in the original language, rather than translating its components. The name \\"Yenching University\\" in this case most likely refers to Yanjing or Yenching (Yanjing is the Chinese word for Yenching), which was an old informal name for Beijing. \\"University\\" would just be translated to \\"Университет\\" which is pronounced \\"Universitet\\". The pronunciation of \\"Yenching\\" as it's spoken in Russian speakers will sound similar to the original Mandarin pronunciation—that is, it's an imitation or approximation of the sounds, rather than a meaningful translation of the components of the word. Do remember, transcribing a foreign name or phrase in Russian often relies on convention as much as it does phonetic likeness—what is widely accepted and understood among Russian speakers is just as important as achieving a close approximation of the original sounds. Just to add, the university once known as Yenching University is today part of Peking University, one of the most prestigious universities in China. Yenching University was a private university in Beijing, China, and was known for its high academic level. Speaking more about Yenching University, it was recognized as one of the premier academic institutions in the Republic of China era and it was the first Chinese institution to be a member of the Universitas 21, an international network of universities. It was integrated into Peking University in 1952. Now, there's a graduate program in Chinese Studies for international students at Peking University named after Yenching University.

Movie title: The Fall Context: Los Angeles, 1915: stuntman Roy Walker (Lee Pace) is hospitalized, as he is bedridden and possibly paralyzed after a jump he took in his first film. He meets Alexandria (Catinca Untaru), a young Romanian-born patient in the hospital who is recovering from a broken arm, and begins to tell her a story about her namesake. Alexandria is told she has to leave, but Roy promises to tell her an epic tale if she returns the next day. The next morning, as Roy spins his tale of fantasy, Alexandria's imagination brings his characters to life. Roy's tale is about five heroes: a silent Indian warrior (Jeetu Verma), a muscular ex-slave named Otta Benga (Marcus Wesley), an Italian explosives expert called Luigi (Robin Smith), Charles Darwin (Leo Bill) with a pet monkey called Wallace, and a masked swashbuckling bandit. An evil ruler named Governor Odious (Daniel Caltagirone) has committed an offense against each of the five, who all seek revenge. The heroes are later joined by a sixth hero, a mystic. Alexandria vividly imagines her friends and people around her appearing as the characters in Roy's story. Although Roy develops affection for Alexandria, he also has an ulterior motive: by gaining her trust, he tricks her into stealing morphine from the hospital pharmacy so that he can attempt suicide; a choice driven by his love leaving him for the actor for whom he provided the stunt footage. However, Alexandria returns with only three pills, having mistaken the \\"E\\" on the piece of paper Roy gave her for a \\"3\\".

Airplanes: This word is the primary subject of the sentence. The entire scenario revolves around 'airplanes'. They are the entities undertaking the activity described. Without this word, the rest of the sentence loses context and meaning. 2. Flying: This verb indicates the ongoing action. 'Flying' contributes to creating the scene being described and helps to understand what the 'airplanes' are doing. It's crucial because it distinguishes the state of the airplanes. They could be parked, landing, or in maintenance, but here, they are in flight. 3. Formation: This word adds a layer of detail to how the airplanes are flying. This tells us that there is a kind of ordered arrangement or pattern to the flight of these planes, as opposed to them flying independently or randomly. It paints a coordinated picture. 4. Smoke: This term is a crucial descriptor which adds a visual element to the sentence. It informs us that there's an output coming from the activity of the airplanes. It helps in visually establishing the scene allowing us to imagine the scenario more vividly. 5. Tails: This word tells us where the 'smoke' is emerging from. It's important for understanding the image of the 'airplanes' spewing 'smoke'. This could have been omitted, but including it gives a more precise and complete picture, as the smoke could come from jets or engines, but here, it specifically emerges from the tails of the airplanes. Each salient word serves an important role in providing the necessary information and helping us visualize the scene. Together, they create a vivid image of 'airplanes' that are 'flying' in a 'formation' and 'smoke' is coming from their 'tails'."},{"question":"Faith can be considered as belief that doesn't require evidence. faith doesn't have knowledge as knowledge requires some evidence.is the reasoning for what question and answer pair?","response":"The question and answer pair for this reasoning could be: Question: How does faith differ from knowledge?

Question: If Mona is manipulating carbon atoms in her science lab and she decreases the number of carbon atoms she has to work with, what happens to the number of possible arrangements the carbon atoms can take increase or decrease? Paragraph : A: The more carbon atoms there are, the greater the number of possible arrangements of carbon atoms. Answer:","response":"If Mona is manipulating carbon atoms in her science lab and she decreases the number of carbon atoms she has to work with, the number of possible arrangements the carbon atoms can take will decrease. This conclusion can be drawn from the information provided in the paragraph, which states that \\"the more carbon atoms there are, the greater the number of possible arrangements of carbon atoms.\\" Therefore, if there are fewer carbon atoms, it logically follows that there will be a smaller number of possible arrangements. Carbon atoms can bond together in various ways to form different molecular structures, and the potential for complexity and diversity in these structures increases as more atoms are involved. By decreasing the number of carbon atoms in her experiments, Mona is reducing the opportunities for these atoms to combine in different ways. This reduction in the number of possible arrangements limits the potential outcomes of her experiments and the information she can gather about how carbon atoms behave and interact with each other in different molecular configurations."},{"question":"Sentence 1: \\"The donkey wished a wart on its hind leg would disappear, and it did.\\" Sentence 2: \\"The donkey wished a wart on its hind leg would disappear, and wart did.\\" Is sentence 2 true, based on sentence 1?","response":"Step 1: Understand the context of both sentences. In Sentence 1, the donkey wished for a wart on its hind leg to disappear, and it happened. In Sentence 2, the donkey had the same wish, but the phrasing changed slightly. Step 2: Analyze the wording. In Sentence 1, the subject is \\"the donkey,\\" and the verb is \\"wished.\\" The object of the wish is \\"a wart on its hind leg would disappear.\\" In Sentence 2, the subject is also \\"the donkey,\\" and the verb is \\"wished\\" with the same object. Step 3: Identify what is being questioned. The question asks if Sentence 2 is true based on the information given in Sentence 1. Step 4: Compare and contrast the sentences. The sentences are very similar in context, with the only difference being the way the ending is phrased. In Sentence 1, \\"and it did\\" clearly states the wish was fulfilled, and the wart disappeared. In Sentence 2, \\"and wart did\\" is not as grammatically clear, but we can infer that it means the wart disappeared as well. Step 5: Reach a conclusion. Based on the context and comparison, it is reasonable to conclude that Sentence 2 is true, based on Sentence 1. The donkey wished for the wart to disappear in both sentences, and it is implied that the wish came true in both instances."},{"question":"Came here for drinks.

Movie plot title: Breach Movie plot: Eric O'Neill (Ryan Phillippe) is a young FBI employee assigned to work undercover as a clerk to Robert Hanssen (Chris Cooper), a senior agent he is told is suspected of being a sexual deviant. Hanssen has been recalled from a detail post at the State Department to FBI headquarters ostensibly to head up a new division specializing in Information Assurance. Initially, Hanssen insists on a strict formality between the two men. He frequently rails against the bureaucracy of the FBI and complains that only those who regularly \\"shoot guns\\" are considered for senior positions instead of those, like himself, who are involved in vital national security matters. He calls the bureau's information technology systems antiquated and laments the lack of coordination and information exchange with other intelligence agencies. Eventually, Hanssen becomes a friend and mentor to O'Neill and takes a personal interest in him and his wife Juliana (Caroline Dhavernas), who is suspicious of Hanssen and resents his intrusions. A devout Catholic who is also a member of Opus Dei, Hanssen urges O'Neill, a lapsed Catholic, and his secular East German-born wife to become active churchgoers. O'Neill finds no evidence of Hanssen leading a secret double life and develops a growing respect for his boss, so he confronts his handler in the undercover assignment, Kate Burroughs (Laura Linney), and she admits that the sexual deviance allegations are only a secondary consideration. Hanssen is suspected of spying for the Soviet Union and Russia for years and being responsible for the deaths of agents working for the United States. He learns that FBI Director Louis Freeh is personally leading the investigation. While the FBI could arrest Hanssen under lesser charges, they want to catch him in an act of espionage, so they can threaten him with the death penalty for treason and possibly induce him to divulge the information he has compromised.

This decision aims to ensure there are no misidentifications, allowing grieving families to receive correct information about their lost loved ones. The devastating accident, which shocked the nation, left many casualties. Due to the immense magnitude of the incident and degree of injuries, conventional methods of identification are proving challenging. Thus, the government's decision to resort to DNA testing is being seen as a necessary step in these circumstances. DNA testing will involve collecting samples from the victims and relatives to help in the identification process. This method, albeit time-consuming, is considered the most reliable due to its precision and relatively smaller chances of error. The results from the tests are to confirm the identities of the deceased with certainty and provide some small sense of closure to their distressed families. The country is putting its best foot forward in handling this catastrophe, with teams working around the clock to process the tests as quickly and accurately as possible.

Usage: \\"don't forget to close the windows before you leave the spaceship\\" and \\"don't forget to close the windows before you leave the car\\" are the two natural language statements with similar wording. Both of the statements are about closing the windows before leaving a vehicle. Part #2: Choosing the statement that makes less sense based on common-sense knowledge. Usage: In this example, the statement \\"don't forget to close the windows before you leave the spaceship\\" makes less sense based on common-sense knowledge because spaceships typically do not have windows that can be opened or closed like a car. Therefore, it is less likely for someone to need to close the windows before leaving a spaceship. Part #3: Using \\"first\\" or \\"second\\" to indicate which sentence makes less sense.

Introduction: When diving into the depths of medieval Europe's military history, the 14th century stands out as a period marked by numerous wars and conflicts. Two noteworthy battles that took place during this era are the Battle of Mons-en-Pévèle and the Battle of Zierikzee. Both battles, fought between different groups of European powers, have become defining moments in the history of their respective regions. But which of these two battles occurred first? In this article, we will explore the historical contexts, dates, and outcomes of these two significant events. Step 1: Introduce the Battle of Mons-en-Pévèle The Battle of Mons-en-Pévèle, also known as the Battle of Mont en Pévèle or Pevelenberg, was fought on August 18, 1304. The conflict was part of the Franco-Flemish War (1297-1305), a larger struggle between the Kingdom of France, led by King Philip IV, and the County of Flanders, which at the time was under French rule and seeking independence. Step 2: Outline the context and outcome of the Battle of Mons-en-Pévèle Before the battle, Flanders had experienced a defeat at the Battle of Furnes in 1303, leading to the Flemish Count, Guy of Dampierre, and his allies to regroup and gather more support. The French king, determined to maintain control over Flanders, moved to crush the rebellion once and for all. The battle took place near the village of Mons-en-Pévèle in the County of Flanders (now part of modern-day France) and was a fiercely disputed fight. Both sides suffered heavy casualties, but the French eventually emerged victorious. The outcome of the battle led to the eventual signing of the Treaty of Athis-sur-Orge in 1305, which would put an end to the conflict but harshly limit the liberties and independence of Flanders. Step 3: Introduce the Battle of Zierikzee The Battle of Zierikzee, on the other hand, took place on June 10, 1304. This particular battle was part of the ongoing conflict between the County of Holland, led by Count John II, and the County of Hainaut, led by Count William I. The battle was a significant event during the War of the Flemish Succession (1299-1305). Step 4: Outline the context and outcome of the Battle of Zierikzee The conflict began when John II, who was also the husband of the Flemish countess-in-exile, sought to claim the rights of his wife over the County of Flanders. Count William I of Hainaut resisted this claim, leading to an open confrontation between the two nobles. The Battle of Zierikzee took place near the island of Schouwen in the County of Holland (modern-day Netherlands). The forces of Hainaut, alongside their French allies, fought against the combined armies of Holland and the English, who supported John II's claims to the Flemish territories. The battle ended in a decisive victory for Count William, which further weakened John II's position in the War of the Flemish Succession. Step 5: Compare the dates and determine which battle came first Returning to our initial question, which of these two battles took place first? With the Battle of Mons-en-Pévèle occurring on August 18, 1304, and the Battle of Zierikzee taking place just a couple of months earlier, on June 10, 1304, it is evident that the Battle of Zierikzee came first. Conclusion: In conclusion, when examining the timelines of the Battle of Mons-en-Pévèle and the Battle of Zierikzee during the tumultuous 14th century, we find that the Battle of Zierikzee predates the Battle of Mons-en-Pévèle by approximately two months. It is essential to remember that while these battles were fought over different issues and stakeholders, they were both significant events that shaped the course of regional politics and history in medieval Europe."},{"question":"Lizzy: Tom decides to make lasagna with all his beef.

Me: Hmmm, let me think. I think this is the detailed solution:","response":"To solve this problem, first, we need to determine the total amount of lasagna noodles Tom needs for the 10 pounds of beef. Since it takes twice as many noodles as beef, he will need: 10 pounds of beef * 2 = 20 pounds of lasagna noodles Tom already has 4 pounds of noodles, so he needs to get: 20 pounds (total needed) - 4 pounds (already have) = 16 pounds of lasagna noodles Since lasagna noodles come in 2-pound packages, to find out how many packages he needs to buy, we'll divide the amount of lasagna noodles he still needs to get (16 pounds) by the weight of a single package (2 pounds): 16 pounds / 2 pounds per package = 8 packages So, Tom needs to buy 8 packages of lasagna noodles to make the lasagna with all his 10 pounds of beef."},{"question":"Solve -12*v - 9 - 15 = 0 for v.

We know that rats will navigate mazes for a reward — a pellet of food, say, or a dose of cocaine — but what if the reward of this particular maze is only the promise of a mystery pellet of unknown origin? And what if the rat finds a new mystery pellet every time it successfully navigates the maze, and each pellet offers a clue to where the next pellet will be found? Will the rat keep searching, collecting clues and mystery pellets until it’s exhausted and undernourished? Will this endless flow of pellets and clues about pellets inspire the rat to form a wiki site on the Web, encouraging other rats in the laboratory to list the dimensions and colors and locations of the mystery pellets that they’ve found? Will this wiki site, in turn, encourage the rats to become increasingly obsessed with these mystery pellets, despite the fact that said pellets turn out to have no nutritive or stimulative benefits whatsoever? Now imagine that the lead researcher enters the lab one day and tells all the rats (in rat language) that there is no answer to the mystery-pellet question. All those clues were arbitrarily placed, based on the whims of each lab assistant, and they don’t mean anything. Still, the lead researcher sincerely hopes that all the rats have thoroughly enjoyed their time navigating this maze. Their loyalty and efforts are much appreciated, and they are now free to go about their lives as if none of this ever happened. What will the rats do then? According to many television writers and development executives these days, the rats will happily march right into the next maze. They will search indefinitely for new mystery pellets: for clues that lead to more clues that add up to nothing. All of which explains how “Lost,” that endless, Mister Toad’s Wild Ride-themed jungle maze of empty mystery pellets and trumped-up suspense, continues to leave its toxic stain on current hits like “Homeland” and “American Horror Story” and threatens, even in death, to kill the current golden age of television. I still remember the first time I heard that “Star Wars” killed the golden age of movies back in the 1970s. As someone who saw “The Empire Strikes Back” 12 times in the theater when I was 10 and owned most of the “Star Wars” action figures, I encountered this statement as nothing short of blasphemy. After all, in that summer of “The Empire Strikes Back,” I crafted an ashtray out of clay and painted the words “I (heart) Harrison” across it in honor of my love for the actor behind Han Solo. I didn’t smoke and, of course, had never met Harrison Ford. But my love for “Star Wars” transcended reason. Hearing that “Star Wars” ended an era of cinematic artistry, for me, was like hearing that not only was there no Santa Claus, but the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy went down with him in a horrible sleigh crash. Today, though, it’s clear that the awkward teddy-bear victory dance that wrapped “Return of the Jedi” (Yub nub! Eee chop yub nub!) was a melodic harbinger of bad times to come. Great action movies like “Jaws” and “Raiders of the Lost Ark” would soon be replaced by clumsy, formulaic movies like “Top Gun” and “Tango and Cash” (and not to mention “Jaws IV” and “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull”). Thanks in part to “Star Wars,” the eclecticism and cinematic daring of the ’70s would be crushed under the wheels of blockbuster moviemaking. A similar process is under way in the post- “Lost” television world. The first three seasons of “Lost” may have approached the imaginative charms of the original “Star Wars” trilogy, but the next three were nearly as awful as George Lucas’s catastrophic prequels. You could easily picture the stumped writers of “Lost,” helpless in the face of an ever-growing pile of unsolved mysteries, madly skimming Wikipedia entries on space-time geometries and black holes.

His date grows increasingly bored and disgruntled by Bradley's refusal to leave, until she finally walks out on him, which doesn't bother him in the slightest. An unidentified man sees her leave, and presumably upset over the disrespect shown towards the young woman, he follows Bradley to a bar where he confronts him with a knife. After a brief struggle, Bradley manages to turn the weapon against the man and kills him. Even though he killed in self defense, Bradley immediately flees the scene knowing the Thai authorities will arrest him and probally sentence him to death for the killing as a result of being a foreigner in their country.The next day, Bradley begins his trip deep into the rain forest first by traveling by train to a point several hundred miles north of Bangkok. At the train's stop, John rents a canoe and a guide to take him down a nearby river towards the Burma border. Still fearing that he'll be captured by the Thai authorities, he pays off the man to not mention their encounter. After rowing a ways and taking several wildlife photos, Bradley's guide, Tuan, mentions his concerns about traveling so far down river, which he reports as being dangerous. Bradley agrees to head back after one more day of traveling.That evening, Bradley falls asleep, and when he awakes the next day, he finds Tuan dead with an arrow in his throat. Before he has any chance to escape, a native Thai tribe captures him in a net and carries him to their village. The chief, Luhanà, is told that the group has captured a large fish-man.

We want to find the value of \\"k\\" in the equation: 0 = 16*k + 63 + 17 First, let's add the numbers 63 and 17 together. That gives us: 0 = 16*k + 80 Now, we want to separate the \\"k\\" from the other numbers. To do this, we can subtract 80 from both sides of the equation. That looks like this: 0 - 80 = 16*k + 80 - 80 This simplifies to: -80 = 16*k Now, we want to find the value of \\"k\\". To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 16.

Fleeing, the pair stumble into a house where eight-year-old Phillip Perry (T.J. Lowther) lives with his devout Jehovah's Witness mother and two sisters. Needing a hostage to aid their escape, Butch grabs the boy, who meekly accompanies them. The trio's journey starts off on an unpleasant note as Butch shoots Jerry, following the latter's attempt to molest the child. With his partner out of the way, the convict and his young victim take to the Texas highway in a bid to flee from the pursuing police. Meanwhile, Texas Ranger Red Garnett (Clint Eastwood), riding in the Governor's airstream trailer, is in pursuit. With criminologist Sally Gerber (Laura Dern) and trigger-happy FBI sharpshooter Bobby Lee (Bradley Whitford) in tow, Red is determined to recover the criminal and the hostage before they cross the Texas border. Also, Red reveals to Sally that he has a personal interest in apprehending Butch alive. Even though Butch doesn't realize it, Red has a history with him. When Butch was a teenager, he stole a car, and Red was the arresting officer. Due to his age and it being a first offense, Butch was supposed to get a lenient sentence. Red feared doing so would not teach him anything and would only encourage him to begin a life of crime. He thought that if Butch got a harsher sentence, it would scare him straight, so he bribed the judge to make it happen. Years later, Red has come to realize that the harsher sentence only encouraged the very life of crime he feared would happen. Now, Red is hoping that if he can bring Butch in alive, he can redeem himself for his past mistake. Phillip, eight years old, has never participated in Halloween or Christmas celebrations. Escaping with Butch, however, he experiences a freedom which he finds exhilarating, as Butch gladly allows him the kind of indulgences he has been forbidden all along, including the wearing of a shoplifted...

Start writing your autobiography by conducting research on your own life. Creating a timeline of your life is a good way to make sure you include all the most important dates and events, and it gives you a structure to build upon. You can consider this the \\"brainstorming\\" phase, so don't hesitate to write down everything you can remember, even if you don't think the memory will make it into the final version of the book. Your autobiography doesn't have to begin with your birth. You may want to include some family history as well. Write down information about your ancestry, your grandparents' lives, your parents' lives, and so on. Having information about your family history will help readers get a sense of how you became the person you are. What happened when you were a teenager? What led you to make the decisions you made? Did you go to college? Write about those transitory years, too. Write about your career, your relationships, your children, and any big life-altering events that occurred. Every good story has interesting characters, friends and foes who help move the plot along. Who are the characters in your life? It's a given that your parents will play a role, along with your spouse and other close family members. Think beyond your immediate family to others who have affected your life and should play a role in your autobiography. Teachers, coaches, mentors, and bosses are extremely influential in people's lives. Decide whether someone who has been a role model (or the opposite) for you will figure into your story. Ex-boyfriends and girlfriends might co-star in some interesting stories. What enemies have you had in life? Your story will be boring if you don't include some conflicts. Offbeat characters such as animals, celebrities you've never met, and even cities are often points of interest in an autobiography. The story of your entire life would start to get pretty long-winded, so you'll have to make some decisions about what anecdotes you're going to include. Begin drafting your manuscript by writing out the main stories that will be woven together to create a picture of your life. There are a few main topics that most autobiographies cover since readers find them fascinating. The childhood story. Whether your childhood was happy or traumatic, you should include a few anecdotes that give a picture of who you were and what you experienced at the time. You can tell the story of your childhood by breaking it down into smaller anecdotes that illustrate your personality - your parents' reaction when you brought home a stray dog, the time you climbed out of the window at school and ran away for 3 days, your friendly relationship with a homeless person living in the woods . . . get creative. The coming of age story. This heady and often sensual period in a human's life is always of interest to readers. Remember that it's not about writing something unique; everyone comes of age. It's about writing something that resonates with readers. The falling in love story. You could also write the opposite of this, the never-finding-love story. The identity crisis story. This usually occurs in the 30s or 40s and is sometimes referred to as a mid-life crisis. The story of facing down some force of evil. Whether it's your battle with addiction, a controlling lover, or a madman who tried to kill your family, you've got to write about conflict you've experienced. People read autobiographies to gain insight on what it's like to be someone else. Being authentically you is a sure way to keep people engaged. If your writing is formal and stiff, or if it reads like a college essay instead of an expose on your life, people will have trouble getting through the book. Write as though you're opening your heart to a trusted friend, in prose that's clear, strong and not too cluttered with vocabulary words you rarely use. Write so that your personality is revealed. Are you funny? Intense? Spiritual? Dramatic? Don't hold back; your personality should come through in the way you tell your story. You don't have to be explicit, but it's important to reveal truths about yourself and your life in an autobiography. Don't let the book become a list of your accomplishments, with all the negative material carefully kept under the rug. Present yourself as a whole person, sharing talents and flaws alike, and your readers will be able to identify with you and hopefully root for you as they make their way through your story. Don't always cast yourself in a positive light. You can have foibles and still be the protagonist. Reveal mistakes you've made and times when you've failed yourself and other people. Reveal your inner thoughts. Share your opinions and ideas, including those that may spark controversy. Be true to yourself through your autobiography. How was your story shaped by the moment in history in which it took place? What wars influenced your politics? What cultural events inspired you? Be sure to include a few important dates so readers can understand the sequencing of the events you are describing. Discussing what happened in the world at large during your lifetime is a good way to make your story more relevant and interesting to those reading it.

So, the answer is indeed '160', and the reasoning is as follows: - Colby initially had 60 kilograms of mangoes and sold 20 kilograms leaving 40 kilograms. - He then sold half of the remaining to his community leaving him with 20 kilograms. - Finally, at 8 mangoes per kilogram, Colby has 160 mangoes left."},{"question":"Read the bio below and try to give details on bob kalsu 's: - position - databasefootball - college - death date - draftedyear - draftedround - birth date - playing team - playing years - death place - birth place Bio: james robert \`\` bob '' kalsu -lrb- april 13 , 1945 -- july 21 , 1970 -rrb- was an all-american tackle at the university of oklahoma and an eighth-round draft pick by the buffalo bills of the american football league in 1968 . kalsu was a starting guard in 1968 . he played the entire season and was the bills ' team rookie-of-the-year . following the 1968 season , to satisfy his reserve officers ' training corps -lrb- rotc -rrb- obligation , he entered the army as a second lieutenant and arrived in vietnam in november 1969 as part of the 101st airborne division . he was killed in action on july 21 , 1970 when his unit came under enemy mortar fire at fsb ripcord near the a shau valley . his family , out of respect , refused to talk in detail about the circumstances surrounding his death . lieutenant kalsu had one child , a daughter named jill . at home in oklahoma city , his wife , jan kalsu , gave birth to his son , james robert kalsu jr. , on july 23 . mrs. kalsu was informed of her husband 's death only hours later . kalsu and former cleveland brown don steinbrunner were the only professional football players to lose their lives in the vietnam war .

This will help you find a dog bed that will be comfortable for her as she sleeps. Pay close attention to your dog's body language as she sleeps.","response":"As you observe your dog's body language while she sleeps, take note of her favorite sleeping positions and whether she prefers a soft or firm surface. Does she like to curl up in a ball, stretch out, or rest her head on a raised edge? These observations will give you insight into the type of bed characteristics she might find most comfortable. Once you have a good understanding of your dog's sleeping preferences, start researching dog beds that match those characteristics. There are a variety of dog bed styles available, including orthopedic beds, heated beds, donut-shaped beds, and even cave-style beds. Making a well-informed decision on the right bed for your dog will ensure her comfort and increase the likelihood that she will willingly sleep in her bed rather than yours. When choosing a location for the new dog bed, consider placing it near your bed or in a spot where your dog feels secure and comfortable. This will make the transition from your bed to her bed easier and help her associate her new bed with a positive and familiar environment. Introduce the new dog bed to your dog during a time when she is calm and relaxed. Encourage her to explore and use the bed by placing a favorite toy or blanket on the bed to attract her attention. Provide plenty of praise when she shows interest in her new bed, reinforcing the idea that the bed is a positive place for her. Create a bedtime routine to help your dog adjust to her new sleeping arrangement. This routine may include taking her for a walk, having a few minutes of playtime, and giving her a treat before she goes to sleep. Make sure to encourage her to settle into her own bed during this routine, using verbal cues such as \\"bedtime\\" or \\"go to your bed.\\" Be patient and consistent while your dog gets accustomed to her new bed. It might take some time for her to break the habit of sleeping in your bed, so it's important to be persistent and reinforce the idea that her bed is the designated sleeping place. During this transition period, it is essential to prevent your dog from returning to your bed. If she tries to jump up onto your bed, gently guide her back to her own bed using verbal cues and praise. If necessary, consider using baby gates or other barriers to restrict her access to your bed during the initial stages of her adjustment. Reward your dog with treats and praise whenever she chooses to sleep in her own bed. Positive reinforcement will help her form a strong association between her bed and pleasant experiences, making her more willing to use her bed for sleeping. As your dog becomes consistently comfortable sleeping in her own bed, you can begin gradually increasing the distance between the two beds, ultimately creating a separate sleeping area for her. This step will help her become more independent while still maintaining the bond you two share. Overall, helping your dog stop sleeping in your bed involves understanding her sleeping preferences, finding the right bed, creating a bedtime routine, utilizing positive reinforcement, and being patient and consistent. With time and dedication, your dog will eventually become comfortable sleeping in her bed, leading to more restful nights for both of you."},{"question":"Read the following article and answer the question. Article: There was once a lonely girl who longed so much for love. One day while she was walking in the woods she found two starving songbirds. She took them home and put them in a small cage, caring them with love. Luckily, the birds grew strong little by little. Every morning they greeted her with a wonderful song. The girl felt great love for the birds. One day the girl left the door to the cage open accidentally. The larger and stronger of the two birds flew from the cage. The girl was so frightened that he would fly away. So as he flew close, she grasped him wildly. Her heart felt glad at her success in capturing him. Suddenly, she felt the bird go weak, so she opened her hand and stared in horror at the dead bird. It was her desperate love that had killed him. She noticed the other bird moving back and forth on the edge of the cage. She could feel his strong desire--needing to fly into the clear, blue sky. Unwillingly, she lifted him from the cage and threw him softly into the air. The lucky bird circled once, twice, three times. The girl watched delightedly at the bird. Her heart was no longer concerned with her loss. What she wanted to see was that the bird could fly happily. Suddenly the bird flew closer and landed softly on her shoulder. It sang the sweetest tune that she had ever heard. Remember, the fastest way to lose love is to hold on it too tight; the best way to keep love is to give it wings! Question: What can we learn from the passage? Answer: Answer:","response":"We can learn from the passage that holding on to love too tightly can be detrimental, and it is important to give love the freedom it needs to grow and flourish.

The men, who have British, Filipino, Taiwanese and Slovak citizenship, were being flown to New York to face charges, according to a source. Thai authorities announced the arrests after the men were turned over to U.S. authorities. A U.S. law enforcement official said the charges would be made public soon. The men are part of a broader investigation that federal prosecutors made public in September, filing charges against a group of former U.S. and European ex-military men in a murder-for-hire and drug-importation plot. The Drug Enforcement Administration concocted a sting operation and arrested Joseph Hunter, a former U.S. Army sniper trainer nicknamed Rambo, and four others in the sting case. The five more recently arrested were expelled by Thai authorities and put on a DEA plane to New York. Additional details of the charges couldn't be learned because they remain under seal. Drug trafficking from North Korea has occurred for decades with at least 50 documented incidents. In previous years, North Korea had been linked to shipments of heroin and methamphetamine, according to the CIA World Factbook. In 2003, a North Korean ship, Pong Su which was carrying nearly 300 pounds of heroin, was seized along the eastern coast of Australia after a four-day chase. There isn't enough information to determine whether the North Korean government is currently involved in drug trafficking, according to the 2013 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report issued by the U.S. State Department. \\"There have been no confirmed reports of large-scale drug trafficking involving DPRK (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) state entities since 2004,\\" it stated. \\"This suggests that state-sponsored drug trafficking may have ceased or been sharply reduced, or that the DPRK regime has become more adept at concealing state-sponsored trafficking of illicit drugs.\\" The report also highlighted that the \\"proximity and availability of precursor chemicals in China likely contribute to the production of methamphetamine within North Korea.\\" It alluded to reported transactions between North Korean traffickers and organized crime groups. Corrupt security agents and government officials are likely responsible for transnational drug operations, according to a different report published in North Korean Review in 2010. There is great difficulty in collecting data or accurate information regarding drug trafficking because of the secrecy in North Korea. So the report's authors, Minwoo Yun and Eunyoung Kim relied on interviews with 28 North Korean defectors living in China and Thailand as well as various documents. They could not be reached Wednesday for this story. Their report alleges that in the 1980s, the North Korean state \\"deliberately chose various transnational crime businesses including drug trafficking\\" during economically troubled times. The North Koreans specialized in heroin trade and kept the drug away from the ordinary population. Once the economy veered into famine and economic disaster in the 1990s, individuals desperate to survive turned to private drug enterprise, according to Yun and Kim's report. Corrupt agents and officials sold drugs to transnational organized crime operations through the North Korea-China border, they wrote. Family members also became private drug traffickers, they added. After poppy production failed due to weather, methamphetamine became more popular, according to a 2007 Drug Trafficking and North Korea report prepared for the U.S. Congress. One of the interviewees in Yun and Kim's report said that the city of Hamhueng is the center of methamphetamine production, because it produces the country's chemicals. Internally, North Koreans started using opium instead of hard-to-obtain and pricey medication, according to the report. And recreational drug users are more likely wealthy businessmen or members of the Party, according to South Korean media. More recently, methamphetamine is more widely used in North Korea as stricter China border controls forced drug producers to seek a local market for \\"ice,\\" according to a report in the Spring 2013 edition of the journal North Korean Review.

Context: Twentieth Century Fox Television (TCFTV, stylized as 20th Century Fox Television) is the television production subsidiary of 20th Century Fox, and a production arm of the Fox Television Group (both are owned by Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox). 20th Television is the syndication and distribution arm of 20th Century Fox Television. Hypothesis: TCFTV is owned by Rupert Murdoch.","response":"Yes, from the given context, we can draw the hypothesis that Twentieth Century Fox Television (TCFTV), stylized as 20th Century Fox Television, is owned by Rupert Murdoch. To provide a more detailed explanation: The context states that Twentieth Century Fox Television is the television production subsidiary of 20th Century Fox. This means that TCFTV operates as a branch or division under 20th Century Fox, which primarily focuses on television production. It is also specified that TCFTV is a production arm of Fox Television Group. Here, a production arm refers to a unit that is responsible for producing content. In this case, TCFTV produces television content for Fox Television Group. The Fox Television Group, in turn, is owned by Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox. Therefore, since TCFTV is a subsidiary of 20th Century Fox and a part of the Fox Television Group, it can be inferred that Rupert Murdoch has ownership over TCFTV through his ownership of 21st Century Fox. Additionally, the context outlines that 20th Television, which is distinct from TCFTV, is the syndication and distribution arm of 20th Century Fox Television. This further highlights the connection between TCFTV and Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox, as both TCFTV and 20th Television have related functions and fall under the same corporate umbrella."},{"question":"Consider the question.

Reasoning: The premise provides three main pieces of information about the dog: its color (brown and white), its behavior (growling), and its environment (in the snow). The hypothesis focuses on two of these pieces of information, describing the dog's color (brown and white) and its environment (in the snow outdoors). Since both of these details are present in the premise, we can conclude that they are also true for the hypothesis. The fact that the dog is growling in the premise does not contradict the hypothesis. The hypothesis simply omits this piece of information, but it does not negate it. So, the hypothesis about the brown and white dog in the snow outdoors is still entailed by the premise."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Liquid water is a fluid. The hydrogen bonds in liquid water constantly break and reform as the water molecules tumble past one another. As water cools, its molecular motion slows and the molecules move gradually closer to one another. The density of any liquid increases as its temperature decreases. For most liquids, this continues as the liquid freezes and the solid state is denser than the liquid state. However, water behaves differently. It actually reaches its highest density at about 4°C. I am facing a new situation today: Steve and Chris sit down at a new cafe that just opened up in town after hearing rave reviews of it at work. They look at the menus trying to decide what to order when a waiter shows up and asks if they would like anything to drink. Steve says he would like a glass of water that has molecules far apart. Chris orders water with molecules closer together. The waiter looks at them with a rather confused look and asks them to please elaborate. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Whose cup of water is more dense? A:","response":"A: Chris's cup of water is more dense. This is because, as mentioned in the background article, the density of any liquid increases as its temperature decreases. When water cools down, its molecular motion slows down and its molecules gradually move closer to one another. Water behaves differently from most liquids, as its highest density is reached at about 4°C. In the given situation, Steve orders water with molecules far apart, which implies that the water molecules have more space between them. This would be characteristic of water at higher temperatures, as the molecules will have more energy and be further away from each other. On the other hand, Chris orders water with molecules closer together. This means he is asking for water at a lower temperature, as water's density increases when its temperature decreases and its molecules come closer. Since Chris's water has molecules closer together, it implies that his cup of water has a higher density than Steve's cup of water, which has molecules further apart. Hence, Chris's cup of water is more dense."},{"question":"Determine if the sentence is true based on the text below: the film stars brad pitt 2 Cool 2 Be 4gotten is a 2016 Filipino coming-of-age drama film directed by Petersen Vargas in his feature-length directorial debut and written by Jason Paul Laxamana.

The total amount of rain in the first two hours is 22 inches. How much did it rain in the first hour?. Me: Hmmm, let me think. I think this is the detailed solution:","response":"Yes, let's break down the problem and solve it step-by-step. 1. Let's use variables to represent the unknown values. Let x be the amount of rain in inches in the first hour. Then, the second hour would have 2x + 7 inches of rain (7 inches more than twice the amount it rained in the first hour). 2. Now, we know that the total amount of rain in the first two hours is 22 inches. We can express this with an equation: x + (2x + 7) = 22 3. Next, we can simplify the equation by adding the like terms: 3x + 7 = 22 4. To isolate 3x, we can subtract 7 from both sides of the equation: 3x = 15 5. Finally, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 3: x = 5 So, it rained 5 inches in the first hour."},{"question":"Given the sentence \\"Bull rider on the ground.\\" is it true that \\"The person fell off the bull.\\"? Let's be accurate as possible and think first.","response":"To accurately answer whether \\"The person fell off the bull\\" is true based on the sentence \\"Bull rider on the ground,\\" let's break down the information provided step-by-step: 1. The subject of the sentence is \\"bull rider,\\" which implies a person who rides bulls, typically in a sport or rodeo context. 2. The location of the bull rider is \\"on the ground,\\" meaning the person is not currently on the bull. From these two pieces of information, we can infer that the bull rider is no longer on the bull. However, the sentence does not explicitly state that the person fell off the bull. The bull rider could have voluntarily dismounted or been on the ground before attempting to mount the bull. In conclusion, it is plausible but not definitively confirmed that \\"The person fell off the bull\\" based on the given sentence. The sentence suggests that the bull rider is no longer on the bull, but the exact reason they are on the ground remains unspecified."},{"question":"Q: Who has the record for scoring the most goals in single season?

This was also the first time Brady played the 49ers in San Francisco, as he missed the Patriots' trip to Candlestick Park in 2008 as a result of an injury. After a 49ers three-and-out, Amendola returned the punt 30 yards to the 49ers 27. Six plays later, Brady hit Edelman on a 7-yard touchdown pass, but Gostkowski missed the extra point. The 49ers drove all the way to the Patriots 6 on their next drive, but Hightower sacked Colin Kaepernick for a 9-yard loss on 3rd-down and they were forced to settle for a 33-yard field goal by Phil Dawson. The Patriots countered on their next drive, racing 77 yards in just 6 plays, scoring on Brady's 9-yard touchdown pass to James White, increasing the lead to 13-3. Two possessions later, the 49ers raced 92 yards in just over four minutes, scoring on an 18-yard touchdown catch by Vance McDonald, trimming the deficit to 13-10. After both teams punted, the Patriots drove to the 49ers 41, but White couldn't get out of bounds in time after a 25-yard catch, and the Patriots led 13-10 at halftime. After the first four possessions of the second half ended in punts, the Patriots marched 80 yards in 10 plays, scoring on Brady's 5-yard connection to Amendola, increasing the lead to 20-10. Three possessions later, Brady found Mitchell for a 56-yard touchdown pass as Brady was falling down, capping off a 70-yard drive, upping the lead to 27-10. After a 49ers three-and-out, the Patriots kept pouring it on, driving all the way to the 49ers 20, and Gostkowski added a 38-yard field goal, widening the lead to 30-10. The Niners marched 75 yards on their next drive, scoring on Kaepernick's 13-yard touchdown pass to Shaun Draughn, trimming the deficit to 30-17. Amendola recovered the ensuing onside kick and the Patriots ran out the rest of the clock to end the game. The Patriots improved to 8-2. Running back LeGarrette Blount had a big day as he rushed for a total of 125 yards on 19 carries. In addition, Tom Brady also had a big day passing for a total of 4 touchdowns against the 49ers. This was also Brady's 199th career win (regular season and postseason combined), tied with Brett Favre for second place. Answer this question: How many yards did LeGarrette Blount average over the course of the game?","response":"LeGarrette Blount had a total of 125 yards on 19 carries during the game. To find out his average yards per carry, we can divide the total yards by the number of carries: 125 yards / 19 carries = 6.57894737 yards per carry So, LeGarrette Blount averaged approximately 6.58 yards per carry over the course of the game."},{"question":"Given the question: Generate a 2-star review (1 being lowest and 5 being highest) about an app with package com.google.android.gms. The answer is:","response":"Title: Disappointing Experience with com.google.android.gms App Review: I had high expectations from the com.google.android.gms app, given the Google brand name and reputation. Unfortunately, my experience with this app can only be described as a 2-star ordeal. There are multiple reasons for my dissatisfaction, and I will outline them below. Firstly, the user interface appears cluttered and disorganized. Navigating through the app proved challenging. I struggled to locate essential features and settings, which should ideally be easy to access in any modern app design. The poor font choices and ineffective use of colors worsened the experience. Google has created some fantastic, user-friendly interfaces in the past, so this app feels like a subpar effort. Secondly, the performance of the app leaves much to be desired. Despite using a relatively new smartphone, the app consistently crashed and froze, sometimes taking minutes just to load a single screen. This level of lag severely impacted the usability of the app, leaving me frustrated and feeling like I was working with a piece of outdated technology. Moreover, the app drained my smartphone's battery at an alarming rate. In just a couple of hours, the battery life was drastically reduced by 20% when using com.google.android.gms. I believe it is a poorly optimized application, as other high-performance apps do not demonstrate the same issue. Another major drawback of the com.google.android.gms app is the lack of clear instructions and useful help guides. Even after researching the app further and seeking help from online sources, I still found it difficult to grasp the purpose and functionality of certain features. The lack of user documentation negatively impacted my experience and left me uncertain about several aspects of the app. Finally, despite having allowed all necessary permissions, the app's syncing and connectivity were temperamental. My data would occasionally fail to synchronize across devices, and my account wouldn't always recognize my actions on other platforms. I experienced frequent connection dropouts, rendering the app nearly useless at times. In conclusion, I cannot provide a higher rating for the com.google.android.gms app, as my experience has been plagued by poor performance, battery drain issues, inadequate documentation, and frustrating connection problems. Improvement is necessary in various aspects of the app's design and functionality, as it currently does not meet Google's high standards. To anyone considering using this app, I would advise checking out alternatives or waiting for an updated version that resolves these ongoing issues."},{"question":"Given the question: Build a movie plot around this: Hamelin is far enough away from where to avoid blast damage?

The protagonist, Sam, is a gifted violinist and Hamelin inhabitant with an unfulfilled desire for adventure. He has spent his entire life within the town's borders, captivated and soothed by its mysterious enigmatic melodies that echo through the streets. Unbeknownst to Sam and the other inhabitants, these melodies serve a much greater purpose than mere beauty – they are part of an ancient pact that keeps Hamelin safe from the impending doom that awaits the outside world. One day, an ominous message is intercepted by the U.S. government, which reveals plans for an imminent nuclear attack in San Francisco. The attack, if successful, would have a disastrous impact on the world as a whole and would surely propel it into irreversible chaos. The news of the attack reaches Hamelin, leaving Sam with a deep yearning to help the city but unsure of his admittance. As the panic escalates, the town's elders reveal that Hamelin is much more than a serene sanctuary. It serves as the global headquarters for an ancient order that holds the key to preventing worldwide cataclysms. Embedded within the music of Hamelin is a potent force that, if channeled correctly, can neutralize even the most potent weapons. Sam, with his musical prowess, is chosen by the order as their last ray of hope. Together with a ragtag team of skilled companions, Sam embarks on a perilous mission to San Francisco to locate and disarm the warhead before it can be detonated. Along the journey, Sam must hone his abilities and reconcile with his own self-doubt to save the city he loves. As they draw closer to the warhead and the countdown commences, Sam's musical gift finds new heights as he pieces together an ancient melody specifically designed to shatter and disable the weapon. In an adrenaline-fuelled climax, Sam and his team race against the clock to reach the warhead just in time. Sam, under immense pressure and with mere seconds to spare, plays the powerful melody on his violin. As the final note rings out, the warhead crumbles before their eyes, rendering it inert and saving millions of lives. As they return to their beloved haven of Hamelin, Sam and his companions are hailed as heroes. They have not only saved San Francisco but preserved the equilibrium of the entire world. And, most importantly, Hamelin remains untouched, safe within its cocoon of melodies and protected from the blast damage that could have brought about its own destruction."},{"question":"Given a sentence in the Central Khmer, provide an equivalent translation in Japanese that retains the same meaning through the translation.

This method ensures that the dishwasher is operating at its optimal efficiency, conserving both water and energy. There are several reasons why filling the dishwasher to max is a more sustainable practice compared to filling it only halfway: 1. Efficient use of water: Dishwashers are designed to clean a specific number of dishes per load. When the dishwasher is filled to its maximum capacity, it can clean all the dishes in that load with the same amount of water that it would use to clean an underfilled load. By filling it halfway, you essentially double the water needed to clean the same number of dishes as with a full load. 2. Energy conservation: Along with water, dishwashers also consume energy to heat the water and dry the dishes. When the dishwasher is filled to max, it maximizes the number of dishes cleaned per energy unit, reducing the overall energy consumption. On the other hand, operating the dishwasher half-filled doubles the energy consumption for the same amount of dishes cleaned. 3. Time efficiency: A dishwasher's cycle typically takes over an hour to complete. By filling the dishwasher to its maximum capacity, you optimize the amount of time spent on cleaning dishes. Running the dishwasher half-filled means you would have to run it twice to clean the same number of dishes, doubling the time spent doing the chore. 4. Detergent use: Dishwasher detergents are harmful to the environment, and minimizing their use is essential for reducing pollution. Filling the dishwasher to max ensures that you use the least amount of detergent needed to clean the dishes, reducing detergent residue entering the water system. 5. Cost-effectiveness: By using the dishwasher to its full capacity, you save on water, energy, and detergent costs. This helps households save money that can be used to invest in other sustainable practices or products. In conclusion, filling the dishwasher to its maximum capacity before using is the most sustainable and eco-friendly practice among the given options. By ensuring that the dishwasher is operated with maximum efficiency, you contribute to reducing water wastage, conserving energy, and minimizing pollution. This practice also saves time and money, making it the best choice for households conscious of their environmental impact."},{"question":"Options are: (1). Send e-mails to his friends; (2).

Copyright © 2016 Albuquerque Journal The official seal of the University of New Mexico featuring a Spanish conquistador and a frontiersman – a mark affixed on diplomas and used as a backdrop for UNM events for 46 years – has come under fire from Native American students who say it glorifies the violent European treatment of natives. The protesters want the seal – whose roots can be traced to the university’s fourth president, Edward Dundas McQueen Gray, and was most recently updated in 1969 – relegated to the dustbin of history. They have gone so far as to design a protest version with a conquistador and frontiersman standing atop a mountain of skulls and ribcages with the current seal in the background. Red capital letters superimposed on the image read, “What Indians?” The Kiva Club, a Native American student group, and The Red Nation, a Native American advocacy group, say the current seal is offensive. UNM President Bob Frank said many people are attached to the seal, given its long history, but that he’s open to hearing the students’ rationale for changing it. “It’s a seal I have always known,” said Frank, who earned several degrees from UNM in the 1970s. “I certainly understand that people may have different points of view. If they want to talk about it, I am open to the conversation.” The protest seal is the creation of Nick Estes, a doctoral student and a member of the Oceti Sakowin tribe in South Dakota. He and others say the current seal is emblematic of deeper-seated racism at UNM. “I saw it, and I was like, ‘Is this really true?’ ” Estes said at a planning meeting of students and others looking to abolish the seal. “This is my interpretation of what that actually means. I actually couldn’t believe it. I didn’t actually think that this was a real thing that the University of New Mexico would be doing.” The issue isn’t limited to UNM. Last year, there were protesters at Fiestas de Santa Fe, a historical re-enactment that features Don Diego de Vargas “peacefully” reclaiming the city of Santa Fe following the Pueblo Revolt of 1680. Protesters said the fiesta glazes over the violent history between colonists and Native Americans. And in 1998, a statue in Alcalde of conquistador Juan de Oñate was the target of vandals who sawed off the statue’s right foot. Oñate may be most infamously known for the punishment he ordered after the battle of Acoma, which was for every man between the age of 12 and 25 to have a portion of his right foot amputated. When the vandals removed the statue’s foot, they left a note saying, “We took the liberty of removing Oñate’s right foot on behalf of our brothers and sisters of Acoma Pueblo.” Student petition The students are circulating a petition to “minimize the dehumanization of Natives on campus.” As of Friday afternoon, a little more than 100 people had signed it, according to an online copy of the petition available on change.org. “UNM has one of the highest populations of Native students in the Western Hemisphere currently,” the petition reads. “Its seal continues to make a mockery of its Native students and the surrounding Native community.” They also want UNM administrators to build a Native American cultural center. And they said that at least one member of the Board of Regents should be Native American. That decision is up to Gov. Susana Martinez, who appoints regents to the board. Greg Cajete has overseen the Native American studies program since 2001, and he said his students have often raised protests over the seal’s imagery. Cajete, who hails from the northern New Mexico pueblo of Santa Clara, declined to take a position but said he believes it will remain an issue for future students. “It warrants being looked into,” Cajete said. “What its resolution is going to be, that’s up to what people come up with. From my perspective, the University of New Mexico does need to reflect all of the cultures of New Mexico in a positive way.” Up to the regents The official seal is one of many images used to represent the state’s flagship university. But unlike the Lobo mascot used for athletics or the logo featuring Mesa Vista Hall, it requires a vote by the Board of Regents to change it. The president’s office, the university’s office of the secretary and the Board of Regents use the seal on official documents. The seal is also stamped on students’ diplomas. Estes said he and other indigenous students shouldn’t have a “racist” seal marking their academic achievements. “To have this on my diploma is an insult of the highest order,” Estes said. Conversation about the seal has spread to other student groups. Cheyenne Trujillo, president of Chicano/a Studies Student Organization, said her group has discussed the seal and its history but hasn’t decided if it will support the petition. Trujillo said the group is split between those who feel the seal is offensive and should be changed and those who feel that changing the seal would be ignoring New Mexico’s troubled history, an opinion Trujillo shares. “Getting rid of the seal says it never happened,” Trujillo said. Though the students haven’t filed an official complaint with the university, administrators have started to respond to their concerns. Jozi de Leon, vice president for equity and inclusion, attended a meeting where the students discussed their problems with the seal. She said she will work with the students to get their message to other university officials. De Leon said the university’s diversity council, a group of faculty, staff and students focused on diversity on campus, will support the students’ efforts in the future. “This is a university,” de Leon said. “This is the place where we should be having this kind of dialogue. We should be open to listening to the concerns of the students.” ||||| This undated photo shows the University of New Mexicoâ€™s official seal, depicting a Spanish conquistador and a frontiersman, that is drawing accusations of racism from Native American students.

So, to convey the entire concept of \\"Social service records (welfare, Medicaid, etc.)\\", you could say: \\"Registros de servicios sociales (bienestar social, Medicaid, etc.)\\". Let's break down the translation: 1. \\"Registros\\": The term \\"registros\\" refers to records or documentation in Spanish. It maintains the same context as in English when speaking about various types of stored data or archived information. 2. \\"de servicios sociales\\": The phrase \\"de servicios sociales\\" translates to \\"of social services\\" in English. When combined with \\"registros\\", it conveys the meaning of records belonging to social services. 3. \\"(bienestar social, Medicaid, etc.)\\": In this part of the phrase, the specific examples of social services (welfare and Medicaid) have been translated. \\"Bienestar social\\" is the Spanish term for welfare programs and services that aim to provide for the well-being of citizens in need. \\"Medicaid\\", on the other hand, remains the same in Spanish. The \\"etc.\\" abbreviation is also utilized in Spanish and can be used in the same context to denote that there are more services or examples beyond those mentioned. So, when discussing \\"Social service records (welfare, Medicaid, etc.)\\" with a Spanish-speaking audience, you can use the phrase: \\"Registros de servicios sociales (bienestar social, Medicaid, etc.)\\".

You have to slow down, which misses the entire point of the game. This is the only DS game I've played that has any trouble telling where you've tapped.There are similar interface, gameplay, and AI glitches in all four games.Don't bother with this one -- your money is better spent elsewhere. Answer:","response":"Based on the information provided in the product review, it is quite clear that this review is negative. There are several reasons to support this conclusion: 1. The title of the review itself - \\"Too buggy\\" - is a strong indication that the reviewer has experienced issues with the product that negatively impacted their experience. 2. The reviewer explicitly mentions the cartridge being \\"riddled with bugs.\\" They discuss how these bugs affect gameplay and user experience, specifically in Boggle, wherein approximately 20% of the users' stylus taps are mis-registered. This negatively affects the gameplay, as the user is forced to slow down, taking away from the essence of the game. 3. The reviewer states that this is the only DS game they have played that has issues with determining the location of taps, which implies that they deem the game to be of lower quality compared to other games they have played on the platform. 4. The review also highlights \\"similar interface, gameplay, and AI glitches in all four games\\" present in the cartridge. This further emphasizes the negative experience the reviewer has had with the product. 5. Lastly, the review concludes with a strong recommendation against purchasing the product, asserting that potential buyers' money would be better spent on other games. In summary, the product review is undoubtedly negative, as it discusses various bugs and glitches that impact gameplay, as well as a poor user interface and AI experience.

Note that sometimes, more than one option can answer the question correctly and completely. In those cases, please generate all such options separated by a comma (e.g. \\"A, B\\" is a valid answer). Do not generate anything else apart from one or more of the following characters: 'A', 'B, 'C', 'D', etc. Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Paragraph- Sent 1: In 1863, Alexander II re-convened the Diet of Finland and initiated several reforms increasing Finland's autonomy from Russia including establishment of its own currency, the markka. Sent 2: Liberation of business led to increased foreign investment and industrial development. Sent 3: Finland also got its first railways, separately established under Finnish administration. Sent 4: Finally, the elevation of Finnish from a language of the common people to a national language equal to Swedish opened opportunities for a larger proportion of the society. Sent 5: Alexander II is still regarded as \\"The Good Tsar\\" in Finland. Sent 6: These reforms could be seen as results of a genuine belief that reforms were easier to test in an underpopulated, homogeneous country, than in the whole of Russia. Sent 7: They may also be seen as a reward for the loyalty of its relatively western-oriented population during the Crimean War and during the Polish uprising. Sent 8: Encouraging Finnish nationalism and language can also be seen as an attempt to dilute ties with Sweden. Question: In what year did Alexander II liberate business in Finland? (A) 1863 (B) Decade after 1863 (C) A few years before 1863. Student:","response":"Part #1: Grasping the task Usage: You need to list all the correct answer options with their associated letters. Understand that sometimes more than one option answers the question correctly and completely. Example: \\"A, B\\" can be a valid answer. This meets the criteria because it follows the requirement of listing multiple correct answers with their associated letters, separated by a comma. Part #2: Reading the paragraph for information Usage: Read the given paragraph and pay attention to all the details and relevant information. Example: The student should read Sentences 1 to 8 to find the information needed to answer the question about Alexander II and the liberation of business in Finland. Part #3: Analyzing the question Usage: Understand the specific question being asked and what information you need to find in the paragraph. Example: The question asks, \\"In what year did Alexander II liberate business in Finland?\\" This means the student needs to find details about the liberation of business and a specific year in the paragraph. Part #4: Identifying the correct answer options Usage: Locate the relevant information in the paragraph that answers the question and match it to the answer options. Example: In Sent 2, it states, \\"Liberation of business led to increased foreign investment and industrial development.\\" Since Sent 1 states that Alexander II re-convened the Diet of Finland in 1863, we can deduce that the liberation of business occurred around the same time. Thus, the correct answer is (A) 1863. Part #5: Providing the answer Usage: Give the answer by listing the correct answer option(s) with their associated letter(s). Example: The student should answer, \\"A\\" as it is the correct option, stating the year when Alexander II liberated business in Finland."},{"question":"Q: Read the following context and answer the question.

He was an absolute delight to work with…very solicitous of his wife all throughout, very cooperative with the staff, and very appreciative of the help we were giving the mother-to-be. The background was that after 7 years of marriage, and 2 tragic miscarriages, THIS pregnancy had come to full term, and the child—deliberately they did NOT want to know the gender—was healthy, and both “mom” and “dad” were excited about the upcoming birth. The child finally emerged, the MD held up the child, and “dad” blurted out “It’s a girl!! You wanted a girl!!! Oh my God, she’s beautiful!!” Then he buried his face on his wife’s shoulder and was sobbing for pure joy. The MD quickly put him to work…he was to cut the umbilical cord. “I’m not going to hurt her, am I??” MD assured him no, he wouldn’t. He made the cut, and came immediately over to the wife…”Honey…are you all right?? I didn’t hurt you??”” While the his daughter was being bathed and checked out by the APGAR nurse, he excited called out the various observations—she as healthy..she was pinking up…she was so beautiful “I can’t believe it.” When the nurse returned the little girl to “mom”, the three of them cuddled together, tears just pouring from his eyes…and we in the birthing suite were all getting teary-eyed ourselves.

Answer:","response":"To answer this question, we need to discuss two key elements: the Pacific Coast League (PCL) Manager of the Year Award and the first winner's playing position in Major League Baseball (MLB). The Pacific Coast League (PCL) is a minor league in professional baseball that operates in the western, midwestern, and southeastern United States. The PCL is a part of the Triple-A level in the MiLB hierarchy, which means it is just one step below the Major League Baseball competition. The PCL Manager of the Year Award is presented annually to recognize the best manager in the league for his outstanding leadership, teamwork, and overall performance in leading his team throughout the season. The inaugural Pacific Coast League Manager of the Year Award was given in 1957. The first winner of this award was Lefty O'Doul, who managed the San Francisco Seals to an impressive 101-67 win-loss record in the PCL. He proved to be an excellent leader and greatly contributed to the team's success that season. Now to address the second part of the question, we need to look into Lefty O'Doul's Major League Baseball playing career. O'Doul began his MLB career as a pitcher in 1919 but eventually transitioned to become an outfielder due to his remarkable batting abilities. He played for the New York Yankees, Boston Red Sox, New York Giants, and Brooklyn Dodgers during his MLB career that spanned from 1919 to 1934. As an outfielder, Lefty O'Doul showcased an exceptional offensive game, including a .349 career batting average and winning two batting titles. In summary, the first winner of the Pacific Coast League Manager of the Year Award was Lefty O'Doul, who initially began his career as a pitcher and subsequently transitioned to play as an outfielder in Major League Baseball. His notable achievements as an MLB player and his outstanding management skills in the PCL proved him to be a versatile and talented figure in the world of professional baseball."},{"question":"Q:Information: - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\". - Salamandridae is a family of salamanders consisting of true salamanders and newts. Currently, 74 species (with more expected) have been identified in the Northern Hemisphere - Europe, Asia, the northern tip of Africa, and North America. Salamandrids are distinguished from other salamanders by the lack of rib or costal grooves along the sides of their bodies and by their rough skin. - The Bosphorus (or ) or Bosporus (\\"Bósporos\\" ) is a narrow, natural strait and an internationally significant waterway located in northwestern Turkey. It forms part of the continental boundary between Europe and Asia, and separates Asian Turkey from European Turkey. The world's narrowest strait used for international navigation, the Bosphorus connects the Black Sea with the Sea of Marmara, and, by extension via the Dardanelles, the Aegean and Mediterranean Seas. - Turkey, officially the Republic of Turkey (Turkish: ), is a transcontinental country in Eurasia, mainly in Anatolia in Western Asia, with a smaller portion on the Balkan peninsula in Southeast Europe. Turkey is a democratic, secular, unitary, parliamentary republic with a diverse cultural heritage. Turkey is bordered by eight countries: Greece to the west; Bulgaria to the northwest; Georgia to the northeast; Armenia, the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan and Iran to the east; and Iraq and Syria to the south. The Aegean Sea is to the west, the Black Sea to the north, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. The Bosphorus, the Sea of Marmara, and the Dardanelles, which together form the Turkish Straits, divide Thrace and Anatolia; they also separate Europe and Asia. Turkey's location has given it geopolitical and strategic importance throughout history. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - The Sea of Marmara, also known as the Sea of Marmora or the Marmara Sea, and in the context of classical antiquity as the Propontis, is the inland sea, entirely within the borders of Turkey, that connects the Black Sea to the Aegean Sea, thus separating Turkey's Asian and European parts. The Bosphorus strait connects it to the Black Sea and the Dardanelles strait to the Aegean Sea. The former also separates Istanbul into its Asian and European sides. The sea has an area of 11,350 km² (280 km x 80 km) with the greatest depth reaching . - Thrace (Modern , \\"Thráke\\" \\"Trakiya\\") is a historical and geographic area in southeast Europe, centered on the modern borders of Bulgaria, Greece, and Turkey. In antiquity, it was also referred to as Europe, prior to the extension of the term to describe the whole continent. As a geographical concept, Thrace designates a region bounded by the Balkan Mountains on the north, Rhodope Mountains and the Aegean Sea on the south, and by the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmara on the east. The areas it comprises are southeastern Bulgaria (Northern Thrace), northeastern Greece (Western Thrace), and the European part of Turkey (Eastern Thrace). The biggest part of Thrace is part of present-day Bulgaria. In Turkey, it is also called Rumeli. The name comes from the Thracians, an ancient Indo-European people inhabiting Southeastern Europe. - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water. - Iran (, also , ; ' ), also known as Persia, officially the Islamic Republic of Iran (' ), is a sovereign state in Western Asia. It is bordered to the northwest by Armenia, the \\"de facto\\" Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, and Azerbaijan; to the north by the Caspian Sea; to the northeast by Turkmenistan; to the east by Afghanistan and Pakistan; to the south by the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman; and to the west by Turkey and Iraq. Comprising a land area of , it is the second-largest country in the Middle East and the 18th-largest in the world. With 82.8 million inhabitants, Iran is the world's 17th-most-populous country. It is the only country with both a Caspian Sea and an Indian Ocean coastline. The country's central location in Eurasia and Western Asia, and its proximity to the Strait of Hormuz, make it of great geostrategic importance. Tehran is the country's capital and largest city, as well as its leading economic center. - Anatolia (from Greek , ' \\"east\\" or \\"(sun)rise\\"; in modern ), in geography known as Asia Minor (from ' \\"small Asia\\"; in modern ), Asian Turkey, Anatolian peninsula, or Anatolian plateau, is the westernmost protrusion of Asia, which makes up the majority of modern-day Turkey. The region is bounded by the Black Sea to the north, the Mediterranean Sea to the south, and the Aegean Sea to the west. The Sea of Marmara forms a connection between the Black and Aegean Seas through the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits and separates Anatolia from Thrace on the European mainland. - The Aegean Sea is an elongated embayment of the Mediterranean Sea located between the Greek and Anatolian peninsulas, i.e., between the mainlands of Greece and Turkey. In the north, it is connected to the Marmara Sea and Black Sea by the Dardanelles and Bosphorus. The Aegean Islands are within the sea and some bound it on its southern periphery, including Crete and Rhodes. - The Dardanelles, also known in Classical Antiquity as the Hellespont (\\"Hellespontos\\", literally \\"Sea of Helle\\"), is a narrow, natural strait and internationally-significant waterway in northwestern Turkey that forms part of the continental boundary between Europe and Asia, and separates Asian Turkey from European Turkey. One of the world's narrowest straits used for international navigation, the Dardanelles connects the Sea of Marmara with the Aegean and Mediterranean Seas, while also allowing passage to the Black Sea by extension via the Bosphorus. - The British Isles are a group of islands off the north-western coast of continental Europe that consist of the islands of Great Britain, Ireland and over six thousand smaller isles. Situated in the North Atlantic, the islands have a total area of approximately 315,159 km, and a combined population of just under 70 million. Two sovereign states are located on the islands: Ireland (which covers roughly five-sixths of the island with the same name) and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The British Isles also include three Crown Dependencies: the Isle of Man and, by tradition, the Bailiwick of Jersey and the Bailiwick of Guernsey in the Channel Islands, although the latter are not physically a part of the archipelago. - A lake is an area of variable size filled with water, localized in a basin, that is surrounded by land, apart from any river or other outlet that serves to feed or drain the lake. Lakes lie on land and are not part of the ocean, and therefore are distinct from lagoons, and are also larger and deeper than ponds, though there are no official or scientific definitions. Lakes can be contrasted with rivers or streams, which are usually flowing. Most lakes are fed and drained by rivers and streams. - Kazakhstan ( \\"Qazaqstan\\", \\"Kazakhstan\\"), officially the Republic of Kazakhstan (\\"Qazaqstan Respwblïkas\\" \\"Respublika Kazakhstan\\"), is a transcontinental country in northern Central Asia and Eastern Europe. Kazakhstan is the world's largest landlocked country, and the ninth largest in the world, with an area of . Kazakhstan is the dominant nation of Central Asia economically, generating 60% of the region's GDP, primarily through its oil/gas industry. It also has vast mineral resources. - The Caspian Sea is the largest enclosed inland body of water on Earth by area, variously classed as the world's largest lake or a full-fledged sea. It is in an endorheic basin (it has no outflows) located between Europe and Asia. It is bound by Kazakhstan to the northeast, Russia to the northwest, Azerbaijan to the west, Iran to the south, and Turkmenistan to the southeast. - Honshu had a population of 103 million , mostly concentrated in the coastal lowlands, notably in the Kant plain where 25% of the total population resides in the Greater Tokyo Area. As the historical center of Japanese culture and political power, the island includes several past Japanese capitals, including Kyoto, Nara, and Kamakura. Much of the island's southern shore forms part of the Taiheiy Belt, a megalopolis that spans several of the Japanese islands. - Salamanders are a group of amphibians typically characterized by a lizard-like appearance, with slender bodies, blunt snouts, short limbs projecting at right angles to the body, and the presence of a tail in both larvae and adults. All present-day salamander families are grouped together under the scientific name Urodela. Salamander diversity is most abundant in the Northern Hemisphere and most species are found in the Holarctic ecozone, with some species present in the Neotropical zone. - Triturus is a genus of newts comprising the crested and the marbled newts , which are found from Great Britain through most of continental Europe to westernmost Siberia , Anatolia , and the Caspian Sea region . Their English names refer to their appearance : marbled newts have a green -- black colour pattern , while the males of crested newts , which are dark brown with a yellow or orange underside , develop a conspicuous jagged seam on their back and tail during their breeding phase . Crested and marbled newts live and breed in vegetation - rich ponds or similar aquatic habitats for two to six months and usually spend the rest of the year in shady , protection - rich land habitats close to their breeding sites . Males court females with a ritualised display , ending in the deposition of a spermatophore that is picked up by the female . After fertilisation , a female lays 200 -- 400 eggs , folding them individually into leaves of water plants . Larvae develop over two to four months before metamorphosing into land - dwelling juveniles . Historically , most European newts were included in the genus , but taxonomists have split off the alpine newt ( Ichthyosaura ) , the small - bodied newts ( Lissotriton ) and the banded newts ( Ommatotriton ) as separate genera . The closest relatives of Triturus are the European brook newts ( Calotriton ) . Two species of marbled newts and six species of crested newts , formerly considered subspecies , are accepted , with one additional crested newt species suspected . Their ranges are largely contiguous but where they do overlap , hybridisation may take place . Although not immediately threatened , crested and marbled newts suffer from population declines , caused mainly by habitat loss and fragmentation . Both their aquatic breeding sites and the cover - rich , natural landscapes upon which they depend during their terrestrial phase are affected . All species are legally protected in Europe , and some of their habitats have been designated as special reserves . - Great Britain, also known as Britain , is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe. With an area of , Great Britain is the largest European island and the ninth-largest in the world. In 2011 the island had a population of about 61 million people, making it the world's third-most populous island after Java in Indonesia and Honshu in Japan. The island of Ireland is situated to the west of it, and together these islands, along with over 1,000 smaller surrounding islands, comprise the British Isles archipelago. - A newt is a salamander in the subfamily Pleurodelinae, also called eft during its terrestrial juvenile phase. Unlike other members of the family Salamandridae, newts are semiaquatic, alternating between aquatic and terrestrial habitats over the year, sometimes even staying in the water full-time. Not all aquatic salamanders are considered newts, however. The more than 100 known species of newts are found in North America, Europe, North Africa and Asia. Newts metamorphose through three distinct developmental life stages: aquatic larva, terrestrial juvenile (eft), and adult. Adult newts have lizard-like bodies and return to the water every year to breed, otherwise living in humid, cover-rich land habitats. - Art is a diverse range of human activities in creating visual, auditory or performing artifacts (artworks), expressing the author's imaginative or technical skill, intended to be appreciated for their beauty or emotional power. In their most general form these activities include the production of works of art, the criticism of art, the study of the history of art, and the aesthetic dissemination of art. - In geography, regions are areas that are broadly divided by physical characteristics (physical geography), human impact characteristics (human geography), and the interaction of humanity and the environment (environmental geography). Geographic regions and sub-regions are mostly described by their imprecisely defined, and sometimes transitory boundaries, except in human geography, where jurisdiction areas such as national borders are defined in law. - The Black Sea is a body of water between Eastern Europe and Western Asia, bounded by Bulgaria, Georgia, Romania, Russia, Turkey, and Ukraine. It is supplied by a number of major rivers, such as the Danube, Dnieper, Rioni, Southern Bug, and Dniester. The Black Sea has an area of (not including the Sea of Azov), a maximum depth of , and a volume of . It is constrained by the Pontic Mountains to the south and by the Caucasus Mountains to the east, and features a wide shelf to the northwest. The longest east-west extent is about . - Lizards are a widespread group of squamate reptiles, with over 6,000 species, ranging across all continents except Antarctica, as well as most oceanic island chains. The group, traditionally recognized as the suborder Lacertilia, is defined as all extant members of the Lepidosauria (reptiles with overlapping scales) that are neither sphenodonts (i.e., tuatara) nor snakes they form an evolutionary grade. While the snakes are recognized as falling phylogenetically within the Toxicofera clade from which they evolved, the sphenodonts are the sister group to the squamates, the larger monophyletic group, which includes both the lizards and the snakes. - A larva (plural \\"larvae\\" ) is a distinct juvenile form many animals undergo before metamorphosis into adults. Animals with indirect development such as insects, amphibians, or cnidarians typically have a larval phase of their life cycle. - Siberia is an extensive geographical region, and by the broadest definition is also known as North Asia. Siberia has historically been a part of Russia since the 17th century. - Russia (from the Rus'), also officially known as the Russian Federation, is a country in Eurasia. At , Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 140 million people at the end of March 2016. The European western part of the country is much more populated and urbanised than the eastern, about 77% of the population live in European Russia. Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara. - North Asia or Northern Asia is a subregion of Asia, consisting of Siberia, and Russian Far East in the Asian portion of Russia the area east of the Ural Mountains. A large part of the region is also known as Asian Russia. - Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people.
