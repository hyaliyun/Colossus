Context: Roland felt his stomach knotting. Having ridden out of the city through the Saint-Denis Gate, he now was nearly home, and the hurt inside was cutting so deep that he thought it would drive him mad. He repeated again and again the pledge he had just made to Nicolette: I am your true troubadour, now and forever. It felt like a knife stabbing into him. I do love her, as I have not loved any other - except Diane. Under his fur-lined mantle he was sweating, despite the bone-deep chill of the January night. Was my pledge to Nicolette a lie? No, not now that Diane has vowed herself to God. He had always believed that a man or a woman could love but one person. For all the years he had loved Diane, he had accepted that as a sacred law of Love. It was the way things should be. But it was not the way they were. Not for him. What if I had known, that day I saw Nicolette at Chinon, that Diane was still alive? I would have wanted Nicolette just as much, but would not have begun this. There would have been no messages, no song in her garden. But I was sure Diane was dead. There was nothing but a memory of a younger time to check my feelings for Nicolette. And then, when I found Diane again, I could not have her. I had lost her forever. So at last I wrote again to Nicolette. But tonight, when Nicolette would have let me make love to her - and how I want her! - I could not go beyond an embrace and a kiss. Not as long as I still love Diane. When he had set out, a full moon had hung low above the huddled rooftops of the university town. Now the silver disk was high overhead, and he could discern the small house he had bought two years ago with money he brought with him from Sicily. Question: Who did Roland pledged his love to?

Article: A wild baby bison at Yellowstone National Park had to be killed because of tourists. The tourists thought that the baby bison looked cold. They put it in their car and drove to a park ranger station. A ranger described the action of the tourists as a \\"dangerous move\\" because adult bisons can look after their babies very well and they will attack to protect their young. Park rangers took the animal from the car and set it free. But, sadly, the baby was refused by its family because it had the smell from humans. Yellowstone National Park explained on Facebook that the smell from people can cause parent animals to refuse to accept their young. The park tried again and again to make the baby bison lives with its parents. After several times they had to give up. Many people expressed anger at both the tourists and the park. The park said that they did not have the ability to care for a young bison. They also said that it is \\"not the task of the park to save animals\\". The tourists were fined 110 for touching park wildlife. Park rules say that visitors to Yellowstone should stay at least 22 meters away from all wildlife, and at least 90 meters away from bears and wolves. One ranger said that Yellowstone recently added many safety signs that say staying near the wildlife there is dangerous to humans and animals as well. Those signs are written in English and other languages. Question: From the passage, we can learn that _ . Options: A: we must keep away from any wild animal B: we should care about wild animals in a right way C: we'll be fined if we save a bison in the park D: we'd better write safety signs in many languages A:","response":"B: we should care about wild animals in the right way"},{"question":"A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the character who scolds Hector for fighting?, using the article: Hector Villa is a young Mexican national and border-crossing migrant and worker with boxing abilities mirroring his late father's. He could perhaps be good if he learned to think along with his pummeling. Despite all of this, Hector is a hard worker on a Texas farm who does what he can to provide for his ailing mother which includes pulling in a few side dollars from small-time, illegal gambling fights. Tito, a \\"coyote\\" (a person who helps smuggle people across the border) spends his days as a snake catcher but at night, helps smuggle immigrants across the border. After winning a fight in a local mechanic's garage, Hector tries to get another fight but the entertainment is interrupted by Tito who scolds both Hector and the owner due to the fact that Tito could get into more trouble for illegal gambling fights as if smuggling illegals across the border isn't enough. Corralled, Hector goes to change but is followed in by another illegal; Maria. It soon becomes known that they grew up together as kids and it also becomes apparent that Hector dislikes her (mostly because of her sarcastic teasing). Tito hands Hector medicine for his mother and the three head back to the farm where they all work. After settling all of the immigrants in, Maria goes into her own suite with Hector and makes herself at home despite Hector being less than welcoming. Hector then goes to his mother Rosa to give her the medicine but it becomes apparent that she is getting worse.

In the first quarter, Tennessee trailed early as QB Eli Manning completed a 3-yard TD pass to WR Plaxico Burress for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, Giants RB Brandon Jacobs got a 10-yard and 4-yard TD run to give the Giants a seemingly comfy 21-0 halftime. After a scoreless third quarter, the Titans' improbable comeback began in the fourth quarter with 10 minutes remaining. QB Vince Young completed a TD pass to TE Bo Scaife. Afterwards, Young would follow it up with a 1-yard TD run.

Rushing here and there, being constantly on call, balancing multiple layers of responsibility may give you a sense of accomplishment – even make you feel important, but it takes a huge toll on every aspect of life. When you constantly push yourself to take on more and more challenges, it is easy to lose sight of why you wanted to be successful in the first place. For many, the reason was to be able to spend less time working and enjoy life more. A frenetic, high-pressure lifestyle creates exactly the opposite. There is a very dark side to constantly pushing yourself to produce more and more. Unfortunately, it creeps up on you and becomes a serious case of self-negligence. When you are busy and driven every minute of every day and well into the evening, it is easy to neglect important things in life that keep you healthy, happy, and create quality of life. A continual stream of urgent tasks that must be completed will overshadow the not-so-urgent, but important activities that make life worth living. It is not just physical well-being that is neglected – mental and emotional well-being also suffer when there is no time for self-care. When your daily schedule is crammed to overflowing one of the first areas of neglect is your diet. Eating regular, nutritious meals become a thing of the past. You are not only too busy to sleep or even take a deep breath now and then, there is no time to prepare decent meals Convenience foods, frozen dinners, take out and fast foods become the norm.

Those with the genes were 13 times more likely to have a history of repeated violent behaviour. The authors of the study, published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry, said at least 5-10% of all violent crime in Finland could be attributed to individuals with these genotypes. But they stressed the genes could not be used to screen criminals. Many more genes may be involved in violent behaviour and environmental factors are also known to have a fundamental role. Even if an individual has a \\"high-risk combination\\" of these genes the majority will never commit a crime, the lead author of the work Jari Tiihonen of the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden said. \\"Committing a severe, violent crime is extremely rare in the general population. So even though the relative risk would be increased, the absolute risk is very low,\\" he told the BBC. We're all products of genetics and the environment but I don't think that robs us of free will or understanding right and wrong Dr Christopher Ferguson, Stetson University, Florida The study, which involved analysis of almost 900 criminals, is the first to have looked at the genetic make-up of so many violent criminals in this way. Warrior gene Each criminal was given a profile based on their offences, categorising them into violent or non-violent. The association between genes and previous behaviour was strongest for the 78 who fitted the \\"extremely violent offender\\" profile. This group had committed a total of 1,154 murders, manslaughters, attempted homicides or batteries. A replication group of 114 criminals had all committed at least one murder. These all carried a low-activity version of the MAOA gene, which previous research has dubbed the \\"warrior gene\\" because of its link to aggressive behaviour. Crime genes The two genes associated with violent repeat offenders were the MAOA gene and a variant of cadherin 13 (CDH13) The MAOA gene codes for the enzyme monoamine oxidase A, which is important for controlling the amount of dopamine and serotonin in the brain CDH13 has previously been associated with substance abuse and ADHD Those classified as non-violent offenders did not have this genetic profile A deficiency of the enzyme this controls could result in \\"dopamine hyperactivity\\" especially when an individual drinks alcohol or takes drugs such as amphetamines, said Prof Tiihonen. The majority of all individuals who commit severe violent crime in Finland do so under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Free will For now, a person's genetic information should not have any influence on conviction outcomes in criminal courts, Prof Tiihonen added. \\"There are many things which can contribute to a person's mental capacity. The only thing that matters is the mental capacity of the individual to understand the consequences of what he or she is doing and whether or not the individual can control his or her own behaviour.\\" Christopher Ferguson of Stetson University in the US state of Florida agreed. He said it must be remembered that there was not \\"one or even two genes that by themselves code for violence or crime\\". \\"To some extent we're all products of genetics and the environment but I don't think that robs us of free will or understanding right and wrong.\\" Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Researchers say genetic profiling should not yet be used in criminal courts Despite this view, echoed by many other scientists, there have been several instances of defence lawyers using genetic information to reduce sentences. In 2009, a court in Italy reduced the sentence of a criminal with genes linked to bad behaviour. In a similar case in the US a murderer's genetic profile was highlighted as a contributing factor for his crime. Commenting on the latest study, Dr Ferguson said it added to our understanding of the factors involved in violent crime. \\"Studies like this really document that a large percentage of our behaviour in terms of violence or aggression is influenced by our biology - our genes - and our brain anatomy. \\"It's important to conceptualise crime and violence, where it comes from, even if we would not want to radically change the criminal justice system.\\" Brett Haberstick from the University of Colorado, Boulder in the US, said the work illustrates that \\"finding genes for criminal behaviour is going to be difficult\\", despite a long tradition of biological work in the area of criminology. He said it would be important for others with similar data to replicate the study. \\"It is worthwhile to look for biological contributions to criminal or antisocial behaviour as their impact on individuals, communities and society in general is sizeable. What I think, however, is that it is vital that environmental influences are considered as well,\\" he told BBC News. Jan Schnupp at the University of Oxford was critical of the work. He commented that up to half the population could have one of the genes involved. \\"To call these alleles 'genes for violence' would therefore be a massive exaggeration. In combination with many other factors these genes may make it a little harder for you to control violent urges, but they most emphatically do not predetermine you for a life of crime.\\" Follow Melissa on twitter ||||| A new genetic study linking two genes to extreme violent behavior is raising serious questions as to what makes a criminal and whether or not these genes could be used to screen — or even let off — potential offenders. A Karolinska Institute research team led by Jari Tihonen found that prisoners in Finland with mutated forms of the two genes — the MAOA gene (sometimes called the \\"warrior gene\\") and a variant of cadherin 13 (CDH13) — were 13 times more likely to have a history of repeated violent behavior. According to the study, which now appears in the journal Molecular Psychiatry, at least 5 to 10% of all violent crime in Finland is attributable to individuals with this particular genetic profile. That's obviously quite significant, but there's more to it than that. \\"Substantially Higher Frequency\\" For the study — the largest of its kind to date — nearly 900 Finns imprisoned for both violent and non-violent crimes underwent a genetic analysis. Each criminal was assigned a profile based on the nature of their offences. In all, the group committed a total of 1,154 murders, manslaughters, attempted homicides, or batteries. A replication group consisting of 114 criminals was also studied. After comparing the genetic profiles of these offenders to those in the general population, the researches found a \\"substantially higher frequency\\" of the implicated genes in violent offenders. What's more, \\"No substantial signal was observed for either MAOA or CDH13 among non-violent offenders, indicating that findings were specific for violent offending,\\" noted the researchers in the study. The scientists also considered environmental factors, like whether or not people had a history of substance abuse, antisocial personality disorders, or childhood maltreatment. But these co-factors, say the researchers, did not alter the outcome. Rather Common Importantly, the study wasn't designed to explain the association. In fact, the scientists involved in the study are quite certain many other genetic variants play a role — either directly or indirectly — in the cognitive molecular cascade that's known to influence behavior. Moreover, the two mutated gene versions are \\"rather common.\\" In fact, as many as one in five people have them — the vast majority of whom never commit extreme violent crimes such as rape, assault, or murder. At the same time, people without the variants were also found in the ultra-violent trial group. \\"Although the high-risk genotype combination of MAOA and CDH13 has a risk of about 13-fold compared with the 'usual' genotype combination, still the vast majority (of) high-risk genotype individuals do not commit severe violent crimes,\\" noted Tihonen in an AFP article. The Molecules of Hate As noted, other genes may be responsible for violent behavior, and despite screening for environmental factors, it's a safe bet that social and economic factors play a non-trivial role in facilitating violent behavior. That said, given the association, it's important to look at the two genetic variants to see how a person's brain could be primed for such behavior. The MAOA gene is linked to the metabolism of dopamine, an important neurotransmitter that's known to play a role in addiction and the ability to experience pleasure. A deficiency in this enzyme results in \\"dopamine hyperactivity\\", which is pronounced when a person drinks alcohol or takes drugs. And in fact, the majority of all individuals who commit severe violent crime in Finland were under the influence of alcohol or drugs. As for CDH13, it's thought to be involved impulse control. It may also play a role in ADHD. A Finding That Can't Be Taken Too Far Tihonen agrees that a person's genetic information should not have any bearing on conviction outcomes in criminal courts. Speaking to the BBC he added: There are many things which can contribute to a person's mental capacity. The only thing that matters is the mental capacity of the individual to understand the consequences of what he or she is doing and whether or not the individual can control his or her own behaviour. Indeed, these two genes aren't hindering an individual's capacity to function as a responsible individual in the real world, or to impair their ability to discern right from wrong. That said, some courts are reducing sentences of criminals with genes linked to bad behavior. For better or worse, studies like these are poised to change the way criminals are sentenced and how we assess accountability. Read the entire study at Molecular Psychiatry: \\"Genetic background of extreme violent behavior\\". Supplementary sources: AFP | BBC ||||| Two separate genetic traits have been linked to violent crime in a study that raises the possibility of there being an innate, biological basis for serious criminality. Scientists in Finland said that between five and 10 per cent of severe violent crime in the Scandinavian country could be attributable to both sets of genes, each of which can modify the activity of the brain. The findings are not the first to link criminal tendencies to genes and they have already generated critical comments from other experts who point to the limitations of the work and the complexity of human behaviour. However, Professor Jan Tiihonen of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, who led the study, published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry, said that there is mounting scientific evidence pointing to the influence of genes on violent criminality. “One way of putting it is that if these two genes did not exist, there might be between five and 10 per cent less violent crime in Finland, but we cannot be sure of what the mechanism is that causes this,” Professor Tiihonen told The Independent. “We’ve observed two genes that have a relatively big effect on violent behaviour but there are possibly tens or hundreds of other genes that have a smaller effect. This is why a ‘test for criminality’ is not possible from this study,” he said. The study analysed the genomes of 895 offenders in Finnish prisons and found that a variant of a gene for monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), an enzyme in the brain that “mops up” the neurotransmitter dopamine, was significantly more prevalent in the most violent criminals who had committed 10 or more serious offenses compared to the rest of the population. About 60 per cent of these repeat offenders carried the low-activity version of the gene, compared to a prevalence of 40 per cent in the general population. Professor Tiihonen said this suggests the gene plays a role in determining or controlling extremely violent behaviour. A second gene, called cadherin 13 (CDH13), which is involved in communication between brain cells and has already been linked to the control of impulsive behaviour, was also found to be linked with extreme criminal violence. “A conservative estimate implies that five to 10 per cent of all severe violent crime in Finland is attributable to specific MAOA and CDH13 genotypes,” the study concludes. A study published in 2002 on more than 400 men found that boys who inherited the low activity version of the MAOA gene and who were subjected to childhood abuse were twice as likely as non-abused carriers of the gene to become violent criminals. However, Professor Tiihonen said that the Finnish study was unable to establish whether there was a similar interaction between upbringing and genetic inheritance, although clearly 40 per cent of people with the gene variant did not become violent criminals. “When interpreting these results it is very important to put them in the right perspective,” said Jan Schnupp, professor of neuroscience at the University of Oxford, who was not involved in the study. “The thing that should be mentioned again and again is that half the population have low-activity MAOA enzymes, but only a tiny fraction of these carriers end up behind bars for violent crimes,” Professor Schupp said. “To call these ‘genes for violence’ would therefore be a massive exaggeration. In combination with many other factors these genes may make it a little harder for you to control violent urges, but they most emphatically do not predetermine you for a life of crime,” he said. Malcolm von Schantz, a molecular neuroscientist at Surrey University, said that the findings do not suggest that a genetic explanation will replace the concept of free will and criminal responsibility for a person’s behaviour. “But I think findings such as these may make it possible, in future, to screen people with vulnerable backgrounds and identify those who are at greater risk of becoming offenders, so that they can get appropriate help before they commit any serious violent crimes,” Dr von Schantz said. ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

Hypothesis: The crossbow released a small arrow. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","response":"Step 1: Identify and understand the key terms in the premise and hypothesis. In the premise, \\"the bolt was shot across it\\" suggests that a projectile, specifically a bolt (which is typically associated with crossbows), was launched in some manner. In the hypothesis, \\"The crossbow released a small arrow\\" suggests that a crossbow was the device that launched the projectile and that it was a small arrow. Step 2: Determine if the premise explicitly states or implies the hypothesis. The premise states that a bolt was shot across something, but it does not mention the use of a crossbow or the type of the arrow (small arrow). The hypothesis specifies the use of a crossbow and the nature of the projectile (small arrow). Step 3: Assess whether the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. The premise does not explicitly mention a crossbow or the specifics of the projectile being a small arrow. However, it does discuss a bolt being shot, which strongly implies the use of a crossbow since bolts are typically associated with crossbows. The size of the arrow, however, is not directly mentioned or entailed by the premise. Conclusion: Although the hypothesis is somewhat plausible given the premise, it is not entirely entailed by the premise since the size of the arrow is not specified. The use of a crossbow is strongly implied by the mention of a bolt, but without explicit confirmation or additional information, we cannot determine with certainty that the hypothesis is fully entailed by the premise."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: \\"Lago di Comabbio\\", given a list of categories: company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, what category does the title belong to?

It was first proposed in 1600 by a British physician named William Gilbert. Knowing it acts like a magnet is one thing. Knowing why it acts like a magnet is more difficult. In fact, finding out why is a fairly recent discovery. To find out why required new technology. It was the seismograph that made it possible to learn why the Earth acted like a magnet. Seismograph are used to study earthquakes. By studying earthquake waves they were able to learn about Earths interior. They discovered that Earth has an inner and outer core. The outer core consists of liquid metals, mainly iron and nickel. Scientists think that Earths magnetic field is generated here. It is caused by the motion of this liquid metal. The liquid metal moves as Earth spins on its axis. After reading the above, is \\"By nuclear reacations\\" the correct answer to the question \\"How does the liquid metal within the Earth's core generate a magnetic field?\\"?","response":"Imagine you're playing with a big ball filled with gooey liquid that has tiny, shiny, magnetic toys (like little metal marbles) floating in it.

This is similar to how the Earth's core works! Now, back to your question about \\"nuclear reactions.\\" That's a bit different, like when you put together tiny building blocks called atoms and create energy. That's not how the Earth's core creates a magnetic field. So, \\"By nuclear reactions\\" is not the correct answer for how the liquid metal within the Earth's core generates a magnetic field.

The ISO 4217 is an international standard specifying three-letter codes for different currencies. EGP stands for Egyptian Pound, where \\"E\\" refers to Egypt, and \\"GP\\" refers to Pound. This helps in identifying and distinguishing the currencies globally. The Egyptian Pound is the official currency of the Arab Republic of Egypt, and it is managed by the Central Bank of Egypt. The Egyptian Pound has a long history, dating back to the early 19th century. During the time of British occupation in the early 1800s, the Egyptian Pound was linked to the British Pound Sterling. The Egyptian Pound was then pegged to gold and various currencies over the years, reflecting significant political, economic, and social changes. Currently, the Pound is a floating currency, meaning its value depends on market forces of supply and demand. The Egyptian Pound is further divided into 100 smaller units, known as \\"piastres\\" in English or \\"qirsh\\" in Arabic. However, because of inflation over the years, piastre coins are nowadays less frequently used in daily currency transactions. The Central Bank of Egypt issues the country's banknotes and coins in various denominations ranging from 1 to 200 Egyptian pounds for banknotes and 25 and 50 piastres, and 1 pound for coins. Egypt's economy has faced fluctuating trends in growth and inflation, which have impacted the value of its currency. Tourism, remittances from Egyptians working abroad, the Suez Canal, and agricultural exports are some of the critical sources of income for the Egyptian economy. Moreover, ongoing economic reforms, such as reducing energy subsidies and introducing a value-added tax (VAT), have helped stabilize the Egyptian economy in recent years. In conclusion, the ISO code EGP represents the Egyptian Pound, which is the official currency of the Arab Republic of Egypt. It plays an essential role in Egypt's economy and holds historical significance. The Central Bank of Egypt manages the issuance of banknotes and coins, and the exchange rate of EGP against other currencies is determined by market forces, reflecting Egypt's economic performance."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a pair of action statements.

The Belgium forward, whom Brendan Rodgers believes will be a ‘world-class striker’, joined Liverpool in August but was immediately loaned back to Lille to continue his development before heading to Anfield next summer. But such is Liverpool’s keenness to bring Origi in, they would be ready to pay a premium to get him in the new year. Rodgers’ side have been desperately short of goals, with Daniel Sturridge missing 14 games through injury and Rickie Lambert, Mario Balotelli and Fabio Borini struggling. Belgium's Divock Origi, second left, scores the second goal against Iceland on Wednesday night. Origi (right) celebrates with team-mates after his goal against Iceland at the King Baudouin stadium. Lille, however, have given no indication that they would be willing to re-jig the original terms of the deal, which meant he would stay the full season in France, and hand Origi to Liverpool early - even if the 19-year-old has admitted he would be happy to move in January. ‘It is not me who makes the decisions but if the club choose to let me go in January I would go, I would like to join Liverpool then,’ said Origi, who scored for Belgium in their 3-1 win over Iceland on Wednesday. ‘I said I would stay for the whole season and I wish to remain honourable in that, of course. But if there was a decision by the clubs, I would not say I wouldn’t like to go to Liverpool in January. Brendan Rodgers is in contact, he (speaks) regularly, he wants to know how I am feeling. ‘It makes me feel very good and wanted. Also the medical staff, they stay in touch for the same reason – to keep me involved, telling me that they are looking forward to me coming to the club. If there was that chance of joining Liverpool sooner I would take it. Liverpool bought Origi from Lille for £10million but loaned him back to the French side for the season. ‘I would love to move to Liverpool sooner rather than later. I am here at Lille. It’s fine, they are a good club and they have helped me. But I can’t wait to be playing in the Premier League because I can now see that it will suit me better. I think there are good things waiting for me with Liverpool.’ Origi, who has scored five goals in France this season, played for Lille in both their Europa League matches against Everton recently. He has made a point of watching how Liverpool have fared and believes their current position in the Barclays Premier League does not reflect their capabilities. ‘I have been following Liverpool closely, the events of what has been going on and I think they have had a difficult time,’ said Origi. ‘They have a team with a lot of talent, with a lot of good players. They also have a very, very good coach. ‘But they have had a lot of injuries and this has not helped them. It is difficult when you do not have a player like Daniel Sturridge, for instance.

To an extent, I appreciate the arguments made by supporters of the GCSB Bill - it's not really a huge encroachment of mass surveillance powers, it is, mostly, just the formalisation of mass surveillance powers that have been encroaching for a decade. We are not fucked off because of the bill itself, really, but because we've finally been forced to pay attention to the barftastic overreach of state surveillance that's been happening around us. At least, that's true for me. Thanks to the GCSB Bill, I finally got around to reading the Kim Dotcom affidavits. It's the best example we have of how \\"GCSB assistance\\" is actually rendered. The Police asked the GCSB for help in a one-page request (page 13 of this): Once the GCSB's lawyer had a look at it, the Police provided a list of \\"selectors\\" to the GCSB (we now know from the PRISM documents that \\"selectors\\" is the term used to describe the search terms used to make PRISM requests): The selectors were entered into █████, in an email classified as \\"SECRET//COMINT//REL TO NZL, AUS, CAN, GBR, USA\\". In other words, the selectors were entered into a secret communications intelligence system, and this secret system was considered related to Five Eyes: The email from the GCSB then described \\"traffic volume from these selectors\\": i.e. This secret system was capturing live traffic. This is consistent with everything that we know about PRISM. Key has refused to comment on this. What does this mean? It means that GCSB assistance is NSA assistance. It means that government agencies can tap into these powers as part of bread-and-butter law enforcement. Through the Bradley Ambrose case, we've seen that the Police are willing to use the full extent of their powers for entirely bullshit cases. Combine the two, and it makes me very, very queasy. I ended my post in May with \\"we need to start by getting really, really fucked off\\". What is step two? Fortunately, there is a 25-year-old answer to this question: Encrypt everything. Over the next however long it's going to take me, I'm going to be doing short posts on how to secretfy your stuff. Today's post is on encrypting text using public-key encryption. Public-key Encryption (the uber-short version) This technique is based on a pair of matching keys - one public, one private. Anything encrypted with one can only be decrypted with the other. Why? MATHS, that's why. The public key is then made public (my key is here), and anyone can use that key to encrypt a messsage. Only you - with the private key that you keep secret - can decrypt that message. It's actually not that hard. The simplest tool for dealing with PGP keys is gpg4usb. Go download it and have a play. Purely for testing purposes, here is the public AND private keys for \\"John PGPKey\\" (right click on the link --> \\"Save link as..\\" to save the file). Open up gpg4usb and use the menu bar: Keys --> Import Key from.. --> File. Select the .asc file you just downloaded. You can now use John PGPKey's private and public keys. (Just to reiterate, this is for testing purposes only - you should NEVER put your real private key on the internet.) Here is a message that's been encrypted using John PGPKey's public key. Open it up and copy and paste the garbled text into gpg4usb (including the BEGIN PGP MESSAGE and END PGP MESSAGE lines). Click on the \\"Decrypt\\" button. It'll ask you for a passphrase, which is \\"spicy panopticon in a dunnenad sauce\\" (this is a more reliable guide to making secure passphrases than your IT department). (And no, you should not be putting the passphrases for your real private key on the internet, either. NOTE: Apologies if this didn't work before, I posted the wrong version of the key I was faffing around with.) Enter the passphrase and BAM - you've decrypted a message! (If you haven't, check that you've copied the whole message, and check that you typed in the password properly.) Now, to encrypt a message, just type things into the text box, select the key you want to encrypt with, and click on the \\"Encrypt\\" button. Pretty goddamn easy. To create your own key, open up Keys --> Manage Keys. From the Key Management window, open up Key --> Generate Key. Fill out the boxes and go. You can export the public key and put it somewhere public - but let's not actually do that yet, until we have a way of securing your private key. In the next part, we'll talk about publishing keys, verifying keys, signing with keys. ||||| A new examination of previously published affidavits from the Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB)—the New Zealand equivalent of the National Security Agency (NSA)—appears to suggest that the GCSB used the “Five Eyes” international surveillance network to capture the communications of Kim Dotcom, the founder of Megaupload. The new analysis was posted by New Zealand journalist Keith Ng in a Thursday blog post. If the link proves to be true, it would seem that the NSA’s vast international surveillance capability can be turned against individuals unrelated to the NSA’s stated mission to aid military, counterintelligence, or counterterrorism objectives. Kim Dotcom has been charged in the United States with copyright infringement rather than terrorism or any other violent crime. The German-born entrepreneur is currently fighting extradition from New Zealand to the United States. Separately, he has launched a civil suit in New Zealand against the GCSB for what the New Zealand government has already admitted was unlawful surveillance. REL TO NZL, FVEY On Page 21 of the GCSB’s Affadavit of Disclosure (PDF), in an internal e-mail dated February 17, 2012, the document is marked: \\"TOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO NZL, FVEY.\\" The last section of that classification (REL TO NZL, FVEY)—“Relevant to New Zealand, Five Eyes”—refers to the vast intelligence and data sharing program between the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, known as “Five Eyes.” Given new disclosures about the capabilities of PRISM and XKeyscore as a result of the documents provided by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, a close examination of this affidavit seems to suggest that the Five Eyes infrastructure was used in Dotcom’s case. (In a slide published last month by The Guardian, XKeyscore is clearly shown to have a presence in New Zealand.) The affadavit also provides a redacted list of “selectors” for Kim Dotcom, his wife Monica Dotcom, and Bram Van Der Kolk, one of Dotcom’s co-defendants. “We intercepted [REDACTED] from the first two selectors on the list,\\" the document states. \\"Obviously only a small fraction of them were used in the reports that were generated. We had no [REDACTED] collection on Dotcom, and I’m advised we saw a little [REDACTED] none of which was used in reporting.” “All Five Eyes partners have access [to the NSA's systems], including GCSB,” Dotcom told Ars. “GCSB doesn’t even operate their own spy cloud. Everything goes into the US-based spy cloud. Including all the surveillance they have done on me. They typed in the selector and got access to everything the Five Eyes spy cloud had on me. Then the GCSB started real-time surveillance of all my communications, IP, mobile, etc. and was feeding that into the spy cloud.” Neither the GCSB nor a spokesperson for the Embassy of New Zealand in the United States immediately responded to Ars’ request for comment. In June 2013, New Zealand Prime Minister John Key evaded answering whether the GCSB uses or has access to the NSA’s PRISM system. \\"I can't tell you how the United States gather all of their information, what techniques they use, I just simply don't know,” Key told TV3’s Firstline. “But if the question is do we use the United States or one of our other partners to circumvent New Zealand law then the answer is categorically no. We do exchange—and it's well known—information with our partners. We do do that. How they gather that information and whether they use techniques or systems like PRISM, I can't comment on that.'' \\"What was done was illegal\\" As we reported in March 2013, a New Zealand appeals court ruled (PDF) that Kim Dotcom has the right to sue the government of New Zealand for illegal surveillance. As we reported further last year, the NZ government admitted after the fact that Dotcom should not have been subjected to government surveillance due to his having obtained permanent resident status. According to new documents acquired earlier this year by a New Zealand TV channel, the GCSB already had information as of December 16, 2011 (before the January 2012 raid) showing that Dotcom was a permanent resident of New Zealand and that the agency knew Dotcom should not have been targeted at all. Interestingly, the documents also show Dotcom’s government code name: “Billy Big Steps.” Still, Ira Rothken, Dotcom’s California-based attorney, seemed to be a bit more cautious about drawing any new implications from the NZ affidavit. “We’re in the process of litigating a civil case that implicates the New Zealand government for their illegal spying,” he told Ars. “At this point, while we have a healthy appreciation for whatever informal analysis is being done, our goal in this case is to actually get the information directly from New Zealand government sources. I don’t want to prejudge the very thing that we’re litigating now.” Still, Rothken seemed to indicate that it was within the realm of possibility that Five Eyes was turned against Dotcom illegally. “I think it’s axiomatic that New Zealand has access to the Five Eyes infrastructure because it’s a member of Five Eyes and it has network points in New Zealand, including a large installation in New Zealand,” he added. “I think that that’s common knowledge. We know that the spy machinery was misused because what was done was illegal. The interesting thing about this case is that it shows how not having sufficient checks and balances against the spy machinery can come back to hurt and impact the rights of innocent residents. Here, the Prime Minister has already apologized and admitted that what happened was illegal. We are litigating for what damages and remedies should be provided.” Mark Rumold, a staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said that it wasn’t clear how much New Zealand authorities obtained via the NSA. “It would all be dependent on New Zealand law,” he told Ars. “There’s nothing in here that looks like a slam dunk. It doesn't seem like it’s outside the realm of possibility, but if everything is based on a single classification, it seems possible.” Meanwhile, NZ expands GCSB spying domestically At the time of the surveillance against Dotcom, the GCSB was only allowed to engage in surveillance of non-resident foreigners. However, earlier this week, the New Zealand parliament voted 61-59 to expand the GCSB’s powers to encompass citizens and legal residents. \\"This is not, and never will be, about wholesale spying on New Zealanders,\\" Prime Minister John Key told parliament on Thursday. \\"There are threats our government needs to protect New Zealanders from. Those threats are real and ever-present, and we underestimate them at our peril.\\" ||||| A summary of this is?","response":"This news article talks about how the government in New Zealand has been using surveillance techniques to gather information about people, especially a person named Kim Dotcom.

It stresses freedom to navigate the oceans and disapproves of war fought in international waters. Today, this concept is enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the third version of which came into force in 1994. Article 87(1) states: \\"The high seas are open to all states, whether coastal or land-locked.\\" Article 87(1) (a) to (f) gives a non-exhaustive list of freedoms including navigation, overflight, the laying of submarine cables, building artificial islands, fishing and scientific research. The safety of shipping is regulated by the International Maritime Organization. Its objectives include developing and maintaining a regulatory framework for shipping, maritime safety, environmental concerns, legal matters, technical co-operation and maritime security.UNCLOS defines various areas of water. \\"Internal waters\\" are on the landward side of a baseline and foreign vessels have no right of passage in these. \\"Territorial waters\\" extend to 12 nautical miles (22 kilometres; 14 miles) from the coastline and in these waters, the coastal state is free to set laws, regulate use and exploit any resource. A \\"contiguous zone\\" extending a further 12 nautical miles allows for hot pursuit of vessels suspected of infringing laws in four specific areas: customs, taxation, immigration and pollution. An \\"exclusive economic zone\\" extends for 200 nautical miles (370 kilometres; 230 miles) from the baseline. Within this area, the coastal nation has sole exploitation rights over all natural resources. The \\"continental shelf\\" is the natural prolongation of the land territory to the continental margin's outer edge, or 200 nautical miles from the coastal state's baseline, whichever is greater.

A few years ago, Vegas was one of my “bucket list” places – one of those iconic cities that one should visit at least once in their life. For me, once was enough. This is now my 4th (I think?) trip to Vegas, and while the city has a lot to offer, it’s just not my cup of tea. For one thing, I’m not a gambler, like at all. I don’t have anything against it, I just don’t enjoy it. It either feels pointless or stressful to me. The city itself makes me a little sad – in some cases, it reeks of desperation. Last time I was there, my cab driver entertained me with stories of how she was working 3 jobs to save up enough to join some mega-massive bingo game. She won a small jackpot a few years back and that allowed her to work only one job for a few months. She was hoping to win again so she could cut back to 1 or 2 jobs. I wondered how many people do similar things – gambling their money away, in big or small chunks, in the hopes of that big score and in the process, putting themselves in a not-great financial situation. I suppose as long it makes them happy, then it’s all OK, but I can’t help but think someone like my cab driver might be happier overall if she only worked 1 job instead of 3, instead of working extra jobs to save up money to gamble her way to financial freedom. But that’s for her to decide, not me. The juxtaposition of extreme and in-your-face wealth and the homeless people on the Strip also makes me sad.

Sergeant Pete sees it and scolds Donald, explaining that it needs to painted so it can't be seen. Pete then demands that Donald re-paint the cannon to make it \\"hard to see\\". Obliging to the sergeant's orders, Donald walks to the \\"Experimental Laboratory: Camouflage Corps\\", disregarding the 'keep out' sign, and walks in. He finds some \\"invisible paint\\", which he tests with his finger, and uses it to paint the cannon. When Pete returns, he is shocked to find the cannon seemingly gone, believing it to be stolen. But of course it isn't stolen, as the sergeant finds out the hard way by bonking his head on the underside of the cannon and discovering Donald inside. Angered that Donald painted the cannon too invisible to see, Pete blows hard into one end of the barrel, sending Donald out the other end and into the bucket of invisible paint. When Donald runs away, Pete finds out Donald has become invisible after seeing Donald's footprints on the ground. Donald then swims across a lake, but the invisible paint doesn't come off. Pete continues to chase Donald through a field of flowers, until he accidentally throws some of the flowers on Donald, revealing his outline. Pete spots Donald and tries to catch him, but he gets away again. However, this gives Pete an idea to find Donald. When the General drives up, Pete's antics, including jumping around a tree while singing \\"Here We Go Round The Mulberry Bush\\" and throwing flowers, convinces the General that he is acting odd, especially after he asks the General \\"did you see a little guy that you can't see?\\" The invisible Donald then puts a cactus down Pete's pants, making him scream in pain and jump around like a madman, making the General wonder what is going on with Pete. Guess a valid title for it! A:","response":"A valid title for this story could be \\"Donald Duck and the Invisible Antics: A Camouflaged Adventure\\". This title reflects the key elements of the story: Donald Duck using invisible paint for camouflage, his ensuing antics as an invisible character, and the pursuit by Sergeant Pete and his confusion.

The sentence pair should look similar, and should be about two related but different objects; for example \\"trophy\\" and \\"suitcase\\". Additionally, the two sentences must be different in terms of trigger words (e.g., \\"small\\" and \\"big\\") which express contrasting properties about the two objects. The answer must not be associated with the trigger word; instead, it should depend on the context present in twin sentences. Also, the answers should not be ambiguous. For each sentence, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. Do not use animals and proper nouns (e.g., New York, Macbook, Jeff Bezos, McDonald's, ...) as your objects. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in twin sentences. E.g., a contrasting sentence can always be created using simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase diversity. Both twin sentences must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Twin sentences must have at least 70% overlapping words. You must utilize the given context word while writing the twin sentences. Each of the twin sentences must contain only one blank. Make sure that ObjectX and Y have the same number e.g. when ObjectX is singular, ObjectY must be singular, too. The two objects (ObjectX & ObjectY) should be used ONCE in each sentence. Here is a list of contrastive words that may be used as trigger words.

Basil gets 1/2 of a dog cookie in the morning and before bed. She gets 2 whole cookies during the day. Basil’s cookies are packaged with 45 cookies per box. How many boxes will she need to last her for 30 days? If the answer is '2'; explain the reasoning:","response":"To determine how many boxes Basil will need for 30 days, we need to first find out the total number of cookies Basil consumes in a day and then multiply it by 30 to find the number of cookies needed for the entire month. Finally, we'll divide the total cookies needed by the number of cookies per box to find out how many boxes are required. 1. Calculate the total cookies Basil eats in a day: Basil eats 1/2 a cookie in the morning and 1/2 a cookie before bed, making a combined total of 1 whole cookie (1/2 + 1/2 = 1). Basil also gets 2 whole cookies during the day. In total, Basil eats 3 cookies per day (1 + 2 = 3). 2. Calculate the total number of cookies needed for 30 days: Since Basil eats 3 cookies each day for 30 days, she will need 3 * 30 = 90 cookies. 3. Determine how many boxes are needed: Each box has 45 cookies. To find out how many boxes Basil needs, divide the total number of cookies needed (90) by the number of cookies per box (45). 90 / 45 = 2 So the answer is '2', and the reasoning is as follows: Basil eats 3 cookies per day. She needs a total of 90 cookies to last for 30 days. Since each box has 45 cookies, Basil will need exactly 2 boxes to have enough cookies for the entire month."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: A federal judge on Thursday rejected efforts by Texas to stop the resettlement of Syrian refugees within its borders. The ruling comes days after presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump called to block non-citizen Muslims from entering the U.S. following the Orlando nightclub massacre. Even before the attack, Americans were divided, mostly along party lines, on the issue of refugees from war-torn countries in the Middle East. A survey conducted in late May by the Brookings Institution found of those polled, just 38 percent of Republicans supported taking in refugees from Syria and the Middle East, compared with 77 percent of Democrats. But among Trump supporters, an overwhelming 77 percent said they oppose taking in refugees. So who are these people who cause such a divide among Americans, triggering feelings of dread and suspicion in some and feelings of empathy and hospitality in others? Millions have been forced to flee the bloody conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Libya and other Middle Eastern nations. In 1951 the United Nation's Refugee Convention defined a refugee as someone who \\"owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality, and is unable to, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country.\\" By the end of 2014, there were 19.5 million refugees worldwide, according to the United Nations, 14.4 million of whom were under the mandate of the United Nations Human Rights Council. This was an increase of 2.9 million from 2013. The remaining 5.1 million refugees were registered with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency. However, there are an estimated 59.5 million forcibly displaced persons around the world, according to United Nation's Global Trends report. This population not only includes refugees, but internally displaced persons, asylum-seekers and stateless people as well. President Barack Obama has set...

Van Persie was rested for the midweek Champions League victory over Real Sociedad and it was claimed in the Netherlands that supposed injuries to toes and groin were a cover for dissatisfaction in training. \\"That's complete nonsense,\\" the Manchester United manager said. \\"He has been playing with injections in his toes, he played one game for Holland with injections and we wanted to get away from that and give him a proper rest. I told him before the Southampton game that if he played he could miss the midweek game to get a little bit of recovery time. One of his small toes has been bothering him for a while and then he got the other one stood on at Shakhtar Donetsk and he felt it was affecting his groin as well.\\" By his standards, Van Persie has made a relatively quiet start to the season, or at least it feels that way, but he has scored four goals in seven Premier League games. \\"He's playing well, he's doing some great stuff for us and I've found him fantastic to work with,\\" Moyes said. \\"I'm surprised I am even having to answer this because he's been that good.\\" One thing Moyes will accept is that his team are not scoring enough goals. An inability to extend their lead beyond a single goal ended up costing them points when Southampton produced a late equaliser in the last league match and the story could have been the same against Sociedad when United were indebted to an own goal for the margin of victory, despite creating a hatful of chances. \\"At least we are creating chances, you can't say we are not going for it,\\" Moyes said. \\"It is a concern because we should have been out of sight against Sociedad. We've been hitting the post and bar and I've no doubt that somewhere along the line it will go for us and the goals will go in but at the same time we do need to be more clinical. You can do as much finishing practice as you want, recreate situations on the training ground and so on but the important thing is to do the job on Saturday afternoon. I would have taken the win in Europe no matter what because the points were important but we could have made our lives much easier with a couple more goals.\\" With only one taken from the last couple of home games, Premier League points are becoming a matter of concern as well, although Moyes takes the long view. \\"Only two months of the season have gone, I think there will be other teams slipping up before the end,\\" he said. \\"We just have to make sure we don't slip up as often.\\" Write a title for it.","response":"\\"David Moyes Dismisses Rumors of Van Persie's Unhappiness, Striker Likely to Return Against Stoke\\""},{"question":"Generate short a sentence that can be linguistically classified as acceptable (OPTIONS: - unacceptable - acceptable)","response":"Acceptable.

Certainly, they were homely and fun but there was no heating or an inside toilet, and running water was a bit of a bonus. Related: Butlin’s Minehead: resort-hotel review On a blustery spring day on the Somerset coast on Tuesday, the holiday company’s executives and its famous Redcoats (not to mention various stilt-walkers and Bonnie Bear), unveiled the 21st-century version of those wooden lodgings: pretty mini-homes with all mod cons, including wireless internet, flat-screen televisions and that epitome of modern living , L-shaped sofas. We're so excited to officially launch the new #ButlinsChalets at #Minehead! Stay tuned for updates from launch day! pic.twitter.com/V8vecalxn5 They were, argued managing director of Butlin’s, Dermot King, a “re-imagining” of the chalets that Sir Billy Butlin dreamed up in the interwar years. “We wanted to go back to what Butlin’s is good at and famous for,” he said. “Billy Butlin invented the chalet. We celebrate our 80th year next year and we couldn’t miss the opportunity to re-invent the chalet. What we’ve built is something that nods to the heritage he created but inside they are very different to the original ones.” A trip to the seaside to see Butlin's new chalets Here's the boss claiming the word chalet for the holiday company. http://t.co/f10L7EMjmi While he was about it, King was also claiming the word “chalet” for Butlin’s. “Chalet is a word that Butlin’s owns,” he said. “It’s generally connected to Butlin’s resorts. It’s only when you put the word Swiss in front of it that you get a different connotation.” The French-Swiss might argue about it, but it is inarguable that the new 117 chalets at the West Lakes Chalet Village on the company’s Minehead park are very different not only to those early versions but to the still-functioning ones in other parts of the resort. Butlin’s has spent £16m on the development, which is set in 6.9 hectares (17 acres) of landscaped gardens. Two-, three- and four-bedroom versions are available. Painted in pastel shades (like Butlin’s originals), they boast balconies and verandas and open plan living areas. The fairground and pavilion packed with all sorts of entertainments is a a short stroll away. The company also, cleverly, worked with the website Mumsnet to find out what mothers actually wanted from a chalet. After almost half said they did not want televisions in children’s bedrooms, Butlin’s left them out. Almost 60% said they were worried about bad weather wrecking family holidays – prompting the company to equip chalets with arts and crafts materials. They are also providing a library of board games designed to get families off tablets and smartphones and interacting with each other. The original Butlin’s chalets were conceived as an antithesis to the existing concept of a seaside holiday when people would arrive at the coast from towns and cities on charabancs and stay in guesthouses run by landladies whose inflexible rules meant guests were kicked out at breakfast time and not allowed back in except at meal or bedtimes. Butlin watched these holidaymakers trying to find shelter and entertainment in the rain and decided to offer them something that gave them more independence and dignity. The historian Kathryn Ferry, who specialises in the British seaside and holiday camps, said: “Billy Butlin had a talent for giving British holidaymakers what they wanted before they knew they wanted it. “The chalet was a key part of his vision because it gave people freedom. It seems obvious now but it was revolutionary in the 1930s and the things people expect on their holidays today really owe a lot to his vision all those years ago.” Butlin’s seems still to be on top of its game. It had 1.2 million stay at its resorts in Minehead, Bognor Regis in West Sussex and Skegness in Lincolnshire last year. Sales are up by 8% this year. Adrian Rogers, 48, from Dorset, was one of the first to sample the delights of the new chalets at Minehead. He was impressed. “I’ve been coming here since I was born and visit maybe five times a year,” he said. “But I’ve never seen anything like these chalets. They are great.” Butlin's regular Adrian Rogers on the company's swish new chalets. http://t.co/xzQjYjVjGD What are the most important parts of this news article?","response":"1.

It is among the most famous gardens in England and is designated Grade I on Historic England's register of historic parks and gardens. It was bought by Sackville-West in 1930, and over the next thirty years, working with, and later succeeded by, a series of notable head gardeners, she and Nicolson transformed a farmstead of \\"squalor and slovenly disorder\\" into one of the world's most influential gardens. Following Sackville-West's death in 1962, the estate was donated to the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty. It is one of the Trust's most popular properties, with nearly 200,000 visitors in 2017. The gardens contain an internationally respected plant collection, particularly the assemblage of old garden roses. The writer Anne Scott-James considered the roses at Sissinghurst to be \\"one of the finest collections in the world\\". A number of plants propagated in the gardens bear names related to people connected with Sissinghurst or the name of the garden itself. The garden design is based on axial walks that open onto enclosed gardens, termed \\"garden rooms\\", one of the earliest examples of this gardening style. Among the individual \\"garden rooms\\", the White Garden has been particularly influential, with the horticulturalist Tony Lord describing it as \\"the most ambitious ... of its time, the most entrancing of its type.\\"The site of Sissinghurst is ancient and has been occupied since at least the Middle Ages. The present-day buildings began as a house built in the 1530s by Sir John Baker. In 1554 Sir John's daughter Cecily married Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset, an ancestor of Vita Sackville-West.

How can the United States and its friends help moderate Muslims combat the extremist ideas? Recommendation: The U.S. government must define what the message is, what it stands for. We should offer an example of moral leadership in the world, committed to treat people humanely, abide by the rule of law, and be generous and caring to our neighbors. America and Muslim friends can agree on respect for human dignity and opportunity. To Muslim parents, terrorists like Bin Laden have nothing to offer their children but visions of violence and death. America and its friends have a crucial advantage-we can offer these parents a vision that might give their children a better future. If we heed the views of thoughtful leaders in the Arab and Muslim world, a moderate consensus can be found. That vision of the future should stress life over death: individual educational and economic opportunity. This vision includes widespread political participation and contempt for indiscriminate violence. It includes respect for the rule of law, openness in discussing differences, and tolerance for opposing points of view. Recommendation: Where Muslim governments, even those who are friends, do not respect these principles, the United States must stand for a better future. One of the lessons of the long Cold War was that short-term gains in cooperating with the most repressive and brutal governments were too often outweighed by long-term setbacks for America's stature and interests. American foreign policy is part of the message. America's policy choices have consequences. Right or wrong, it is simply a fact that American policy regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and American actions in Iraq are dominant staples of popular commentary across the Arab and Muslim world. That does not mean U.S. choices have been wrong. It means those choices must be integrated with America's message of opportunity to the Arab and Muslim world.

Article: Street art can be found on buildings, street signs and even dustbins from Tokyo to Paris to New York City. This special kind of art can take the form of paintings, sculptures, cloth or even stickers. Street art has become part of a culture which can be seen around the world. Now, even art museums and galleries are collecting the works of street artists. People have different thoughts about street art. Some think street art is bad, but others see this art as a rich form of non-traditional cultural expression. Street art began in New York City in the 1960s. Young adults would use paint in special cans to spray their \\"tag\\" on walls and train cars around the city. This tag was a name they created to show off themselves and their artwork. This style of drawing and writing became known as graffiti . Graffiti art showed that young people wanted to rebel against the rules. They traveled around cities to make paintings that everyone could see. Street artists do their work for some reasons. A number of them choose street art because it is closer to the everyday life. What they enjoy most is the freedom of expressing themselves which street art permits . One well-known street artist is Swoon. She cuts out paper images of people and puts them on walls. Swoon didn't start her career as a street artist. She studied art but, as time went on, got bored with the works she saw in museums. Then she fell in love with graffiti. The people in New York enjoy Swoon's strong and interesting style. Some museums have already bought some of her works. Nowadays street art has become part of a world-wide culture. It is supported by websites, artist groups, books and magazines. Question: According to the writer, the artists love street art because _ .

Article:","response":"Title: Concussion Injuries on the Rise: A Comprehensive Look into the Epidemic in Premiership Football Introduction Concussion injuries have become an increasingly prevalent issue in the world of sports. With athletes pushing themselves and their bodies to the limits, the risk of head injuries has risen significantly. According to a recent annual study, concussions were the most commonly reported injury during the last Premiership football season, accounting for approximately 25% of the total injuries. This staggering figure raises questions about the impact of these injuries on the athletes and what steps can be taken to mitigate the risk. The Growing Crisis of Concussion Injuries in Football As the rate of concussions in football grows, it becomes essential to delve deeper into the causes and consequences of these injuries. One primary cause is the growing intensity and competitiveness of the sport. With millions of fans and substantial financial rewards at stake, the pressure on the players to perform and be successful is immense. This competitive environment often leads players to push themselves to the very edge both mentally and physically, resulting in riskier play that may increase the likelihood of injury, especially concussion. Moreover, the sheer physical nature of football exposes the players to the risk of rough collisions and accidental impacts that can lead to head trauma. Despite the necessary protective measures, such as wearing helmets and other protective gear, concussions still remain a significant issue in the sport. The Impact of Concussions on Athletes' Health and Career Concussion injuries can have a severe and long-term impact on an athlete's health and career. In the short term, concussions can lead to symptoms such as dizziness, nausea, confusion, memory loss, and sensitivity to light and noise. These symptoms can affect a player's performance on the field and could sideline them for weeks or even months while they recover. Additionally, it is critical to understand that these injuries can have lasting effects. Studies have shown that repeated concussions can lead to a degenerative brain condition called chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). CTE can cause severe cognitive impairment, memory loss, and personality changes, and, in severe cases, can even be fatal. Thus, concussions not only harm a player's immediate performance but also jeopardize their long-term health and quality of life. Mitigating the Risk of Concussions in Football Given the severity and prevalence of concussion injuries, it is vital for governing bodies, clubs, and players to prioritize finding solutions to reduce the risk of head trauma on the field. Firstly, there must be ongoing research into technologies that can improve the quality and effectiveness of protective gear such as helmets. Better protection can significantly reduce the force of impact on the player's head, thus lowering the chances of sustaining a concussion. Secondly, rule changes can be instrumental in mitigating the risks. For instance, the NFL instituted a rule called \\"The Helmet Rule,\\" which penalizes players for lowering their head and using their helmet to initiate contact with an opponent. Similar regulations in football could enable players to engage in a safer and more controlled environment, minimizing the risk of head injuries. Lastly, players themselves need to be aware of the risks associated with concussions and prioritize their safety over winning. Sportsmanship and fair play must be promoted, discouraging risky or dangerous play that could lead to head injuries. Furthermore, athletes must be open about symptoms or suspected concussions, as hiding them could put their lives at risk. Conclusion Concussions are a serious, growing issue in football that warrant urgent attention and action. Players, coaches, and officials must work together to develop and implement effective strategies to minimize the risk of concussions and protect the long-term health of athletes. Doing so will not only ensure the safety of the players but also preserve the integrity of the sport for future generations."},{"question":"What type of details about joe brainard can be gathered from the following bio?

Learn more ||||| It had been 41 days since the little girl’s body was discovered on a Deer Island beach, inside a black garbage bag, clothed in polka-dot leggings and a zebra-striped blanket. For 41 days, the State Police investigators assigned to the case had been beating their heads to find something — anything — that could give them even a faint idea of who the girl dubbed Baby Doe was, or where to look to uncover the mystery of her death. There was so little to go on. Exhaustive searches of the island the day she was found turned up nothing. The autopsy had given them little more, not even a cause of death. She had no fingerprints, the tides had so damaged the skin of her hands. There were no toxins in her blood. A tip line they set up was bringing in dozens of calls every day. One by one, they painstakingly followed up each. None had yielded answers. But now, at last, homicide detective Trooper Daniel Herman had something he hoped would narrow the sprawling investigation that had sent investigators scrambling to track down leads from Peru to India to the forests of Brazil: Advertisement Pollen. Get Metro Headlines in your inbox: The 10 top local news stories from metro Boston and around New England delivered daily. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here Sticky and hardy, the pollen that had floated from the flora surrounding Baby Doe in life had clung to her in death, coating her blanket, leggings, and hair. Detectives already suspected that the child had died locally, but where she had lived had remained a mystery. On that 41st day, the results of the pollen analysis came back. Baby Doe had played among the pines and oaks of New England; she was dusted with traces of privet hedges and cedar-of-Lebanon, which are not native but are often planted in the suburbs. The soot mixed in with the pollen told investigators her surroundings were urban. Somewhere near Boston, they concluded. A local girl. A place to start. Little evidence to examine Advertisement From the moment Herman had first crouched on the rocky beach and peered inside the trash bag crumpled at the high-tide line, the evidence before him was incongruous. The little girl appeared to be between 3 and 5 years old, with long brown hair. Whoever put her in the bag had first wrapped her in her blanket. There were no marks on her body: no signs of trauma or abuse. Except that she was dead. It was June 25. The sun shone overhead. Two doctors from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner were en route, and the beach swarmed with police, firefighters, emergency workers, and crime scene services technicians taking pictures and putting down evidence markers. Herman stood up and surveyed the beach: a secluded area, hidden behind an embankment and a stand of low, scrubby trees. Did she wash up, or was she placed here? he wondered. The outcropping had an almost ceremonial feel. Advertisement “Is there somebody else nearby?” Herman thought. “A dead mother?” But the cadaver dog found nothing. Officials held their first press conference that afternoon, pleading for help from the public. By 2:30 a.m., the beach was clear: investigators had twice stood shoulder to shoulder and walked its length, combing every inch for evidence, and found no clues. Herman and his sergeant stood together at the shoreline. Their only evidence was whatever the person who had dumped the child had left in the bag. The task ahead was nearly impossible, but they were determined. At their feet, the tide was coming in. Theories on a rare case It is rare, experts say, for a child to turn up dead and remain unidentified. According to FBI statistics, about 870 bodies believed to be of a person under 18 remain unidentified across the country. Of those, only approximately 88 are believed to be children between the ages of 2 and 10. “Child homicides happen all the time. We understand that,” said Carol Schweitzer, a National Center for Missing & Exploited Children senior forensic case specialist. “But the chances that a child is recovered deceased, and investigators can’t identify them in a short period of time? . . . I can count them on one hand in one year.” Among the most high-profile of these cases: Baby Hope, found dead, emaciated, and sexually abused in a cooler beneath a tree by a parkway in Manhattan in 1991. The only clue, according to a New York Times article from the period: A family had seen a man and woman carrying a cooler two weeks before the body was found. The trail went cold for 22 years, until, in 2013, police got the tip that broke the case and gave Baby Hope back her name: A woman reported a conversation in a laundromat with another woman who said her sister had been killed. The child was Anjelica Castillo, age 4, and she had allegedly been assaulted and murdered by her cousin. Much of the Castillo family was undocumented, and no one ever reported her missing, the Times reported. Investigators in the Baby Doe case have tried to imagine what could have happened in the life of their little girl, that she wound up alone at the mercy of the tide, with no family to speak for her. They believed the girl had been dead for just a couple of days when she was found. Maybe, they have theorized, her family was undocumented. That could explain why, even if she died of natural causes, no one has come forward to identify her. Or perhaps she died accidentally, and her parents have stayed silent for fear of prosecution. “How do you have a girl who is well cared for disappear and no one’s missing her?” said Assistant District Attorney David Deakin, chief of the Family Protection and Sexual Assault Bureau for Suffolk District Attorney Daniel F. Conley. “Maybe there are people missing her, but they’re afraid to come forward.” But there is also a third possibility that investigators have not ruled out: that Baby Doe was murdered. Forensic efforts across agencies Baby Doe was Herman’s case, but he wasn’t working alone. All 12 State Police homicide and narcotics detectives who worked with him in the Chelsea office of Suffolk County State Police detectives, as well as three Winthrop Police detectives, assembled to join him chasing leads. Forensic analysts at the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children started poring over records of missing children, assembling a file of vanished girls from across the country. The Coast Guard calculated “reverse drifts,” charting how the currents might have carried a body. The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner and the State Police laboratories expedited every forensic test. Winthrop, East Boston, Chelsea, Quincy, Revere, and other local police departments put officers on the streets to help canvass, search for video evidence, and track down children who tipsters worried could be Baby Doe. Within days of the discovery of her body, one wall of the Chelsea office began to fill with images of smiling little girls with brown hair and brown eyes whom the investigators have checked on and ruled out. In the pictures, they hold up dated signs or current newspapers as proof of life. In one image, a girl in a tutu shows off the bicycle she got for her birthday; in another, a grinning child raises a daisy to the camera’s lens. Suzanne Kreiter/Globe staff Trooper Daniel Herman’s office held photos of girls ruled out from being the child. Above the pictures of those living children, detectives hung a composite image a forensic artist had created of Baby Doe: big brown eyes, pierced ears, chubby cheeks, a slight smile. Herman stuck another copy to the dashboard of his car. Frantic parents, their children taken by state child protective services, have called detectives weeping and begging: Is this my baby? Please, tell me this isn’t my child. One by one, investigators ruled them out and added them to the wall. The team worked with urgency. A terrible question loomed. What if Baby Doe had brothers or sisters? What if there were other children in danger? A flood of dead-end leads For every tip detectives tracked down, scores of new ones came in. Herman, an intense 37-year-old former Army staff sergeant with a habit of pacing while on the phone, read them all, triaging them for plausibility and dispatching detectives and police officers to track them down. A week after Baby Doe was found, a man called in with a tip that he had seen a woman driving a gold SUV stop atop the Tobin Bridge and toss a black plastic trash bag into the water in the days before June 25. “There’s always a hope you come out of a lead with an answer,” said a State Police investigator on the case whose identity was withheld at the request of the department. The investigator started by interviewing the witness and a friend of his, to make sure he had seen what he said he did. Then, the investigator drove him to the top of the Tobin Bridge and reenacted the scene, pulling over and timing how long it would take to get out of a car, walk to the ledge, and throw a bag over the side. The investigator pulled video surveillance, but it did not cover the spot where the woman stopped. So the investigator pulled all the license plates of the cars that passed through the tolls after the witness’s car, focusing on the time period suggested by the reenactment, and finally found the gold SUV. It belonged to a man who said his mother drove it, he said. The investigator tracked down the mother and interviewed her on the phone and again in person. The woman confessed to throwing a garbage bag from the SUV. It had been full of rotting fruit. That was the way it went, time after time. Painstaking investigation, and then nothing. This one had taken a week. “Imagine,” the investigator said. “You have a lead about a child in a trash bag, and it turns out to be fruit.” The investigator spent another week combing through days of security footage at a Target where a woman said she saw a little girl wearing Baby Doe’s polka-dotted pants. The investigator walked the aisles and studied the tipster in person and in the video footage, but no flash of the child appeared. Other detectives threw themselves into running down other tips. A boat seen in a Winthrop marina around the time Baby Doe was found; a zebra-striped blanket donated as a Christmas present last year at St. John the Evangelist Church in Winthrop; a mother who stayed briefly with a woman in Revere, leaving behind a bag of children’s toys and toiletries. The Winthrop detectives spent weeks knocking on doors in the neighborhood surrounding the Norman F. Daw Playground, armed with a picture of Baby Doe and a description from a witness of a woman in a burka pushing a similar-looking child. Nothing panned out. And then, more than a month into the investigation, the detectives caught what they thought could be a break: Baby Doe appeared to have a particular kind of sealant on her teeth. It was a long shot, but it might be a way to find her identity. Suzanne Kreiter/Globe staff Winthrop Detectives Timothy Callinan (far right) and Wayne Carter followed up on a Baby Doe tip with Andrea Mesa and her son Anthony. Baby teeth provide a clue Herman walked into a Revere dentist’s office July 31, carrying a list of more than 50 providers who had applied sealant to the teeth of hundreds of children in Suffolk County. He expected the roster to grow. For two years, until late 2013, MassHealth covered sealants for baby teeth in Massachusetts, an expensive procedure that many parents skip if they are paying out of pocket. Detectives pulled records of MassHealth reimbursements for the procedure, and set to calling each dentist who had made a claim, asking them to search their records for young girls. Dentist Leo P. Corey had two patients who fit the criteria. One had a chipped front tooth, which ruled her out: Corey pronounced Baby Doe’s teeth “disgustingly normal” after looking at pictures on Herman’s cellphone. Corey made photocopies of the other file, with its careful chart of the little girl’s mouth. Every new name presented detectives with a contradiction: hope that the little girl attached to it was still alive, and hope that she was their Baby Doe. This was a good lead. But there had been lots of good leads — girls who looked just like Baby Doe, living in homes with months’ worth of mail piled up outside, or with parents who refused to answer the door. Herman had stood on many a front porch, Miranda forms ready, only to come face to face with a child who was very much alive. Corey handed the paperwork to the detective. “Someone has to know something,” the dentist said. Turning to advanced science While investigators searched for Baby Doe’s dental records, they were also turning to advanced forensic techniques for answers. Her DNA had already been compared, without a match, with databases of missing children. So they sent a sample to the University of North Texas Health Science Center, for scientists to examine her mitochondrial DNA, which could help identify her immediate relatives. SUZANNE KREITER/GLOBE STAFF Evidence was sent to Utah for isotope analysis. They sent a single tooth and 200 strands of hair to a lab in Salt Lake City, Utah, called IsoForensics Inc. The oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in her tissue could tell researchers where her drinking water came from, and the strontium isotopes could give them clues about the origins of what she ate and bathed in, said a research scientist at the lab, Brett Tipple. The hair is a historical record of those isotopes, he said, that will show analysts whether and where she moved. And detectives waited on the pollen test. Still hunting for justice Bad news came five days after Herman’s visit to Corey’s office. The dental sealant they had hoped could lead them straight to the girl’s identity was never there. It was a false positive, and another dead end. The detectives were working nights and weekends. Herman’s phone buzzed incessantly with pictures the other investigators sent of girls ruled out by well-being checks; sometimes, he woke up in the middle of the night thinking about Baby Doe. He could not help but see echoes of her face in little girls he passed on the street. He and other detectives returned to the scene again and again, studying the tide, and hoping that the person who dumped the body might come back. Someone knows what happened, he and other investigators thought. They did not understand how the child’s family could remain silent. “I think about her alone on the rocks and I wonder if she knew what was happening in those final moments. What was going through that little head?” said Conley, the Suffolk district attorney. “It just breaks my heart, and it lights a fire under us to keep going.” He pleaded for her caregiver to come forward. “It’s time for that person to do the right thing now and come clean about who she is and how she died,” Conley said. “Give her back her identity. Give her back her name.” Eventually, officials will have to confront the question of whether to bury Baby Doe. For now, her body is zipped into a black bag on a shelf inside an industrial walk-in cooler at the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner on Albany Street in Boston. She is surrounded by other bodies. She is identified by a bar code. Boston tips take on importance There was no time to dwell on the sealant. Test results had arrived from a Houston lab that had analyzed the pollen in a sample of the girl’s hair, as well as her blanket and clothes. The lab had given them reams of data on the presence of 39 types of pollen. Investigators gave the data to scientists at Harvard and Texas A&M and concluded that the combination the lab found, and the proportion of pollens, probably pointed to the Boston area. Scientists differ on how precisely such tests can pinpoint locations, but one of the scientists who performed the analysis at the Houston lab, Andrew Laurence, said it’s “usually pretty reliable.” For the investigators on the case, reported sightings locally now took on new weight. On Thursday, State Police Sergeant Scott Holland, who that first night had stood on the beach with Herman, pulled up to the curb at the Eagle Hill Laundromat in East Boston, where employee Sal Golisano, 62, swore he had seen Baby Doe. “I said, ‘You know, I got to say something. I’ve seen this girl. I seen her with her mother,’ ” Golisano said. The mother, Golisano said, was heavyset, with a light complexion and dirty blonde hair. Five feet 8 inches, he thought, maybe shorter. She pushed a toddler with brown hair and eyes in a stroller at another laundromat. “I feel free now,” he said. “My conscience is clear.” But Golisano had not seen the child since November. It was an unlikely lead, though Holland would comb through the roster of reported sightings, looking for others in the neighborhood. He climbed back into his truck and headed for the other laundromat. The detective was resolute as he assessed his newest bit of information. “More hay in the haystack.” Suzanne Kreiter/Globe staff Stuffed animals and dolls are part of a memorial on Deer Island.

Follow her on Twitter @evanmallen ||||| The brown-eyed, brown-haired girl who was found dead on a Boston beach on June 25 was likely a local, investigators learned last week in their first big break in the case. The girl, who investigators call \\"Baby Doe\\" as they search for clues about her identity, was found on Deer Island in the Boston Harbor. She was dressed in white pants with black polka dots, wrapped in a trash bag that contained a soft zebra-print blanket. Results of an analysis of pollen that coated Baby Doe's pants and blanket gave some focus to the case, which has generated intense attention — but no concrete leads. \\"The amount and the types of pollen that were on those items suggest that she was from the Boston area,\\" Jake Wark, spokesman for Suffolk County District Attorney Dan Conley, told NBC News. \\"That's somewhat reassuring, because that's been a theory from the start.\\" Hundreds of tips, from about 30 states and three or four countries, have poured in about the child, who Wark calls \\"our little girls.\\" None of the tips have panned out. A DNA sample hasn't turned up any information. RELATED: Authorities Launch New Billboard Campaign to Identify 'Baby Doe' Because Baby Doe's body was only in the early stages of decomposition, detectives didn't think that she had been killed long before she was found. The pollen analysis — which police reviewed with the chief arborist of Boston's Arnold Arboretum, who agreed with the findings — buoyed suspicions that Baby Doe was placed on Deer Island, rather than the idea that she washed up there after drifting from a faraway coastline. \\"At least it's a geographic location that we can target, as opposed to the entire world,\\" Wark said, adding that Deer Island is \\"the kind of place that an outsider wouldn't know too well.\\" Investigators desperately want to identify the child, believed to be about four years old. But as they knock on doors of families with little girls matching Baby Doe's description, they also hope to be greeted by kids who are very much alive, Wark said. \\"In one respect, they hope they've identified this little girl. But on the other hand, if they did, that would mean the child they are looking for is dead,\\" he said. During dozens of well-being checks, investigators have encountered little girls riding their bikes or playing with dolls. But they haven't found the family of Baby Doe. RELATED: 'Baby Doe' Discovery on Deer Island in Boston Harbor Mystifies Authorities \\"There's this cognitive dissonance of being happy that this child is alive, but being disappointed that we're no closer to identifying our Baby Doe,\\" Wark said.

Baby Doe had pierced ears and appeared to be well-nourished. An autopsy failed to identify a cause of death. RELATED: Authorities Launch New Billboard Campaign to Identify 'Baby Doe' Investigators now await the results of a second form of testing. The test looks at isotopes, a type of atom that exist for long periods of time in teeth and hair. Samples are being analyzed from Baby Doe, and should tell investigators about the water that she drank and bathed in. \\"Whether it will be more specific than the pollen, we just don't know yet,\\" Wark said. \\"It's significantly more complex, and I think there's a limited number of labs that can do it.\\" It's not clear when those results will be in. In the meantime, authorities are hoping the 84 billboards they put up in 50 locations might give them more leads.

Radcliffe Tower is all that remains of an early 15th-century stone-built manor house. The structure is a Grade I listed building and protected as a Scheduled Monument. The construction of a nearby tithe barn is not documented, but it was probably built between 1600 and 1720. It was used for storage of the local tithes (a tenth of a farm's produce). Along with Radcliffe Tower, the Parish Church of St Mary is a Grade I listed building. The town also has two Grade II* listed buildings; Dearden Fold Farmhouse, completed during the 16th century, and Radcliffe Cenotaph, built in 1922 to commemorate the First World War. Outwood Viaduct, and Radcliffe's most visible landmark, St Thomas' Church, are Grade II listed buildings. St Thomas' took nine years to complete. The first stone was laid by Viscount Grey de Wilton (grandson of the Countess Grosvenor) on 21 July 1862, and it was consecrated in 1864 by the first Bishop of Manchester, James Prince Lee. Construction of the tower began in 1870 and the building was completed in 1871. The building cost £7,273, (£670 thousand today) and the tower cost £1,800 (£160 thousand today). The first vicar was the Reverend Robert Fletcher. Radcliffe's first public ornament was a drinking fountain located at the bottom of Radcliffe New Road. It was presented to the town by a Mrs Noah Rostron in memory of her husband, and erected in August 1896. The fountain no longer exists at this location. Built in 1911 the town hall was on the junction of Water Street and Spring Lane. For many years after the town lost its urban district status, the building was unoccupied.

When they got worse and I couldn’t ignore them anymore, I was finally sent to a neurologist, who diagnosed me with ice pick headaches. I let out a sigh of relief that I didn’t even know I was holding in; I felt like I could finally breathe. Years of stress and confusion washed off of me, and I started taking a beta blocker to prevent them. I’ve been on them for a few years now, and it’s changed my life for the better. I used to be terrified of learning to drive, for many reasons, but a large one being that if I got an ice pick headache on the road, I couldn’t guarantee the safety of those around me if I was at the wheel. Now I’m considering finally getting my license (considering - I still don’t like being behind the wheel), I don’t double over in white hot pain randomly anymore, and when I do get a cluster headache, I can still function. It almost sounds a little silly, but really, they were crippling, and being able to work through them on my own? It’s the greatest gift I’ve given to myself. You know yourself better than anyone, even if you feel like you don’t know yourself. If something feels wrong, don’t just live with it - keep pushing for a correct diagnosis! Question: Why did the main character get excruciating migraines in her arms and legs? Options: A. not enough information B.

This sentence makes sense since a mother can buy a sweater for someone.

For example, if it were used in the context of praising the quality and detail of a movie or television program, it could be seen as positive. On the other hand, if it were used to complain about the difficulty of reading text on a small display, it might be seen as negative.

Explanation: This answer is more consistent with the story being described. The location is a beach and the girls have just woken up, therefore it makes sense that they would head directly to the sand to begin playing. As for the other options: (1). take turns swimming in the long ocean. Swimming in the ocean is a plausible scenario but since they just woke up, it is more likely they would start by playing in the sand, especially considering they are little. Swimming usually requires supervision and preparation, which is not mentioned in the context. (2). hold hands and stand facing each other. There's no context to suggest they would engage in such an activity. This answer does not follow the scope of the girls' actions especially being at the beach. (4). walk into the beach.

In fact, many people never read a poem once they get out of high school. It is worth reminding ourselves that this has not always been the case in prefix = st1 /America. In the nine-tenth century, a usual American activity was to sit around the fireside in the evening and read poems aloud. It is true that there was no television at the time, nor movie theaters, nor World Wide Web, to provide _ However, poems were a source of pleasure, of self - education, of connection to other people or to the world beyond one ' s own community. Reading them was a social act as well as an individual one, and perhaps even more social than individual. Writing poems to share with friends and relations was, like reading poems by the fireside, another way in which poetry has a place in everyday life. How did things change? Why are most Americans no longer comfortable with poetry , and why do most people today think that a poem has nothing to tell them and that they can do well without poems? There are, I believe, three factors: poets, teachers, and we ourselves. Of these, the least important is the third: the world surrounding the poem has betrayed us more than we have betrayed the poem. Early in the twentieth century, poetry in English headed into directions unfavor-able to reading of poetry. Readers decided that poems were not for the fireside or the easy chair at night, and that they belonged where other difficult-to-read things belonged. Poets failed the reader, so did teachers. They want their students to know something about the skills of a poem, they want their students to see that poems mean something. Yet what usually occurs when teachers push these concerns on their high school students is that young people decide poems are unpleasant crossword puzzles.

But no matter, I could tell they thought I was a bother, The woman, in fact, seemed to be chewing gum as she unemotionally clicked off a series of commands for me to perform. The next day I heard from a friend of mine who got a performance review without his boss once looking up at him. Not once. You see it everywhere. Gone are the days when people cared about you. It's a sign of the time, I suspect. But that makes me sad -- for them and for us all. People who aren't happy, who don't smile, who don't kid, who don't joke or make light of even bad situations, make for an even worse situation. And it spreads like a cancer. Someone's rude to you, you're rude to them and to the next fellow you meet, and on and on. Smiles are contagious but so annoyances. The boss who can't be bothered with his workers. The celebrity who can't be bothered with her annoying fans. You know, my mom used to judge presidential candidates by how they smiled. I would say, \\"But mom, you don't know if that smile is real.\\" \\"Oh, yes I do,\\" she would tell me. \\"I can feel it.\\" It's in their eyes, she would say. And it's in their smile. The rest just kind of falls into place. Question: Why did the writer mention his phone call?

Zappa sued Cohen for skimming more than he was allocated from DiscReet Records, as well as for signing acts of which Zappa did not approve. Cohen filed a lawsuit against Zappa in return, which froze the money Zappa and Cohen had gained from an out-of-court settlement with MGM over the rights of the early Mothers of Invention recordings. It also prevented Zappa having access to any of his previously recorded material during the trials. Zappa therefore took his personal master copies of the rock-oriented Zoot Allures (1976) directly to Warner Bros., thereby bypassing DiscReet.In the mid-1970s Zappa prepared material for Läther (pronounced \\"leather\\"), a four-LP project. Läther encapsulated all the aspects of Zappa's musical styles—rock tunes, orchestral works, complex instrumentals, and Zappa's own trademark distortion-drenched guitar solos. Wary of a quadruple-LP, Warner Bros. Records refused to release it. Zappa managed to get an agreement with Phonogram Inc., and test pressings were made targeted at a Halloween 1977 release, but Warner Bros. prevented the release by claiming rights over the material. Zappa responded by appearing on the Pasadena, California radio station KROQ, allowing them to broadcast Läther and encouraging listeners to make their own tape recordings. A lawsuit between Zappa and Warner Bros. followed, during which no Zappa material was released for more than a year. Eventually, Warner Bros. issued different versions of much of the Läther material in 1978 and 1979 as four individual albums (five full-length LPs) with limited promotion.Although Zappa eventually gained the rights to all his material created under the MGM and Warner Bros. contracts, the various lawsuits meant that for a period Zappa's only income came from touring, which he therefore did extensively in 1975–77 with relatively small, mainly rock-oriented, bands. Drummer Terry Bozzio became a regular band member, Napoleon Murphy Brock stayed on for a while, and... answer the following question: What is the first name of the person who prevented Zappa having access to any of his previously recorded material during the trials?

Movie plot title: Mother of Tears Movie plot: The film begins with members of the Catholic Church digging up the body of a 19th-century church official, whose casket has a box-shaped urn chained to it. Inside the box they discover artifacts belonging to Mater Lachrymarum (Moran Atias), the last surviving member of the Three Mothers; an ancient trio of powerful black witches. In particular, the box contains a magic cloak that, when worn by Mater Lachrymarum, increases her powers significantly. The urn is shipped to the Museum of Ancient Art in Rome where Sarah Mandy (Asia Argento), an American studying art restoration, works. Sarah is dating the curator Michael Pierce, a single father who is away from the museum that night. With help from the assistant curator, Sarah opens the box and finds the cloak, a dagger, and three statues representing the three witches. Sending Sarah to her office to retrieve tools to help her translate the text on the artifacts, the curator is promptly attacked by the demonic agents of Mater Lachrymarum. Sarah arrives too late to save her boss (who is being disembowelled by the monsters) and starts to flee the museum. Unfortunately, she is pursued by Mater Lachrymarum's familiar (a baboon) and is only able to escape when a disembodied voice magically throws open a series of locked doors keeping her trapped inside the museum. Sarah tells the police what happened as she spends the night with Michael and his son. Michael visits the Cardinal who sent him the urn only to find out that, shortly after mailing the urn to him, he had a severe stroke and is now in a coma. An assistant of the priest gives Michael a piece of paper, which the Cardinal was writing on before collapsing. On it is scrawled the name \\"Mater Lachrymarum\\". As he leaves the hospital, a pair of witches observe Michael leaving the building. Back in Rome, chaos descends as a wave of mass suicides, murder, and violence engulfs the city.

Answer: Social contract theory is a significant and influential aspect of contemporary political philosophy. It posits that the relationship between the governed and their government is based on an implicit or explicit agreement, referred to as the \\"social contract.\\" According to this political ideology, individuals agree to relinquish some personal autonomy and adhere to certain rules or norms to maintain a functioning society. The enforcement of these rules is then entrusted to a governing authority or political institutions. Social contract theory has significantly shaped Western political thought and has played a vital role in the development of modern liberal democracies. Three key philosophers – Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau – significantly contributed to the development and advancement of social contract theory. 1. Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679): Hobbes' most famous work, \\"Leviathan,\\" was an early and influential example of social contract theory, published in 1651. His thoughts on the matter came in the wake of the English Civil War, which convinced him of the necessity of strong government to prevent societal discord. Hobbes argued that in a pre-governmental state, known as the \\"state of nature,\\" human life was \\"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.\\" In this anarchic state, people lived in constant fear and pursued self-preservation above all else. To remedy this situation, Hobbes claimed that individuals would willingly enter into a social contract, surrendering their individual rights and liberties to a sovereign authority. This absolute ruler, which Hobbes referred to as the Leviathan, would provide law and order, enforce social rules, and protect subjects from external threats. In return, subjects would obey the ruler and the system of laws set in place. For Hobbes, a strong and unified government, even if oppressive, was better than the chaos that reigned in the state of nature. 2. John Locke (1632-1704): Locke, often referred to as the father of liberalism, introduced a more optimistic view of human nature and the social contract in his \\"Two Treatises of Government,\\" published in 1689. Contrary to Hobbes, Locke believed that humans lived in relative peace and cooperation in the state of nature, possessing natural rights to life, liberty, and property. For Locke, the primary purpose of government was to protect these rights. Individuals would form a social contract by instituting a government and agreeing to follow its laws. However, rather than an omnipotent sovereign, power was to be entrusted to a parliamentary system with a clear separation of powers, ensuring that no single entity had absolute control. Importantly, Locke advocated for the right to revolution if a government failed to protect the people's rights or became tyrannical. 3. Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778): Rousseau introduced a more egalitarian perspective to the social contract theory in his influential 1762 work, \\"The Social Contract.\\" For Rousseau, individuals in the state of nature were equal and autonomous. He famously claimed that \\"man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains.\\" Therefore, humanity entered into a social contract not only to secure their rights and protection but also to overcome the constraints and inequalities imposed by society. Rousseau's vision of the social contract differed from his predecessors by emphasizing the collective or \\"general will\\" as the guiding principle of political legitimacy. He argued that laws should be established through direct democracy, giving each citizen an equal voice in legislation. To ensure that the general will prevailed, Rousseau envisioned a decentralized form of government, with power dispersed among smaller communities. While not entirely against a central government, Rousseau maintained that authority should be limited, serving only to coordinate the decisions made by local communities. In conclusion, social contract theory has played a crucial role in shaping contemporary political philosophy. Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, with their respective approaches and contributions, helped lay the foundation for today's modern liberal democracies by articulating the rationale behind the existence of government, its legitimacy, and the importance of individual rights and collective will for a more just society."},{"question":"Bullseye Preparesness & Outdoors Expo will feature preparedness and outdoors vendors and exhibitors and a variety of classes, presentations, demonstrations, prizes and giveaways for attendees.

Another poem in the anthology, which Stravinsky did not set but is likely to have read, is \\"Yarila\\" which, Morton observes, contains many of the basic elements from which The Rite of Spring developed, including pagan rites, sage elders, and the propitiatory sacrifice of a young maiden: \\"The likeness is too close to be coincidental\\". Stravinsky himself gave contradictory accounts of the genesis of The Rite. In a 1920 article he stressed that the musical ideas had come first, that the pagan setting had been suggested by the music rather than the other way round. However, in his 1936 autobiography he described the origin of the work thus: \\"One day [in 1910], when I was finishing the last pages of L'Oiseau de Feu in St Petersburg, I had a fleeting vision ... I saw in my imagination a solemn pagan rite: sage elders, seated in a circle, watching a young girl dance herself to death. They were sacrificing her to propitiate the god of Spring. Such was the theme of the Sacre du Printemps\\".By May 1910 Stravinsky was discussing his idea with Nicholas Roerich, the foremost Russian expert on folk art and ancient rituals. Roerich had a reputation as an artist and mystic, and had provided the stage designs for Diaghilev's 1909 production of the Polovtsian Dances. The pair quickly agreed on a working title, \\"The Great Sacrifice\\" (Russian: Velikaia zhertva); Diaghilev gave his blessing to the work, although the collaboration was put on hold for a year while Stravinsky was occupied with his second major commission for Diaghilev, the ballet Petrushka.In July 1911 Stravinsky visited Talashkino, near Smolensk, where Roerich was staying with the Princess Maria Tenisheva, a noted patron of the arts and a sponsor of Diaghilev's magazine World of Art. Here, over several days, Stravinsky and Roerich finalised the structure of the ballet. Thomas F. Kelly, in his history of the Rite... Guess a valid title for it!","response":"A valid title for the piece, considering the context provided, could be \\"The Genesis and Evolution of The Rite of Spring: Stravinsky, Roerich, and the Sacrificial Rituals of Pagan Russia.\\" This title captures the key elements and collaborative nature of the work's creation, as well as its grounding in ancient rituals and folk traditions."},{"question":"HewaschairmanoftheMathematicsDepartmentatHarvardfrom1981to1984andMacArthurFellowfrom1987to1992.

A:","response":"Yes, the supposed perturbation would indeed have a direct impact on the process. If damage occurs to the kidneys, it can affect their ability to filter out waste effectively. This can lead to a build-up of waste products and excess water in the body, which can have several harmful effects. Moreover, the damage can reduce the number of functional nephrons, impeding the process at the stage where blood passes through these filtering units. Even if some nephrons remain unaffected, they may be strained by having to filter more blood than normal, potentially leading to further damage. This situation can also affect the circulation of clean blood out of the kidneys, as blood may not be adequately filtered before being circulated again. In addition, kidney damage can lead to an inability to produce urine effectively, leading to accumulation of waste and water in the body.

United States law distinguishes what it calls treaties from executive agreement, congressional-executive agreements, and sole executive agreements. All four classes are equally treaties under international law; they are distinct only from the perspective of internal American law. The distinctions are primarily concerning their method of approval. Whereas treaties require advice and consent by two-thirds of the Senators present, sole executive agreements may be executed by the President acting alone. Some treaties grant the President the authority to fill in the gaps with executive agreements, rather than additional treaties or protocols. And finally, congressional-executive agreements require majority approval by both the House and the Senate, either before or after the treaty is signed by the President.\\". Can you tell me what it is?","response":"Certainly. In the United States, when everything is not explicitly spelled out in a treaty, the details can be clarified through several mechanisms, primarily executive agreements, congressional-executive agreements, and sole executive agreements, which are all considered treaties under international law but have different approval processes under U.S. law. 1. Executive Agreements: These agreements are made by the President with the authority granted by an existing treaty. They help elaborate or clarify the specific provisions of the treaty without requiring any additional treaties or protocols. 2. Congressional-Executive Agreements: These agreements require approval from both the House of Representatives and the Senate by a majority vote. They can be approved either before or after the treaty is signed by the President, allowing the legislative branch to have a say in the clarification or interpretation of treaty provisions. 3. Sole Executive Agreements: The President, acting alone, can execute these agreements without needing additional approval from the Senate or the House of Representatives. They provide the President with some flexibility in clarifying or implementing treaty provisions. In summary, when a treaty does not include all the necessary details, the gaps can be filled through various types of agreements (executive, congressional-executive, and sole executive agreements), which either involve the President independently or in collaboration with the legislative branch. These agreements help clarify and implement the details of the treaty under United States law."},{"question":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: The children often play football in the garden and sometimes break Mr. Black's windows.

Set in the Stone Age, Ishbo is the younger son of Mookoo, the leader of a tribe of cavemen. Ishbo is smarter than most of his tribesmen, but awkward and nerdy, living in the shadow of his much more physically impressive brother Thudnik. He hopes to use his superior intellect to become an inventor and raise his tribe above simple sticks and stones, but due to a combination of the flimsy materials available to him and the lack of support from his tribe they always fail. Ishbo also has had a lifelong crush on his childhood friend, Fardart. Much to his dismay, immediately after he finally expresses his love to her she is \\"clubbed\\" by Thudnik (and all that follows in the tradition of caveman stereotypes), and eventually married to him. Ishbo himself has never clubbed a woman, having his heart set on Fardart his whole life. After Fardart is betrothed to Thudnik, Ishbo begins to believe that he will never club a woman. He at first is too attached to her to consider clubbing another woman, and is further discouraged after a particularly ill-fated attempt at clubbing. Ishbo becomes quite depressed, a feeling which is escalated by his failure to prove useful on a mammoth hunt.

However, each person's experiences and challenges may differ.

Becoming mentally strong: Step 1: Self-awareness Understand your thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. Recognize your strengths and weaknesses, and note areas where you need to improve. Step 2: Develop emotional intelligence Learn to manage and express your emotions effectively. This includes empathizing with others, controlling impulses, and maintaining healthy relationships. Step 3: Build resilience Cultivate the ability to bounce back from failures, setbacks, and adversity. Accept that challenges are a part of life and use these experiences for personal growth. Step 4: Establish healthy habits Prioritize self-care through regular exercise, a balanced diet, and good sleep patterns. Don't neglect your mental well-being and follow stress management techniques like mindfulness and meditation. Step 5: Set realistic goals and expectations Break down your goals into manageable steps, and celebrate small achievements. Understand your limitations and don't overburden yourself with unrealistic expectations. Step 6: Develop a growth mindset Embrace the idea that you can improve and grow through effort and learning. View challenges as opportunities to enhance your skills and knowledge. 2. Becoming a mentally strong woman: In addition to the steps mentioned above, here are some specific considerations for women: Step 1: Empower yourself Recognize and embrace your value as an individual. Seek out external sources of information and support, such as self-help books, workshops, or therapy, tailored to women's experiences. Step 2: Address gender-related barriers Acknowledge and challenge societal expectations and gender norms that may impact your mental strength. Develop strategies to persist in the face of obstacles or biases. Step 3: Surround yourself with positive role models and support Seek out relationships with other strong and supportive women. Establish a network of colleagues, mentors, and friends who can encourage your growth and resilience. Step 4: Advocate for yourself and others Use your journey to becoming mentally strong as an opportunity to advocate for other women and address gender-based disparities in various aspects of life.

So a simple procedure such as opening someone's airway can save their life while they're waiting for emergency medical help. This means you're more likely to give first aid to someone you know than a stranger. There are many misconceptions surrounding first aid. Below are the 'most popular' ones with details of what you should do. You should put butter or cream on a burn. The only thing you should put on a burn is cold water - keep the butter for cooking. Put the affected area under cold running water for at least ten minutes. The best way to treat bleeding is to put the wound under a tap. If you put a bleeding wound under a tap you wash away the body's clotting agents and make it bleed more. Instead put pressure on the wound with whatever is available to stop or slow down the flow of blood. As soon as possible call 999. Keep pressure on the wound until help arrives. Nosebleeds are best treated by putting the head back. If you put the head back during a nosebleed, all the blood goes down the back of the airway. Instead advise them to tilt their head forwards and ask the person to pinch the end of their nose and breathe through their mouth. You need lots of training to do first aid. You don't - what you mostly need is common sense. You can learn enough first aid in a few minutes to save someone's life - whether it's from a book, attending a course or watching videos online. Remember: anyone can save a life The most important point to save a person's life is to ensure _ . A) his smooth breath B) ambulances' arriving time C) the quiet surroundings D) emergency medical help","response":"The most important point to save a person's life is to ensure A) his smooth breath. Ensuring that the individual can breathe properly is critical in emergency situations involving a blocked airway. Timely opening of someone's airway can save their life while they're waiting for emergency medical help. There are several misconceptions about first aid that people should be aware of: 1. Putting butter or cream on a burn: This is incorrect, and the only thing that should be applied to a burn is cold water. Pour cold running water over the affected area for at least ten minutes to reduce pain and damage. 2. Treating bleeding by putting the wound under a tap: This is not a proper method, as it washes away the body's clotting agents and can worsen bleeding. Instead, apply pressure on the wound with anything available to stop or slow down blood flow and call emergency services. Maintain pressure until help arrives. 3. Treating nosebleeds by tilting the head back: This is not advisable because tilting the head back causes blood to flow down the back of the airway. The correct way to treat a nosebleed is by tilting the head forwards, pinching the end of the nose, and breathing through the mouth. 4. Believing extensive first aid training is needed: While formal training is helpful in learning first aid techniques and skills, it's not always necessary. Common sense, along with understanding simple first aid procedures from books, courses, or online videos, can enable anyone to save a life during an emergency. Remember, having basic first aid knowledge can be invaluable in emergency situations, and ensuring a person's smooth breath is a critical step in saving their life."},{"question":"I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

The test flight fails as his right wing breaks, sending him crashing into the Seine River. Later after the incident, Woody is asked by his friend, CIA file clerk Harry, to perform what appears to be a civilian paper swap in Istanbul. Upon arriving in Istanbul, he meets a beautiful Soviet named Natalia Rambova, who poses as the Soviet civilian with whom the exchange is supposed to take place, but it is later revealed that she is in fact a KGB spy. Woody does not tell Natalia his real name, and instead fabricates his identity to her as a top American agent code-named \\"Condorman\\". During the encounter, Woody fends off a group of would-be assassins and saves her life by sheer luck before accomplishing the paper trade. Impressed by Woody, and disgusted by how she was treated by her lover/boss Krokov when she returns to Moscow, Natalia decides to defect and asks the CIA to have \\"Condorman\\" be the agent that helps her.Back in Paris, Woody's encounter with Natalia inspires him to create a super heroine patterned after her named \\"Laser Lady\\".

Select your answer: was the movie seen positively or negatively based on the preceding review? [a]. negative. [b]. positive.","response":"Based on the sentence provided in the movie review, the movie was seen negatively. The reviewer states that the movie \\"once again strands his superb performers in the same old story.\\" This suggests that despite having talented actors, the film was unable to provide them with a fresh or captivating storyline, resulting in a repetitive or uninspired experience for the viewer. Furthermore, the phrase \\"once again\\" implies that this is not the first time this issue has arisen in the filmmaker's work, leading to further disappointment and unmet expectations. The reviewer seems to acknowledge and appreciate the skilled actors but is left unsatisfied with how they were utilized within the movie. Their frustration can be understood as a missed opportunity, where a potentially successful film fell short due to a lack of creativity or originality in its storytelling. The disappointment emphasized in this review sets a largely negative tone and offers the assumption that the movie may not have received much praise or acclaim in other aspects as well. In contrast to a positive review, which would likely focus on elements such as engaging plot points, innovative cinematic techniques, or strong character development, this single sentence primarily emphasizes what went wrong or was not successful. Therefore, it can be concluded that the movie was seen negatively based on the preceding review.

As one NSC staff note put it, \\"Under the Taliban, Afghanistan is not so much a state sponsor of terrorism as it is a state sponsored by terrorists.\\" In early 2000, the United States began a high-level effort to persuade Pakistan to use its influence over the Taliban. In January 2000, Assistant Secretary of State Karl Inderfurth and the State Department's counterterrorism coordinator, Michael Sheehan, met with General Musharraf in Islamabad, dangling before him the possibility of a presidential visit in March as a reward for Pakistani cooperation. Such a visit was coveted by Musharraf, partly as a sign of his government's legitimacy. He told the two envoys that he would meet with Mullah Omar and press him on Bin Laden.

But President Clinton insisted on including Pakistan in the itinerary for his trip to South Asia. His one-day stopover on March 25, 2000, was the first time a U.S. president had been there since 1969.

He held the office of Speaker of the House of Representatives between 1929 and 1935. Therefore, the text fits within the 'office holder' category as it depicts the life and work of an individual who held a significant public office. The paragraph does not evidently relate to any of the other listed categories like company, educational institution, artist, athlete, means of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film, or written work. In detail, 'office holder' typically refers to an individual who has been appointed or elected to a public or private position of trust or responsibility, such as a corporation executive or government official. Public offices can range from local positions, such as mayor or city council member, to national roles, like member of parliament, senator, or president. In this particular context, László Almásy carried the office of the Speaker of the House of Representatives in Hungary, which affirms his classification as an office holder. His accomplishments and roles as a jurist and soldier further emphasize his public service, although these aspects of his identity do not fit precisely into the category of 'office holder'.

The Eagles star pulled out of a concert scheduled for July 17 in Cleveland, after he says he was misled about its mission. “It was my understanding that I was playing a concert which was a non-partisan event to benefit the families of American veterans,” Walsh says, via Facebook. “Today it was announced that this event is, in fact, a launch for the Republican National Convention. In addition, my name is to be used to raise sponsorship dollars for convention-related purposes. Therefore, I must humbly withdraw my participation in this event with apologies to any fans or veterans and their families that I might disappoint.” Aside from apparently feeling misled, Walsh said he is also upset with the tone of this year’s campaign – specifically citing “the rampant vitriol, fear-mongering and bullying coming from the current Republican campaigns. It is both isolationist and spiteful,” he added. “I cannot in good conscience endorse the Republican party in any way.” Walsh now joins Cheap Trick in refusing to play for the GOP. “The Republican National Committee called our office and offered us 100,000 to play at their convention in Cleveland,” Robin Zander told The Guardian, before making a joke at the party’s expense. “We turned it down,” Zander said. “Then we had second thoughts.

The specific term you are looking for is \\"mutualism\\" or \\"obligate mutualism,\\" which refers to the type of relationship in which a plant depends on a single type of insect. However, the original statement can be expanded upon to provide a more detailed and long answer that addresses the question effectively. Mutualism, a form of symbiosis, describes a close and long-term interaction between two species (in this case, plants and insects) in which both organisms benefit from the relationship. In obligate mutualism, the relationship between the two species is not just beneficial but essential for their survival and reproduction. This mutual dependency drives co-evolution, which refers to the process where two or more species reciprocally influence each other’s evolution. Regarding the co-evolution of flowering plants and animals that pollinate them, this interaction has played a crucial role in the formation and maintenance of various ecosystems. As plants evolved to develop various mechanisms to attract their preferred pollinators, the pollinators also evolved to become more efficient and specialized in collecting resources like nectar or pollen. In examples of obligate mutualism, certain plant species have developed very specialized morphological features to attract and ensure pollination specifically by their preferred, single type of insect. These features may include specific shapes, colors, scents, or nectar rewards that appeal to one particular pollinator, while being unattractive or inaccessible for others. One well-known example of this phenomenon is the relationship between figs and fig wasps. The unique structure of the fig fruit (technically called a syconium) accommodates the life cycle of the fig wasp, which pollinates the fig plant. Female fig wasps enter the fig, wherein they lay their eggs and die. As the fig develops, the wasp larvae feed on the plant tissues, before emerging as adults. Upon their exit, they inadvertently spread pollen from the fig they inhabited, thus pollinating other fig plants. This relationship is crucial for the survival of both parties: the fig depends on the wasp for pollination and reproduction, while the wasp relies on the fig for a suitable environment for reproduction and provision for its offspring. In summary, while symbiosis does indeed play a major role in the co-evolution of plants and their pollinators, the specific word you are seeking to describe the kind of relationship in which a plant depends on a single type of insect is \\"mutualism\\" or \\"obligate mutualism.\\" These relationships foster mutual dependency and drive the co-evolution of both the plant and the insect involved, shaping the world of flora and fauna as we know it today."},{"question":"Dialogue: Freya: Hey, Hope you're enjoying Austria :P I have a medical query: if I donated a kidney (or some other organ), and during the transfer operation it was rejected by that person's body, could I have that organ back??

The debate is primarily on the left, or among the Democrats, where partisans are furiously arguing along two intersecting fronts: First, the public option is or is not an essential element of reform. Second, abandoning the public option will or will not make passing the remainder of reform more likely. Let’s start with Washington Post columnist Steven Pearlstein, who’s in the not-essential, more-likely-to-pass-without-it camp. Or, as he writes today: “Enough already with the public option!” It is not the be-all and end-all of health-care reform. It is not the long-awaited safety net for the uninsured. And if, as many liberals hope, it turns out to be nothing more than Medicare for All, it won’t do anything to hold down long-term growth in health spending. The public option is nothing more than a political litmus test imposed on the debate by left-wing politicians and pundits who don’t want to be bothered with the real-life dynamics of the health-care market. It is the Maginot Line of health-care policy, and just like those stubborn French generals, liberal Democrats have vowed to defend it even if it means losing the war. . . . By insisting on a government-run plan, liberals have played right into the hands of Republicans who aim to defeat any reform by mischaracterizing it as a government takeover. If there is anything that’s been made clear over the last two weeks, it is that the public option is a political non-starter that threatens the entire reform effort. It’s time to let it go. Conor Clarke, guest-blogging for Andrew Sullivan, makes many of the same points today in a post titled “Time to Let Go of the Public Option.” I have decently warm feelings about a public option, but I don’t think it’s a good site for an all-consuming pitched battle over the fate of American health-care reform. The public option is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for successful health-care reform (defined as expanded coverage that is more cost effective). Ezra Klein is dubious about how attractive a PO-less reform would be to Republicans. “Loudly letting go of the public option wouldn’t necessarily secure additional votes so much as it would increase the confidence of opponents and depress supporters,” Klein writes at his Washington Post blog today. If the forces arrayed against health-care reform could spend two weeks assailing end-of-life counseling, they can find another provision in the bill, too. Maybe the exchanges, Or the subsidies. Or MedPAC. They’re committed to defeating Barack Obama and the Democrats, not erasing a particular section of the bill. To be clear, Klein is reluctantly willing to deal the PO, but only at the right time and for the right price: If the public option needs to be dropped to secure passage of the final bill, then that may be the unfortunate reality of the situation. But that’s the context in which you drop something like the public option: A context in which you get something significant for the concession, like passage of everything else, or much more money in subsidies and much stronger exchanges. That’s pretty much the same place Matt Yglesias is in. Writing at the Daily Beast on Monday, when the big whoop was whether or not Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius had the day before signaled a willingness to abandon the PO, Yglesias said, “One can still easily imagine a health-reform plan that would be a monumental progressive achievement even without a public option.” Yglesias ticks off all the things the various reform bills would fix or improve. Those already insured would get: A set of consumer protections that would cap out-of-pocket health costs, guarantee access to preventive care, and prevent insurers from treating people well as long as they’re healthy only to start monkeying around when they get sick. This would be a big deal. The bills in Congress also envision expanding the Medicaid program that currently serves the poor. This would only help a relatively narrow slice of the near-poor, but for those who are helped, the help would be enormous. For “the self-employed, the unemployed, and those working for small firms” who are “at a huge disadvantage,” in the current set-up, the current bills offer a “three-fold fix.” First, force insurers to offer a defined set of benefits to all comers at a fixed price—no discrimination based on gender, health status, whatever. Second, fix the adverse-selection problem this causes by mandating that everyone get themselves some health insurance. Third, to fix the economic hardship this might apply to some families, offer generous subsidies to ensure affordability for all. This would, if done correctly, more-or-less solve the problem of the uninsured. Even without the PO, concludes Yglesias, a bill that accomplishes all that “would be a huge win for the uninsured, the poor, the anxiety-stricken middle class, and ultimately for the economy as a whole.” It wouldn’t be an ideal health plan or the best bill you can imagine. But it’s no exaggeration to say that it would be the greatest progressive legislative accomplishment in four decades, and that’s nothing to sneer at. Writing at his site, FiveThirtyEight, Nate Silver agrees: The fundamental accomplishments of a public option-less bill would be to (1) ensure that no American could be denied coverage because of a pre-existing condition or because they became sick; (2) subsidize health insurance coverage for millions of poor and middle-class Americans. These are major, major accomplishments. Arguably, they are accomplished at too great a cost. But let’s look at it like this. The CBO estimates that the public option would save about 150 billion over the next ten years — that’s roughly 1,100 for every taxpayer. I’m certainly not thrilled to have to pay an additional 1,100 in taxes because some Blue Dog Democrats want to placate their friends in the insurance industry. But I think the good in this health care bill — the move toward universal-ish coverage, the cost-control provisions — is worth a heck of a lot more than 1,100. At Slate, Tim Noah is ready to take on all these comers. He says health reform without PO just won’t work. “At the broadest possible level,” he wrote yesterday, “the public option is necessary simply because it’s impossible to identify a successful health system anywhere in the world based on a for-profit insurance model.” If profit-driven health insurance could be made to work, then surely somebody would have figured it out by now. Paul Krugman, in an Aug. 17 New York Times column, likens health reform to the reforms Switzerland instituted in 1994: “[E]veryone is required to buy insurance, insurers can’t discriminate based on medical history or pre-existing conditions, and lower-income citizens get government help in paying for their policies.” But there’s a significant difference. In Switzerland, private insurers are required to provide basic health coverage on a nonprofit basis. Under Obamacare, private insurers will continue to seek profits, and it’s quite possible that the new regulatory restraints imposed on them (take all comers, don’t punish the sick with higher premiums, don’t seek out fine-print reasons to cancel policies after policyholders get sick, etc.) will inspire them to find ever-more-ingenious ways to avoid payouts. President Obama often says that a public option will help keep the private insurers honest. What he doesn’t say, but surely knows, is that private insurers’ duties to their shareholders may be irreconcilable with their duties to their customers. Should that prove true, a public option would provide a necessary refuge. Though Noah see the PO as crucial, it may a good question to ask whether the White House does. This morning the Washington Post quoted an anonymous White House official, who is stumped by the support for the PO coming from within the president’s party. “I don’t understand why the left of the left has decided that this is their Waterloo,” said a senior White House adviser, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “We’ve gotten to this point where health care on the left is determined by the breadth of the public option. I don’t understand how that has become the measure of whether what we achieve is health-care reform.” “It’s a mystifying thing,” he added. “We’re forgetting why we are in this.” Lots of bloggers have been scratching their heads over this one today. Though not Jame Hamsher at Firedoglake, who argues today that from the White House’s point of view, the PO was a bargaining chip all along. If a public plan gets into a final health care bill, it’s going to be because of public pressure, because people who put Obama in office demand one. Because in the grand scheme of White House priorities, it was something that could acceptably be dealt away in pursuit of a higher political objective by the guy who was calling the plays: Rahm Emanuel.

Options: - intelligence - overconfidence - knowing more - better understanding - growth Step-by-step reasoning process below:","response":"When someone is learning, multiple things can happen to their knowledge base. Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to better describe the possible outcomes: 1. Intelligence: As a person acquires new information and skills, their intelligence can increase. Intelligence refers to the ability to apply knowledge effectively and adapt to new situations. By learning, a person can develop their problem-solving skills, critical thinking abilities, and overall cognitive capacity. 2. Overconfidence: Sometimes, when a person learns a little about a subject, they may develop overconfidence. Overconfidence means having an inflated belief in one's abilities or expertise. Without thoroughly understanding a complex topic, an individual might believe they know more than they do and make mistakes or express too much confidence in their judgments. 3. Knowing more: By definition, learning is the acquisition of knowledge or skills through experience, study, or being taught. As a person learns about a subject, their knowledge base expands, resulting in a deeper understanding of the topic. 4. Better understanding: A person's learning journey doesn't only involve acquiring new information but also involves making connections between pieces of information in their knowledge base. This process helps them develop a better understanding of concepts and ideas, allowing them to analyze and integrate new knowledge more effectively. 5. Growth: Learning facilitates personal growth. Expanding the knowledge base gives a person access to more ideas and perspectives, contributing to emotional, intellectual, and social development. As a person learns and grows, they become more open to incorporating new ideas and viewpoints, making them more adaptable and empathetic. In conclusion, when someone is learning, numerous outcomes can affect their knowledge base, including increased intelligence, potential overconfidence, knowing more, obtaining a better understanding, and experiencing personal growth. These possibilities are not mutually exclusive and can occur simultaneously or at different stages of the learning process."},{"question":"Single/multi-choice problem: Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: Prevent eyeshadow from falling on cheeck. Possible answers: [+] Place a sticky note under eye.; [+] Place a sticky note over eye.;","response":"Okay, little buddy, imagine this: you want to stop eyeshadow from falling on your cheek, like when your mom puts on makeup. You've got two choices: 1. Place a sticky note under the eye: This way, the sticky note acts like a little umbrella, catching any eyeshadow that might fall and keeping your cheek clean and free of eyeshadow. 2. Place a sticky note over the eye: But if you put the sticky note on top of your eye, it would cover the area where you want to apply the eyeshadow. So, you won't be able to put any eyeshadow on your eye, and that's not what we want, right? So, the better solution here is to place a sticky note under the eye, that way your cheek stays clean while you can still put on eyeshadow.

Clinton emphasized her own experience as first lady, senator and secretary of state, saying she would provide the steady diplomacy the country needs. “National security is the foundation of how we make sure our interests are pursued in the world,” said Louis Goodman, Emeritus Dean of International Relations at American University in an interview with VOA. With polls show terrorism is a major concern among Americans, Clinton targeted Trump's positions on the issue. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has promised to temporarily block Muslims from crossing U.S. borders. \\"The struggle against radical Islam also takes place in our homeland. There are scores of recent migrants inside our borders charged with terrorism. For every case known to the public, there are dozens more. We must stop importing extremism through senseless immigration policies,\\" Trump said in a foreign policy speech in April. Trump's other anti-terrorism proposals include a pledge to torture and murder the families of suspected terrorists and target Islamic State. \\"I have a simple message for them,\\" Trump said. \\"Their days are numbered. I won't tell them where and I won't tell them how. But they will be gone. And soon.\\" But...

Immigration policy changes depend on various factors, including the election outcomes, political dynamics, and priorities of the administration in power. It's important to note that both Clinton and Trump have different stances on immigration, and the policy changes would depend on who got elected and the supporting majority in Congress. However, even after the election, policies may not change immediately due to more pressing issues that the government needs to address or the pace of legislation in Congress."},{"question":"Elánius sklopil oči na prsa a pak je zase zvedl.

The power goes out, so Kurt and Brian go outside to check the fuses; Tommy follows with his camera. After finding the fuses charred and partially melted, they head into the woods to investigate a transformer which is throwing sparks. They find a UFO in a nearby field. As they watch from the treeline, two aliens exit the ship and use a ray-gun on a cow. Despite their attempt to remain hidden, the three men are spotted. One of the aliens raises its weapon and burns Brian's hand. They rush back to the house and try to convince their incredulous family to flee while there is still time. They see lights in the sky and a furtive figure outside a window, but the family refuses to believe the brothers' story until Tommy plays them the tape. Suddenly, a high-frequency screech incapacitates everyone but five-year-old Rose. When it stops, Kurt straps a flashlight to his shotgun and decides to get everyone in his truck and leave. The truck will not start. The battery has melted so they return to the house. As they take stock of the situation they hear scrabbling sounds from the roof and discover that an alien has made its way in through an open window. Kurt leads the way up the stairs and begins to search. Tommy takes the opportunity to go into his bedroom and change his soiled pants when he is ambushed by an alienâit (apparently) puts him in a trance, investigates his camera, and slips away, leaving Tommy with no memory of the encounter. Tommy is awakened by the shouts of Kurt, who has trapped an alien in an adjacent room. They are greeted by a laser shot and Kurt responds with his shotgun. Everyone retreats downstairs. A ball of light floats into the house and puts Renee into a coma.

Explanation: 1. \\"Happy dog\\" - This refers to a dog that is feeling good and joyful. Just like people, animals can have feelings and be happy or sad, and a happy dog usually wags its tail and plays. 2. \\"Played\\" - This means the dog is engaging in a fun and enjoyable activity. When dogs play, they might run, jump, or chase things like toys. 3. \\"Bouncing red ball\\" - This is a round object that is red in color and can bounce up and down when you throw it or drop it. Balls can be used for many games and are fun to play with. 4. \\"At the park\\" - This describes the location where the dog is playing. A park is a public place with grass, trees, and play areas, where people and animals can spend time outdoors and have fun.

The tweet states: \\"It was fun while it lasted.. No more 9.A\\" Generally, sentiment analysis classifies text into three main categories: positive, negative, or neutral. In this case, the sentiment of the tweet appears to be a mix of both positive and negative emotions. Positive sentiment: The first part of the tweet, \\"It was fun while it lasted,\\" shows a sense of nostalgia or fond memories of a past experience that was enjoyable (fun) for the user. This expression indicates that they appreciated the time they spent in this particular situation or activity, making this part of the tweet convey a positive sentiment. Negative sentiment: The second part of the tweet, \\"No more 9.A,\\" communicates that the enjoyable experience has come to an end and the user is possibly sad or disappointed about it. The phrase \\"no more\\" signifies something is no longer occurring or available, which may give a sense of finality or loss, leading to a negative sentiment.

Answer: Pigs are omnivores and are highly social and intelligent animals. Question: what do pigs eat","response":"Yes, the given answer is correct in addressing the question about what pigs eat, as it states that pigs are omnivores. Pigs, being omnivores, consume a wide variety of plant and animal sources in their diet. They naturally forage for roots, tubers, leaves, fruits, and even insects, small mammals, and reptiles in the wild. Pigs are also known for their excellent scavenging capabilities, which allows them to consume anything that is edible and available in their environment. In domestic settings, pigs are often fed a well-balanced diet consisting of grains, vegetables, fruit, and protein sources, such as soy, fish meal, or milk products. This ensures they receive essential nutrients in their diet for a healthy life. Consequently, they are more likely to be offered food waste and agricultural by-products, including cereal by-products, vegetables, fruits, and even bread. Farmers also supplement their diet with vitamins and minerals for optimal growth, reproduction, and overall health. The adaptable digestive system of pigs allows them to utilize nutrients from various food sources, making them highly efficient and economically significant livestock animals. In modern agriculture, the focus on sustainable food production has led to the increased use of alternative feed sources for pigs, including waste products from food processing industries. This not only reduces waste but also lowers the cost of feeding pigs and reduces their environmental impact. Moreover, the social and intelligent nature of pigs is noteworthy, as they display complex social behaviors and are capable of learning new tasks quickly. They have excellent memory and are known to have cognitive abilities comparable to those of dogs and primates. This aspect of their behavior adds to the fascinating nature of these animals, and it is essential to provide them with adequate mental stimulation and social interaction for their well-being. To summarize, the answer \\"Pigs are omnivores and are highly social and intelligent animals\\" correctly answers the question about what pigs eat by emphasizing their omnivorous nature. They have a diverse diet that can include plant-based materials and various animal sources, both in the wild and in captivity. Additionally, their social and cognitive abilities make them an intriguing and resourceful species."},{"question":"I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

Is Amer reassured him that the army was prepared for confrontation, but Nasser doubted Amer's assessment of the military's readiness. a good answer to this question?","response":"No, the given response does not directly answer the question of who was Nassir's vice president. Instead, it provides an insight into the relationship between Nassir and someone named Amer, potentially Zakaria Mohieddin or Abdel Hakim Amer, and their discussion about military readiness. A more appropriate response to the question would be: Gamal Abdel Nasser, the second President of Egypt, who served from 1956 to 1970, had multiple vice presidents during his tenure. However, his most notable vice president and successor was Anwar Sadat. Sadat served as the vice president of Egypt from 1969 until Nasser's death in 1970. After Nasser's death, Sadat became the President of Egypt and remained in power until his assassination in 1981. Prior to Anwar Sadat's appointment, other significant vice presidents under Nasser included Abdel Hakim Amer and Zakaria Mohieddin. These individuals were key figures in Egyptian politics during the Nasser era. Abdel Hakim Amer was a military officer and political leader who played a pivotal role in Egypt's revolution of 1952. He was appointed as vice president in 1956 and held various military and political positions until his downfall in 1967 following the Six-Day War. Zakaria Mohieddin, another military officer and co-founder of the revolutionary Free Officers Movement, also served as vice president and held various positions in the Egyptian government, such as minister of interior and prime minister, during Nasser's tenure.

On June 21, 2005, the day of the release of his album TheFutureEmbrace, Corgan took out full-page advertisements in the Chicago Tribune and Chicago Sun-Times to announce that he planned to reunite the band. \\"For a year now\\", Corgan wrote, \\"I have walked around with a secret, a secret I chose to keep. But now I want you to be among the first to know that I have made plans to renew and revive the Smashing Pumpkins. I want my band back, and my songs, and my dreams\\". Corgan and Chamberlin were verified as participants in the reunion, but there was question as to whether other former members of the band would participate.In April 2007 Iha and Auf der Maur separately confirmed that they were not taking part in the reunion. Chamberlin would later state that Iha and Wretzky \\"didn't want to be a part of\\" the reunion. The Smashing Pumpkins performed live for the first time since 2000 on May 22, 2007, in Paris, France. There, the band unveiled new touring members: guitarist Jeff Schroeder, bassist Ginger Reyes, and keyboardist Lisa Harriton. That same month, \\"Tarantula\\" was released as the first single from the band's forthcoming album. On July 7, the band performed at the Live Earth concert in New Jersey.The band's new album, Zeitgeist, was released that same month on Reprise Records, entering the Billboard charts at number two and selling 145,000 copies in its first week. Zeitgeist received mixed reviews, with much of the criticism targeted at the absence of half of the original lineup. The album divided the Pumpkins' fanbase. Corgan would later admit, \\"I know a lot of our fans are puzzled by Zeitgeist. I think they wanted this massive, grandiose work, but you don't just roll out of bed after seven years without a functioning band and go back to doing that\\".

Which member of the Royal family divorced on April 23rd 1992 and married again 8 months later?","response":"The member of the Royal family who divorced on April 23rd, 1992 and married again eight months later is Princess Anne, the only daughter of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, and the second oldest of their four children. Princess Anne holds the title of Princess Royal, which is a title traditionally given by a British monarch to their eldest daughter. Princess Anne was first married to Mark Phillips, a Lieutenant in the British Army and a skilled equestrian who she met through their shared passion for horse riding. The couple married on November 14, 1973, at Westminster Abbey in London, in a ceremony that was watched by millions on television. They had two children together: Peter Phillips, born in 1977, and Zara Phillips, born in 1981. However, their marriage was not without its challenges, and reports of tensions between them began to surface in the British press. In the late 1980s, both Princess Anne and Mark Phillips were linked with other partners. By the early 1990s, it was apparent that their marriage had broken down irreparably. On April 23, 1992, Princess Anne and Mark Phillips officially divorced, marking the end of their 19-year-long marriage. It was a significant moment for the British Royal Family, as Princess Anne became the first of Queen Elizabeth II's children to divorce. Eight months later, on December 12, 1992, Princess Anne married Commander Timothy Laurence, a Royal Navy officer. Their courtship had been kept relatively private, and the wedding took place at Crathie Kirk near Balmoral in Scotland. This was a significantly smaller and more intimate ceremony than her first marriage. Timothy Laurence was later granted the title of Vice Admiral Sir Timothy Laurence. Now married for over 28 years, Princess Anne and Sir Timothy Laurence have been happily together, with Princess Anne continuing her royal duties and working closely with a range of charitable organizations. While her marriage to Mark Phillips may have captured public attention, her relationship with Sir Timothy Laurence has been characterized by a greater sense of stability, privacy, and devotion."},{"question":"Premise: A man in a kilt and sporting full facial hair is standing in front of Bradford's and holding a package. Hypothesis: The man is sitting on the ground. .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","response":"No, we cannot conclude the hypothesis from the given premise. To further elaborate, the premise provides us with the following information: 1. The man is wearing a kilt. 2. The man has full facial hair. 3. The man is standing in front of Bradford's (which could be a store or a location, though it is not specified in the premise). 4. The man is holding a package. While the premise offers detailed information about the man's attire and what he is doing, it does not mention anything about his sitting or standing position. We can infer that he is standing from the phrase \\"standing in front of Bradford's.\\" However, the hypothesis is contradictory to this information, as it suggests that the man is sitting on the ground. Based on the information provided in the premise, we can't conclude the hypothesis since it contradicts the stated detail that the man is standing. Instead, we can infer that the man is standing in front of Bradford's while wearing a kilt, having full facial hair, and holding a package. A possible interpretation of this scenario could be that the man is waiting for someone, or might have received or is about to deliver the package. Additionally, to validate the hypothesis, more information would be needed to suggest that the man has changed his position from standing to sitting on the ground."},{"question":"What is the most logical next event?

There are two religious university campuses in Canberra: Signadou in the northern suburb of Watson is a campus of the Australian Catholic University; St Mark's Theological College in Barton is part of the secular Charles Sturt University.The Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA) and the Royal Military College, Duntroon are located in the inner-northern suburb of Campbell. ADFA teaches military undergraduates and postgraduates and includes UNSW@ADFA, a campus of the University of New South Wales; Duntroon provides Australian Army officer training. Tertiary level vocational education is also available through the multi-campus Canberra Institute of Technology.In 2016 there were 132 schools in Canberra; 87 were operated by the government and 45 were private. During 2006, the ACT Government announced closures of up to 39 schools, to take effect from the end of the school year, and after a series of consultations unveiled its Towards 2020: Renewing Our Schools policy. As a result, some schools closed during the 2006–08 period, while others were merged; the creation of combined primary and secondary government schools will proceed over the next decade. The new policy has provoked significant opposition. Most suburbs are planned to include a primary and a nearby preschool; these are usually located near open areas where recreational and sporting activities are easily available.

He is a fourth-generation San Franciscan. His father is of mostly Irish descent; one of Newsom's maternal great-grandfathers, Scotsman Thomas Addis, was a pioneer scientist in the field of nephrology and a professor of medicine at Stanford University. Newsom is the second cousin, twice removed, of musician Joanna Newsom. On May 14, 1991, Newsom and his investors created the company PlumpJack Associates L.P. In 1992, the group started the PlumpJack Winery with the financial help of his family friend Gordon Getty. PlumpJack was the name of an opera written by Getty, who invested in 10 of Newsom's 11 businesses. Getty told the San Francisco Chronicle that he treated Newsom like a son and invested in his first business venture because of that relationship. According to Getty, later business investments were because of \\"the success of the first.\\" One of Newsom's early interactions with government occurred when Newsom resisted the San Francisco Health Department requirement to install a sink at his PlumpJack wine store. The Health Department argued that wine was a food. The department required the store to install a 27,000 sink in the carpeted wine shop on the grounds that the shop needed the sink for a mop. When Newsom was later appointed supervisor, he told the San Francisco Examiner: \\"That's the kind of bureaucratic malaise I'm going to be working through.\\" The business grew to an enterprise with more than 700 employees. The PlumpJack Cafe Partners L.P. opened the PlumpJack Cafe, also on Fillmore Street, in 1993. Between 1993 and 2000, Newsom and his investors opened several other businesses that included the PlumpJack Squaw Valley Inn with a PlumpJack Cafe (1994), the Napa Valley winery (1995), the Balboa Cafe Bar and Grill (1995), the PlumpJack Development Fund L.P. (1996), the MatrixFillmore Bar (1998), PlumpJack Wines shop Noe Valley branch (1999), PlumpJackSport retail clothing (2000), and a second Balboa Cafe at Squaw Valley (2000). Newsom's investments included five restaurants and two retail clothing stores. Newsom's annual income was greater than 429,000 from 1996 to 2001. In 2002, his business holdings were valued at more than 6.9 million. Newsom gave a monthly 50 gift certificate to PlumpJack employees whose business ideas failed, because in his view, \\"There can be no success without failure.\\" Newsom sold his share of his San Francisco businesses when he became mayor in 2004. He maintained his ownership in the PlumpJack companies outside San Francisco that included the PlumpJack Winery in Oakville, California, new PlumpJack-owned Cade Winery in Angwin, California, and the PlumpJack Squaw Valley Inn. He is currently the president in absentia of Airelle Wines Inc., which is connected to the PlumpJack Winery in Napa County. Newsom earned between 141,000 and 251,000 in 2007 from his business interests. In February 2006, he paid 2,350,000 for his residence in the Russian Hill neighborhood, which he put on the market in April 2009, for 2,995,000.

Never mind employers can ask you to leave at any time. After all, job hunting is a huge inconvenience. There is ONE exception to this rule: NOT GETTING PAID. I am not talking about if accounting messes up and you have to wait an extra day or two to get paid. If you are a good employer, I won’t be happy, but I am understanding. I am talking refusing to pay or being even rumored to be not paying. I am not in the volunteer business for business owners.

I’ve known a few amateur actors. But, those auditions do not include showing up for a week to work unpaid so maybe you might get hired from talking to them… And waiters don’t do auditions!

Four overlapping ecological regions have been identified on the Table Rocks, with considerable differences in the variety of wildlife found in each. From the outermost base of the rocks, three regions consisting of oak savanna, chaparral, and mixed woodland surround the relatively flat tops. The andesite cap is covered by the fourth region, mounded prairie. This region formed when the caps were slowly eroded by the freezing and thawing of water that seeped into the ground (ice erosion), which created layers of mounded soil. Vernal pools fill in from October to June in the mounded prairie area due to the andesite's impermeability. The pools support species of plants and animals. Over 340 species of plants grow on the rocks, including approximately 200 species of wildflowers. Some of the most common wildflowers are western buttercups, desert parsley, bicolor lupine, and California goldfields. Camas and death camas also grow on the rocks. Camas produces an edible bulb, while death camas is poisonous and was used by the Takelma as an anesthetic.More than 70 species of animals are known to live on the Table Rocks. Lizards such as the western fence lizard, southern alligator lizard, and western skink have been seen in all four regions of the Table Rocks. Western rattlesnakes and two species of garter snakes also live in all regions. Black-tailed deer, coyotes, and bobcats are some of the mammals that live on the Table Rocks. The rocks are also home to western black-legged ticks, although they are mainly found in the chaparral region. Many species of birds live on the rocks.The Table Rocks experience a Mediterranean climate. The average wind speed in the area is less than 6 miles per hour (10 km/h), and the annual precipitation is approximately 18 inches (460 mm) due to the rain shadow created by the Klamath Mountains.

Context: In December 1831, he joined the Beagle expedition as a gentleman naturalist and geologist. He read Charles Lyell's Principles of Geology and from the first stop ashore, at St. Jago, found Lyell's uniformitarianism a key to the geological history of landscapes. Darwin discovered fossils resembling huge armadillos, and noted the geographical distribution of modern species in hope of finding their \\"centre of creation\\". The three Fuegian missionaries the expedition returned to Tierra del Fuego were friendly and civilised, yet to Darwin their relatives on the island seemed \\"miserable, degraded savages\\", and he no longer saw an unbridgeable gap between humans and animals.

Regrettably, it proved to be an utter disappointment that fails to meet any of the great expectations it had promised. Despite the promising cast and dramatic premise, \\"Once Upon A Tragedy\\" disappointingly descends into a monotonous, disjointed jumble of poorly executed scenes and superficial characters, with no evident display of emotional depth or coherent storytelling. The film's lackluster script, penned by screenwriter John Penman, feels like a hasty concoction of mundane dialogues and worn-out clichés. The narrative attempts to traverse the depths of human sorrow by exploring the tragic lives of a multi-generational family, but quickly loses sight of its central themes and dissolves into aimless meandering. The script shockingly neglects the crucial element of character development, reducing the potentially captivating protagonists into mere caricatures of pain and suffering with no discernible layers or nuance. This, in turn, dilutes the emotional gravitas the film earnestly aspires to possess. LeRoux, whose acclaimed repertoire of visually arresting and impactful films had once garnered such admiration, seems to have lost complete sense of direction and vision in \\"Once Upon A Tragedy.\\" The disorganized and frenetic pacing bogs down the film, leaving the audience unable to connect with the plot or the character's reactions. There are multiple pivotal moments in the story where the engine of emotion should begin to rev, driving viewers to a state of empathy or shock; however, these instances are unceremoniously glossed over or abruptly abandoned, leaving viewers largely unmoved. The cinematography, widely promoted as one of the film's selling points, is not sufficient to salvage the wreckage. Awash with an overuse of distracting visual effects and editing techniques, director of photography, Max Lensflair, seems to have forsaken artistic subtlety for grandiose gimmicks. The sumptuous visuals that were meant to enrapture and propel the film instead appear as an obvious attempt to distract from the lack of substance and ingenuity in the plot. Undeniably, \\"Once Upon A Tragedy\\" boasts a star-studded cast of award-winning actors, led by renowned performances from Jane Leadinglady and Oliver Heartthrob. Nevertheless, the film fails to capitalize on the remarkable talent at its disposal. Hampered by the stilted dialogue and shallow portrayals, the actors are unable to transcend the limitations of their poorly conceived roles. Many scenes serve only as unreliable vehicles for their abilities, showcasing a squandered opportunity to invoke raw emotion or maintain any semblance of a captivating on-screen chemistry between the ensemble. Ultimately, \\"Once Upon A Tragedy\\" lacks any redeeming qualities worthy of its extensive hype. Bereft of a coherent plot or meaningful character development, it unwittingly reduces itself to nothing more than a kaleidoscopic mess of unfulfilled potential. The film's slogan, \\"A heart-wrenching journey into the depths of tragedy,\\" is, ironically, nothing short of a tragic disappointment. It is with great misfortune that I cannot in good conscience recommend this film."},{"question":"Process: - The liver filters blood from the digestive tract - The liver produces bile - The liver produces proteins for blood plasma - The liver converts excess glucose into glycogen for storage - The liver converts ammonia to urea - The liver regulates blood clotting. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the winter comes earlier this year happens, how will it affect more bile occurs. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","response":"No, the supposed perturbation (winter coming earlier this year) does not have a direct or indirect effect on the liver's process of producing bile. The liver's functions, including bile production, are primarily influenced by factors internal to the body, such as hormones, nutrients, and metabolic needs. External factors such as seasonal changes may affect the body's overall energy requirements and food intake, but they do not directly alter the liver's bile production mechanism. However, it is worth noting that any changes in diet or physical activity due to the earlier arrival of winter may potentially influence the liver's overall workload and, to some extent, affect bile production. For example, if a person consumes more fatty foods during the winter months, the liver might produce more bile to aid in fat digestion.

Terry Lee Morris was convicted of soliciting sexual performance from a child and was sentenced to 60 years. Judge George Gallagher ordered the bailiff to activate a stun belt sending 50,000 volts through Morris when he allegedly refused to answer questions. The higher court found that stun belts cannot be used as punishment in court. Mr Morris appealed his 2014 conviction alleging that his constitutional rights were violated when the judge used the belt as punishment for not answering questions properly. The belts - used by courtrooms such as the one Tarrant County in Texas - are affixed around the legs or midsection of a suspect in court and are used to deliver a shock to the person should they become violent. Mr Morris said he was too scared to return to court out of more electrical shocks, the Texas Eighth Court of Appeals in El Paso heard. The appeals court ruled on 28 February that Mr Morris' shocks and removal from the court was a violation of his constitutional right to be present and confront witnesses during his trial. The decision was first reported by the Texas Lawyer news website on Tuesday. He has now been ordered to stand for a new trial. During the case in which Mr Morris was convicted of soliciting sexual acts from a 15-year-old girl, Judge Gallagher asked him to enter his plea of \\"guilty or not guilty\\". When Mr Morris responded by saying he had a lawsuit against Judge Gallagher and his defence lawyer, the judge warned him that he would shock him if he did not \\"follow the rules\\", the Washington Post newspaper reported, citing court transcripts. Mr Morris asked the judge to recuse himself because of the lawsuit when the judge directed the bailiff to shock him. The judge ordered the defendant to be shocked two more times as Mr Morris told the court he had a history of mental illness and complained that he was being \\"tortured\\". Mr Morris's attorney, Bill Ray, told the Texas Lawyer that he did not object to the use of the stun belt because his client was acting \\"like a loaded cannon ready to go off\\", and that he did not really believe that he was being shocked. The appeals court said the order clarifies that no Texas judges are allowed to shock defendants for refusing to follow the court's rules of decorum. \\"Never before have we seen any behaviour like this, nor do we hope to ever see such behaviour again,\\" wrote appeals court Justice Yvonne Rodriguez. \\"We must speak out against it, lest we allow practices like these to affront the very dignity of the proceedings we seek to protect and lead our courts to drift from justice into barbarism.\\" More on stun weapons ||||| State District Judge George Gallagher of Tarrant County told a bailiff on three occasions to punish an uncooperative defendant with electric shocks, and now the sex offender's conviction has been overturned and a new trial ordered. Stun belts can be strapped around the legs of some defendants and used to deliver thousands of volts of electric shock in the instance a defendant turns violent or attempts to escape the courtroom. However, in the case of Terry Lee Morris, who was convicted in 2014 of charges of soliciting sexual performance from a 15-year-old girl, an appeals court found that Gallagher used electric shocks as punishment after Morris failed to answer the judge's questions properly. Gallagher, the District 396 judge since 2000, declined to comment, as did a spokeswoman with the Tarrant County district attorney's office. After enduring the 50,000-volt shocks, Morris was apparently too scared to return to the courtroom and actually did not attend the remainder of his own trial. He appealed his conviction, alleging Gallagher violated his constitutional rights by repeatedly shocking him for failing to answer questions while showing no signs of becoming violent or being a flight risk. CYBER MONDAY SALE! Only 20 for a full year of digital access! Hurry! Offer ends Monday! SUBSCRIBE NOW The Texas Eighth Court of Appeals in El Paso handed down its ruling on Feb. 28. Texas Lawyer first reported the ruling Tuesday. The ruling said judges are not permitted to shock defendants who won't answer questions or don't follow the court's rules of decorum. “While the trial court’s frustration with an obstreperous defendant is understandable, the judge’s disproportionate response is not. We do not believe that trial judges can use stun belts to enforce decorum,” Justice Yvonne T. Rodriguez said of Gallagher’s actions in the court’s opinion. “A stun belt is a device meant to ensure physical safety; it is not an operant conditioning collar meant to punish a defendant until he obeys a judge’s whim. This Court cannot sit idly by and say nothing when a judge turns a court of law into a Skinner Box, electrocuting a defendant until he provides the judge with behavior he likes,\\" Rodriguez wrote. Morris, 54, remains in the Wynne Unit in Huntsville. Besides the conviction that was overturned, he was convicted in 1992 of causing bodily injury to a child and sentenced to 12 years to prison. His attorney at the 2014 trial, Billy Ray, told the Star-Telegram that he was \\"scared to death of what Morris might do. I was scared of the way he was acting. \\"But I felt kind of sorry for Morris,\\" Ray said. \\"I was trying to defuse Morris instead of telling the judge what to do. I felt that if I could have gotten Morris calmed down we could get through this thing.\\" Morris had filed a lawsuit against Ray and wanted him to recuse himself as his attorney. \\"Morris appeared to hate me but I think really he hated the situation more,\\" Ray said. \\"But you can't leave a defendant just because you believe he hates you; that's not the way it works.

When Gallagher asked Morris for his plea, guilty or not guilty. Morris refused to answer the question. “Sir, before I say that, I have the right to make a defense,” Morris responded, according to the appeals court. Morris told the judge he had a pending lawsuit against his defense attorney. Gallagher became irritated and warned Morris about further \\"outbursts.\\" \\"Mr. Morris, I am giving you one warning,” Gallagher said outside the presence of the jury, according to the appeals court. “You will not make any additional outbursts like that, because two things will happen: No. 1, I will either remove you from the courtroom or I will use the shock belt on you.” Morris answered, \\"All right, sir.\\" When Morris continued to talk, Gallagher instructed the bailiff to activate the stun belts around Morris' legs. Gallagher asked Morris twice more if he was going to follow the rules. When Morris did not provide a plea, Gallagher said to the bailiff, \\"Hit him,\\" according to the appeals court ruling. The bailiff pressed the button that was to send the electric shock through Morris' body. Gallagher asked him again if he was going to comply. Morris told him he had a history of mental illness. Gallagher ordered another shock. \\"Hit him again,\\" Gallagher said. When Morris contended he was being \\"tortured\\" for seeking a recusal, Gallagher, according to the appeals court, ordered the bailiff to do it again: \\"Would you hit him again?\\" The appeals court said that 50,000 volts can have cognitive impairment effects on a defendant.

I know it says he was getting electrocuted, but they didn’t shock him.” Ray said Morris was behaving like a “loaded cannon ready to go off.\\" He told the Star-Telegram that he said he was afraid that Morris \\"would do something that might have gotten him hurt a lot worse. \\"And Judge Gallagher is not the kind of person who is mean to people,\\" Ray said. However, El Paso's Eighth Court of Appeals ruled that Gallagher shocked Morris as punishment and not for security reasons. “Never before have we seen behavior like this, nor do we hope to ever see such behavior again,” Rodriguez wrote. “As the circumstances of this case perfectly illustrate, the potential for abuse in the absence of an explicit prohibition on non-security use of stun belts exists and must be deterred.” Gallagher later stated for the record that he was concerned by Morris' agitation and movements, suggesting he was within reach of a 200-pound wall-mounted courtroom video monitor that he could have pulled off and used to injure attorneys in the courtroom. \\"It was based on the totality of his continuing escalation and his movements that the court ordered the shock belt be initiated,\\" Gallagher said at the time, according to Texas Lawyer. \\"It was done for the safety of the lawyers and all of the participants.\\" SHARE COPY LINK Dash cam footage released by the Irving Police Department shows Kenneth Roblez, 38, attempt to avoid being pulled over by an officer.

The question of where tin is stored forever is a complex one, as it depends on factors such as its form, use and disposal, and societal practices. The options provided - shopping bag, hardware store, landfill, junk yard, and antique store - represent different contexts in which tin might be found or stored. Let's explore each of these options in detail to determine the best answer. 1. Shopping bag: A shopping bag is a temporary storage option that will likely not store tin \\"forever.\\" Tin products may be contained in a shopping bag during transportation from a retail outlet to a consumer's home or workplace. However, once the consumer puts the tin item to use, the bag no longer serves as a storage place for tin, rendering this option not suitable. 2. Hardware store: A hardware store is another temporary storage location for tin. Hardware stores stock various tin products, such as tin sheets, foils, and tin-based solders. While these stores store tin for a certain period until it is purchased and used by consumers, they cannot be considered as a \\"forever\\" storage option. 3. Landfill: Landfills are the final destination for many waste materials, including tin. When tin products reach the end of their useful life and are discarded as waste, they may end up in landfills. Over time, tin exposed to air and moisture can corrode and disintegrate, releasing tin ions into the environment that can eventually become part of the soil. This natural process makes landfill a feasible option for tin to be stored \\"forever,\\" although it is not an ideal solution due to potential environmental consequences. 4. Junk yard: Similar to landfills, junk yards serve as a final resting place for innumerable discarded objects made of various materials, including tin. Although tin products may be found in junk yards as waste, the permanence of their storage there is uncertain. Junk yards often sort and process materials for recycling or disposal, which may include tin. So, while tin can be stored in junk yards for extended periods, it is not a \\"forever\\" storage solution. 5. Antique store: Antique stores can preserve and store tin items in the form of vintage or historical artifacts, such as tin toys, cans, and decorative objects. Although these tin items are stored and preserved for a long time, the concept of \\"forever\\" might not apply, as these objects may eventually be sold, exchanged, or passed on to other collectors. In summary, out of the provided options, the landfill seems to be the most plausible answer for where tin might potentially be stored \\"forever.\\" However, it is important to note that none of these options represent an ideal or permanent storage solution for tin, highlighting the necessity to develop sustainable practices for tin use, recycling, and disposal. Integrating recycling processes into waste management systems can help reduce the amount of tin being sent to landfills, contributing to a more sustainable and eco-friendly future."},{"question":"Read this and answer the question Federal law originates with the Constitution, which gives Congress the power to enact statutes for certain limited purposes like regulating interstate commerce.

While the statement you provided does give some context regarding the events leading up to the Civil War, it does not entirely answer the question, as it only explains the formation of the Confederacy and does not discuss the scope of the conflict itself. A more comprehensive answer would involve mentioning key states where major battles occurred and address the regional nature of the war. The American Civil War involved numerous states from both the Union and the Confederacy, with key battlegrounds including Virginia, Tennessee, Maryland, Georgia, and Pennsylvania.

A six-time Grammy Award winner and three-time Academy Award winner, Bacharach's songs have been recorded by more than 1,000 different artists. As of 2014, he had written 73 US and 52 UK Top 40 hits. He is considered one of the most important composers of 20th-century popular music. Following his tour of duty in the United States Army, Bacharach spent the next three years as a pianist and conductor for popular singer Vic Damone. Damone recalls: \\"Burt was clearly bound to go out on his own. He was an exceptionally talented, classically trained pianist, with very clear ideas on the musicality of songs, how they should be played, and what they should sound like. I appreciated his musical gifts.\\" He later worked in similar capacity for various other singers, including Polly Bergen, Steve Lawrence, the Ames Brothers and Paula Stewart (who became his first wife). When he was unable to find better jobs, Bacharach worked at resorts in the Catskill Mountains of New York, where he accompanied singers such as Joel Grey. In 1956, at age 28, Bacharach's productivity increased when composer Peter Matz recommended him to Marlene Dietrich, who needed an arranger and conductor for her nightclub shows. He then became part-time music director for Dietrich, the German actress and singer who had been an international screen star in the 1930s. They toured worldwide off and on until the early 1960s; when they weren't touring, he wrote songs. As a result of his collaboration with Dietrich, he gained his first major recognition as a conductor and arranger.

David Graham on the history of the political walkout. You can’t win a vote when you’ve got fewer votes than your opponents. But Wisconsin Democrats are discovering a centuries-old corollary truth this week: you can’t lose a vote if you don’t let it happen. And that’s why 14 of them have fled out of Madison and across the border into Illinois, hoping to prevent a vote that would cut benefits for public-sector workers and curtail the right to collective bargaining. As hundreds of protestors demonstrated against Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's budget proposal, the Senate chamber in Madison remained quiet on February 17. (Photo: Mark Hoffman, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel / MCT / Landov) It’s really just another tool in the minority toolbox—a sibling to the stalling tactic of proposing amendments and a cousin to that peculiar U.S. Senate obstructionist tradition, the filibuster. It carries distinct risks, since legislators who try it are literally running away from their jobs. But it can also be an effective way to buy time, since state police can’t drag legislators over state lines where they don’t have jurisdiction. And the example being set in Wisconsin could well stir copycats across the country, as budget battles grow ever more heated. In Ohio and Indiana, similar benefit battles loom, and both sides are watching their counterparts in Wisconsin to figure out what tactics work. “It’s odd that it doesn’t happen more often,” says Sarah Binder, a senior fellow and Congressional expert at the Brookings Institution. The situation in Wisconsin may be atypical—“This may be somewhat unusual, getting the president of the United States to weigh in on a legislative matter,” she says—and it might not gain additional votes. But it is a way for Democrats to influence the public mood and perhaps persuade Gov. Scott Walker and state Senate Republicans to tone down the bill. “Expanding the scope of conflict makes it much harder for Republicans to keep control of the story,” Binder says. While the temptation to follow Wisconsin’s lead may be growing, the list of notable uses of quorum-breaking in American history is still rather short. A look at some of the highlights: 1. Thomas Burke’s Departure As long as Americans have had legislatures, they’ve had disagreements and desperate minorities. In 1778, the Continental Congress was considering a critical letter to Gen. George Washington. Thomas Burke, a delegate from North Carolina, opposed the missive and stalked out of the congress, garnering him much abuse from his frustrated—but ultimately powerless—colleagues. North Carolinians, however, rallied around Burke because he justified his move by declaring that his allegiance was to his state and would not be weakened by unreasonable moves of a tyrannical central government. A dozen legislators hid out in a tiny apartment, using coded telephone signals as Texas Rangers fanned across the state to find them. 2. Abraham Lincoln’s Acrobatics Before Abraham Lincoln was a Republican and a staid statesman, he was a Whig and a rabble-rouser. Fighting a Democratic bill in Springfield to make payments only in gold or silver rather than paper money, Lincoln led Whigs to walk out and head off a quorum, as Karl Kurtz of the National Council of State Legislatures recalls. It worked one day, but the following day, Democrats were able to get back on track when Lincoln and a colleague entered the chamber to make the required motion for a quorum call. By the time the Whigs realized the trick, they were locked in. An attempt to dive out the window succeeded only in making them laughingstocks, and the bill passed. 3. “The Disappearing Quorum” Late in the 1800s, the U.S. House had become a hotbed of obstruction, much to the chagrin of Speaker Thomas Reed, an Ohio Republican, who set out to reform the rules. One favorite tactic was for representatives to come to the chamber but refuse to answer a roll call. Finally, in 1890, a furious Reed announced that if the clerk could see a member—rather than just hear his response—he would be counted toward a quorum. “Members started diving under their desks and running for the cloakrooms and stuff” to avoid being counted, says Senate historian Donald Ritchie. Despite heated objections, Reed’s reform stuck, and the House minority lost a valuable tool. 4. Texas’ Killer Bees Texas requires a two-thirds majority for a quorum, making mischief an especially attractive prospect there. In 1979, 12 liberal Democrats had already been nicknamed the “Killer Bees” for frequently blocking legislation. Their greatest moment came when they decided to flee to stop a bill to change the date of the state’s primary. The dozen hid out in a tiny apartment, using coded telephone signals as Texas Rangers fanned across the state to find them. Although one senator left and was captured, the others held out long enough to force the lieutenant governor to drop the proposal. 5. Bob Packwood vs. the Sergeant at Arms In the midst of a filibuster showdown in 1988, Republicans irked Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd by refusing to come to the floor. But Byrd, the legendary master of parliamentary tactics, was the wrong man to cross: he dug out an obscure rule that allowed him to call all members to the chamber at 12:30 a.m. under penalty of arrest by the Sergeant at Arms. Some members literally ran away; another, Oregon’s Bob Packwood, injured his arm while trying to barricade himself in his office. Packwood was eventually convinced to come to the Senate, but he insisted that they carry him across the threshold. 6. The Texas Eleven During a fight over redistricting, Democratic members of the state house and senate learned the lessons of the Killer Bees—and fled the Lone Star State altogether. A Republican plan, which Democrats derided as gerrymandering, would have eliminated five Democratic seats in Congress. It started in May 2003, when 51 House Democrats skipped town and went to Oklahoma, killing the plan. Republicans tried again later in the session, and 11 Democratic senators headed to Albuquerque, New Mexico. Speaking with Newsweek on Friday, Senator Mario Gallegos recalled a James Bond-like scenario. Senators had a plan in the event they had to flee, and kept bags packed in their offices. After a signal from their leader, all 11 met at a rendezvous point, where they were hustled into Chevy Suburbans and taken to the Austin airport to board two private planes—still unaware where they were going. Once in the air, they learned they were headed to Albuquerque, despite an order from the ground to return to Austin. “Obviously we told the pilots not to,” Gallegos says. “I said, ‘Oh hell, are we going to have two fighter jets force us to go back to Austin?’” The “Texas Eleven” held out for 46 days until Sen. John Whitmire decided he’d had enough and returned to Austin, making a quorum possible. What lessons can the runaways offer their counterparts in Wisconsin on their third day away? Gallegos says he doesn’t regret his 2003 run even though it ultimately failed, and he offered some moral support to the Wisconsin delegation. “If they feel strong about their position, they need to stay right where they’re at,” he says. “If they feel they’re representing our district, they need to stay right where they’re at.” But Gallegos’ colleague Juan Hinojosa, another member of the Texas Eleven, spoke of a wearying ordeal and was a bit warier. “You’ve got to compromise while you’re out of state,” he says. “Keep the lines of communication open.” David Graham is a reporter for Newsweek covering politics, national affairs, and business.

Walker and the GOP take language out of the budget repair bill that dilutes union rights. Which do you think is more likely to happen first? Madison — As protests at the state Capitol entered their second week, Republicans and Democrats on Sunday were holding possible bargaining chips in their efforts to end the political standoff that has held up action on Gov. Scott Walker's budget repair bill. If Democrats in the state Senate stay out of Wisconsin until Friday, they could undermine a key provision of Walker's plan to fix the state budget and take away most of public workers' union rights. Without this refinancing element, the state would have to take other steps such as cuts to health care programs to keep its budget balanced this year. Walker and other leading Republicans are holding firm despite the deadline. Meanwhile, Republicans who control the state Senate sought Sunday to put pressure on the Democrats in Illinois with their own leverage point: by planning action on a \\"full calendar\\" of undisclosed bills for Tuesday, said Andrew Welhouse, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald (R-Juneau). Without Democrats present, the Republicans have enough members to be able to hold votes on nonfinancial bills, such as confirmation of Walker cabinet appointments, but not on a budget bill. \\"The work of the Senate is not going to be held hostage just because the minority refuses to show up and do their jobs,\\" Welhouse said. Senate Minority Leader Mark Miller (D-Monona) declined Sunday to say how long Democrats would stay in Illinois, where they have been holed up since Thursday to prevent the Senate from having enough lawmakers on the floor to vote on Walker's bill. Sen. Jon Erpenbach (D-Middleton) said he believed he and other senators were willing to stay away until Friday or even longer if necessary. \\"A true leader wouldn't force people into this situation, and the governor needs to learn his lesson,\\" Miller said. With snow and cold rain falling on Madison Sunday, the crowd of demonstrators at the Capitol shrank from the massive levels of last week. But union supporters still turned out a sizable demonstration by normal statehouse standards, filling the rotunda with their numbers and chants. After districts in Madison and Milwaukee canceled classes last week because of teachers not showing up for work, Mary Bell, the president of the Wisconsin Education Association Council, said Sunday that teachers should report back to their schools. If teachers are off Monday, which is Presidents Day, Bell said they should come to Madison to keep up the demonstrations against Walker's bill. \\"It's time for educators to be back in the classroom with the students,\\" Bell told reporters in a teleconference. Milwaukee Public Schools and Madison's public schools will be closed on Monday, but officials at both districts said they expected to reopen on Tuesday. Miller said Democrats would quickly return if the governor and Republicans who control the Legislature would agree to take out the provisions on union rights. He said Republicans should agree to that because Democrats and public worker unions are willing to accept economic concessions in the bill that amount to roughly an 8% pay cut for an average state employee with family health coverage. But Walker stuck with his proposal Sunday. The governor said that the budget repair bill's cuts to public worker benefits and its repeal of union rights were both necessary to avoid the layoffs of 10,000 to 12,000 state and local employees. \\"This is about balancing not only our next budget but the budgets two, four, six years into the future,\\" Walker told \\"Fox News Sunday.\\" Walker said he believed Wisconsin was helping lead the nation in efforts - also under way in other states - to change the way state and local governments deal with their unions. \\"We're willing to take this as long as it takes,\\" he said. Besides the union bargaining provisions, the bill includes many other elements, including a refinancing of state debt that Walker wants to shore up the state's finances through the fiscal year that ends June 30. That would push back 165 million in principal payments on the bonds into future years and free up money that could be used to help the state pay two large outstanding bills - one owed to the state of Minnesota and another owed to a fund for medical malpractice victims. The Legislature's nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau said Walker's bill, as amended by Republicans on the Legislature's budget committee last week, would leave the state with just 65 million in reserves. So without the money from the refinancing, the state would have a further projected shortfall of roughly 100 million to make up. To allow time for that refinancing deal to go through, the bill must pass by Friday, according to a memo earlier this month by state Administration Secretary Mike Huebsch. More recently, Huebsch said it may be possible to pull off the bond deal if the bill passes by Saturday, but no later than that. \\"If we can't pass this by then, we lose our window for refinancing in this (fiscal year),\\" he said. If a deal can't be done, employee layoffs and cuts to Medicaid, the health care program for the poor, elderly and disabled, may be necessary, he said. GOP lawmakers are standing firmly with Walker. Rep. Robin Vos (R-Rochester), co-chairman of the Legislature's Joint Finance Committee, noted Republicans did not leave Wisconsin in 2009 when Democrats controlled the Legislature and governor's office and passed a series of bills that were anathema to Republicans. \\"If this is a new standard where you can say, 'We can extort the majority,' then they have set up a permanent state of chaos in this state,\\" Vos said. On Sunday at the Capitol, union supporters clapped and chanted, \\"Kill the bill with kindness.\\" No incidents or arrests were reported, said Lt. Mary Ricksecker of the Madison police. The bill would require most public workers to pay half their pension costs - typically 5.8% of pay for state workers - and in many cases at least 12% of their health care costs. Union leaders have said they are willing to accept those concessions, which total nearly 330 million through June 2013. Under the bill, the unions could not bargain over anything but wages, would have to hold annual elections to keep their organizations intact and would lose the ability to have union dues deducted from state paychecks. Employees would no longer have to automatically pay union dues, but could choose whether they want to do so. It is those union changes that Democrats and public workers are demanding to be stripped from the bill. The changes affect most local, school and state employees, but police, firefighters and state troopers are exempt. Republicans control the Senate 19-14, but 20 senators must be present to pass bills with budget ramifications. That gives Democrats the ability to stop action, provided they all stick together. Senators are using personal funds, not state funds, to pay their expenses while they're in Illinois, Miller and Erpenbach said. They said senators were taking their salaries because they believed they were doing their jobs by standing up for workers' rights. The departure of the Senate Democrats recalls the 2003 stand-off in Texas in which Democratic senators went to New Mexico to block the adoption of a new map of legislative districts. That incident lasted a month, and ended when one of the 11 senators defected from the group. *** What happens next Monday: A hearing is scheduled for 8:30 a.m. in Dane County Circuit Court on a request by the Madison Metropolitan School District to force teachers to return to school. A judge on Friday refused to issue a temporary order on that request. Monday: Noon and 5 p.m. rallies by labor and other groups at the state Capitol with musical performances from several artists, including Tom Morello, guitarist formerly of Rage Against the Machine. Tuesday: 10 a.m. Assembly session on budget repair bill scheduled. Noon labor rally at the Capitol. Senate session also expected on undisclosed bills but not budget repair proposal. Don Walker of the Journal Sentinel staff contributed to this report. ||||| The Democratic Wisconsin state senators camped out across the border in Illinois fired back at Gov. Scott Walker today, saying their action to block a vote on his budget proposal is an effort to protect democracy. Walker, whose budget bill sparked six straight days of protests at the capitol in Madison, today criticized the 14 Democrats, whose absence has prevented the state Senate from achieving the quorum necessary for a vote on the proposal. \\"If you want to participate in democracy, you've got to be in the arena, and the arena is right here in Madison, Wisconsin,\\" Walker said on \\"Fox News Sunday.\\" \\"Democracy is not about hiding out in another state,\\" he said. \\"It's about showing up here in the capital and making the case there.\\" State Sen. Julie Lassa, who is six months pregnant, said the governor is wrong about her and the others holed up in an Illinois hotel. \\"For all of us who left the state, we believe we're standing up for democracy,\\" Nissa told ABC News' Barbara Pinto. Meanwhile, the tens of thousands of demonstrators protesting Walker's proposal, which would cut benefits for public employees and drastically reduce unions' collective bargaining powers, have paralyzed the state capitol and the protesters said they aren't going anywhere. \\"I know that the people here are not going home people are going to be here until he is gone,\\" protester Miles Kristan said. Walker, though, was just as firm today in his resolve. \\"We're willing to take this as long as it takes, because, in the end, we're doing the right thing,\\" he said. \\"We're doing the right thing for Wisconsin.\\" He said the Democratic state senators who fled the state have \\"failed to do their jobs,\\" and he expects them to concede this week. \\"My hope is that cooler minds will prevail and by some time earlier this coming week they'll show up for their job,\\" Walker said. Instead, some 70,000 demonstrators showed up at the Capitol Saturday and a similar number today. Though most of them opposed Walker's budget proposal, which critics say is an effort at union busting, there were many backers of the bill as well this weekend. In addition to the demonstration in Madison, a smaller pro-union rally also was held today in Green Bay, outside Packers Stadium. Some tea party groups said Saturday they are forming exploratory committees to recall two of the Democrats who fled the state Thursday to protest the vote on the bill. The tea party group Northwood Patriots said it would meet today to discuss the recall of state Senator Jim Holperin, while a separate group in Kenosha, called the Robert Wirch Exploratory Committee said it is looking into recalling state Senator Robert Wirch. According to Madison's The Capital Times, a recall effort would require the exploratory committees to collect 15,000 to 20,000 petition signatures. Walker told reporters Friday that he would not \\"allow protesters to drown out the voice of the taxpayers,\\" adding that he had received 19,000 supportive e-mails this week and that a \\"quiet majority\\" of the state's residents are behind his plan. Walker, who unveiled the budget bill last Saturday, has been calling upon the Democrats to return and end their \\"theatrics.\\" \\"The bottom line is we're broke,\\" the governor said. \\"We can't negotiate for something we don't have the ability to give on.\\" Walker, faced with a 3.6 billion deficit, denied he is trying to bust the unions. Wisconsin has a 137 million shortfall this year and 3.6 billion over the next two years. Other governors facing similar budget crises are watching Wisconsin carefully. More than 40 states are facing a combined projected shortfall of 125 billion for the fiscal year of 2012. The hardest hit are California, facing a 25.5 billion gap, Texas at 13 billion, Illinois at 15 billion, New York at 9 billion and New Jersey at 10.5 billion.

Q: Passage: Jacksonville has suffered less damage from hurricanes than most other east coast cities, although the threat does exist for a direct hit by a major hurricane. The city has only received one direct hit from a hurricane since 1871; however, Jacksonville has experienced hurricane or near-hurricane conditions more than a dozen times due to storms crossing the state from the Gulf of Mexico to the Atlantic Ocean, or passing to the north or south in the Atlantic and brushing past the area. The strongest effect on Jacksonville was from Hurricane Dora in 1964, the only recorded storm to hit the First Coast with sustained hurricane-force winds. The eye crossed St. Augustine with winds that had just barely diminished to 110 mph (180 km/h), making it a strong Category 2 on the Saffir-Simpson Scale. Jacksonville also suffered damage from 2008's Tropical Storm Fay which crisscrossed the state, bringing parts of Jacksonville under darkness for four days. Similarly, four years prior to this, Jacksonville was inundated by Hurricane Frances and Hurricane Jeanne, which made landfall south of the area. These tropical cyclones were the costliest indirect hits to Jacksonville. Hurricane Floyd in 1999 caused damage mainly to Jacksonville Beach. During Floyd, the Jacksonville Beach pier was severely damaged, and later demolished. The rebuilt pier was later damaged by Fay, but not destroyed. Tropical Storm Bonnie would cause minor damage in 2004, spawning a minor tornado in the process. On May 28, 2012, Jacksonville was hit by Tropical Storm Beryl, packing winds up to 70 miles per hour (113 km/h) which made landfall near Jacksonville Beach.

The details of the operation (actually, there were several such operations) are handed to two intelligence officers, Colonel Logan and Major Harvey. They are initially unable to devise such a plan – but one night, Harvey sees an actor at a London theatre, putting on a convincing impression of General Bernard Montgomery. Logan and Harvey discover that the actor is M. E. Clifton James (who plays himself in the film), a lieutenant stationed in Leicester with the Royal Army Pay Corps and that he was a professional actor in peacetime. He is called to London, on the pretext that he is to make a test for an army film, and a plan is devised that he should tour North Africa, impersonating 'Monty'. 'Jimmy' as Harvey calls him, is doubtful that he can carry off an impersonation of Montgomery, especially with his air of command, but with time running short and no options open to him, he agrees. Disguised as a corporal, he spends some days at Montgomery's headquarters and learns to copy the general's mannerisms and style. After an interview with the general himself, he is sent off to tour North Africa. Accompanied by Harvey, who has been 'promoted' to brigadier for his cover as Montgomery's aide-de-camp, 'Jimmy' arrives at Gibraltar, where the governor, who has known the general for years, can't get over the likeness.

(Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices) Unlike for example the United States Federal Reserve Bank, the ECB has only one primary objective but this objective has never been defined in statutory law, and the HICP target can be termed ad-hoc. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Where is the primary mission of the European Central Bank listed?","response":"The primary mission of the European Central Bank (ECB) is listed in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). More specifically, it can be found in Article 127(1) of the treaty. The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union is one of two primary Treaties that form the constitutional basis of the European Union, the other being the Treaty on European Union. The TFEU outlines the roles, responsibilities, policies, and procedures of the various institutions and decision-making bodies within the EU. It includes a wide variety of topics, ranging from agriculture and fisheries to transport and health. Returning to the subject of the European Central Bank, its primary mission, as stated in Article 127(1) of the TFEU, is maintaining price stability within the Eurozone. This means that the ECB aims to control inflation and prevent significant price fluctuations that could negatively impact the economy. In October 1998, the Governing Council further defined this objective of price stability, stating that they view it as keeping the inflation rate of the Euro area below but close to 2%, measured by the year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP). The Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) is an indicator of inflation and price stability in the Eurozone. It is a consumer price index that has been standardized across all member countries of the European Union in order to provide a comparable measure of inflation. Therefore, the ECB's primary mission is not simply declared in their statutes or laws, but is reflected in their continual efforts to maintain a stable price level in the Eurozone over the medium term by managing inflation rates. This price stability contributes to a stable economic environment, which is essential for sustainable economic growth and welfare in the Euro area. Unlike other central banks, such as the United States Federal Reserve Bank, the ECB has only one primary objective, focusing solely on price stability, with no formal statutory definition or quantified target beyond the ad-hoc HICP target."},{"question":"Write an article based on this \\"Make a nail polish remover tub.

Fact 2: Animals that reproduce sexually produce sex cells, or gametes. Given the two facts above, what does pollen consist of tiny grains of? Choose your answer from: -- it helps plants in growing -- the female sexual organs -- Something with exactly eight protons -- seeds -- Microscopic organisms -- the male sex cells of plants -- bees -- sub-units of species A:","response":"Pollen consists of tiny grains of the male sex cells of plants. These male gametes play a crucial role in the reproduction process of plants, specifically in the sexual reproduction of seed plants. They are produced in the pollen sacs within the anthers of the flower, and they aid the plant in fertilization by delivering sperm cells to the female sex organs (ovules) in order to form seeds, which can then grow into new plants. This process is often facilitated by pollinators, such as bees and butterflies, which transfer the pollen grains between flowers, enabling cross-fertilization."},{"question":"What most naturally follows?

Step 1: Determine the context and setting I need to establish the context and setting of this scene, as it will influence what could naturally follow. It could be taking place at a salon or at home among family or friends. Since there is no explicit mention of a specific location, I will assume it's a casual setting involving friends or family. Step 2: Consider possible events or interactions In a casual setting, we can consider various plausible events or interactions that might follow. Some possibilities include: a) The boy thanks the girl for drying his hair and they continue their conversation. b) Other people present in the scene start discussing the boy's new hairstyle or share their opinions on it. c) Someone else steps up to style the boy's hair or give him a haircut. d) The group of people present shifts their focus to a different activity such as watching TV, playing games, or having a meal.

Start by just having conversations with her. Ask her about her siblings or other little things. For example, \\"How are Jimmy and Sarah doing?\\" or, \\"That blue shirt brings out your eyes.\\" Girls like it when you remember little things. Find out things you have in common, like a favorite band or sport. That will give you a common subject to talk about. If you go to school together, walk up to her in the halls and say hello after you've talked in class a couple times. You will make a good impression if you do nice things, like holding a door for her to go through or tying her shoe if you notice it has come undone. Do not go out of your way to do these things all the time. She will think it is weird instead of sweet. Many guys prefer to cut to the chase, but if she is worth asking out, it is worth building a friendship. If you ask her out without getting to know her first, she might turn you down just because she doesn't know enough about you to say yes. Text or chat with her for long periods of time. Girls love it when this happens. After you've texted her for a while and you think she's good enough friends with you, try to ask her who she likes. Make sure she asks you too, otherwise it will most likely end up being a different guy. Also try to make it late—that's extra cute! Do you have common interests? Are you around the same age? If you are going to date this girl, make sure that she is someone with whom you actually want to spend a lot of time. It is easy to build up unrealistic fantasies in your head, but it isn't always easy to gauge whether you would truly be happy with someone. Try talking about what motivates her; by doing so, you will create a bond between you two. Ask her and some of your other friends if they would like to go somewhere such as the mall or movies. Eventually if you two are comfortable with each other you could ask her to hang out at your house with a group of people. A group of people will make it seem less awkward. Don't ask her specifically to something and build it up. Instead, arrange something with a group of friends and say she is welcome to come along. That way, if she can't make it, no harm done and you can recover from the rejection without problems. When inviting her out, it has to be something fun that isn't a big deal for her to join in on. You want to avoid the awkward staring at your hands/feet mumbling about \\"what she is up to that weekend\\". If she is already dating someone, then that is her business, and you need to respect it. If she's obviously interested in someone else, then it might be worth your while to win her over—but do not get your hopes up. When you two start hanging out a lot, people will start talking and wondering if you two are dating or if you have a \\"thing.\\" If people ask you about it, just say, \\"we like hanging out,\\" or, \\"we have a lot of fun together.\\" Never say, \\"we are just friends.\\" This will give her the wrong impression. Ask her if she would like to hang out sometime, but don't make it sound like a date. As you spend more time with her, invite fewer and fewer people, so that eventually you can just say, \\"Want to hang out this weekend?\\" If she says no thanks, don't drop it yet. She is likely not comfortable enough with you, but she may come around if you keep talking to her. You could explain that it wouldn't be a date, just going to the movies as friends, or hanging out and going swimming. Summary:","response":"The article suggests building a friendship with a girl before asking her out by engaging in casual conversations, talking about her likes and dislikes, and remembering little things about her. Find common interests and discuss them, while also being considerate by doing nice things occasionally but not too often. Communicate through texting and chats, and spend time together in a group setting with other friends. Gradually reduce the number of people and invite her to hang out one-on-one without making it seem like an official date. Respect her current relationship status and be patient, as she may not initially feel comfortable hanging out alone. Focus on building a strong connection and deepening your understanding of each other's motivations before pursuing a romantic relationship."},{"question":"Produce a long descriptive sentence that uses all these words: RCD Mallorca GOALS_AGAINST 34; RCD Mallorca GOAL_DIFFERENCE +23; RCD Mallorca GOALS_FOR 57","response":"After an exciting campaign riddled with relentlessly pulsating matches, RCD Mallorca, the skillful and determined football team from the vibrant island, astoundingly scored a remarkable 57 GOALS_FOR, which, when coupled with a solid defense allowing only 34 GOALS_AGAINST, decisively rendered their triumphant victory inevitable in the riveting league competition as they emerged with a stellar GOAL_DIFFERENCE of a commendable +23, concretely reflecting their unwavering prowess and superiority."},{"question":"Premise: \\"Its budget comes from lawyer contributions, grants and interest from lawyers' trust accounts, For 2002, the foundation awarded nearly 950,000 to 11 agencies (see sidebar).\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"The agencies needed the funds to keep operations running.\\" true?","response":"Step 1: Identify the main components of the premise. - Budget sources: lawyer contributions, grants, and interest from lawyers' trust accounts. - The foundation awarded nearly 950,000 to 11 agencies in 2002.

Take medications as directed. Elevate your leg while resting. Apply ice around your knee. Maintain proper dressage care. Beware of signs of infection.","response":"Title: A Comprehensive Guide to Post-Knee Surgery Recovery: 6 Essential Steps for Optimal Healing Introduction: Knee surgery is a common and highly effective procedure that can alleviate pain and improve your overall quality of life. But for the surgery to be truly successful, utmost care and adherence to your surgeon's instructions during the post-operative recovery period is crucial. In this article, we will discuss six essential steps to ensure a smooth and effective recovery process after knee surgery. 1. Listen to your surgeon's instructions: The first and most important step to ensure a successful recovery is to closely follow the doctor's orders. Your surgeon will provide detailed instructions specific to your case, which may include guidelines on wound care, physical activity, and diet. Make sure you understand these directions and ask questions if you are unsure. Adhering to these recommendations will prevent complications and aid in your healing process. 2. Take medications as directed: After surgery, you may be prescribed medications for pain relief or to prevent infection. It is essential to take these medications exactly as instructed by your surgeon and pharmacist. Doing so will help manage pain, reduce inflammation, and keep any potential infections at bay. If you experience side effects or the medications do not seem to be working, consult your doctor immediately. 3. Elevate your leg while resting: Proper elevation of your operated leg while sitting or lying down can reduce swelling, which is common after knee surgery. Keeping your leg elevated also facilitates better blood circulation, preventing the risk of blood clots. Use pillows or foam wedges to support your leg while resting, and follow your surgeon's guidelines on how long and how often you should elevate the leg each day. 4. Apply ice around your knee: Icing is a proven way to reduce pain and swelling after surgery. Applying ice packs or cold compresses to the affected area can provide both local anesthesia and anti-inflammatory effects. Make sure to wrap the ice pack or cold compress in a towel to prevent direct contact with the skin, as this can cause frostbite. Follow your surgeon's recommendations regarding the frequency and duration of ice application. 5. Maintain proper dressage care: The dressing covering your surgical wound must be kept clean and dry to promote healing and prevent infection. Follow the doctor's instructions for changing the dressing and caring for the wound. Additionally, it is vital to observe the incision regularly for any signs of infection, such as redness, warmth, or discharge. If you notice any unusual changes, contact your healthcare provider as soon as possible. 6. Beware of signs of infection: Being vigilant about detecting any signs of infection is crucial in the early stages of your recovery. Common indicators of infection include fever, chills, unusual pain, redness, or swelling around the surgical site. If you experience any of these symptoms, consult your doctor promptly to initiate appropriate treatment and prevent further complications. Conclusion: Recovering from knee surgery can be a challenging process, but by following these six essential steps, you can promote optimal healing and avoid unnecessary complications. Remember to be patient with yourself, as the recovery journey may take time and persistence. Keep in close communication with your healthcare team, and don't hesitate to reach out to them with any concerns or questions. With the appropriate care and commitment, you will soon be on your way to better knee health and an improved quality of life."},{"question":"Question: how long does a back waxing last I found the following answer on Google: This removes the wax along with the hair.

It is thought to be caused mostly by the increase of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide. Greenhouse gases can be released by factories that burn fossil fuels. Over the past 20 years, burning fossil fuels has produced about three-quarters of the carbon dioxide from human activity. The rest of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is there because of deforestation, or cutting down trees ( Figure below ). Trees absorb carbon dioxide during cellular respiration, so when trees are cut down, they cannot remove carbon dioxide from the air. Paragraph: Long island was full of people and they used all their natural resources and burned fossil fuels while Snail island protected the environment and had fewer people living there. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which island contributed more to global warming? The answer to this question is:","response":"Long Island contributed more to global warming. Based on the provided information, Long Island has a high population density, and its inhabitants extensively utilized natural resources and burned fossil fuels. Fossil fuels, when burned, release significant amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, contributing to global warming. Over the past 20 years, approximately three-quarters of human-induced carbon dioxide emissions resulted from the burning of fossil fuels. Additionally, the rampant use of natural resources on Long Island could have led to deforestation, a process that exacerbates global warming as trees, which play a crucial role in absorbing carbon dioxide, are cut down and cannot remove carbon dioxide from the air. On the other hand, Snail Island has a smaller population and prioritizes environmental protection. As a result, it is likely that the island's greenhouse gas emissions are much lower than those on Long Island. The residents of Snail Island may also adhere to more sustainable practices and rely on renewable energy sources, which generate fewer greenhouse gas emissions compared to the burning of fossil fuels. Reducing human activities that contribute to global warming consequently enables this island to have a less detrimental impact on the environment. In conclusion, Long Island's high population, abundant use of natural resources, and burning of fossil fuels indicate that it contributes more to global warming than Snail Island, which follows environmentally friendly practices and maintains a smaller population."},{"question":"Question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: How did this impact Ottoman life? Context: Over the course of Ottoman history, the Ottomans managed to build a large collection of libraries complete with translations of books from other cultures, as well as original manuscripts. A great part of this desire for local and foreign manuscripts arose in the 15th Century. Sultan Mehmet II ordered Georgios Amiroutzes, a Greek scholar from Trabzon, to translate and make available to Ottoman educational institutions the geography book of Ptolemy. Another example is Ali Qushji -an astronomer, mathematician and physicist originally from Samarkand- who became a professor in two madrasas, and influenced Ottoman circles as a result of his writings and the activities of his students, even though he only spent two or three years before his death in Istanbul. Answer:","response":"The impact on Ottoman life due to the large collection of libraries and translations of books from other cultures, as well as original manuscripts, was significant. This development enriched the intellectual and cultural life of the Ottoman Empire and allowed for the exchange and dissemination of knowledge from various sources. The active pursuit of foreign and local manuscripts during the 15th century, as exemplified by Sultan Mehmet II's order to translate and make available Ptolemy's geography book, demonstrates the importance placed on learning and education. The influence of scholars like Ali Qushji, who brought their expertise in fields such as astronomy, mathematics, and physics, further contributed to the intellectual growth of the Ottoman society. By becoming a professor in two madrasas and influencing Ottoman circles through his writings and the activities of his students, Qushji played a vital role in the development and propagation of scientific knowledge in the empire. As a result, this broadening of knowledge and the blending of different intellectual traditions led to an environment of creativity and innovation in the Ottoman Empire. This cultural exchange and openness to learning from other cultures positively impacted various aspects of Ottoman life, including science, art, literature, and education."},{"question":"Premise: \\"Ski equipment on the side of a snowy mountain.\\" Hypothesis: \\"The ski gear is in the garage.\\" Do we know that the hypothesis entailed by the premise?

His hat was pulled down tight and his eyes didn't move as he passed the crude shacks at the edge of town. He tied his horse in front of the saloon, unwinding his long body as if a sudden movement might snap it. He turned down the collar of his greatcoat and checked to make sure his big Army Colt was loose in its holster. The saloon door was a single chunk of white pine, still oozing sap, and he had to put his shoulder to it to force it open. The long room inside was quiet, and not much warmer than the street. Clusters of people sat nursing coffee and drinks, talking quietly if they talked at all. Marlin spotted a few farmers the railroad had brought in from Europe: rounded hats, nervous eyes, skin as red as blood. At the far end of the room a half-dozen cowboys turned over cards with patient boredom. Marlin walked up to the bar. \\"Whiskey,\\" he said, and when the drink came he tossed it straight down and felt it pull his lips into a grimace. He nodded for a refill. When he turned to face the room they were all watching him. \\"I'm looking for a man named Kraamer,\\" Marlin said. \\"Anybody here know of him?\\" One of the cowboys turned casually and rang the spittoon with a stream of tobacco juice.

The embassy bombings of 1998 had focused attention on al Qaeda's finances. One result had been the creation of an NSC-led interagency committee on terrorist financing. On its recommendation, the President had designated Bin Laden and al Qaeda as subject to sanctions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. This gave theTreasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) the ability to search for and freeze any Bin Laden or al Qaeda assets that reached the U.S. financial system. But since OFAC had little information to go on, few funds were frozen. In July 1999, the President applied the same designation to the Taliban for harboring Bin Laden. Here, OFAC had more success. It blocked more than 34 million in Taliban assets held in U.S. banks. Another 215 million in gold and 2 million in demand deposits, all belonging to the Afghan central bank and held by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, were also frozen. After October 1999, when the State Department formally designated al Qaeda a \\"foreign terrorist organization,\\" it became the duty of U.S. banks to block its transactions and seize its funds. Neither this designation nor UN sanctions had much additional practical effect; the sanctions were easily circumvented, and there were no multilateral mechanisms to ensure that other countries' financial systems were not used as conduits for terrorist funding. Attacking the funds of an institution, even the Taliban, was easier than finding and seizing the funds of a clandestine worldwide organization like al Qaeda. Although the CIA's Bin Laden unit had originally been inspired by the idea of studying terrorist financial links, few personnel assigned to it had any experience in financial investigations. Any terrorist-financing intelligence appeared to have been collected collaterally, as a consequence of gathering other intelligence. This attitude may have stemmed in large part from the chief of this unit, who did not believe that simply following the money from point A to point B revealed much about the terrorists' plans and intentions. As a result, the CIA placed little emphasis on terrorist financing. Nevertheless, the CIA obtained a general understanding of how al Qaeda raised money. Question: \\"Who recommended that the President designate Bin Laden and al Qaeda as subject to sanctions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act?\\" Answer: \\"The embassy\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","response":"No, the answer is not correct. Based on the paragraph, the correct answer is \\"an NSC-led interagency committee on terrorist financing\\" recommended that the President designate Bin Laden and al Qaeda as subject to sanctions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act."},{"question":"News article: Autopsy Cites ‘Intentionally Removed’ Plug in Ruling Kayaker’s Death a Homicide The medical examiner’s conclusion is clear: Vincent Viafore, who the police say was killed by his fiancée during a kayaking trip on the Hudson River this past spring, was a victim of homicide caused by a “kayak drain plug intentionally removed by other.” But the lawyer for the fiancée, Angelika Graswald, said the medical examiner’s office had overstepped its bounds with that determination. He said it was based on police speculation, not an examination of Mr. Viafore’s body. “Clearly, the Orange County medical examiner failed to conduct any meaningful investigation of her own and relied on false information provided by the New York State Police,” the lawyer, Richard A. Portale, said on Thursday, referring to Jennifer L. Roman, who performed the autopsy for the medical examiner’s office in Orange County, N.Y. “She ruled this a homicide without a scintilla of medical evidence,” Mr. Portale added. He argued that the reference to the kayak plug in the autopsy report could prejudice a jury. Since May, when Mr. Viafore’s body was pulled from the Hudson, prosecutors have declined to identify a cause of death or release the autopsy. A copy of the report was obtained by The New York Times. It was unsurprising in some of its conclusions. It lists the cause of death as drowning (Mr. Viafore, 46, who was not wearing a life jacket, capsized in 46-degree water, cold enough to quickly cause hypothermia). The toxicology results attached gave his blood alcohol concentration as 0.066 percent, close to the legal limit of 0.08 and consistent with Ms. Graswald’s account that the couple, who shared an apartment in Poughkeepsie, paddled to Bannerman Island on April 19, where Mr. Viafore had a few beers. The autopsy offers a grim, methodical accounting of Mr. Viafore’s body, which was recovered from the middle of the river on May 23. His face and abdomen were bloated, the report says, and marked by a mottled red and green discoloration. Besides evidence of drowning, the only injuries noted in the report are a two-inch abrasion on the left torso and bruises on the lower chest and arm, also on the left side. The police have made no reference to a possible struggle between Mr. Viafore and Ms. Graswald, 35, while they were in their kayaks, though they have said Ms. Graswald moved his paddle out of his reach after he went in the water. Some legal experts agreed with Mr. Portale’s contention that the medical examiner’s conclusions had gone too far. Jeanine Pirro, a former district attorney in Westchester County who now hosts “Justice With Judge Jeanine” on Fox News Channel, said medical examiners typically gave the manner of death, whether accident, suicide, homicide or undetermined, without elaborating. “That is a very unusual way of describing manner of death,” Ms. Pirro said in a phone interview. “It’s rare that you get something next to the manner of death that is so outside the analysis of the body.” “Let’s assume that the drain plug was removed,” she added. “It doesn’t mean it’s a homicide. It could mean that it was removed by accident. What does that have to do with the drowning? If that’s what the medical examiner thinks, she’s going to have to back that up on the stand.” The medical examiner’s office referred questions about the report to the Orange County executive’s office. The county executive’s office defended the medical examiner’s actions. Justin Rodriguez, a spokesman for the county executive, Steven M. Neuhaus, said a medical examiner could use facts outside of the autopsy, citing a state law that addresses determinations about cause and manner of death. “Obviously this statute envisions that the autopsy is only one aspect of the medical examiner’s examination into the cause of death,” he said. “If medical examiners were limited to basing their conclusions solely on a physical examination of the body, there would be no coroner inquests. The coroners and medical examiners have been doing this for over 100 years.” The case has captivated residents of the Hudson Valley and beyond, for both its puzzling circumstances and the defendant’s behavior. For more than a week after Mr. Viafore’s drowning, the police described it as an accident. Ms. Graswald, meanwhile, was posting numerous photographs and videos to Facebook that showed her smiling broadly, doing cartwheels and kayaking. After Ms. Graswald was charged on April 30, the police said she had implicated herself in the killing. At a bail hearing later, they quoted her as having said, among other things, that it “felt good knowing he was going to die.” Mr. Portale, her lawyer, said his client’s statements to the police had been coerced. Complicating matters is the assertion by Mr. Portale that the kayak’s drain plug had been missing for some time. Kayaking experts have said that a missing plug would not necessarily cause a boat to sink because the hole it closes, at the top of the vessel, is so small. (Mr. Viafore’s kayak did not sink to the bottom of the river, and was later found near shore.) Such plugs, kayaking instructors say, are designed to make it easy to rid the kayak of excess water by flipping it over on dry land. In very choppy conditions, water can splash directly into the cockpit, causing the kayak to ride low in the water and making it unstable. Lawrence Kobilinsky, a forensics expert and chairman of the department of sciences at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan, also found the reference to the kayak plug troubling, particularly the description that it was “intentionally removed by other.” Calling the reference a “red herring,” Dr. Kobilinsky said that medical examiners can and do consider police reports and other information besides the physical examination in arriving at a manner of death. However, he said, the leap from ruling a death a homicide to suggesting it was murder is not one a medical examiner should make. “That’s not something the medical examiner should be writing down,” he said of the reference to the plug’s intentional removal. “It already presumes it’s a murder. Homicide can be justified or not justified, or it can be an accident. It simply means that one person causes the death of another.” “The way it was written,” he added, “sounds like the medical examiner was saying it’s clearly a murder based on pulling the plug. But that’s a big hop, skip and a jump, and in a courtroom, all of this stuff will get dissected to the finest detail.” Correction: September 10, 2015 An earlier version of this article misstated the date on which the police say Angelika Graswald killed her fiancée, Vincent Viafore, during a kayaking trip. It was April 19, not April 10. A version of this article appears in print on September 11, 2015, on page A21 of the New York edition with the headline: ‘Intentionally Removed’ Plug Cited in Ruling Kayaker Death a Homicide. Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe What are the most important parts of this news article?","response":"The news article discusses the case of Vincent Viafore, who was reportedly killed by his fiancée Angelika Graswald during a kayaking trip on the Hudson River. The medical examiner's conclusion states that Viafore's death was a homicide caused by a \\"kayak drain plug intentionally removed by other.\\" However, the lawyer for Graswald argued that the medical examiner's office based their determination on police speculation rather than an examination of Viafore's body and that the reference to the kayak plug could prejudice a jury. The case has gained much attention from residents of the Hudson Valley and beyond due to the puzzling circumstances and the defendant's behavior. Graswald initially posted numerous photographs and videos on social media showing her smiling and kayaking after Viafore's drowning, which had been described as an accident by the police for over a week. Complicating the case, Graswald's lawyer has claimed that the kayak's drain plug was missing for some time, while kayaking experts maintain that a missing plug would not necessarily cause a boat to sink. The inclusion of the reference to the missing kayak plug in the medical examiner's report has sparked debate over whether the medical examiner's conclusions are overreaching, as some argue that the leap from ruling a death a homicide to suggesting it was a murder is not one a medical examiner should make."},{"question":"Q:I know that the answer to the question \\"What was really important to the Europeans?\\" is in \\"Treaties formed an important part of European colonization and, in many parts of the world, Europeans attempted to legitimize their sovereignty by signing treaties with indigenous peoples.

Ablett displayed a love for sport at an early age, winning the state school high jump at 10 years of age. He was also awarded both club and competition best and fairest awards for Drouin at the under-11s, under-12s and under-14s levels. After citing waning interest in school, Ablett dropped out of high school at the age of 15 years to become a bricklayer's labourer. Ablett combined strength, speed, and skill to produce many spectacular highlights and goal-kicking feats. A noted big game player, Ablett kicked 43 goals in 11 State appearances. More significantly, he booted 64 goals over the course of his 16 finals - an average of four goals a game. His haul of 27 goals in the 1989 finals series is a record that still stands. He was awarded the Norm Smith Medal for his performance in the 1989 Grand Final, where he was adjudged best player afield. In doing so, he became one of only four players (the others being Maurice Rioli -1982, Nathan Buckley -2002, and Chris Judd -2005) to win the medal playing for the losing side. In 1996, Ablett joined Gordon Coventry, Doug Wade, Jason Dunstall and Tony Lockett as the only players in league history to kick 1000 VFL/AFL goals. Martin Flanagan's representation of Australian football pioneer Tom Wills in his 1996 novel The Call is modeled on Ablett. According to Flanagan, Wills and Ablett polarised opinion in similar ways, and displayed a lack of insight into their actions--they simply did what came naturally to them, \\"like a lot of artists\\". Ablett is the subject of the song \\"Kicking the Footy with God\\", released by The Bedroom Philosopher on his 2005 debut album In Bed with My Doona. In 1996, Ablett was named in the AFL Team of the Century on the interchange bench, alongside Jack Dyer and Greg Williams. In 2001, Ablett was named in the Geelong Team of the Century, on a half forward flank. In 2005, after many years of controversy and debate (see below), he was inducted into the Australian Football Hall of Fame. The following year, he was honoured yet again when he was voted as the Greatest Geelong player of all-time ahead of Graham Farmer. In 2006, Ablett was honoured with the naming of a terrace in his name within the newly renovated Skilled Stadium. Ablett once had a set of gates named in his honour, but he was upgraded to a terrace at the beginning of the 2006 AFL season. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Did he switch teams?","response":"Imagine you're listening to a story about a really good football player named Gary Ablett. He grew up in a place called Victoria with his big family and was good at sports even when he was a little kid. He didn't like school much, so he stopped going when he was 15 and started working with bricks. Gary was super strong, fast, and knew how to play football really well. He scored lots of goals when he played and even won special awards for being the best player on the field sometimes. He also became part of a special club of football players who scored 1000 goals. People liked to sing and write about Gary because he was like a superhero on the football field. He got into special teams because he was so good, and people even named a part of a stadium after him. Now, to answer your question: The story doesn't say anything about Gary switching teams, so we don't know if he did.

It serves directly to assist a rapid distribution of goods at reasonable prices, thereby establishing a firm home market and so making it possible to provide for export at competitive prices. By drawing attention to new ideas it helps enormously to raise standards of living. By helping to increase demand it ensures an increased need for labor, and is therefore an effective way to fight unemployment. It lowers the costs of many services: without advertisements your daily newspaper would cost four times as much, the price of your television license would need to be doubled, and travel by bus or tube would cost 20 per cent more. And perhaps most important of all, advertising provides a guarantee of reasonable value in the products and services you buy. Apart from the fact that twenty-seven Acts of Parliament govern the terms of advertising, no regular advertiser dare promote a product that fails to live up to the promise of his advertisements. He might fool some people for a little while through misleading advertising. He will not do so for long, for mercifully the public has the good sense not to buy the inferior article more than once.

Here are the pop stars who tried their luck on the silver screen IT seems that being a successful musician isn’t enough these days. Rather than sticking with their original passion, many talented stars are adding even more strings to their bows and breaking into the acting industry. This week, it was reported that Rihanna is set to join the Oceans Eight all-star cast, while Jennifer Lopez had landed the role of cocaine queen Griselda Blanco for an upcoming HBO biopic too. They’re not the only ones. From rappers to rock stars, we take a look at some of the most memorable musicians that took the leap… Her incredible success in music has made her one of the most successful female solo artists of all time – but being Beyoncé, she wasn’t happy with simply selling 100million records worldwide. The star, who is married to Jay-Z, landed her first role in 2001 and has since starred in Austin Powers: Goldmember, The Pink Panther, Dreamgirls and Life is But a Dream. She's only 28 years old, but there's very little she hasn't done. As well as an astounding career in music, the Barbadian singer has starred in Battleship, Home and is rumoured to be joining the Ocean's Eight cast this year. He started his career as the MC of hip-hop duo DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince, but now Will Smith is better known as an award-winning actor. Some of his most notable movies include Men in Black, Hitch, Seven Pounds and, more recently, Suicide Squad. The pop princess gained notoriety through her music and after three successful albums, she starred in Crossroads. The 2002 film received mainly negative reviews, but still managed to make £47million at the box office. The former N'Sync star made a name for himself in music but, like Britney, starred in TV shows as a teenager. He utilised his acting talent after becoming famous, making the move to the silver screen in 2005 with a role alongside Morgan Freeman in Edison. He has since starred in The Social Network, Friends With Benefits and Bad Teacher, and continues to act today. Perhaps not quite as successful as her counterparts, Swifty made her acting debut with a minor role in Valentine's Day. The star, who is dating actor Tom Hiddleston, later lent her voice to The Lorax movie as Audrey and also made a cameo in 2014's The Giver. Now she seems to be now focusing her attention on her music career. It may come as a surprise to discover that the rapper has racked up countless acting roles in his career. Some of his performances include voicing the character of Smooth Move in Turbo and comedic roles in Starsky & Hutch and Scary Movie 5. The singer may have firmed up her status as a true icon through her music, but her movie roles speak for themselves. The star, who was previously married to director Guy Ritchie, has had over 20 film roles during her career, including those in Desperately Seeking Susan, Evita and Die Another Day. The actor formed the band Thirty Seconds to Mars back in 1998, running the show as the lead vocalist and songwriter. Meanwhile, he was making a name for himself in the acting world and played supporting roles in Fight Club, American Psycho and The Thin Red Line. He took a break to focus on his music, but later returned to movie making and quickly gained notoriety, winning awards for his talents. Leto's most notable performances include those in Dallas Buyers Club and Suicide Squad. The singer has worked hard on her acting career while simultaneously making music. She has since become a rom-com favourite, starring in Maid in Manhattan, Shall We Dance, The Wedding Planner and The Back-Up Plan.

Sweden's first contest was the third, in 1958. Without broadcasting a public selection, Sveriges Radio (SR) chose to send Alice Babs to the contest in Hilversum, Netherlands. The song selected was \\"Samma stjärna lyser för oss två\\" (The same stars shine for the two of us), later renamed \\"Lilla stjärna\\" (Little star). It finished fourth at Eurovision on 12 March 1958. The first Melodifestival, incorporated into the Säg det med musik radio series, took place on 29 January 1959 at Cirkus in Stockholm; eight songs participated. Four \\"expert\\" juries in Stockholm, Gothenburg, Malmö, and Luleå decided the winner. The competition was won by Siw Malmkvist performing \\"Augustin\\", but SR decided that the winning song—regardless of its original performer—would be performed by Brita Borg at Eurovision. This policy, of selecting the artist for Eurovision internally and having other artists perform potential Swedish entries at Melodifestivalen, was stopped in 1961. The competition became a stand-alone television programme in 1960, known as the Eurovisionschlagern, svensk final. In the event's early years, it was broadcast to Norway and Denmark through the Nordvision network. The competition adopted its current name, Melodifestivalen, in 1967. The Melodifestival has failed to be staged on three occasions. In 1964, the competition was cancelled due to an artist's strike; Sweden did not send a song to Eurovision that year. Sweden was absent at Eurovision for a second time in 1970 because of a Nordic boycott of the voting system, which had led to a four-way tie for first place at the 1969 contest. After SR staged the 1975 contest in Stockholm, left-wing groups argued that Sweden should not spend money to win and host Eurovision again. This led to mass demonstrations against commercial music and the organisation of an anti-commercial Alternativfestivalen. Therefore, Sweden decided not to send a song to Eurovision 1976,..., what would be the answer ?

Answer:","response":"The first step of the process you've described, which refers to the formation and eventual collapse of a star into a black hole, is that the star burns until it runs out of fuel. A star's life begins with the gravitational collapse of a gaseous nebula of material composed primarily of hydrogen, along with helium and trace amounts of other heavier elements. These stars burn their fuel through a process called nuclear fusion. In the core of a star, under high pressure and temperature, hydrogen atoms combine to form helium. This fusion process releases a tremendous amount of energy in the form of light and heat, which is what makes stars shine. However, over time, the star exhausts its fuel - the hydrogen present in its core. This depletion doesn't happen suddenly but over many millions to billions of years. This process is the first step in a chain of events that can ultimately lead to the star collapsing under its own gravity to form a black hole, given it has sufficient mass."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: This is a correct answer to the following question about What Chilli Wants.

Through the credible threat of violence, the racketeers deter people from swindling, robbing, injuring, sabotaging or otherwise harming their clients. Protection rackets tend to appear in markets where the police and judiciary cannot be counted on to provide legal protection, either because of incompetence (as in weak or failed states) or illegality (black markets). - The term magistrate is used in a variety of systems of governments and laws to refer to a civilian officer who administers the law. In ancient Rome, a \\"magistratus\\" was one of the highest ranking government officers, and possessed both judicial and executive powers. In other parts of the world, such as China, a magistrate was responsible for administration over a particular geographic area. Today, in some jurisdictions, a magistrate is a judicial officer who hears cases in a lower court, and typically deals with more minor or preliminary matters. In other jurisdictions (e.g., England and Wales), magistrates may be volunteers without formal legal training who perform a judicial role with regard to minor matters. - Historically a mandamento was the part of Italian territory under the jurisdiction of a \\"pretore\\" which is a kind of magistrate.

Each family claims sovereignty over a territory, usually a town or village or a neighbourhood (\\"borgata\\") of a larger city, in which it operates its rackets. Its members call themselves \\"men of honour\\", although the public often refers to them as \\"mafiosi\\".

When he lost his job, he rented out the condo and moved back home. “Mom and Dad are my base,” he said. “When things go wrong, I can pop back over there.” He then lived in Chelsea with a boyfriend, decided to indulge his interest in style and attended beauty school at the Aveda Institute. He is now a hairdresser for Bumble and bumble. When his relationship ended, Mr. Ellis again returned to the parental nest, lacking the time and resources to find another place to live. “I always intended to go back to my apartment in Prospect Heights,” he said. “I made a home of it and was superattached to it, but I couldn’t afford to keep it.” For more than a year, he inhabited his childhood bedroom. His sister returned, too, along with her baby boy. “I wasn’t used to being there with another adult sibling,” he said. “You think it’s bad as kids!” His nephew, adorable though he was, awakened every morning “screaming like a banshee.” Mr. Ellis’s plan was to sell the condo and buy a smaller place for himself in the city. Last spring, he listed the unit with a friend, Jeff Gardner, an agent at the Corcoran Group, and requested that Mr. Gardner find him a new home. The condo sold in the fall for 455,000. “It was totally sick and insane,” Mr. Ellis said, referring to his profit. He credited his father for suggesting that he buy a decade before, and himself for having no reason to disagree. Mr. Ellis hoped to live in Greenwich Village, not far from his workplace, which is in the meatpacking district. His price was capped at 400,000, but “that would have been superstretching it,” he said. “I know what other people go through, so I was really expecting the worst when it came to the hunt. I had a low, constricting price range.” In truth, “he wasn’t going to go a penny over what he could afford,” which was 300,000, Mr. Gardner said. “There is a big difference between ‘I want’ and ‘I can.’ ” Mr. Ellis checked out some affordable studio co-ops, which happened to be in Midtown Manhattan. Because he works one day a week at Bumble and bumble’s East 56th Street salon, the location seemed reasonable. At 153 East 57th, the Gotham Towne House, a 450-square-foot studio, listed at 365,000, had too little closet space. Besides, that part of town was so congested and loud, “you could hear the whole world outside your window,” Mr. Gardner said. The studio sold in September for 350,000. They headed across town to Addison Hall on West 57th Street, where they saw three studios for less than 300,000. One was in terrible shape. Another had been nicely renovated but in dark wood with dark colors. Mr. Ellis loved the third studio, on a high floor. It was big and bright, at 360 square feet, with two south-facing windows and two sizable closets. The well-kept building had a laundry room, bike racks and metal storage lockers in the basement. He was, however, still optimistic about living downtown. So Mr. Gardner scheduled some showings, partly to demonstrate how little his money could buy there. A 275-square-foot co-op at 99 Avenue B in the East Village, with a 279,000 price tag, was “the smallest apartment I ever saw,” Mr. Gardner said. An armoire prevented the door from opening fully. “It was a wake-up for him — this is the reality,” Mr. Gardner said. More reality appeared at 24 Fifth Avenue, a lovely building near Ninth Street, featuring another small and expensive studio. This one was 325 square feet for 395,000. At one of the West Village’s taller buildings — the Parker Towne House at 3 Sheridan Square, above a Gristedes supermarket — an apartment of 400 square feet was bigger than the others, but had no kitchen counter space. “I wouldn’t be able to set down a glass,” Mr. Ellis said. That one already had an accepted offer of 399,000. “The quality of everything was a notch below what you would expect, but it was a part of the education process,” Mr. Gardner said. “Quamin hadn’t really come to terms with what he could afford and had this idea he would be living downtown, but I said, ‘You have to be realistic — here is what 399,000 buys, and you don’t have 399,000.’ ” Midtown it would be. “In the end, financials win out over location, as they often do,” said Mr. Gardner, whom Mr. Ellis termed “the voice of reason.” Mr. Ellis bought his apartment — the Addison Hall studio that he liked — for the asking price, 299,000. (It was originally listed last spring for 359,000.) Monthly maintenance is 642. The board interview was informal, with one person meeting him at the Holiday Inn across the street. With the market softening, “sellers couldn’t ask for the moon,” Mr. Ellis said. “That really worked in my favor. We had genius, genius, genius timing.” Mr. Ellis moved in February, along with his affectionate cat, Misstress. He wouldn’t mind new kitchen cabinets and a redone bathroom, but is content for now. To his surprise, he loves his new Midtown West neighborhood. “The irony is, this was not even on my radar,” he said. “I had no idea.” His parents are glad, in large part, that he is out on his own, he said. “I definitely miss them,” he said. “I’ve been trying to get home for Sunday dinner every week.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page RE8 of the New York edition with the headline: Leaving the Nest (Again).

The answer is:","response":"No, that answer provides safety precautions for viewing a solar eclipse rather than explaining when they happen. A more appropriate answer would be: Solar eclipses happen when the Moon passes between the Earth and the Sun, casting a shadow on Earth.

While having her portrait done by Broome, a call from Curtis brings her eagerly to a jeweler, only to discover to her disappointment that he merely seeks her advice in buying Donna an engagement gift. After he purchases an expensive one, Christabel plants a seed of doubt in Donna's mind and makes her feel guilty by insinuating that in accepting such a lavish gift, Donna is giving Curtis the appearance of being after his money.

Is art necessary? If yes, then why? Why is art still necessary?","response":"Although the two questions appear to be related, they have slight differences in their implications and meanings. Let's examine each question and provide a detailed answer to better understand their differences. 1. Is art necessary? If yes, then why? This question seeks to understand whether art holds any importance or value in our lives and, if so, why. In response to this question, one can consider numerous reasons why art is necessary: a. Cultural Significance: Art reflects and records the cultures and societies in which it was produced. It preserves the cultural values, beliefs, and ideas of people, and helps future generations understand the heritage left by their ancestors. b. Emotional Expression: Art provides an outlet for individuals to express emotions that may be difficult to convey through other means, such as language. It helps individuals connect with their own emotions and enables them to experience empathy and a deeper understanding of others. c. Aesthetic Appreciation: Art captures beauty, stimulating our senses, and enriching our lives. Engaging with art can bring a sense of pleasure and enjoyment to people who value the aesthetics of visual, auditory, or textual pieces. d. Cognitive Development: Involvement in the creation or appreciation of art helps develop critical thinking, problem-solving, and perceptual skills. It encourages individuals to think creatively and fosters cognitive growth. e. Social Interaction: Art creates opportunities for social interaction, bringing people together to experience and discuss the meanings and interpretations of various artworks. This fosters understanding and tolerance among individuals from different backgrounds. f. Economic Impact: Art also has a significant economic impact, with industries like film, theater, music, and fine arts generating revenue and creating employment opportunities for countless artists, curators, and other professionals. 2. Why is art still necessary? This question implies that there might have been doubts about the continued relevance of art in the present day. It seeks to understand if and why art remains necessary despite changes in society, technology, and human priorities. Here, a few reasons why art is still necessary can be presented: a. Adaptability: Art continually adapts itself to changing societal conditions. It conveys and comments on the most pressing matters of our time, taking on new mediums and forms to stay relevant. b. Human Nature: As humans, we have an innate desire to create and appreciate beauty, to connect with our emotions, and to express ourselves. This fundamental aspect of human nature ensures that art remains necessary, regardless of the changes that permeate our lives. c. Conversations And Reflections: Art still serves as an essential platform for initiating conversations about contemporary issues and values. It offers a means for people to reflect on topics such as politics, social justice, and environmentalism. d. Impact On Mental Health: With the increasing importance placed on mental health in today's society, art has emerged as a therapeutic tool that helps individuals explore and process their emotions, find solace, and reduce stress. e. Technological Advancements: The rise of digital technology and social media has not diminished the importance of art; instead, it has broadened the platforms through which art can be created, shared, and appreciated. As a result, it has become more accessible to a wider audience, reaffirming its necessity in our lives. In conclusion, while both questions revolve around the importance and necessity of art, they approach the subject from slightly different perspectives. The first question focuses on the inherent value of art in human society, while the second delves into why art remains necessary in the face of change. Despite their differences, both questions emphasize the enduring significance and essential role that art plays in our lives."},{"question":"Summarize this article in one sentence. On your Xbox 360's Power button, there will most likely be one to four red flashing lights displaying around the perimeter of the button; these lights pertain to different problems. If you don't see an error code when you turn on the Xbox 360, skip ahead to the \\"Replace the power brick\\" step. Depending on the number of flashing quadrants, the problem could be one of four main things: One red quadrant — Displays when a hardware component (e.g., the fan or a connected USB stick) stops working. Two red quadrants — Signifies that your console has overheated. This will normally go away on its own, but you can take steps to ensure that it doesn't happen again. Three red quadrants — Indicates that a serious error regarding one or more hardware components has occurred. This is the infamous \\"Red Ring of Death\\" error. Full red circle — Indicates that an A/V connection has been lost. You won't see this for Xbox 360s which use HDMI cables. If you see one red quadrant light up on your Xbox 360's Power button, you'll also see an error code appear on the connected television. Since there are numerous codes you might see, the easiest way to address your specific error is by typing the error code followed by xbox 360 error into a search engine, selecting a reputable search result, and following the instructions. Unfortunately, you'll have to take your Xbox 360 in for repairs if you can't address the error by looking it up. While your console's two flashing red lights will disappear on their own after the console comes down in temperature, there are a few things you can do to prevent your console from overheating in the future: Make sure the console has plenty of space in all directions. Lay your console horizontally, not vertically. Clean any dust out of the console's vents (you can use a damp cloth or a vacuum for this). Keep the console in a cool, dry place; avoid having it in the sun or near a heater. . The Red Ring of Death is somewhat non-specific, but you may be able to fix it by applying a new layer of thermal paste to your Xbox 360's heat sinks. As with most internal issues, the Red Ring of Death is a problem best left to professionals. The easiest way to fix this error is by using an HDMI cable to connect your Xbox 360 to your TV; if that isn't an option, check your current A/V cables to see how they're plugged in. If they're loose, tighten them and then restart your console. If your A/V cables are fine, you'll need to replace them. If the error continues displaying even when using new A/V cables, your console's A/V input may be broken. You can either send your console in for repairs or switch over to a different display that allows you to use an HDMI cable. Microsoft's official policy for a CD drive that's stuck open is to wiggle the tray from side to side, wiggle it up and down, and then gently push it shut. If pressing the \\"Eject\\" button doesn't prompt the tray to pop out, you'll need to take the Xbox 360 in for service. If the CD drive is stuck shut, you can try opening it by pushing a bent paper clip into the \\"Eject\\" hole on the front or back of the console. If this doesn't work, your Xbox 360 needs service. If the CD drive works but won't read two or more of your game discs, try removing any attached USB items. If it still won't read your discs, you'll need to take your Xbox 360 in for service. For problems not related to an error code (e.g., unexpected shut-downs), you may need to replace your Xbox 360's power source. This is because Xbox 360 power bricks have roughly 5 years of life before they begin to malfunction. Malfunctioning power bricks can also cause your Xbox 360 to freeze or otherwise under-perform. If your Xbox 360 won't turn on even after replacing the power brick, check the USB slots to see if any of their connectors are bent. Bent connectors can cause the Xbox 360 to fail to turn on; if they are bent, prying them loose with a screwdriver may fix the problem. If you use an HDMI cable and your Xbox 360 isn't displaying video properly, you can try using a different HDMI cable to address the problem. Keep in mind that the problem may also lie with your TV, in which case you'll either need to use a different HDMI port on your TV or use a different TV entirely. If none of the above instructions have fixed the problem you're having with your Xbox 360, you'll need to send it in for repairs.","response":"This article talks about different problems you might face with your Xbox 360, like red flashing lights, and gives tips on how to fix them or when to take it for repairs."},{"question":"Teacher:Write an incorrect answer to the given question based on the associated fact.

The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter. and the situation: The Malegese Ocean is primarily connected to one river. This river is next to Hilda's farm that she has lived on for decades. Ever since she was a child, she was taught that it's important to dump excess fertilizer into the river.

The Birmingham Six spent 17 years in prison before their convictions were quashed in 1991. Mr Hill said Hayes speaking out earlier would have done nothing for them. Explosions at two Birmingham city centre pubs - the Mulberry Bush and Tavern in then Town - killed 21 people in November 1974. Mr Hill said that in the aftermath of the attacks, an IRA spokesman said that if any of their members were found to have been involved in the bombings they would be court martialled. \\"That's why they all [the real bombers] denied it when they went home,\\" he said. \\"They were interrogated.

She needed time, and she needed a plan. \\"If I'm to die, at least tell me what your purpose is, Hadja,\\" she implored, trying to stall for precious moments. Step 4: Introducing Satina's thought process and attempts - By revealing Satina's thoughts and attempts to stall, the reader can follow her journey while building suspense. Hadja's smile widened, but her eyes held a cruel glimmer as she considered the request. \\"Very well,\\" she conceded, \\"but I doubt it will give you any comfort.\\" She began to weave her tale, describing the dark schemes she was now a part of, entwining herself deeper into Satina's fears. Step 5: Providing some answers - By partially divulging Hadja's story, further plot points and questions can be introduced, while keeping the reader engaged and maintaining suspense. As Hadja spoke, Satina started formulating a plan, her determination resolute. She resolved to uncover the truth, save her life and Vane's, and put an end to the sinister plot, no matter the cost. Step 6: Showcasing Satina's resolve - Demonstrating Satina's developed determination propels her into action and sets forth her goal, building anticipation and setting the stage for future events."},{"question":"Premise: Presently, addresses are required on such pieces. Hypothesis: Any parcel may be sent anonymously. Does the premise entail the hypothesis? OPT: + yes; + it is not possible to tell; + no;","response":"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise states that \\"Presently, addresses are required on such pieces,\\" which refers to the necessity of including an address on parcels. This suggests that in the current context, it is mandatory to have an address on any parcel being sent. On the other hand, the hypothesis posits that \\"Any parcel may be sent anonymously.\\" This statement implies that a parcel can be sent without disclosing the sender's identity, which seemingly contradicts the premise requiring addresses on all parcels. The fact that addresses are required on parcels in the present context does not automatically infer that the parcels can be sent anonymously. It is important to note that having an address on a parcel does not necessarily reveal the complete identity of the sender, but it does provide some information that could potentially be traced back to the sender, making it less likely for the parcel to be truly anonymous. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis because, while it acknowledges the necessity of an address on parcels, it does not confirm the possibility of sending parcels entirely anonymously."},{"question":"What is an example of a tweet?","response":"A tweet is a message that you can post on Twitter.

Here's an example of a tweet: \\"@TommyBear I love your teddy bear picnic idea! I think we should add honey sandwiches to our menu. #TeddyBearPicnic 🍯🧸\\" In this tweet, the person is sending a message to their friend TommyBear, talking about something they love (a teddy bear picnic idea), suggesting an idea (adding honey sandwiches to their menu), and using a hashtag (#TeddyBearPicnic) which is like a theme tag for that tweet.

But don't let the basic elements hold you captive. Be creative and make up your own power. If not, try considering things like electricity, superhuman strength, telekinesis, flight, ice, darkness (a good one), or anything you want. Combining more than one power is also possible, but don't make it too strong. Remember, the good guy should always win...for some reason. The whole \\"Taking Over The World\\" thing is outdated. Be more original. For example, Magneto (X-Men) was seen as evil because he was tired of humans treating him and all mutants like trash. Mr Freeze (Batman) had the whole story with his wife - if you watched the movie, you'd know. Nevertheless, let the villain have a good, genuine reason for being so mean (e.g. jealousy, alienation, revenge, protection). A laugh is a confirmation of their power, so it has to suit them. Pick it out carefully. You could choose the deep Dracula kind of chuckle for the guys, the high toned witch cackle could suit some females, but not all. Others would rather prefer the lower mysterious laugh, that is sometimes even confused with a giggle. There are countless choices. In complex plots, henchmen have their very own personalities and would not be considered as part of the super villain. But if the story is short and simple, a henchman can be limited. Give them a basic good quality - e.g. brains, strength, speed, obedience, bravery - and a basic bad quality - e.g. stupidity, clumsiness, cowardice. They don't have to look like the villain, but it would be good if they shared some characteristics or ideas. They could have, for example, the same goal and reason to be doing such dastardly crime. It could be a physical thing, like Achilles' heel, or a mental or inner flaw like greed or jealousy. He could have also been betrayed. But don't let it be an accident, his or her defeat. The point is to teach people that crime does not pay, so let his loss be by flaw. Throughout the story, show signs of his flaw, as Caesar showed signs of his arrogance throughout the Shakespearean play, and it was this flaw which caused him to die. He wasn't a Supervillain, but yours should, as Caesar, perish in the end. A betrayed friend or a spurned lover, if the rivalry is personal it makes for more intense battles.

Stream of thoughts:","response":"The premise describes a situation where pedestrians are in a shaded walkway. The hypothesis suggests that the reason for them being in the shade is to avoid the sun. While it is reasonable to assume that people might stand in the shade to avoid the sun, we cannot definitively conclude that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. There could be alternative reasons for people to be in a shaded walkway other than to avoid the sun. For example, they could be on the walkway for various reasons like taking a leisurely stroll, waiting for someone, or even enjoying the ambiance of the environment.

If you wait, you may forget a lot of important details from the experiment. Having a rough version of your report at the ready a month in advance can save you from unnecessary stress and from having to turn in unpolished work. You may have performed supplemental experiments/simulations, or repeated your initial experience after receiving your first round of feedback. Feedback should go through the following stages ideally: (a) Self-review and revision (b) Peer review and constructive feedback (c) Advisor/instructor review and feedback The goal of your experiment or the goal of proving or disproving certain hypotheses is essentially unimportant when you are writing a lab report. The data contained in it could be anything, and you may very well have to write lab reports in the future that seem silly or unnecessary. The goal of your lab report is to be read and evaluated by another person, like your instructor. It can help to remind yourself of this goal at the beginning of every section before you start writing. When you finish a section of your report, read it through carefully and at the end of it, ask yourself: was that easy to read and understand? Did I succeed in my goal? The narrowest purpose of your lab report is to enable your seniors, advisors, and/or an evaluation committee to confirm your ability to consistently and clearly produce a report. But once you start devising and performing labs of your own, it's quite possible that your peers or juniors will utilize it as a resource.

Take a piece of scrap paper and pencil and list the necessary sections of your lab report in order. Under each section, jot a few sentences that summarize what must be covered in that section. Due to the fact that different instructors have different preferences, you should check your lab report handout or course syllabus to verify expectations for the order and content of your report. Most lab reports are organized, first to last: background information, problem, hypothesis, materials, procedure, data, and your interpretation of what happened as a conclusion. Technical aspects of your paper might require significant explanation. This may necessitate the use of subsections so that you can appropriately delve into and explain those nuanced aspects of your lab problem.

And it's also released details of the new, fifth-generation Corsa super-mini. It's set for its official launch at the Paris Motor Show in October, priced from less than £10,000. Vauxhall is out to knock Ford's Fiesta off the top sales spot. The current Corsa — its best-seller — sold 83,000 in the UK in the past year, against around 121,000 Fiestas. Supercar: Vauxhall's new, fifth-generation Corsa super-mini is set to launch in October. Although almost as long as the outgoing model, Vauxhall says almost every other aspect of the new car's design and engineering has been changed to 'significantly improve' it. That includes a re-designed instrument panel and dashboard and Vauxhall's IntelliLink communications system, which operates through a 7in colour touchscreen, is compatible with smartphones and incorporates extra features, such as voice command. The new model, pictured right, will be available with heated front seats, steering wheel and windscreen, as well as 'soft-tone' ambient lighting and an optional, full-size panoramic roof. Available in three and fivedoor versions, the next-generation Corsa has a new chassis, better suspension and speedsensitive power steering, while the chassis has been tuned for a smoother drive, with more precise steering, to cater for what Vauxhall calls Britain's 'unique and challenging topography'. Does it mean our crumbling, potholed roads? Star exhibit: Princess Diana's Austin Mini Metro will be on display at Hagerty's Festival of the Unexceptional. A red Austin Mini Metro once owned by Princess Diana — and affectionately known as the 'Courting Car' — will be the star exhibit at an event that aims to be the antidote to all those posh, glittering supercar extravaganzas. Normally in Coventry Transport Museum, it makes its first public outing in around 20 years at Hagerty's Festival of the Unexceptional later this month. Said to have been a gift from Prince Charles to the then Lady Diana Spencer during their courtship, the car will headline the first 'Concours de l'Ordináire' in Towcester, Northants. The event promises 'the finest collection of mauve interiors and beige exteriors ever brought together in one place', within a show that 'humorously celebrates the best examples of some of the most mundane British and European cars ever built' between 1968 and 1985. An spokesman said: 'The 1980 Metro is the final entry on a list of 50 truly unexceptional vehicles and highlights how a great era of ordinary cars has become endangered.' Other unexceptional specimens include a Peel P50, a three-wheeled micro-car, produced from 1962 to 1965, and an Austin Maestro — a distant cousin of the Metro — owned by the grand-daughter of the aristocrat who financed William Morris, to create his celebrated, eponymous company.

The Draags are an alien race which is humanoid in shape but a hundred times larger than humans, with blue skin, fan-like earlobes and huge, protruding red eyes. The Draags also live much longer than human beings one Draag week equals a human year. Some Oms are domesticated as pets, but others run wild, and are periodically exterminated. The Draags' treatment of the Oms is ironically contrasted with their high level of technological and spiritual development.The story opens with a woman running, occasionally looking behind her as if pursued. An enormous hand descends and blocks her way. She runs back the way she came and finds her way blocked by another hand. It becomes apparent that she is being toyed with by entities that do not appreciate her fragility, and as she dies, the infant she has been carrying and attempting to protect begins to cry.The view changes to reveal the Draag children who have accidentally killed the woman; they leave quickly when an adult Draag and child approach. The child voices concern for the orphaned infant, and the two take the child to their home. Tiva (the Draag child) names the infant Terr (word play on \\"terrible\\", same spelling in French; also a homophone for the French \\"Terre\\", meaning Earth).

Assess their current skill level. Create a goal-oriented timeline.\\"","response":"Title: Enhancing the Learning Journey: A Goal-Oriented Approach for Success Introduction In an increasingly competitive world, learning new skills and enhancing existing ones is the key to success. Whether it's for personal growth, career development or merely a hobby, pursuing an education presents the opportunity to expand our knowledge and capabilities. As a tutor or educator, it's vital to guide learners with a tailored approach to ensure they attain their educational goals. The following steps offer a solid framework for creating a goal-oriented timeline that can foster accelerated progress and satisfaction in any learner. Step 1: Inquire about their reasons for wanting to learn now Understanding the motivation behind a learner's decision to pursue a particular subject is crucial in devising a personalized educational plan. Start by asking questions based on their interests, career aspirations, and personal ambitions. This step enables the learner to reflect on the reasons behind their decision, which will affect their dedication and focus during the learning journey. As an educator, this insight helps you develop a tailored strategy that aligns with the learner's goals and aspirations. Whether the learner wants to advance in their career, pursue a personal passion or fulfill a long-held dream, your understanding of their motivation empowers you to deliver a stimulating and enriching learning experience. Step 2: Assess their current skill level Before diving into the learning process, it's essential to determine the learner's existing knowledge and skills. A comprehensive assessment helps you understand their strengths, weaknesses, and potential areas for improvement. This information allows you to set realistic benchmarks and create a customized learning plan that caters to the individual's abilities. A variety of assessment methods can be employed, such as quizzing, observation, and self-assessment questionnaires. Employing a combination of these techniques will give you an all-encompassing understanding of the learner's current skills, enabling you to devise a tailored approach that maximizes their potential for success. Step 3: Create a goal-oriented timeline With a clear understanding of the learner's motivation and current abilities, it's time to establish a well-defined, goal-oriented timeline that maps out their learning path. Creating this timeline involves setting specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals that account for their aspirations as well as any potential roadblocks. First, set short, medium, and long-term objectives that encompass various milestones, from acquiring specific skill sets to achieving broader educational goals. The timeline should be flexible enough to accommodate inevitable setbacks and be adaptable to the learner's progress and evolving interests. Next, identify resources and strategies needed to achieve these goals effectively. This might include textbooks, online resources, and hands-on training. As an educator, implement teaching techniques that cater to the learner's preferred learning style, be it visual, auditory, or kinesthetic, to enhance their engagement and retention of knowledge. Lastly, set up regular checkpoints throughout the timeline to assess the learner's progress, providing feedback and modifying the learning plan as needed. This will ensure the learner stays on track and feels supported throughout their journey. Conclusion By diligently following this approach, educators and learners can cultivate a mutually beneficial learning experience marked by both achievement and personal growth. Inquiring about the learner's reasons for pursuing education, assessing their current skill levels, and creating a clear, goal-oriented timeline collectively aim to empower individuals to conquer new skills and emerge as confident, well-informed members of society."},{"question":"Use reasoning to lead to the answer of the following question: When you experience boredom, what can you do on television?

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no.","response":"No, the provided answer does not directly explain what organic semiconductors are or the concept of HOMO and LUMO in organic semiconductors. Organic semiconductors are materials that have properties similar to inorganic semiconductors, like silicon, but they are composed of organic molecules, meaning they mostly consist of carbon and hydrogen atoms. They are used in applications such as organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic solar cells, and flexible electronics. The concept of HOMO (Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital) and LUMO (Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital) in organic semiconductors relates to the energy levels of their molecular orbitals. HOMO is the energy level of the highest occupied molecular orbital, and LUMO is the energy level of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital. The energy difference between HOMO and LUMO, known as the bandgap, determines the material's electronic properties such as conductivity and absorption."},{"question":"Following two consecutive losses to Dallas and San Diego, Philadelphia went to Chicago to take on the Chicago Bears, who were 4-5, on Sunday Night Football. The Eagles dominated the first quarter as Philadelphia took a two score lead on a 25-yard field goal by David Akers and a 13-yard touchdown from Donovan McNabb to Jason Avant on a wide receiver screen pass. Down 10-0 at the start of the second quarter, Chicago drove within one point as Bears kicker Robbie Gould successfully made a 45-yard field goal, as well as a pair of 28-yard field goals, to make the score 10-9 at the half. In the second half, the Bears took the lead as Robbie Gould kicked his fourth field goal, a 49-yarder that put Chicago up 12-10. However, it took only 30 seconds for the Eagles to take the lead as Donovan McNabb passed to DeSean Jackson for a 48-yard touchdown to give the Eagles a 17-12 lead. Ironically, the 48-yard touchdown catch was the shortest touchdown scored by Jackson thus far in the season. Chicago again took the lead in the third quarter as struggling quarterback Jay Cutler, who had already missed several wide open targets in the game, passed to tight end Kellen Davis for a 15-yard score. The Bears converted the 2-point conversion attempt as running back Matt Forte scored on the pass from Cutler to put the Bears back on top 20-17. In the fourth quarter, both defenses fought back and forth but the only points of the final period were scored by Eagles running back LeSean McCoy on a 10-yard, game-winning touchdown run to put the Eagles up 24-20, the game's final score. With the win, the Eagles improved to 6-4. Ironically, the Eagles win came by the same score (24-20) in the same city (Chicago) at the same time and venue (Sunday Night Football on NBC) as when they had lost in week 4 of the 2008 season. Answer this question: How many yards longer was Jay Cutler's only touchdown pass compared to Donovan McNabb's first touchdown pass?","response":"To find out how many yards longer Jay Cutler's only touchdown pass was compared to Donovan McNabb's first touchdown pass, we need to compare the lengths of the touchdown passes. Donovan McNabb's first touchdown pass was a 13-yard pass to Jason Avant. Jay Cutler's only touchdown pass was a 15-yard pass to Kellen Davis. To find the difference in yardage of the two touchdown passes, we subtract the length of McNabb's pass from the length of Cutler's pass: 15 yards (Cutler's pass) - 13 yards (McNabb's pass) = 2 yards Answer: Jay Cutler's only touchdown pass was 2 yards longer than Donovan McNabb's first touchdown pass."},{"question":"Question: Where can you find an old coffee table book?

This is a 2 x 2 grid labeled \\"Crafting,\\" to the right of your character portrait. Each craftable item has its own recipe. When you drag the right items into the crafting area, the result of the recipe will appear in the box on the right. Minecraft doesn't tell you the recipes, so it's up to you to discover them. Example: Drag a block of wood into the crafting area, leaving the other three squares empty. The box on the right should show a picture of wooden planks, with the number four next to it. (To get wood, move your mouse over a tree trunk and hold down the left mouse button.) This will put it in your inventory, and destroy the ingredients in the crafting area. Example: Drag the wooden planks to your inventory. The wood you used to make them will disappear. The inventory crafting screen only allows you to craft certain items. To make most Minecraft items, you'll need a crafting table. Cover the 2 x 2 crafting grid with wooden planks to build one. Drag the crafting table from the box on the right to your hotbar. (Your hotbar is the line of items at the bottom of the screen.) This recipe won't work if you just put one stack of four planks in the same square. Minecraft recipes care about what type of item is in each square, not how many items there are total. Right-click your stack of wooden planks to separate the items into multiple stacks. If you are on a Mac without a right-click button, use Control+click or use trackpad commands. Close your inventory by pressing E again. Select the crafting table in your hotbar.

Place two planks in a vertical line in the crafting area to make sticks. Place three planks across the top row of the crafting area. Place a stick in the center square, and another stick just below it. This last recipe makes a wooden pickaxe. Equip it in your hotbar and select it, and you can break stone blocks. You can experiment to discover recipes yourself, or look up instructions online. Here are some useful basic recipes to get you started: Make a sword to fight monsters. Craft other tools to break down blocks faster or allow you to break more advanced blocks. Get a stone axe and pickaxe as soon as you can, then mine iron ore so you can upgrade again. Build a furnace out of cobblestone to cook food and to smelt iron ore into usable metal. Make torches to light your house, preventing monsters from appearing inside.

Question 2: What are the M, V and N diagrams for this structure? OPTIONS: a). no; b). yes; Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","response":"Question 1: The importance of rolling loads and influence line diagrams in structural analysis Imagine you have a toy bridge, and you want to make sure it's strong enough for your toy cars. Rolling loads are like the weight of those toy cars moving across the bridge. The bridge has to be strong enough so it doesn't break when the load moves from one side to the other. Now let's say you want to draw a picture showing how your toys crossing the bridge could affect its strength. This is where influence line diagrams come in! These diagrams help us understand how the bridge will respond to different places where toy cars or other loads are placed. In summary, rolling loads and influence line diagrams are important in structural analysis because they help us make sure our bridges and structures are strong and safe for the things we put on them. Question 2: M, V, and N diagrams for a structure When talking about structures, M, V, and N are diagrams that help us understand how strong the structure is in different ways: 1. M is for Moment, which is like a twisting force on the structure. You could imagine it as if you're trying to twist a straw; 2. V is for Shear, which is a force that tries to slide parts of the structure past each other, similar to how you'd slide your hands in opposite directions; 3. N is for Normal, which is the force that tries to stretch or compress the structure. Think of it as either pushing or pulling something apart. Now, with the options a) no and b) yes, it's unclear what these options refer to. However, the answer to both questions wouldn't necessarily be the same, since they are about different aspects of structural analysis - one is about the importance of rolling loads and influence line diagrams, and the other is about specific types of diagrams to understand how strong a structure is."},{"question":"His quietus make with a bare bodkin... Unlike Hamlet's first two major soliloquies, his third and most famous speech seems to be governed by reason and not frenzied emotion. Unable to do little but wait for completion of his plan to \\"catch the conscience of the king\\", Hamlet sparks an internal philosophical debate on the advantages and disadvantages of existence, and whether it is one's right to end his or her own life. Read on.... ||||| William Shakespeare had a secret son who grew up to become the poet laureate of England, according to the author of a new biography. In his new book \\"Shakespeare's Bastard: The Life of Sir William Davenant,\\" biographer Simon Andrew Stirling claims that the Bard of Avon was the father of poet and playwright Davenant, the Australian reports. Stirling says that Davenant was the son of Shakespeare and Jane Davenant, a married tavern mistress. Shakespeare was married to Anne Hathaway; the couple had three children: Susanna; Hamnet, who died at 11; and Judith. Many have speculated that the marriage was not a happy one; in his will, Shakespeare famously left his wife his \\"second best bed.\\" See more of our top stories on Facebook >> Shakespeare was Davenant's godfather. But Stirling argues the two were biologically related, pointing to pictures of the two that indicate they both had a \\"droopy left eyebrow.\\" Stirling claims that Shakespeare's famous Sonnet 126 was written for Davenant. The poem, which many have speculated was about a gay lover of Shakespeare, reads in part, \\"O thou, my lovely boy, who in thy power / Dost hold Time's fickle glass, his sickle, hour; / Who hast by waning grown, and therein show'st / Thy lovers withering as thy sweet self grow'st...\\" \\"The poem appears to have been written to a very young child whose birth caused his mother’s full-moon belly to wane,\\" Stirling writes. The Daily Mail notes that the rumor of Shakespeare's secret son has been around for a while. It was repeated by novelist Samuel Butler, who once remarked, \\"It seemed to [Davenant] that he writ with the very same spirit that Shakespeare [did], and seemed content enough to be called his son.\\" Davenant, who is perhaps best known for his plays \\"The Wits\\" and \\"The Playhouse to Be Let,\\" died in 1668.

From beyond France he absorbed some traits from Verdi, and possibly Mascagni, and above all Wagner. Unlike some other French composers of the period, Massenet never fell fully under Wagner's spell, but he took from the earlier composer a richness of orchestration and a fluency in treatment of musical themes.Although when he chose, Massenet could write noisy and dissonant scenes – in 1885 Bernard Shaw called him \\"one of the loudest of modern composers\\" – much of his music is soft and delicate. Hostile critics have seized on this characteristic, but the article on Massenet in the 2001 edition of Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians observes that in the best of his operas this sensual side \\"is balanced by strong dramatic tension (as in Werther), theatrical action (as in Thérèse), scenic diversion (as in Esclarmonde), or humour (as in Le portrait de Manon).\\"Massenet's Parisian audiences were greatly attracted by the exotic in music, and Massenet willingly obliged, with musical evocations of far-flung places or times long past. Macdonald lists a great number of locales depicted in the operas, from ancient Egypt, mythical Greece and biblical Galilee to Renaissance Spain, India and Revolutionary Paris. Massenet's practical experience in orchestra pits as a young man and his careful training at the Conservatoire equipped him to make such effects without much recourse to unusual instruments.

His music is rhythmically complex; harmonically and melodically he employs a system he called modes of limited transposition, which he abstracted from the systems of material generated by his early compositions and improvisations. He wrote music for chamber ensembles and orchestra, vocal music, as well as for solo organ and piano, and also experimented with the use of novel electronic instruments developed in Europe during his lifetime. He travelled widely and wrote works inspired by diverse influences ranging from Japanese music, the landscape of Bryce Canyon in Utah and the life of St. Francis of Assisi. He said he perceived colours when he heard certain musical chords (a phenomenon known as synaesthesia in its literal manifestation); combinations of these colours, he said, were important in his compositional process. For a short period Messiaen experimented with the parametrisation associated with \\"total serialism\\", in which field he is often cited as an innovator. His style absorbed many global musical influences such as Indonesian gamelan (tuned percussion often features prominently in his orchestral works). Messiaen entered the Paris Conservatoire at the age of 11 and was taught by Paul Dukas, Maurice Emmanuel, Charles-Marie Widor and Marcel Dupré, among others. He was appointed organist at the Église de la Sainte-Trinité, Paris, in 1931, a post held until his death. He taught at the Schola Cantorum de Paris during the 1930s.

Karine Charbonnier-Beck was hailed as a bold speaker of truth to power for her appearance three weeks ago on the TF1 programme Face aux Francais (Face to Face with the French), in which the president was questioned by members of the public. Her frank denunciation of the government's business policies, and refusal to be impressed by President Hollande's attempts to explain, made an instant hit. After being inundated with mostly complimentary tweets and emails from across the country, she has now been offered a regular slot on one of France's leading radio chat-shows. \\"I thought it was important to tell the president exactly what we have to go through as small business-owners,\\" she says in an interview at the Beck Industries factory in Armentieres, on the Belgian border. \\"When French people think about business, they automatically imagine rich tycoons and the CEOs of massive multinationals. \\"They don't realise that most of the work is done at a much more humble level. After the broadcast I got so many messages from viewers saying how refreshing it was to hear things from a different angle.\\" In the television programme, Ms Charbonnier-Beck upbraided the president for failing to understand the reality of running a business. She said that by simply moving a few kilometres across the frontier into Belgium, she could save Beck Industries â‚¬3m (3.7m/Â£2.3m) in taxes and charges every year. Her staff would also earn more because of lower payroll taxes. Ms Charbonnier-Beck said that President Hollande had failed to live up to his promise to simplify red tape. In fact, she said, there had been a process of \\"complexification\\"; and she urged a reform of the trade union system which, in its current form, hindered industrial relations. As for the president's responses, she says she was distinctly unimpressed. \\"I imagined that he would have come prepared for the event and used the section with me to announce some new initiative on business. But there was nothing of the kind. \\"I didn't have the feeling he was listening to anything I said. The answers had nothing to do with my questions. It is impossible to know what the president really thinks about anything. He says whatever he thinks the people he is with will want to hear.\\" Ms Charbonnier-Beck is the fourth generation of her family to run Beck Industries, which was set up in 1919 in a town destroyed in World War One. Armentieres, which lies a little south of Ypres, was on the frontline for four years. After meeting at one of France's top business schools HEC, she and her husband Hugues began at the company 20 years ago. Ten years ago they took over the reins from Karine's father. \\"After HEC we had the chance to go to the US. There was a choice: Harvard or Armentieres. Naturally we chose Armentieres,\\" laughs Ms Charbonnier-Beck. With its crumbling industrial heritage and surrounding fields of Brussels sprouts, Armentieres may not be the most picturesque of locations. But it has provided a solid base for the business. Today the company owns factories at Aberdeen and Wolverhampton in the UK, as well as in Belgium and Germany. The factories all make heavy bolts and fastenings for use in the oil, gas and nuclear power industries. Overall Beck employs some 700 people. \\"We have been very impressed by the British approach to business. It is so very different from the French way,\\" says Hugues Charbonnier. \\"In France we are very good at mastering a core of competences and really excelling at them. But in the UK there is always the desire to move on, to try something new. Probably the perfect world would involve a synthesis of the two approaches.\\" Karine says that she and her husband are very proud of what they have achieved. \\"We know we are a very good company,\\" she says. \\"But we need to invest if we are to stay ahead of the competition. And the only way we can do that is if we start making more profits. That means there have to be lower charges.\\" And has taking on the president had any effect? Has the publicity gone to her head? \\"Not a bit of it. I have started turning down requests for interviews and the radio appearance will only be one evening every couple of weeks,\\" she says. \\"It is important to get our message across. But work comes first.\\"","response":"A small business owner who publicly challenged French President Hollande's government policies gained national attention and became a radio chat-show contributor after her frank critique resonated with the public."},{"question":"Determine if the sentence is true based on the text below: Foley and Boothroyd were both Labour politicians Maurice Anthony Foley (9 October 1925 – 8 February 2002) was a British Labour Party politician.

After writing and producing a few of mentor Roger Cormans' New World films, Demme was afforded the opportunity to direct for the first time, and he delivers a movie that not only delivers the expected and tasty doses of nudity and violence, but has an appealing tongue-in-cheek quality to it as well; it's often as funny as it is flashy. Standout scenes include a lewd and crude vaudeville style act performed for the prisoners, as well as a potent dream / fantasy sequence for uptight and obviously very repressed Superintendent McQueen (horror icon Barbara Steele, doing a marvelous turn in this antagonistic role). I also enjoyed a bank robbery scene gone haywire and a carjacking scene that was simply uproarious. As in other movies of this kind, it's also commendable that it's as much a portrait of female empowerment as it is pure exploitation. These women are tough, they take no garbage from anybody, and they're more than capable of handling themselves. Our attractive cast here makes the most of their roles: Juanita Brown as the aggressive Maggie, Roberta Collins as the sassy Belle, Rainbeaux Smith as the cute and timid Lavelle, Gavin as the wide-eyed newcomer, and Lynda Gold (a.k.a. Crystin Sinclaire) in a bright appearance as an accomplice on the outside. As our climax plays out, Demme comes up with a tense \\"beat the clock\\" finish as our heroines race to save Belle from being lobotomized by predatory Dr. Randolph (Warren Miller), the type of man who thinks nothing of taking advantage of women. Bouncing along to John Cales' flavorful score, \\"Caged Heat\\" is upbeat entertainment and a guaranteed good time. 8/10 How would you describe the sentiment of this review?","response":"The sentiment of this review is predominantly positive and enthusiastic. The reviewer appreciates the film's combination of expected elements from 70's exploitation films, such as nudity and violence, with a tongue-in-cheek and amusing quality.

To determine whether the first premise is true given the second premise, more context and information are required. Firstly, let's consider each statement separately to assess the possible scenarios they imply. The first premise, \\"A man is standing outside a building while another man in a military uniform leans against a low wall,\\" describes a specific scene where two men are engaged in different activities. One man is outside a building, presumably taking a break from what he was doing, while the other is leaning against the wall, potentially also taking a break. The fact that one of them is wearing a military uniform implies that he may be a soldier or works in some capacity for the military. The second premise, \\"Two men are taking a break from work,\\" implies that there are two men who have temporarily stopped working for some reason. This statement does not provide specific details about the men or the context in which they are taking a break. We do not know their occupations or where they are located. On the surface, it may appear that the second premise could describe the scenario depicted in the first premise. One man is taking a break outside a building, and the other is leaning against a wall, with both men potentially having paused their work for some time. The man in the military uniform could be taking a break from his duties, explaining the presence of the uniform. However, there are a few considerations that lead us to question whether the first premise is truly true under the second premise: 1. Lack of explicit connection: No specific information from the second premise demonstrates that both men are engaged in work-related activities. For example, the man standing outside the building could be waiting for a friend or taking a casual stroll, and the man in the military uniform could be on vacation or simply passing through the area. 2. Ambiguity of location: Neither premise specifies the location of the two men, making it difficult to establish a direct link between the two scenarios. The men from the first premise could be in a completely different place than the men from the second premise. 3. Alternate scenarios: There are various possibilities when considering two men taking a break from work. They could be working together or separately, in similar or different professions, or taking a break indoors or outdoors. The fact that they are taking a break could imply that they are resting, eating, or engaging in leisure activities. Just because the first scenario is a potential interpretation of the second premise does not mean it is the only or definitive one. In conclusion, while it is possible for the premise \\"A man is standing outside a building while another man in a military uniform leans against a low wall\\" to be true if \\"Two men are taking a break from work,\\" given the information provided, it cannot be conclusively proven to be true. A definitive conclusion would require more context, information, or the explicit connection between both premises."},{"question":"Summarize this article in one sentence.

How the statement is interpreted mostly depends on the context in which it was deployed. If the critic is citing this deceleration of pace as a tool that the filmmakers used to allow a deeper immersion into the character development or intricacies of the plot, then it would denote a positive sentiment. Here, the slowed pace would be perceived as an advantage that enhances the viewing experience by offering the audience the time and space to dwell more deeply into the movie's narrative. In such a case, the critique could be taken as appreciation for the director's courage to defy the more popular fast-paced thrillers or action-packed movies. Perhaps, in this context, the slow pace signified the filmmaker's desire to promote reflection and contemplation, creating a unique rhythm preferred by movie lovers who enjoy thoughtful and nuanced storytelling. Conversely, if the critic found the movie to be boring, sluggish, or lacking momentum due to this reduced tempo, then the sentiment would likely tilt towards negative. In this scenario, the phrase suggests that the movie moved at such a slow pace that it could test the patience of viewers, especially those in middle age who might be accustomed to or prefer livelier narratives. If the slow pace failed to serve an artistic purpose and instead felt dull and dreary, the movie could come across as monotonous or tedious. Furthermore, the statement could also suggest that the critic felt that the themes or storylines of the movie were out of sync or unrelatable to their age or generation, rendering the movie somewhat stagnant or not in alignment with their personal preferences or the societal experiences that resonate with them. Overall, without additional context or information, it's challenging to determine unequivocally whether the critic's impression of the movie was positive or negative based solely on the phrase \\"at a speed that is slow to those of us in middle age.\\" It suggests that the pace of the movie was slow – but whether this was a positive or negative factor largely depends on the critic's personal preferences and the broader context of their review."},{"question":"What are the most important words in the following sentence: the ornament of flowers in heart shape","response":"The most important words in the sentence are: \\"ornament,\\" \\"flowers,\\" and \\"heart shape.\\" These words help us understand that the sentence is about a decoration made of flowers arranged in the shape of a heart."},{"question":"Translate \\"Why is the breeder asking me questions?\\" to German?","response":"To translate the sentence \\"Why is the breeder asking me questions?\\" to German, I will follow these steps: 1.

Green plants obtain their carbohydrate supply from the carbon dioxide in the air by the process of photosynthesis.

Nutrient uptake in the soil is achieved by cation exchange, wherein root hairs pump hydrogen ions (H+) into the soil through proton pumps.

A:","response":"The last step of the process after the turbine spins is usually the generation of electricity. Let's delve a bit deeper into this entire process: 1. Coal Burning: The coal is brought to the power station where it is then crushed into powder as this increases its surface area, and hence its combustion rate. The crushed coal is then burned in a furnace. 2. Production of Steam Under Pressure: When the coal burns, the chemical energy is converted to heat energy. This heat energy is utilized to convert the water into steam inside the boiler. The steam is produced under high pressure. 3. Flow into a Turbine: The pressurized steam is transferred into a turbine. The heat energy in the steam is converted into kinetic energy as it expands and rushes against the blades of the turbine. This results in the movement or rotation of the turbine blades. 4. The Turbine Spins: The turbine's blades are coupled to the shaft of a generator. This means that when the steam turbine’s blades rotate, the generator also rotates. 5. Generation of Electricity: In the final step, when the rotating turbine spins the generator, it induces a flow of electrical charges in the generator’s windings, generating electricity. The generators work using Faraday's principle of electromagnetic induction which states that a changing magnetic field induces an electromotive force in a conductor. This process effectively converts mechanical energy (the spinning of the turbine) into electrical energy. So, the last step is often the electrical output from the generator is delivered to the homes and businesses that require it by distribution systems called power grids. By going through these steps, the original chemical potential energy stored within the coal is delivered to many power users as electrical energy. Of course, it is important to mention that this process also includes some auxiliary steps, such as the cooling of the steam after it has left the turbine to condense the steam back into water so it can be reused in the boiler. It is also crucial to note that not all kinetic energy of the steam can be utilized to produce mechanical energy in the turbine – a majority of it gets lost as waste heat. Modern power stations have measures in place to control or reduce these losses to improve efficiency. Thus, the process of converting coal into electricity is quite complex with multiple stages, but the ultimate goal is to generate electricity safely and as efficiently as possible."},{"question":"Title: IQ's Subterrenea is sheer brilliant !

And the last 20 minute piece The Narrow Margin is a sheer brilliance.Note that there is NOT ONE weak song on Subterrenea, and that for a double cd..If you like bands like Genesis, Marillion, Porcupine Tree, then this CD is a MUST!Give it a listen (or 100) you will LOVE it. ;) Is the review positive or negative?","response":"The review is positive."},{"question":"Translate from Spanish to English: En el baño privado hay secador de pelo y bañera o ducha.

Can you help me answer a few questions? If you can't, please say \\"No I can't\\". Question: Who is bothered that North refused to flee? Movie title: The Killers Movie plot: The Killers is an adaptation of a short story by Ernest Hemingway. The story is divided into three scenes. The first and third scenes were directed by Beiku and Tarkovsky, the second by Gordon. The first scene shows Nick Adams (Yuli Fait) observing two gangsters (Valentin Vinogradov and Boris Novikov) in black coats and black hats entering a small-town diner where Adams is eating. They tell the owner, George (Aleksandr Gordon), that they are searching for the boxer Ole Andreson and that they want to kill him. They tie up Nick Adams and the cook, and wait for Ole Andreson to appear. Three customers enter the restaurant and are sent away by George. One of the customers is played by Tarkovsky, who whistles Lullaby of Birdland. The second scene shows Nick Adams visiting Ole Andreson (Vasiliy Shukshin) in his hide-out, a small room. He warns Andreson about the two gangsters, but Andreson is resigned to his fate and unwilling to flee. The third scene shows Adams returning to the diner and informing the owner of Andreson's decision. A:","response":"The character who is bothered by the fact that Ole Andreson refused to flee is Nick Adams. In the movie \\"The Killers,\\" Nick Adams plays a significant role in the story's development. As a character who exhibits a sense of responsibility and concern for others, he finds himself deeply troubled by the decision Ole makes when faced with the threat of the two gangsters. Let's discuss this further by analyzing the three scenes of the movie. 1. In the first scene, Nick Adams witnesses the gangsters' arrival and intentions as they enter the small-town diner. As they tie him up along with the cook, he becomes aware of the impending danger that awaits Ole Andreson. His concern for Ole's safety is evident from the beginning, as he observes the menacing demeanor and plans of the gangsters, Valentin Vinogradov and Boris Novikov. 2. The second scene reinforces Nick's sense of responsibility and his willingness to help others. Instead of taking a passive role in the situation, he takes the initiative to warn Ole about the possible threat to his life. When he finds Ole in his hide-out, Nick makes a genuine effort to convince him to flee in order to avoid harm. Despite his urgent warning, Ole Andreson remains indifferent and resigned to his fate, which further agitates Nick. 3. In the third and final scene, Nick Adams returns to the diner and feels compelled to share Ole's decision with George, the owner. This scene illustrates Nick's concern not only for Ole but also for the members of his community. By informing George about Ole's choice to stay put, he ensures that everyone is aware of what has transpired and can act accordingly. From this analysis, we can deduce that Nick Adams is the character who is most affected by Ole's refusal to escape the gangsters' threat. Throughout the plot, Nick struggles to understand and accept Ole's passive approach, which remains a source of tension in the story. As a result, Nick's actions and emotions serve as a central element in the narrative, highlighting the complexity of human choices and the consequences that come with them."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Information: - Murgash Glacier (Lednik Murgash 'led-nik mur-'gash)is the 3.4 km long and 3.2 km wide glacier on Greenwich Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica situated southeast of Yakoruda Glacier, south of Teteven Glacier, southwest of Traub Glacier and west-northwest of Bravo Glacier.

This step encompasses various aspects of an elderly person's life, such as physical and mental health deterioration, retirement from careers, increased dependency on others, and engaging in end-of-life planning, ultimately culminating in their death. As people enter old age, their bodily functions begin to decline. They may experience a decrease in energy, weaker muscles, and reduced stamina. Elderly individuals also face a higher risk of chronic illnesses, such as arthritis, heart disease, cancer, and Alzheimer's disease. Consequently, they might require more regular medical checkups, medications, and treatment to manage their health conditions. Furthermore, the aging process affects cognitive abilities, such as memory, decision-making, and problem-solving skills. Some elderly individuals suffer from cognitive decline or dementia, leading to an increased reliance on family members or caregivers. Many older adults choose to live in assisted living facilities or nursing homes to access the necessary support and healthcare services. Another significant aspect of this final step is retirement from work. After dedicating many years to their careers, elderly individuals often face the challenge of finding a sense of purpose and social connections outside their work environment. Retirement offers the opportunity to explore hobbies and interests, volunteer, or simply enjoy leisure activities. However, the loss of income may lead some seniors to encounter financial challenges or adjust their lifestyle to accommodate a limited budget. As elderly individuals approach the end of their lives, they might also engage in end-of-life planning. Some essential aspects include creating a will or living trust, expressing preferences concerning medical care and treatment (e.g., advance directives), and discussing funeral arrangements. These preparations provide guidance for family members and caregivers to ensure that the elderly person's wishes are respected. Eventually, the final stage of life arrives as the elderly individual passes away. They may experience a slow decline and receive palliative or hospice care to manage their pain and maintain their quality of life. Alternatively, they might pass away suddenly due to an illness or accident. In the end, their loved ones gather to mourn and celebrate their memory at a funeral or memorial ceremony. In conclusion, the final step of the process is the culmination of a lifetime of experiences, growth, and relationships, as the elderly individual's life comes to a close. It involves physical and mental health decline, retirement from work, end-of-life planning, and ultimately, death."},{"question":"Q: who is the longest serving football manager ever?

Movie title: The Nameless Context: In Spain, the vanished six-year-old daughter of the editor Claudia (Emma Vilarasau) and her husband Marc is found completely mutilated in a well by the police, being recognized by her husband only due to a bracelet and leg defect (one legbone is shorter than the other). The body contains marks of many needle insertions and burns from sulfuric acid, which appear to have been inflicted while the child was still alive. Five years later, Claudia is still unable to get over the death of her child and she is addicted to tranquiliizers. Inexplicably, the presumed dead daughter Angela calls her mother, saying that she is still alive and needs her help. After visiting a now-deserted clinic where she used to take her daughter (she has footage of it on a home video of herself and Angela), and finding strange pictures of angels there, Claudia calls a recently retired cop, Massera (Karra Elejalde), to investigate the matter. She also gives him a boot she found on the site, believing it to have been left for her to find. Massera's research appears to corroborate the hypothesis that Angela is alive, revealing that a girl with similar characteristics disappeared around the same time and could have been used to fake Angela's death.

Although he revered the music of Bach and Mozart, he remained ambivalent about much 19th-century music. In 1891 he met the composer and pianist Ferruccio Busoni in Leipzig; they were to maintain a correspondence for over thirty years. Shortly after arriving in Paris in early March 1891 Nielsen met the Danish sculptor Anne Marie Brodersen, who was also travelling on a scholarship. They toured Italy together and married in St Mark's English Church, Florence, on 10 May 1891 before returning to Denmark. According to Fanning, their relationship was not only a \\"love match\\", but also a \\"meeting of minds\\"; Anne Marie was a gifted artist and a \\"strong-willed and modern-minded woman, determined to forge her own career\\". This determination would strain the Nielsens' marriage, as Anne Marie would spend months away from home during the 1890s and 1900s, leaving Carl, who was susceptible to opportunities with other ladies, to raise their three young children in addition to composing and fulfilling his duties at the Royal Theatre.Nielsen sublimated his anger and frustration over his marriage in a number of musical works, most notably between 1897 and 1904, a period which he sometimes called his \\"psychological\\" period. Fanning writes, \\"At this time his interest in the driving forces behind human personality crystallized in the opera Saul and David and the Second Symphony (The Four Temperaments) and the cantatas Hymnus amoris and Søvnen\\". Carl suggested divorce in March 1905 and had considered moving to Germany for a fresh start, but despite several extended periods of separation the Nielsens remained married for the remainder of the composer's life.Nielsen had five children, two of them illegitimate.

A court, which is like a big school principal's office for adults, said that police officers have to go and arrest these six people. Arrest is when police take someone to jail because they think that person did something really wrong. So, in this case, these six oil workers are being taken to jail because the court thinks what they did is wrong."},{"question":"I heard that Robin kept a careful eye on the new employee to make sure there was nothing wasted. And I was wondering How would Robin feel afterwards? Possible answers: a). powerful b). an effective manager c). very attentive at work","response":"In order to determine how Robin would feel after keeping a careful eye on the new employee, let us analyze each option and its relevance to the situation. a). Powerful: Powerful refers to having a strong influence or control over others. In this case, Robin was carefully monitoring the new employee to prevent any wastage, which is more about careful supervision rather than exerting control. So, this option may not be the most suitable. b). An effective manager: An effective manager is someone who can make sure that the work is being done efficiently and without unnecessary waste. Since Robin was closely observing the new employee to avoid any wastage, it indicates that Robin wanted things to run smoothly and was focused on efficiency. This option aligns well with the situation, making it a strong possibility. c). Very attentive at work: Being very attentive at work means focusing on the task at hand and ensuring every detail is taken care of. In this case, Robin was indeed paying close attention to the new employee in order to avoid any waste. This option also aligns with the situation and is a possible way Robin may feel. After analyzing all the options, it seems that both option b (an effective manager) and option c (very attentive at work) are suitable descriptions of how Robin might feel after monitoring the new employee. However, option b (an effective manager) provides a more comprehensive understanding of Robin's feelings in this context, as it encompasses both the attention to detail and the focus on overall efficiency. Therefore, we can conclude that Robin would feel like an effective manager after keeping a careful eye on the new employee."},{"question":"Given the sentence \\"A gentleman is rock climbing.\\" is it true that \\"A man is watching tv at home.\\"?

Glucose, galactose, and fructose are the three monosaccharides that are commonly consumed and are readily absorbed. Your digestive system is also able to break down the disaccharide sucrose (regular table sugar: glucose + fructose), lactose (milk sugar: glucose + galactose), and maltose (grain sugar: glucose + glucose), and the polysaccharides glycogen and starch (chains of monosaccharides). Your bodies do not produce enzymes that can break down most fibrous polysaccharides, such as cellulose. While indigestible polysaccharides do not provide any nutritional value, they do provide dietary fiber, which helps propel food through the alimentary canal. The chemical digestion of starches begins in the mouth and has been reviewed above. In the small intestine, pancreatic amylase does the ‘heavy lifting’ for starch and carbohydrate digestion (Figure 23.29). After amylases break down starch into smaller fragments, the brush border enzyme α-dextrinase starts working on αdextrin, breaking off one glucose unit at a time. Three brush border enzymes hydrolyze sucrose, lactose, and maltose into monosaccharides. Sucrase splits sucrose into one molecule of fructose and one molecule of glucose; maltase breaks down maltose and maltotriose into two and three glucose molecules, respectively; and lactase breaks down lactose into one molecule of glucose and one molecule of galactose. Insufficient lactase can lead to lactose intolerance. Q: Making ups about 50 percent of the modern american diet, what food group can be classified according to the number of monomers they contain of simple sugars and/or complex sugars?

About five or six hundred years before Christ, almost the whole of the interior of Asia was united in one vast empire. The founder of this empire was Cyrus the Great. He was originally a Persian; and the whole empire is often called the Persian monarchy, taking its name from its founder's native land. Cyrus was not contented with having annexed to his dominion all the civilized states of Asia. In the latter part of his life, he conceived the idea that there might possibly be some additional glory and power to be acquired in subduing certain half-savage regions in the north, beyond the Araxes. He accordingly raised an army, and set off on an expedition for this purpose, against a country which was governed by a barbarian queen named Tomyris. He met with a variety of adventures on this expedition, all of which are fully detailed in our history of Cyrus.

Petrochemical refineries and manufacturing plants were constructed along the ship channel because of the demand for petroleum and synthetic rubber products by the defense industry during the war. Ellington Field, initially built during World War I, was revitalized as an advanced training center for bombardiers and navigators. The Brown Shipbuilding Company was founded in 1942 to build ships for the U.S. Navy during World War II. Due to the boom in defense jobs, thousands of new workers migrated to the city, both blacks and whites competing for the higher-paying jobs. President Roosevelt had established a policy of non-discrimination for defense contractors, and blacks gained some opportunities, especially in shipbuilding, although not without resistance from whites and increasing social tensions that erupted into occasional violence. Economic gains of blacks who entered defense industries continued in the postwar years. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): Petrochemical refineries and manufacturing plants were built due to the demand for what items during the war?","response":"During World War II, petrochemical refineries and manufacturing plants were built due to the high demand for petroleum and synthetic rubber products by the defense industry. These items played a vital role in supporting the war effort, as petroleum was crucial for fueling military vehicles, aircraft, and ships, while synthetic rubber was used in the production of various essential military items such as tires, hoses, seals, and other equipment. The increased demand for these products spurred the growth of the petrochemical industry in the areas around ports and facilitated the construction of refineries and manufacturing plants, which in turn contributed to job growth and economic development in those regions."},{"question":"I can use this background: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. Now, I have a new situation: Bobby and Kenny are two prolific farmers from Arkansas who have ponds located down stream from their farm sites. Bobby recently received a large order of potatoes from a neighboring city. Because of this order, Bobby has dramatically increased the amount of fertilizer he is using on his farm. Kenny mainly grows tomatoes, which are not in season right now, so his use of fertilizer is currently low.

With the large amount of rain falling on both farms, the rain dissolves the fertilizer in the soil and runoff carries it away, potentially ending up in the nearby ponds.

Should I validate this answer? Answer:","response":"Based on the information provided, the suggested answer does not accurately address the specific question about the depth of the Atlantic Ocean. Instead, it offers a general statement about the Atlantic Ocean being the second-largest of the world's oceanic divisions. To provide a more accurate and detailed response, it is important to address the actual depth of the Atlantic Ocean. The depth of the Atlantic Ocean varies greatly from one place to another, with its shallowest and deepest parts located at different points. On average, the Atlantic Ocean has a depth of about 3,339 meters (10,955 feet). However, its deepest point can be found in the Puerto Rico Trench, which plunges down to approximately 8,648 meters (28,373 feet) below the sea level. This subduction zone lies in the boundary between the North American Plate and the Caribbean Plate. It is crucial to note that ocean depths are dynamic and complex, and can be influenced by various geographical factors and submarine geological formations such as underwater mountains, trenches, and rift valleys. The Atlantic Ocean, being the second-largest ocean in the world, covers an area of approximately 106,460,000 square kilometers (41,100,000 square miles), allowing for a diverse range of depths and underwater topographies. To appropriately validate the given answer, you should consider revising the response to include information about the Atlantic Ocean's average depth, its deepest point in the Puerto Rico Trench, and the dynamic nature of ocean depths influenced by geological factors.

Before we can send a human researcher down in the submarine, we have to be sure it can tolerate the pressure of the water without cracking.

Step 2: Compare the depths We are given two depths to consider: 500 feet and 1500 feet. We need to determine which depth will be the tougher test for our submarine. Step 3: Determine the greater pressure Since pressure increases with depth, the pressure at 1500 feet will be greater than the pressure at 500 feet. This means the submarine will experience more pressure at 1500 feet than at 500 feet. Step 4: Choose the tougher test As our goal is to ensure the submarine can tolerate the pressure of the water without cracking, the tougher test would be to send the submarine down to the greater depth, which in this case is 1500 feet."},{"question":"Answer the question...when was the first cctv camera used in the uk??","response":"The first recorded instance of CCTV camera usage in the UK can be traced back to 1960, when it was employed in the London suburb of Croydon. Metropolitan Police installed a network of CCTV cameras in this area for monitoring public safety and crime prevention. Apart from monitoring public places, the cameras also played an integral role during the notorious Great Train Robbery investigation in 1963. However, the origins of video surveillance started a bit earlier, in 1942, when German engineer Walter Bruch designed the first-ever closed-circuit television to monitor V-2 rockets' launch in Peenemunde, Germany. While this was the birth of the CCTV technology, the purpose was quite different from its later application in the UK. Over the years, the UK would go on to become one of the world's most surveilled nations, with the number of cameras expanding exponentially. The widespread adoption of this technology across the country was further spurred by IRA attacks during the 1980s and 1990s. Consequently, local authorities would set up extensive surveillance networks in their respective jurisdictions. By the turn of the millennium, CCTV cameras had spread to numerous UK cities. The technology also served as a vital tool for maintaining law and order, eventually earning the moniker of a \\"security blanket\\" for the general populace. A report published by the British Security Industry Authority (BSIA) in 2013 estimated that around 4 to 5.9 million CCTV cameras were in use across the UK. From monitoring busy shopping centers to keeping an eye on traffic conditions, the practical applications of CCTV cameras in the nation continue to grow. To summarize, the first usage of CCTV cameras in the UK dates back to 1960 in Croydon. Initially intended for enhancing public safety and crime prevention, these cameras have since proliferated to cover a wide array of functions in the UK, making it one of the most surveilled countries in the world."},{"question":"If a person rushes to respond or share their own opinions, they stand in the way of empathy. Hold mock conversations in which one person talks while the other person hears them out completely. Encourage the listener to turn to face the speaker and make eye contact. The listener should be trying their best to understand what the other person is saying, not simply listening to reply. Those learning empathy need feedback to determine if they understand others' messages during communication. Saying what the person said back to them in a different way helps them double-check that they got the right message. Paraphrasing may sound like, “From what I'm hearing, you seem very shocked and upset about the results of your doctor's exam. Is that right?” If the message was not received correctly, the speaker can try to relay it again so that the listener understands. Paraphrasing can also be taught in practice situations to help them feel confident doing it in real-life conversations. Identifying what someone is feeling can be challenging in the moment. To build the skill, start at the end: with the emotion you think the person felt. Then, reflect back and analyze other details, like facial expressions, body language, tone of voice, and the actual words that were said. For instance, if a wife guessed that her husband was angry, she might work backwards and recall that his arms were crossed, he was pacing, he had a sneer on his face, and his speech was overly sarcastic. Noting these details can help her read future nonverbal and verbal cues more easily. Help adults learn empathy by breaking down different scenarios and reflecting on the experiences of the people involved. This may work best by using scenes from popular movies or TV shows. For instance, a scene from a movie may portray two friends fighting. Have two people role-play the scene and discuss what each character may have been thinking and feeling, and what cues help you figure that out. Have everyone start by spending 5 or 10 minutes breathing deeply and generating good vibes about themselves. This might include silently repeating affirmations, like “I am worthy,\\" or simply envisioning giving oneself a warm hug. In subsequent meditation sessions, they can start focusing on a friend or family member. Radiate positive thoughts towards that one person for the full exercise—just for about 10 minutes. After focusing on loved ones for a few sessions, they can then progress to radiating good vibes to a virtual stranger, such as the nice barista at Starbucks or someone they heard about on the news. Loving-kindness helps connect with the deeper human side of oneself and others, increasing a person's ability to feel empathy. Summary:","response":"1. Conduct mock conversations in which a listener focuses on understanding the speaker rather than responding. This includes making eye contact and facing the speaker. 2. Teach paraphrasing to ensure the listener understands the message correctly, allowing them to double-check their understanding. 3. Practice identifying emotions by analyzing facial expressions, body language, tone of voice, and words spoken along with the emotions they represent. 4. Use role-playing scenarios, like scenes from movies or TV shows, to help adults analyze the emotional experiences of characters and learn empathy. 5. Encourage practicing loving-kindness meditation, starting with oneself, then focusing on friends, family, and eventually strangers, to help connect with the deeper human side of individuals and improve empathy skills."},{"question":"UnsureaboutwhichtypeofURLfileyouhave?Doyouwanttoknowexactlywhatitis,whocreatedit,andhowtoopenit?

V interrupts the broadcast to claim responsibility, encouraging the people of Britain to rise up against their government and meet him on next year's November 5 outside the Houses of Parliament. During the broadcast, the police attempt to capture V. Evey helps him escape, but is knocked unconscious. V takes Evey to his home, where she is told she must remain for one year. V then kills Lewis Prothero (Roger Allam), Norsefire's chief propagandist, and Anthony Lilliman (John Standing), the Bishop of London. Evey offers to help, and uses the opportunity to escape to the home of her boss, comedian and talk show host Gordon Deitrich (Stephen Fry). In return for Evey trusting him with her safety, Gordon reveals prohibited materials including subversive paintings, an antique Quran, and homoerotic photographs. After Gordon performs a satire of the government on his show, his home is raided and Evey is captured.

It was formed on 1 January 1923 under the Railways Act of 1921, which required the grouping of over 120 separate railways into four. The companies merged into the LMS included the London and North Western Railway, Midland Railway, the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (which had previously merged with the London and North Western Railway on 1 January 1922), several Scottish railway companies (including the Caledonian Railway), and numerous other, smaller ventures. - Edinburgh is the capital city of Scotland and one of its 32 local government council areas. Located in Lothian on the Firth of Forth's southern shore, it is Scotland's second most populous city and the seventh most populous in the United Kingdom. The 2014 official population estimates are 464,990 for the city of Edinburgh, 492,680 for the local authority area, and 1,339,380 for the city region as of 2014 (Edinburgh lies at the heart of the proposed Edinburgh and South East Scotland city region). Recognised as the capital of Scotland since at least the 15th century, Edinburgh is home to the Scottish Parliament and the seat of the monarchy in Scotland. The city is also the annual venue of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland and home to national institutions such as the National Museum of Scotland, the National Library of Scotland and the Scottish National Gallery. It is the largest financial centre in the UK after London. - On a steam locomotive, a trailing wheel or trailing axle is generally an unpowered wheel or axle (wheelset) located behind the driving wheels. The axle of the trailing wheels is usually located in a trailing truck. On some large locomotives, a booster engine was mounted on the trailing truck to provide extra tractive effort when starting a heavy train and at low speeds on gradients. - The Caledonian Railway (CR) was a major Scottish railway company. It was formed in the early 19th century with the objective of forming a link between English railways and Glasgow. It progressively extended its network soon reaching Edinburgh and Aberdeen, with a dense network of branch lines in the area surrounding Glasgow. It was absorbed into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in 1923. Many of its principal routes continue active at the present day, and the original main line between Carlisle and Glasgow is in use as part of the West Coast Main Line railway (with a modified entry into Glasgow itself). - The Caledonian Railway 300 Class were freight 0 - 6 - 0 tender engines introduced in 1918 and designed by William Pickersgill . Forty - three were built between 1918 and 1920 . They were numbered 294 -- 324 , 280 , 281 , 670 -- 679 by the Caledonian Railway . - A tank locomotive or tank engine is a steam locomotive that carries its water in one or more on-board water tanks, instead of a more traditional tender. A tank engine may also have a bunker (or oil tank) to hold fuel. There are several different types of tank locomotive, distinguished by the position and style of the water tanks and fuel bunkers. The most common type has tanks mounted either side of the boiler. This type originated about 1840 and quickly became popular for industrial tasks, and later for shunting and shorter distance main line duties. Tank locomotives have advantages and disadvantages compared to traditional tender locomotives. - Glasgow is the largest city in Scotland, and third largest in the United Kingdom. Historically part of Lanarkshire, it is now one of the 32 council areas of Scotland. It is situated on the River Clyde in the country's West Central Lowlands. Inhabitants of the city are referred to as Glaswegians. - On a steam locomotive, a driving wheel is a powered wheel which is driven by the locomotive's pistons (or turbine, in the case of a steam turbine locomotive). On a conventional, non-articulated locomotive, the driving wheels are all coupled together with side rods (also known as coupling rods); normally one pair is directly driven by the main rod (or connecting rod) which is connected to the end of the piston rod; power is transmitted to the others through the side rods. - In rail transport, a wheel arrangement or wheel configuration is a system of classifying the way in which wheels are distributed under a locomotive. Several notations exist to describe the wheel assemblies of a locomotive by type, position, and connections, with the adopted notations varying by country. Within a given country, different notations may also be employed for different kinds of locomotives, such as steam, electric, and diesel powered. - Aberdeen is Scotland's third most populous city, one of Scotland's 32 local government council areas and the United Kingdom's 37th most populous built-up area, with an official population estimate of 196,670 for the city of Aberdeen itself and 228,990 for the local authority area. Aberdeen is the Oil Capital of the World. - The West Coast Main Line (WCML) is the most important intercity rail passenger route in the United Kingdom, connecting the major cities of London, Birmingham, Coventry, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Liverpool and Manchester. which have a combined metropolitan population of over 24 million people. In addition, several sections of the WCML form part of the suburban railway systems in London, Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow, with many more smaller commuter stations, as well as providing links to more rural towns. In 2008 the WCML handled 75 million passenger journeys. - A steam locomotive is a railway locomotive that produces its pulling power through a steam engine. These locomotives are fueled by burning combustible materialusually coal/coke, wood, or oilto produce steam in a boiler. The steam moves reciprocating pistons which are mechanically connected to the locomotive's main wheels (drivers). Both fuel and water supplies are carried with the locomotive, either on the locomotive itself or in wagons (tenders) pulled behind. The first steam locomotive, made by Richard Trevithick, first operated on 21 February 1804, three years after the road locomotive he made in 1801. The first practical steam locomotive was built in 1812-13 by John Blenkinsop. - Chief mechanical engineer and locomotive superintendent are titles applied by British, Australian, and New Zealand railway companies to the person ultimately responsible to the board of the company for the building and maintaining of the locomotives and rolling stock. In Britain, the post of \\"locomotive superintendent\\" was introduced in the late 1830s, and \\"chief mechanical engineer\\" in 1886. - The Whyte notation for classifying steam locomotives by wheel arrangement was devised by Frederick Methvan Whyte, and came into use in the early twentieth century following a December 1900 editorial in \\"American Engineer and Railroad Journal\\". The notation counts the number of leading wheels, then the number of driving wheels, and finally the number of trailing wheels, groups of numbers being separated by dashes. Other classification schemes, like UIC classification and the French, Turkish and Swiss systems for steam locomotives, count axles rather than wheels. - William Pickersgill (1861 2 May 1928) was chief mechanical engineer of the Caledonian Railway from 1914 until Grouping in 1923. He was appointed locomotive superintendent of the Northern Division of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway but retired in 1925. He died in Bournemouth. - Under the Whyte notation for the classification of steam locomotives, represents the wheel arrangement of no leading wheels, six powered and coupled driving wheels on three axles and no trailing wheels. This was the most common wheel arrangement used on both tender and tank locomotives in versions with both inside and outside cylinders. - Bournemouth is a large coastal resort town on the south coast of England directly to the east of the Jurassic Coast, a World Heritage Site. According to the 2011 census, the town has a population of 183,491 making it the largest settlement in Dorset. With Poole to the west and Christchurch in the east, Bournemouth forms the South East Dorset conurbation, which has a total population of over 465,000.

John Lewis (center), participate in a \\"sit-in\\" to demand a vote for gun control measures. | Photo by Rep. Chillie Pingree via AP Democrats stage sit-in on House floor to force gun vote 'We have been too quiet for too long,' said Rep. John Lewis, the civil rights icon. Dozens of House Democrats staged a sit-in on the House floor Wednesday in protest of the GOP leadership’s refusal to allow a vote on a gun control measure following the Orlando massacre. Led by Reps. John Lewis (D-Ga.), the civil rights icon, and John Larson (D-Conn.), more than 40 Democrats walked into the chamber just before noon and pledged to “occupy” the House floor until GOP leadership allowed a vote. In one hour, their numbers more than tripled — even as Republicans recessed the House, turning off C-SPAN cameras and the video feed to the public. Story Continued Below Democrats countered the TV camera blackout by streaming everything on their cellphones, which ended up on C-SPAN anyway. Democrats have tried numerous times over the past week to force a vote on a “no fly, no buy” bill, which would bar terror suspects on the “no-fly” list from purchasing guns. The sit-in represented a sharp escalation in the fight, however, putting political pressure on Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) to allow a roll-call vote on the policy issue that’s gotten the most traction following the Florida shooting. But by early afternoon, there were no signs that Republicans would acquiesce to the Democrats’ demands for a vote. Republicans believe that if they give in now, it would encourage more such actions by Democrats, and one GOP leadership aide called the move a “Democrat publicity stunt.” But Democrats claim they will stay on the floor as long as it takes. They want Ryan to cancel the mid-July recess to take up their proposal. “We have been too quiet for too long,” Lewis said. “There comes a time when you have to say something. You have to make a little noise. You have to move your feet. This is the time. “How many more mothers? How many more fathers need to shed tears of grief before we do something?” Lewis continued, his voice rising in intensity. “Give us a vote. Let us vote. We came here to do our job. We came here to work.” A short while later, Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) said the House “is drenched in blood and the only way we can cleanse it is if the speaker of the House allows us to vote on this legislation. “Every day that we don’t commit to a vote, the blood is on the leadership of this House,” Nadler said. But Rep. Mark Walker, a North Carolina Republican, slammed the sit-in, tweeting that “calling this a sit-in is a disgrace to Woolworth’s. They sat in for rights. Dems are “sitting in” to “strip them away.” View Bobby Rush on the shooting death of his son Rep.

Thank you John Lewis for leading on gun violence where we need it most. https://t.co/vctfqAH5Wt — President Obama (@POTUS) June 22, 2016 The protest seemed to catch Republicans off guard. As another House Democrat prepared to speak after Lewis, the GOP lawmaker presiding over the chamber suddenly declared the House was in recess and shut off microphones. The cameras followed since, technically, the House was not in session. Democrats, including Reps. Joe Crowley of New York, Donna Edwards of Maryland and Alcee Hastings of Florida, meanwhile, sat down on the floor or stood by the front podium. They began reading the names of those who died in the June 12 shooting at a Florida nightclub that left 49 dead and 53 wounded. “No bill, no break,” they chanted, repeating recent demands that House GOP leaders cancel the upcoming House recess until they vote on gun control. Members took turns speaking, backed up by chants and applause. “We’ve had it. We’re not going to watch any more people in this country get slaughtered and do nothing!” Rep. Mike Doyle (D-Pa.) yelled during the protest. “Break the shackles!” Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas) said at another point. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) taunted Republicans, saying they “don’t have the guts to stand up to the gun lobby.” Lawmakers tweeted their protest, posting pictures online, and Rep. Scott Peters (D-Calif.) started streaming the sit-in live on the Periscope app. As the number of Democrats on the floor grew, staffers brought in cases of bottled water, Coca-Cola and Diet Coke to the Democratic cloakroom. One Democratic member said the protest could stretch through the evening and possibly into Thursday. s lost, those families destroyed, those communities that have been broken because of our refusal to speak up, stand up and support just laws that will ensure safety and security,” Clyburn said. Just Tuesday, when Clyburn unsuccessfully tried to force a vote on the same issue during a House vote, Republicans rejected his attempts. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who led the 15-hour filibuster in the Senate last week, showed up to encourage Democrats. His filibuster had forced Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to hold a series of votes on gun measures, though none cleared that chamber. The Democrats cheered him, vowing to sit in the chamber until they forced a vote in their own chamber, too. “I hope they stay in there for as long as it takes, through the day, through the night, until they get a vote,” Murphy said. Republicans showed no signs of bowing to Democrats’ demand. “The House cannot operate without members following the rules of the institution, so the House has recessed subject to the call of the chair,” AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), said in a statement. Some Democrats carried their protest outside, gathering on the Capitol steps to double down on their demands. With the sun blazing, party leaders took turns speaking as rank-and-file Democrats and gun violence protesters stood behind them, some wearing “We are Orlando” shirts and others holding up pictures of gun violence victims. ||||| Tweet with a location You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

Learn more ||||| Washington (CNN) Senators couldn't muster enough bipartisan support to pass a series of gun control measures Monday, the latest in a long string of failed attempts at enacting tighter curbs on firearms in the United States. Spurred by the worst mass shooting in U.S. history, senators from each party introduced the measures they said would have strengthened background checks and prevented suspected terrorists from obtaining weapons. But tough election year politics, paired with disputes over the effectiveness of each party's ideas, proved too powerful to break the longstanding partisan gridlock that's surrounded gun issues for years. The result was expected. A fifth option, set to be introduced and voted upon as early as Tuesday by moderate Republican Sen. Susan Collins, has generated more optimism, but still faces long odds at passage. Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat who sponsored one of the failed measures expanding background checks, reacted angrily after his provision was defeated. \\"I'm mortified by today's vote but I'm not surprised by it,\\" Murphy said Monday evening. \\"The NRA has a vice-like grip on this place.\\" Citing a fresh CNN/ORC survey showing vast majorities of Americans from all parties backing restrictions that would prevent individuals on terror watch lists from buying guns, Murphy predicted widespread voter anger in November's congressional contests. \\"I don't think democracy allows for this Congress to be do out of step with the American public for long,\\" he said. Just before the votes, Murphy had told reporters for The Washington Post : \\"We've got to make this clear, constant case that Republicans have decided to sell weapons to ISIS.\\" Outspoken liberal Sen. Elizabeth Warren echoed his sentiment after the votes. \\".@ChrisMurphyCT said it right: The @SenateGOP have decided to sell weapons to ISIS,\\" she tweeted. .@ChrisMurphyCT said it right: The @SenateGOP have decided to sell weapons to ISIS. — Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) June 20, 2016 How they voted The measures Monday each went down in succession on largely party line votes. The 60-vote threshold required for passage prevented even Republicans, who control the chamber, from pushing through their favored measures. The Senate rejected first a Republican proposal to update the background check system for gun purchases, which would have required states to add more information on mental health records to a national database. It also included a provision to alert law enforcement agencies when an individual who was on a government terror watch list in the last five years buys a gun. The proposal, sponsored by Iowa GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley, failed to get the 60 votes for passage. The vote was 53-47, largely along party lines. Some Senate Democrats warned that the legislation's revised definition of who would be considered mentally ill could potentially still allow those with significant psychological issues to legally purchase guns. A second proposal to expand the background check system for those buying guns to require checks at gun shows and for online purchases went down 44-56. Murphy, the Democrat who launched a nearly 15-hour filibuster last week to press for new gun restrictions after the Orlando massacre where 49 people were killed, sponsored the proposal. A Republican proposal to delay gun sales to individuals included on a government terror watch list failed in a mostly party-line vote of 53-47. The measure was sponsored by Texas GOP Sen. John Cornyn. The bill would allow a judge to permanently block a purchase if the court determined probable cause that the individual is involved in terrorist activity. And a Democratic option that sought to bar all gun sales to those individuals on the terror watch list failed 47-53, the second time the proposal went down to defeat after a mass shooting. California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein originally pushed the proposal in December after a shooting in San Bernardino, and revived it after the horrific Orlando nightclub shooting by a gunman who pledged allegiance to the terror group ISIS. Feinstein's plan did garner the support of some Republicans, including Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire who is facing a fierce re-election bid this year. Sen. Mark Kirk, another vulnerable Republican up for re-election, voted with Democrats on all of the four amendments. On the flip side, Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, a moderate Democrat, voted with Republicans to oppose the two amendments offered by Murphy and Feinstein. Both sides rally support Ahead of the votes, both gun advocates and proponents of tighter restrictions sought to galvanize supporters. \\"They're blaming you, the (National Rifle Association) for the terrorist attack in Orlando and taking advantage of this tragedy to push their gun control agenda while emotions run high,\\" the NRA wrote to members Monday. The group holds powerful sway among Republicans and moderate Democrats. Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid, meanwhile, blasted Republicans for withholding support for his party's plans, saying on the Senate floor that \\"Senate Republicans should be embarrassed -- but they are not, because the NRA is happy.\\" Majority Leader Mitch McConnell touted the GOP proposals as more directly targeted toward the Orlando shooting, and argued the Democratic proposals would not provide due process for individuals barred from purchasing guns. Expectations Before the first votes were cast, eyes were already turning to an effort by Collins to craft another gun control, one week after the Orlando terror attack. The Maine lawmaker was expected to unveil her proposal on Tuesday. \\"Theres tremendous interest on both sides of the aisle, I hope that will be having a press conference tomorrow,\\" Collins said on Monday. \\"We'll see where we are.\\" The Collins measure would bar people on the government's no-fly list -- a significantly smaller group than the terror watch list -- from purchasing guns and also set in place some protections for anyone wrongly placed on the no-fly list. The vast majority of Americans favor preventing those on terror watch lists from buying guns -- including 90% of Republicans, according to a CNN/ORC poll released on Monday . That's a higher figure than either Democrats (85%) and Independents (83%) who say they support such a rule. Cornyn said Monday that McConnell is open to Collins getting a vote on her gun control proposal. \\"I congratulate her for her good work. I just think these are the first votes were going to have, but that doesn't preclude other votes. Sen. McConnell said if she wants a vote, I'm sure she could get one,\\" Cornyn -- who introduced one of the four measures up for a vote Monday -- said before voting began. Collins' proposal, however, has not garnered much support on the Democratic side, though she said Monday she had spoken to \\"dozens\\" of senators over the weekend. House vote Even if her gun control legislation does make its way out of the Senate, it's unlikely to get a vote in the House, where House Speaker Paul Ryan threw cold water on the idea during his weekly press conference last Thursday. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar told CNN's Jim Sciutto that while there remains fierce resistance in the House -- where Republicans outnumber Democrats 247-188 -- the push for action in the wake of the Orlando terror attack reflects new momentum in the gun control debate. \\"I don't know that it's going to be different than when we had votes in the past, but there is one thing that is different. People are starting to talk. There are starting to be negotiations going on. I think that's very important,\\" Klobuchar said. ||||| Focused crawls are collections of frequently-updated webcrawl data from narrow (as opposed to broad or wide) web crawls, often focused on a single domain or subdomain. ||||| This collaborative project is an extension of the 2016 End of Term project, intended to document the federal government's web presence by archiving government websites and data.

John Lewis (D-GA) says in the video above. For approximately 20 minutes after the sit-in began Wednesday morning, both Democrats and C-Span accused Republicans of turning off the cameras, preventing the sit-in from being broadcast. (At press time, the cameras seemed to be turned back on, after pressure from Twitter users including C-Span and Rep. John Yarmuth (D-KY), who was documenting the sit-in from his account.) Advertisement Advertisement “The soul of this nation cries out for a vote,” said Rep. John B. Larson (D-CT). “We ask our colleagues to provide us with the simple dignity that every American is calling for... a vote.” After Lewis, a former Civil Rights leader who is leading the charge, spoke for a bit longer, Larson doubled down, saying “Rise up, America, rise up, Democrats, this cannot stand!” By noon, after the House chaplain led representatives in prayer, the Democrats commenced their sit-in and the House went back to recess. As of press time, the sit-in was growing. Advertisement Democrats have been pushing Republicans to consider a gun control vote, last week executing an eight-hour-long filibuster. Thus far Republicans, some of whom are definitely NRA-influenced, have resisted. On Monday, the Senate blocked a total of four gun control proposals.

Advertisement Update, 1 PM: The Huffington Post reports that this sit-in has been in planning for days, and suggests that more actions will occur. Additionally, it says that Senate Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi planned the “No Bill, No Break” tagline, which has been chanted by representatives in the House Chambers and has subsequently become a useful Twitter hashtag, along with Reps. Steve Israel (D-NY) and Mike Thompson (D-CA): At a caucus meeting on Wednesday morning, Pelosi told members that a “great deal of planning is in the works” for the next few days and encouraged them to remain united in trying to force a vote. According to an aide who was present, she said she empathized with the desire of many lawmakers to show their constituents that they were not content with inaction. “Many of you have said that we cannot have another moment of silence without action to follow. These moments of silence have almost become a moment of denial because it’s a denial of what we need to do,” Pelosi told members. “We have to turn it into a moment of truth and actions — where we go from here.” In addition to the Lewis-led sit-in, aides said to expect lawmakers to file repeated motions to adjourn and parliamentary inquiries demanding votes. Pelosi will also lead a press event on Wednesday calling on Ryan to keep the House in session until they vote on the two gun-related bills.

When Ryan tried to retake the floor late Wednesday night, Democrats shouted him down in a display unlike anything Washington insiders have ever seen. The sit-in, as Democrats are calling it, is the latest of a series of moves this week to pressure Republicans into taking a vote on a gun violence measure that would prevent anyone on a terrorist watch list from buying a gun. CSPAN cameras were turned off earlier in the day when the House went into recess, but coverage of the House floor is live on Periscope and CSPAN is carrying it live here. \\"The time for silence and patience is long gone,\\" Rep.

He is studying the periodic table when he decides to compare two random elements within the same column. He chooses Mardine and Sampline to compare and contrast and gets to work. The first thing he notices is that Sampline is further down the periodic table than Mardine. It's not much information to go on, but it's a good starting point for Timmy. and a hint : The general trend in electronegativity is that the value increases from left to right across a row in the periodic table and decreases down a column. The most electronegative element is fluorine, which has a value of 4.0. As discussed in the lesson \\"Trends in the Periodic Table,\\" electronegativity increases across a row as the number of protons in the nucleus increases and therefore has a stronger pull. Electronegativity decreases down a column due to an increased effect of electron shielding in larger atoms. Please answer this question : Is electron shielding higher or lower in Sampline? The answer to this question is:","response":"Electron shielding is higher in Sampline. Since Sampline is further down the periodic table than Mardine, it means that Sampline has more electron shells. More electron shells result in a higher degree of electron shielding due to the increased number of electrons between the nucleus and the outer electrons. This increased shielding reduces the effective nuclear charge experienced by the outer electrons, making them less tightly held and resulting in a decrease in electronegativity as you move down a column in the periodic table."},{"question":"Do these mean the same?

Yay!"},{"question":"Here are some concepts: city, look, stop What is a sentence about these concepts?","response":"Sure, here's a comprehensive interpretation using these concepts: city, look, and stop. A city is a large and densely populated urban area that often serves as the cultural, commercial, or political hub of a region or country. Cities often exhibit various unique characteristics in their architecture, culture, and vibe that differentiate them from one another - a charm that attracts both residents and tourists alike. Contemporary cities are characterized by skyscrapers and high-rise buildings, consistent with the modernistic architectural style that starkly contrasts with the Gothic and Baroque styles seen in older cities. They symbolize advancement and progress and represent the amalgamation of diverse cultures, ideas, and innovations. The concept of 'look' usually refers to the act of directing one's gaze towards something or someone, often to visually inspect or admire. In different contexts, 'look' might take on different meanings, but primarily it concerns sensory perceptual experience. It could be an integral part of appreciating cities where looking closely at cityscapes, landmarks, cultural precincts or everyday street life reveals the city's character, its soul. It allows us to perceive the aesthetics and energy of civic existence. For instance, travelers may gaze upon the cityscape of New York from the top of the Empire State Building to absorb the city's majesty and grandeur, perhaps encapsulated in the twinkling lights and the towering skyscrapers that seemingly touch the sky. On the other hand, 'stop' refers to the action of ceasing movement or activity, often for a temporary period. Stop can be physical, like stopping at a red traffic light in a bustling city, signifying a pause in the haste of everyday life. But it can also be a state of emotional or mental cessation, often invoked to denote introspection or reflection. In the context of a city, for example, one may need to 'stop' amidst the city rush, look around, and soak up the vibrant city life. This cease in activity can also help preserve resources or mitigate environmental damage in cities; a concept famously implemented in cities like Paris and Bogota through the implementation of Car-Free days, where citizens are encouraged to stop using their cars for a day to reduce pollution. To summarize, the sentence integrating these three concepts could be: \\"In the heart of the bustling city, amid the humdrum of life and towering skyscrapers, one often finds the need to stop, look around, and admire the marvel of urban existence and its electrifying energy.\\" This sentence encapsulates the essence of these three concepts and their intricate interaction in defining our experiences in a cityscape."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: This task is in Spanish. Based on the given context, generate a question which can be answered by the given context. Generate a question that has more than 7 words. You can paraphrase the given context while forming the question. Suggestion: The question may involve starting question words like WHERE, WHEN, HOW, WHAT (in Spanish). Q: CONTEXT: La temporada comienza con la esperanza de que se produzcan cambios en la jerarquía y además de los pilotos de las escuderías McLaren-Mercedees y Ferrari, otros puedan entrar en la lucha por el título. Quizá el primer aspirante sea el alemán Heinz-Harald Frentzen que dispondrá del Jordan-Mugen Honda, que ya el pasado año estuvo a punto de conseguirlo y en esta ocasión puede dar el salto definitivo al volante de un coche muy fiable y competitivo. Una nueva escudería, Jaguar, que ha heredado toda la infraestructura de Stewart Grand Prix, es la punta de lanza de Ford para conseguir el título en el plazo más corto posible, para ello cuenta con Eddie Irvine y el británico Johnny Herbert, aunque la falta de fiabilidad que ha demostrado en las pruebas invernales, pueden dar esta temporada al traste con sus esperanzas. El español Pedro de la Rosa ha sido el autor de los mejores tiempos en las pruebas previas al inicio del Campeonato del Mundo de Fórmula Uno al volante del nuevo Arrows A21 Supertec, con el que en dos ocasiones pulverizó el récord del circuito de Cataluña. Aunque los tiempos conseguidos han sido cuestionados por otras escuderías, al pensar que el coche podía estar por debajo del peso mínimo autorizado, 605 kg., lo cierto es que de ser cierta esa circunstancia, el coche, a pesar de todo seguiría siendo rapidísimo y podría estar entre los aspirantes a podio. Honda regresa a la Fórmula Uno ocho años después de su retirada y lo hace con la escudería BAR que cuenta con el ex campeón del mundo Jacques Villeneuve y el brasileño Ricardo Zonta. Tienen potencial para estar entre los primeros, pero los inicios serán difíciles, como lo serán también en la escudería Williams, que contará con otra fabricante que vuelve a la Fórmula Uno, BMW, y Prost, que a pesar de tener el motor Peugeot, es incapaz de hacer un coche competitivo. Por último Minardi, con Marc Gené como primer piloto y el debutante argentino Gaston Mazzacane, tiene el problema de ser la única escudería que no cuenta con un motor oficial, y utilizará el Ford de la pasada temporada, rebautizado Fondmetal. Con el chasis han dado un gran paso hacia adelante y la fiabilidad del conjunto puede permitirles en alguna ocasión entrar en los puntos.

The band released three albums and several singles, including \\"For What It's Worth\\". The band combined elements of folk and country music with British invasion and psychedelic-rock influences, and, along with the Byrds, were part of the early development of folk-rock. With a name taken from a brand of steamroller, Buffalo Springfield formed in Los Angeles in 1966 with Stills (guitar, keyboards, vocals), Dewey Martin (drums, vocals), Bruce Palmer (electric bass), Furay (guitar, vocals), and Young (guitar, harmonica, piano, vocals). Chris Hillman of the Byrds persuaded the owners of the Whisky a Go Go to give Buffalo Springfield an audition, and they essentially became the house band at the Whisky for seven weeks, from May 2 to June 18, 1966. This series of concerts solidified the band's reputation for live performances and attracted interest from a number of record labels. It also brought an invitation from Friedman to Dickie Davis (who had been the Byrds' lighting manager) to become involved in the group's management. In turn, Davis sought advice from Sonny & Cher's management team, Charlie Greene and Brian Stone; unbeknownst to Davis and Friedman, Greene and Stone then aggressively pitched themselves to the band to be their new managers. Friedman was fired, and Davis was made the group's tour manager. Greene and Stone made a deal with Ahmet Ertegun of Atlantic Records for a four-album contract with a 12,000 advance, following a brief bidding war with Elektra Records and Warner Bros. Records, and arranged for the band to start recording at Gold Star Studios in Hollywood. The first Buffalo Springfield single, \\"Nowadays Clancy Can't Even Sing\\", was released in August, but made little impact outside Los Angeles, where it reached the Top 25. Young and Stills have long maintained that their own mono mix was superior to the stereo mix engineered by Greene and Stone. The band's eponymous album was released by the Atlantic subsidiary Atco in mono and in stereo in December 1966. A revamped version issued both in mono and stereo with a different track order was issued in March of the following year. In November 1966, Stills composed \\"For What It's Worth\\" in response to a protest that had turned into a riot following the closing of a nightclub called Pandora's Box on Sunset Strip. The song was performed on Thanksgiving night at the Whisky a Go Go, recorded within the next few days, and on the air in Los Angeles on radio station KHJ soon afterwards. By March 1967, it was a Top Ten hit. Atco took advantage of this momentum by replacing the song \\"Baby Don't Scold Me\\" with \\"For What It's Worth\\" and re-releasing the album. \\"For What It's Worth\\" sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc., Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Was the album a success?","response":"Yes, the album was a success. As mentioned in the article, \\"For What It's Worth\\" sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc. This momentum of the single also led to the re-release of the album, further contributing to its success."},{"question":"Is the following statement true? \\"The climate of the White Sea varies from tropical to polar.\\" Chain of thought and solution for this question is:","response":"The statement that \\"The climate of the White Sea varies from tropical to polar\\" is not true. Chain of thought and solution for this question: 1. Determine the geographical location of the White Sea: The White Sea is located in the Northwestern region of Russia. It is positioned between the Kola Peninsula to the north and the mainland of Russia to the south. The White Sea is an inlet of the Barents Sea, which in turn, is part of the Arctic Ocean. 2. Identify the climate types present in that region: The climate surrounding the White Sea exhibits a subarctic climate (Köppen classification: Dfc). This means that the climate in this area is characterized by long, cold winters, and short, mild summers, with the overall weather being significantly cooler and more stable compared to tropical regions. 3. Evaluate if any tropical climates are present in the region: Tropical climates generally occur near the equator, which is thousands of miles away from the White Sea. As the White Sea is located in the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, it does not experience tropical climates. Therefore, the statement that its climate varies from tropical to polar is incorrect. In conclusion, the White Sea's climate does not range from tropical to polar, as the statement suggests. Instead, it has a predominantly subarctic climate with distinct cold winters and short summers."},{"question":"Please answer the following question by reasoning step-by-step.

Article: Leadership is the art of getting someone to do something you want done because he wants to do it. People naturally want to follow a good leader. After meeting with an effective leader it is not unusual to feel uplifted , inspired, and motivated to work towards a common goal. An effective leader makes others feel good about themselves, as well as the work they are doing. The leader has a vision of what he or she wants to achieve, and can communicate that vision to others in a way that makes people want to be part of it. One thing a good leader typically does is to communicate the big picture, so that each employee can see how the particular role he or she plays makes a contribution to the final result. Good leaders are positive and optimistic when they speak about the future. Their enthusiasm wins them plenty of supporters who help make their vision a reality. Good leaders also understand that different people are motivated by different things. For employees motivated by a need for achievement, a leader explains how the task offers an opportunity to take on a challenge with an achievable goal. And employees are motivated by hearing how they will be part of a team of people working together. Good leaders will introduce employees by name first, rather than job titles. They refer to employees as team members, companions, or colleagues, never as \\"servants\\". Words have power, including the power to make people feel whether or not they are important to the success of an organization. Good leaders believe that every team member matters and set up environments that make everyone feel important. It is no wonder they can attract the support they need to help them achieve their goals.

Ischemic preconditioning (IPC) elicits two distinct windows of cardioprotection, an early phase that lasts for 1-2 h and a delayed phase that lasts for 24-72 h. However, there is conflicting data as to how long the heart is resistant to IPC-induced cardioprotection after the initial protection wanes, leading to the demonstration of IPC-resistance. This resistance to IPC appears to be dependent on the timing of the next IPC stimulus, the species of animals used and the model studied. Furthermore, the mechanisms responsible IPC-resistance are unknown. It is also important to demonstrate therapeutic interventions that will produce cardioprotection during this period of IPC-resistance.', 'To examine potential mechanisms responsible for acute IPC-induced resistance, the NHE-1 inhibitor EMD 85131 (2-methyl-5-methylsulfonyl-1-(1-pyrrollyl)-benzoylguanidine), which exerts its effects via mechanisms distinct from IPC, and the K(ATP) channel opener bimakalim, which bypasses the signaling mechanisms of IPC to directly open K(ATP) channels, were examined in a canine model of IPC-resistance. One 10 min. IPC stimulus followed by 10 min. of reperfusion produced a significant reduction in IS/AAR compared to Control (7.1 +/- 2.6% versus 26.0 +/- 6.2%; P < 0.05). However, IPC did not significantly protect the myocardium if a 2 h reperfusion period occurred between the initial IPC stimulus and the subsequent prolonged (60 min) ischemic challenge (IS/AAR: 22.5 +/- 4.8%: P > 0.05). Furthermore, hearts treated with IPC followed by 2 h of reperfusion were resistant to an additional IPC stimulus administered just prior to the subsequent 60 min. occlusion period (IS/AAR: 22.9 +/- 3.2%: P > 0.05). In contrast, administration of the NHE-1 inhibitor EMD 85131 (IS/AAR: 7.4 +/- 2.5%: P < 0.05) or the K(ATP) channel opener bimakalim (IS/AAR: 11.8 +/- 2.4%: P < 0.05) both afforded significant cardioprotection when administered at 2 h of reperfusion in previously preconditioned canine hearts resistant to IPC.","response":"Task: Determine if the passage has a definite objective/aim/goal and output '1' if it does, or output '0' if it doesn't.

Question: Who was illiterate? Context: Muammar Gaddafi was born in a tent near Qasr Abu Hadi, a rural area outside the town of Sirte in the deserts of western Libya. His family came from a small, relatively un-influential tribal group called the Qadhadhfa, who were Arabized Berber in heritage. His father, Mohammad Abdul Salam bin Hamed bin Mohammad, was known as Abu Meniar (died 1985), and his mother was named Aisha (died 1978); Abu Meniar earned a meager subsistence as a goat and camel herder.

Dogen finds a murdered prospector, whose young daughter Dhyana saw him killed by Baal, Jared Syn's half-cyborg son. Baal sprayed the man with a green liquid that caused a nightmare dream-state, in which Syn appeared and executed him with a crystal. Dogen convinces Dhyana to help him find Syn.

But because of the very specific set of circumstances, I remember exactly how Barend and I became friends. This, of course, was long before he became famous for inventing the easy-foldable map, and infamous for the series of bodies he'd decided to bury in his backyard. Barend and I became friends because he had one of the most attractive shadows I'd ever seen. I remember gazing out over the playground, watching a waning sun scatter its dying light over the monkey bars, the metal skeleton contrasting against the turquoise sky, when I noticed this kid coming toward me. He was one of those mostly invisible characters; faded jeans, dirty jacket, snot caked on his upper lip. I probably wouldn't have noticed him if not for his shadow. For some reason, his shadow immediately caught my eye. Now, I'm not one for noticing shadows in general, never really noticed a shadow before or since, but this kid had the most incredible shadow I'd ever seen. I cannot even put in words what that means. What specific set of properties make an ordinary shadow into an incredible one, I'm not sure anyone can, but his shadow was like a piece of art; I didn't necessarily understand it, but I liked it. And that's why this boring looking kid and I first became friends. Our kindergarten games were harmless and boring, but when puberty hit, Barend began to change. We were both expected to change, but I guess some kids just change more than others. Bared didn't want to kill at first. Like many overachievers in the death game, his first brush with the craft came about more or less accidentally.

Electronic calorie counters and food diaries have been around for years, and there is a strong market for these types of applications on mobile phone platforms too. Today, DailyBurn (formerly known as Gyminee) is releasing a new kind of food journal for the iPhone: FoodScanner. As the title suggests, FoodScanner uses the iPhone’s built-in camera to scan barcodes of food items. Using DailyBurn’s database over 200,000 food products, you can scan what you eat (or what you are thinking about eating) and get the nutritional information and your daily calorie count. If the item you are eating doesn’t have a barcode or if it isn’t in DailyBurn’s database, you can search for the product and select it, or add new foods to the database and add photos and UPC codes. I tested the app on some of the items sitting on my desk and I was impressed with the speed an accuracy of how it worked. Even on an aluminum soda can that is both a rounded and reflective surface, the barcode scanning picked up and worked as expected. It’s also nice that you get a running count of all your calories for the day at the bottom of the app, and that the app can also sync with your existing DailyBurn account, with the updates showing up instantaneously. If I had any complaint it would be that while you can log your food charts for past days, you can’t view your counts for those days. The free DailyBurn iPhone app does show this data, but it would be nice if you could track at least a weekly log with FoodScanner (which costs 2.99) too. Do you count calories?

Cohen is seeking 250,000 in damages, alleging that the inadequate accommodations \\"ruined his summer.\\" Body: A legal feud has sparked between Michael Cohen, a top executive within the Trump Organization, and Dr. Ali Guy, an NYU physician, over a rented Hamptons luxury home. Cohen claims he had negotiated a 150,000 agreement with the professor to secure the vacation property during August, in hopes of providing a comfortable retreat for his family. However, Cohen's expectations were shattered when the house failed to deliver several key amenities promised in their agreement. Upon arriving at the residence on August 2, Cohen and his family found the air conditioning units were not functional. Furthermore, he found the beds in the home were allegedly too small for his family's needs. In response to the property's numerous shortcomings, Cohen sued Dr. Guy for a sum of 250,000, alleging the professor had \\"ruined his summer.\\" According to the lawsuit, Cohen claims the property's issues prevented him and his family from enjoying a relaxing vacation, which was the main motivation behind renting the high-end Hamptons home. The property in question, known for its luxurious features and prime location, is valued at approximately 8 million. Situated within the upscale community of the Hamptons, the home attracts affluent renters seeking a lavish summer escape. Despite the home's reputation and immense price tag, Cohen believes it did not provide the comfort and relaxation his family had anticipated. The plaintiff's attorney, Samuel Rosen, revealed that Cohen's party had emphasized the importance of working air conditioning and adequately sized beds to the landlord before finalizing the rental agreement. However, Cohen alleges these concerns were not met, resulting in discomfort and dissatisfaction for his family. This legal dispute highlights the high stakes at play when dealing in luxury real estate rentals. The increasingly competitive vacation rental market is no stranger to conflicts between tenants and landlords. In this case, the disagreement could result in a significant financial loss or tarnished reputation for either party. As the lawsuit progresses, the case will shed light on the potential repercussions from renting luxury properties and might serve as a cautionary tale for both landlords and renters alike. There has not yet been a public statement or response from Dr. Ali Guy regarding the allegations and lawsuit filed by Michael Cohen."},{"question":"This question has options.

Obama's remarks were specifically about the situation in Libya, stating that the \\"shadow of tyranny\\" had been lifted. While Tyranny is commonly referred to as a form of government which involves harsh, absolute power concentrated in a single ruler or group, in this context, Obama was using the term metaphorically to describe the oppressive regime in Libya. By stating \\"the shadow of tyranny over Libya has been lifted,\\" he meant that the oppressive and dictatorial rule that had been prevalent in Libya had ceased. It's also noteworthy that the statement includes comments from another world leader, UK Prime Minister David Cameron. However, Cameron's comments were more about expressing pride in his country's participation in overthrowing the Libyan dictator, which he referred to as a brutal dictator.

The proposals, set out by global financial regulators are designed to avoid the need for taxpayers to bail out the banks in a future crisis. Instead investors will be required to accept a loss on their investments. Leaders of the G20 group of nations will be asked to endorse the reforms. Under the proposals drawn up by the Financial Stability Board (FSB), chaired by UK Bank of England governor Mark Carney, banks will be required to issue \\"buffer bonds\\" by 2019 equivalent to 16% of the risk-weighted assets they hold, rising to 18% in 2022. Such assets can include government debt and cash. In the event of a financial crisis the value of those bonds could be written down and used to raise funds for the bank. As a result investors in those bonds would bear the burden of keeping the bank solvent by taking a \\"haircut\\" or loss on their investments. The reform means investors will be the first to take a financial loss before taxpayers are asked to bail out the bank in question. The \\"buffer bonds\\" are the last major reform to be announced by the FSB since the G20 tasked it with introducing changes to the regulate the banking industry in 2009. The FSB has since increased bank capital requirements and imposed restrictions on bankers' bonuses. Mr Carney said many key reforms have already been implemented. \\"As a consequence, the financing capacity to the real economy is being rebuilt and significant retrenchment from international activity has been avoided,\\" Mr Carney said in a letter to G20 leaders ahead of their summit next week. The FSB believes the reforms will allow a big bank to fail without creating the level of panic in financial markets after Lehman Brothers went under in 2008. The \\"buffer bonds\\", known as Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity or TLAC, are on top of the minimum core capital requirements a bank must already hold. The FSB is also assessing the risks to financial stability from the activities of big asset managers and said it would publish recommendations \\"as necessary in the first half of 2016\\". Summary:","response":"Global financial regulators have proposed reforms to end the \\"too big to fail\\" banks phenomenon, preventing the need for taxpayers to bail out banks in future crises. Under the proposals, banks will be required to issue \\"buffer bonds\\" by 2019, which can be used to raise funds in a crisis. Investors would accept losses on these bonds before taxpayers are asked for help. The G20 group of nations will be asked to endorse the reforms, aiming to allow a big bank to fail without causing panic in financial markets. These \\"buffer bonds\\" are an addition to the minimum core capital requirements banks must already hold."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In this task you will be given a claim and a perspective.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"The answer to why there was so little assimilation of Jews in central and eastern Europe for so long would seem to lie in part in the probability that the alien surroundings in central and eastern Europe were not conducive, though contempt did not prevent some assimilation. Furthermore, Jews lived almost exclusively in shtetls, maintained a strong system of education for males, heeded rabbinic leadership, and scorned the life-style of their neighbors; and all of these tendencies increased with every outbreak of antisemitism.\\"? The answer is:","response":"Based on the given passage, a good question to test students' understanding and reading comprehension could be: How did the various factors contribute to the limited assimilation of Jews in central and eastern Europe? This question requires students to identify and examine the factors mentioned in the passage that explain the limited assimilation of Jews in central and eastern Europe. The answer should address the following factors mentioned in the passage: 1. Alien surroundings: The passage suggests that the unfavorable environment in central and eastern Europe made it difficult for Jews to assimilate. 2. Contempt: Despite some assimilation taking place, contempt from their surroundings had a limiting impact on Jewish assimilation. 3. Living in shtetls: Jews primarily lived in small, isolated communities, which made it difficult for them to assimilate into the larger society. 4. Strong system of education for males: The importance placed on education allowed the Jews to maintain their cultural identity and resist assimilation. 5. Rabbinic leadership: Jewish communities adhered to their religious leaders, which allowed them to preserve their customs and traditions. 6. Scorn for the life-style of their neighbors: Jews were not attracted to the lifestyle of their non-Jewish neighbors, which reduced their motivation to assimilate. 7. Antisemitism: Every outbreak of antisemitism further strengthened the Jews' desire to maintain their distinct identity and resist assimilation. To answer this question effectively, students would need to extract key information from the passage, demonstrate their understanding of the factors mentioned, and explain how these factors contributed to the limited assimilation of Jews in central and eastern Europe."},{"question":"Write the next sentence.

The boys are trained from an early age to be professional, international hitmen-for-hire. Years later, Interpol agent Mike Whittier arrives at his house and discovers Agent 47, where the two talk about 47's life as a professional hitman, working for a mysterious unknown paramilitary group known as The Organization. Three months prior, 47 (Timothy Olyphant) is completing a hit on a gang leader named Bwana Ovie in Niger. He is told by his Organization contact, Diana, to kill his next target, Russian President Mikhail Belicoff publicly. He completes his mission, but before he can leave Russia, he is contacted by his employers. They tell him that there is a witness to the assassination and order him to intercept her. When Agent 47 realizes she has never seen him before, he does not shoot her, instead, he narrowly avoids an assassination attempt on himself, attempted by another unknown Agent. His employers reveal his location to agents of FSB, who make plans to intercept him. As he is about to be taken, Diana calls to warn him and that Belicoff ordered the hit. After an escape from the hotel, 47 intercepts Nika, Belicoff's mistress, the woman who supposedly witnessed his hit. He interrogates her about Belicoff and discovers that Belicoff had a body double, who ordered the hit on the real Belicoff so that he could take his place as the president of Russia. 47 was to be killed after the hit to ensure total secrecy. As Nika and 47 attempt to take a train further into Russia, they are intercepted by more assassins from the Organization. 47 kills three before disarming Agent Whittier and wounding his partner.

The terrain is also quite flat, with the highest point, Suur Munamägi, only reaching an elevation of 318 meters. Estonia's climate is mainly influenced by the Baltic Sea, giving rise to temperate maritime weather. Summers in Estonia are relatively mild, with average temperatures ranging from 16 to 20°C (61 to 68°F), while winters are cold and snowy with temperatures often dropping below 0°C (32°F). Due to its coastal location, Estonia experiences varying weather patterns, with coastal regions experiencing milder temperatures and more rainfall, while the inland regions have harsher winters and warmer summers. In terms of cultural heritage, Estonia is home to a rich tapestry of history, art, and traditions. The Estonian language is part of the Finno-Ugric language family, sharing close ties with Finnish and more distantly with Hungarian. The country has a population of approximately 1.3 million people, with ethnic Estonians making up the majority. Throughout its history, Estonia has been influenced by various neighboring countries and empires, such as the Swedish, Polish, Danish, German, and Russian empires. As a result, Estonia has a wealth of architectural, linguistic, and cultural influences, seen especially in its cities and countryside. Estonia is also known for its innovative spirit and technological advancements, being one of the most digitally advanced countries in the world. Estonia leads the European Union in digital services, electronic voting, e-government, and digital entrepreneurship. Moreover, a stable business environment and a developed startup ecosystem make Estonia an attractive location for foreign investments and talents.

Article: Which boy hasn't dreamed of being a cool secret agent ? The wonderful fighting abilities and the world-saving adventures are much more colourful than most people's everyday lives. Well, Cody Banks is just like any other boy,except that he is not just dreaming. He has a big secret his friends never know about. He was trained to be a spy by a special CIA programme,which was made to look like a summer camp. He learned high-speed driving,hand-to-hand fighting and the use of high-tech tools. After proving he could become a young hero by saving a baby from a runaway car,Banks gets his first real task. He must make friends with a popular girl at school,Natalie Connors. Then,he must spy on her father,a scientist who has developed a dangerous technology .Banks must stop a group of bad people from forcing Natalie's father into using the technology to endanger the world. The CIA may have taught him first-class self-defence moves,but they didn't show him how to talk to girls. Banks has zero ability when it comes to dealing with girls.

Do the same things you always do in your bedtime routine: brush your teeth, read a book, chat with your friends, etc.. Say to yourself: \\"What am I gonna do tomorrow?\\" -- like it's any normal day: \\"Oh, hey, tomorrow maybe I will hang out with my 'bud', ______\\". A technique that, strange as it sounds, works well is to play a quiet game you can play alone (or with another hyper and excited friend or sibling), such as Mad Libs, while in bed. This will help take away your energy and help you fall fast asleep. Santa came a lot quicker than you thought! Although this may seem counterintuitive, exercise can help to calm you down. A couple hours before you go to bed, see how many push-ups, crunches, or jumping jacks you can do in your room. Exercise only for thirty minutes, though; you don't want to stay up too late. Exercising is a great way to help you feel physically tired so that your body will want to sleep. Better still, it will take your mind off Christmas for a little while. Having a warm bath will relax your muscles and make it easier to fall asleep. Squirt bath toys at imaginary targets, submerge yourself in bubbles, and relax your muscles. Try scented bubbles and soap. This might spoil any surprises and will keep you very excited and awake! Remember, Santa Claus knows when you are sleeping and when you are awake. He won't come if you are peeking. In addition to providing you with nutrients like calcium, magnesium, and L-tryptophan, warm milk can be a soothing, comforting drink that lulls you to sleep. You can also try hot herbal tea; it is very soothing and calming to drink. Just make sure it doesn’t contain caffeine! When you're setting up a cookie plate for Santa is a great time to have some warm milk. Or, drink hot chocolate after you are in your pajamas. This will also help you to relax and stay warm! Don't drink coffee. The caffeine in it can keep you awake. If warm milk disgusts you on its own, add some honey. It will make for a relaxing treat. . If you are just jumping up and down and feeling hyperactive, you need to calm down; you're only feeding a buildup of excitement that it'll be hard to come down from. Read a book. Listen to music. Whatever makes you calm down and relax. Read a book. It can be about Christmas, although it doesn't really matter. Try reading a school textbook, a really boring one from your least favorite class. Read a boring book to induce sleepiness; read an exciting one to get lost in and to help take away the urgency of thinking about Christmas things. Some good non-Christmas books are Harry Potter, Twilight, School of Fear, and Diary of a Wimpy Kid. They are fairly long and can keep you occupied for a while. Burn a sweet scented candle for a little while in a safe place in your room. The scent will help you to relax, particularly if you choose a scent like lavender or jasmine. Just make sure to extinguish it before you fall asleep! Summary:","response":"To help you sleep when you're excited, follow your normal bedtime routine, try playing a quiet game like Mad Libs, and exercise a little to tire yourself out. Take a warm bath to relax and drink warm milk or herbal tea to soothe you. Read a book to calm your mind and, if you like, use a sweet-scented candle to help you relax. Just remember, Santa won't come if you're still awake!"},{"question":"I was lucky enough to get three acne skincare packs from Aphelia Cosmetology for guest reviewers with acne to trial for me. I think that this is important because the treatment of acne is such a personalised journey that it is good to hear about the results of the skincare from a variety of people. In the third review of this series, Nalini from The Made Up Maiden has reviewed this acne set for me. Nalini is 30 and has troublesome skin. She has tried many products to fix it without a lot of luck. Here is Nalini's review: I've always thought the journey to clear skin can be quite a complicated one. There are just so many things that affect the condition of your skin; genetics, skincare, diet, hormones, weather, stress...the list is endless. In my case, both parents had acne when they were younger, and I had hopes that my acne would fade once I left my teens. My skin isn't completely horrendous, but I do have some minimal scarring on my cheeks (which goes away after a little while), and the odd large pimple on my chin during those hormonal times, which goes away after a while but is still really frustrating when it happens! I'm 30 years old, so it looks like these problems are here to stay. I have contemplated taking hormonal pills or medication aimed at reducing acne, but decided that the possible side effects haven't really been worth the benefit. As a result, I was really keen to explore the Aphelia Cosmetology range and see if it lives up to the promise of helping with acne troubled skin. I would classify my skin as combination, the t-zone gets a little oily towards midday, while the rest of my skin is pretty much classified as 'normal'. I received the following items. Why did Nalini think that her acne would fade once she left her teens? - Because her parents had acne when they were younger ( and not beyond). - Because of stress. - not enough information - Because of the weather.","response":"- Because her parents had acne when they were younger, and she hoped that her acne would follow the same pattern and disappear after her teenage years."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you're given reviews from Amazon's food products and a summary of that review.

Questions: The blood was everywhere in the operating room, what were the surgeons operating on? Options: - soccer game - musle - vein - animals - person","response":"The most sensible option in the context of the given question is that the surgeons were operating on a person. An operating room typically refers to a medical facility where surgical procedures are performed on individuals suffering from various medical conditions or requiring surgical interventions for their well-being. In this specific scenario, the presence of blood also signifies that the procedure being performed was an invasive one involving the human body. To elaborate further, the alternative options provided can be evaluated as follows: - Soccer game: This choice does not align with the context of the question, as soccer games involve athletic competition and sportsmanship rather than medical procedures. An operating room is not an appropriate venue for a soccer game, and it would not explain the presence of blood. - Muscle: While operating on a muscle could definitely be a part of a surgical procedure performed on a person, the option is not as comprehensive and all-encompassing when compared to the choice of \\"person.\\" A muscle in isolation does not signify the complete context, which would be a surgery on a person involving a specific muscle. - Vein: Similarly, this choice could be a part of the larger surgical procedure on a person, but it is too specific to accurately represent the entire context of the situation in question. Veins may be involved when blood is present in an operating room, but the correct answer should account for all aspects of the scenario, such as the fact that it involves a person as a whole, rather than a singular component of their body. - Animals: This option could be a possibility if the context of the question indicated that the surgery was performed in a veterinary setting. However, given that the question does not provide any clear indication that the surgery is being performed on an animal rather than a human, it is more appropriate and in line with common sense to assume the surgery was performed on a person. In conclusion, based on the common sense and the information provided in the question, the most appropriate answer would be that the surgeons were operating on a person.

Hearing Ash's arrival: Taylor might have become aware of their friend's arrival through a knock, sound of a car, or other auditory cues. They may need to pause whatever activity they were previously engaged in and proceed to the door for the following step. 2.

A close friend of Prince William has claimed a drink driving charge against him could be invalid because of malfunctions in a police breathalyser machine. Guy Pelly, 32, was pulled over in his £90,000 black Audio R8 last year, and tests found that he was significantly over the legal alcohol limit. He is currently standing trial in Westminster Magistrates' Court, which heard today that a reading showed the proportion of alcohol in Mr Pelly's. breath was 52 microgrammes in 100 millilitres of breath. The legal limit is 35. But, despite the reading, and the testimony of officers who say his breath smelled of strong liquor on the night, Mr Pelly's lawyer has argued that the reading could have been wrong. He said that signals given off by radios held by nearby police officers, as well as those produced by Pelly's own iPhone, could have interfered with the intoximeter machine used in the police station. However, he was later contradicted by experts, and told the machine had been recently serviced. Pelly had that night refused to give a breath sample at the side of the road after being pulled over near Tonteria, the Sloane Square night club he runs. He was instead arrested and taken to a police station in Belgravia instead to undergo the test. Giving evidence, PC Geoff Parker told the court he stopped Pelly at around 1am on May 28 last year. He said: I noticed a black Audi pull out of a side road and travel down Sloane Street towards Knightsbridge. 'The reason my attention was drawn to the vehicle was because in my opinion it seemed to accelerate at speed. 'I decided to turn around and stop the vehicle and speak to the driver.' 'As I was speaking to him I could smell intoxicating liquor on the male's breath. 'I made a request for Mr Pelly to take part in a roadside breath test. I showed Mr Pelly the device, Mr Pelly said \\"I don't want to\\". 'I said to My Pelly \\"If you fail to provide a sample you'll be arrested, are you refusing to provide a sample?\\" Supercar: Pelly was pulled over while driving is Audi R8 supercar. He is pictured above with the vehicle in 2013. 'Mr Pelly replied: \\"Yes\\".' 'I asked: \\"Have you had an alcoholic drink in the last 20 minutes?\\" 'He replied no. 'I asked: \\"Have you had a cigarette in the last five minutes?\\" 'He replied no'. 'When I asked him to take the roadside breath test he replied: \\"I don't want to\\". Pelly was taken to Belgravia Police Station where he gave a sample over the legal drink drive limit, around an hour after his arrest. He insists he only drank two bottles of beer that night. Phillip Lucas, defending, said that Pelly could be innocent despite the reading, as the breathalyser machine could have suffered errors in the recording that went unseen by officers. He told the court: 'I'm going to suggest to you that there are certain error messages that can be produced on this device that only come up on the screen. Famous friends: Pelly poses at an upmarket book launch at London's Saatchi Gallery last April. Friends: Prince William, left and Pelly, right, watch a Six Nations rugby match together in 2002. 'They will not come up on a print out. Is that news to you?' Jon Fairhurst, the custody sergeant who oversaw the two intoximeter tests, said 'yes', adding: 'I would only be guided by the print out. As the print out said no errors, I took that to mean no errors.' Sgt Fairhurst said he only knew of four error messages that suggested the breathalyser machine may have given a faulty reading. But Mr Lucas said there were 13 - some of which only show up on the machine's screen and are not contained in a printout. The officer said he knew 'how to log into it, work it and be guided by it' but he said he was 'no expert' on the number of error messages that exist. Mr Lucas also suggested that police radios and mobile phones were in use near the machine and may have interfered with the reading. He told the arresting officer PC Geoff Parker: 'I'm going to suggest that your police radio was on your person and switched on.' Royal favourite: Pelly is pictured here with Princess Eugenie inside Tonteria. But the officer insisted it wasn't, and told the court: 'My radio and phone are normally taken off me and placed on the custody desk before I approach the procedure. 'I removed them myself. I placed them on the desk myself.' He admitted that there were other police officers in the adjacent custody room who would have had their radios on, but said he wasn't sure what frequency they were tuned into. Mr Lucas also claimed that Pelly still had his iPhone in his pocket when the test was carried out. He said: 'His telephone wasn't taken from him. When he came back to the desk he had to surrender his telephone. 'I'm suggesting that the defendant had his mobile phone on him during the procedure.' But the officer insisted the. socialite had been searched, his pockets emptied and his mobile phone. removed when he first got to Belgravia police station and before he was. breathalysed. The coutr. also heard how the machine was serviced and found to be in working order. on March 4 2013 - just two and a half months before Pelly used it. But Phillip Lucas, defending, said he was 'challenging the reliability' of the device. Party pal: Prince William and Guy Pelly pictured leaving Boujis, in South Kensington, after a night out. He said he had no actual evidence to prove that the machine was working perfectly. He said: 'The furthest I can go is to accept that the engineer went to check the calibration and the device. But I have no actual documentation saying it was fully operational. I don't have any actual figures about how the machine was seen on that date.' Pressed by District Judge John Zani on what the thrust of the defence case is, he added: 'I'm challenging the reliability of the breath analysis on this occasion. That has always been our challenge.' Charlotte Dale, an independent forensic alcohol consultant called by the prosecution, said there was no reason to doubt the machine's findings - especially as a repeat reading had been taken. Club owner: Guy Pelly with Prince Harry's ex-girlfriend Chelsy Davy at the launch of Tonteria. Branding the idea that it had misread Pelly's alcohol levels twice as 'too incredible'. She said: 'For it to affect two independent specimens to the exact same extent is to be too incredible. 'They are completely independent because they are two separate breath specimens. 'These are two separate breath specimens being analysed by the same hardware and coming up with the same result.' CCTV. footage played to the court shows Pelly being taken the station where. he blew into an intoxicator machine, which measured the amount of. alcohol in his system. He sat. on a bench with his arms crossed after taking the test before being told. to removed the laces from his shoes as he was put into a cell. The. 32-year-old denies the allegation. Pelly owns Mexican-themed Tonteria in Sloane Square and has run celebrity hotspots Mahiki and Whisky Mist in the past. His grandmother, Monica, was a. member of the Tate & Lyle sugar dynasty and his friendship with.

The aim is to engage the readers and evoke curiosity about the possessions that could potentially denote middle-class status. Introduction: In today's society, the concept of the middle class is an ever-evolving and, at times, a contentious topic. However, certain possessions have become synonymous with the aspirations and tastes that define this particular social class. From unique home decorations and technology to culinary choices, these items can shed light on one's position within the social stratum. So, what are these telltale possessions, and how many do you own? Step 2: Present a list of possessions that reflect middle-class status In this step, I will provide a comprehensive list of possessions that are commonly associated with the middle class. The information provided about each item will emphasize how these items indicate middle-class values and preferences. 1.

The Nespresso Coffee Machine: With a focus on convenience and stylish design, this coffee machine indicates a middle-class preference for high-quality coffee without sacrificing aesthetics. 3. A Smart Home System: Possessing a smart home system, such as an Amazon Echo or Google Home, shows an embrace of modern technology, and the willingness to invest in home improvements that enhance convenience and efficiency. 4. A Well-Stocked Bookshelf: A bookshelf filled with an eclectic range of reading materials, varying from classic literature to the latest bestsellers, showcases middle-class intellectual curiosity and cultural engagement. 5. Art Prints and Decor: The presence of art prints and thoughtfully chosen home decor tells of middle-class sensibilities, with a taste for quality, style, and individuality in the home environment. Step 3: Encourage readers to reflect on their own possessions In this step, I will invite readers to assess their own belongings and make connections to their position within the middle class. This helps to create a more interactive experience and keeps readers engaged.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more adolescents becoming adults happens, how will it affect less fetus in womb. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","response":"Step 1: Understand the process The given process outlines the typical stages of human life, from conception (as a fetus in the womb) to death (as an elderly person). Step 2: Define the perturbation hypothesis The perturbation hypothesis states that an increase in the number of adolescents becoming adults will have an effect on the number of fetuses in the womb. Step 3: Analyze the perturbation hypothesis's potential effects To do this, we will consider the different ways in which more adolescents becoming adults can influence the number of fetuses in the womb: - If a higher number of adolescents are becoming adults and assuming they have children during their adult life, this could potentially increase the number of fetuses in the womb in the population. - On the other hand, if more adolescents becoming adults lead to delayed childbearing or a decrease in the average number of children per family, it could result in fewer fetuses in the womb overall. Step 4: Determine if the perturbation hypothesis affects the process (directly or indirectly) A: Yes, the perturbation hypothesis does have an effect on the process, although it is indirect. An increase in the number of adolescents becoming adults could change variables such as the overall fertility rate, average age of childbearing, and family planning decisions, all of which can influence the number of fetuses in the womb. However, it is important to note that other factors like social, cultural, and economic conditions may also play a significant role in shaping these variables."},{"question":"Solve 3258*f = -3715*f + 502056 for f. Solve this problem.","response":"Okay, let's solve the equation step by step, just like we're trying to find out how many candies little Johnny has if he gave away some and received more from his friends. We have the equation: 3258 * f = -3715 * f + 502056 Our goal is to find the value of f (like finding out how many candies Johnny has). First, let's move the -3715*f to the other side, so the equation will look like this: 3258*f + 3715*f = 502056 Now, let's add the numbers together on the left side of the equation: (3258 + 3715) * f = 502056 That means: 6973 * f = 502056 Now, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 6973 to find the value of f: f = 502056 / 6973 After we do the division, we find out that: f ≈ 72 So, the value of f is approximately 72 (like Johnny has around 72 candies)."},{"question":"The technology is improving every year.

The suit fit her well, and she loved the way the colorful flowers danced across the fabric. She stepped out of the fitting room and showed Christine, who gave her a big thumbs up. Christine then decided that if Patricia was trying a one-piece, she should give it a shot too. She picked a beautiful blue one-piece with little seashells printed all over it, and went into the fitting room to try it on. When she came out, Christine looked stunning in her new one-piece bathing suit. Patricia clapped her hands in delight, happy to see her friend enjoying the new style. Both Christine and Patricia decided to buy their new one-piece bathing suits, excited to wear them at the beach. They knew they would have a fantastic time playing in the water and making sandcastles, now that they had these fabulous new bathing suits to wear. And so, full of excitement and anticipation, they left the mall and headed straight for the beach, ready to make a big splash together in their new one-piece bathing suits."},{"question":"Ava: Hey Eric, this is Doctor Ava from Rhodes Clinic..

Say only the first word of the rhyme. Memorize common Cockney rhyming slang. Article:","response":"Title: Unlocking the Secrets of Cockney Rhyming Slang: A Guide to Mastering the Lingo Introduction Cockney rhyming slang, an intriguing and inventive linguistic tradition, has captivated people's attention for centuries. Hailing from the East End of London, this particular vernacular has been synonymous with true 'Londoners' and has found its way into mainstream British culture. While it may appear confusing at first, learning Cockney rhyming slang can provide a unique window into a fascinating subculture. This article will act as a beginner’s guide, delving into the steps one should take to become proficient in this distinctive language. Remember, 'practice makes perfect,' so let's get started! Step 1: Grasp the Basic Concept Cockney rhyming slang is a linguistic game, essentially substituting everyday words with rhyming phrases. In most cases, only the first word of the rhyming phrase is actually used in conversation, leaving the listener to infer the intended meaning. For example, the word 'stairs' might be replaced with the phrase 'apples and pears,' and subsequently shortened to simply 'apples.' To become adept in Cockney rhyming slang, one must immerse themselves in this creative world of wordplay. Step 2: Familiarize Yourself with Common Rhyming Slangs Once you understand the basic premise of Cockney rhyming slang, the next step is committing some of the more commonly used phrases to memory. As with any language, the best way to learn is through active exposure and practice. Some well-known examples to start with include 'plates' for 'feet' ('plates of meat'), 'trouble' for 'wife' ('trouble and strife'), and 'butcher's' for 'look' ('butcher's hook'). By integrating these phrases into your daily speech, you'll become more comfortable and fluent. Step 3: Put It to the Test To truly improve your Cockney rhyming slang skills, it's essential to engage with native speakers – or at least those who have a strong grasp of the dialect. Seek out opportunities to use your newfound vocabulary in conversation with others familiar with the slang, whether it's in person or through online forums. Encountering a variety of rhymes and usages will not only reinforce your knowledge but also expose you to novel expressions. Step 4: Be Creative Cockney rhyming slang is a playful language at its core, so don't be afraid to get creative and invent your own phrases. Think of words you use frequently and brainstorm potential rhyming substitutes. The more you experiment with creating new slang, the more your proficiency will grow, and the more closely you'll understand the spirit behind the dialect. Conclusion Learning Cockney rhyming slang is a fun and challenging endeavor that can bring you closer to understanding a unique aspect of London's rich culture. By familiarizing yourself with the basic principles, memorizing common phrases, practicing regularly, and staying curious, you'll soon find yourself conversing like a true East Ender.

It is principally white-bodied and smooth, rough or broken-coated. But, can be any colour. - The Parson Russell Terrier is a breed of small white terrier that was the original Fox Terrier of the 18th century. The breed is named after the person credited with the creation of this type of dog, the Reverend John \\"Jack\\" Russell. It is the recognised conformation show variety of the Jack Russell Terrier and was first recognised in 1990 in the United Kingdom as the Parson Russell Terrier. In America, it was first recognised as the Jack Russell Terrier in 1997. The name was changed to its current form in 1999 in the UK and by 2008 all international kennel clubs recognised it under the new name. - A foxhound is a type of large hunting hound bred for strong hunting instincts, great energy, and, like all scent hounds, a keen sense of smell. In fox hunting, the foxhound's namesake, packs of foxhounds track quarry, followedusually on horsebackby the hunters, sometimes for several miles at a stretch; moreover, foxhounds also sometimes guard sheep and houses. - Fox Terriers are two different breeds of the terrier dog type: the Smooth Fox Terrier and the Wire Fox Terrier. Both of these breeds originated in the 19th century from a handful of dogs who are descended from earlier varieties of British terriers, and are related to other modern white terrier breeds. In addition, a number of breeds have diverged from these two main types of fox terrier and have been recognised separately, including the Jack Russell Terrier, Miniature Fox Terrier and Rat Terrier. The Wire and Smooth Fox Terriers share similar characteristics, the main differences being in the coat and markings. They have been successful in conformation shows, more prominently in America than their homeland. - H.O.R.S.E. is a form of poker commonly played at the high-stakes tables of casinos. It consists of rounds of play cycling among: - Hunting is the practice of killing or trapping animals, or pursuing or tracking them with the intent of doing so. Hunting wildlife or feral animals is most commonly done by humans for food, recreation, to remove predators that are dangerous to humans or domestic animals, or for trade. Lawful hunting is distinguished from poaching, which is the illegal killing, trapping or capture of the hunted species. The species that are hunted are referred to as game or prey and are usually mammals and birds. - The domestic dog (\\"Canis lupus familiaris\\" or \\"Canis familiaris\\") is a member of genus \\"Canis\\" (canines) that forms part of the wolf-like canids, and is the most widely abundant carnivore. The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa, with modern wolves not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated. The dog was the first domesticated species and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. - A working terrier is a small type of dog which pursues its quarry into the earth. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the name dates back to at least 1440, derived from early modern French \\"(chien) terrier\\" - from the medieval Latin \\"terrarius\\" from the Latin \\"terra\\" (earth). - A conformation show, also referred to as a \\"breed show\\", is a kind of dog show in which a judge familiar with a specific dog breed evaluates individual purebred dogs for how well the dogs \\"conform\\" to the established breed type for their breed, as described in a breed's individual breed standard. - A landrace is a domesticated, locally adapted, traditional variety of a species of animal or plant that has developed over time, through adaptation to its natural and cultural environment of agriculture and pastoralism, and due to isolation from other populations of the species. Landraces are generally distinguished from cultivars, and from breeds in the standardized sense, although the term landrace breed is sometimes used as distinguished from the term \\"standardized breed\\" when referring to cattle. The \\"-race\\" in this word refers to the taxonomic definition of \\"race\\" in biology, not the ethnographic sense of the word. - A terrier is a dog of any one of many breeds or landraces of terrier type, which are typically small, wiry, very active and fearless dogs. Terrier breeds vary greatly in size from just to over and are usually categorized by size or function. There are five different groups with each group having several different breeds. - The red fox (\\"Vulpes vulpes\\"), largest of the true foxes, has the greatest geographic range of all members of the Carnivora family, being present across the entire Northern Hemisphere from the Arctic Circle to North Africa, North America and Eurasia. It is listed as least concern by the IUCN. Its range has increased alongside human expansion, having been introduced to Australia, where it is considered harmful to native mammals and bird populations. Due to its presence in Australia, it is included among the list of the \\"world's 100 worst invasive species\\". - Fox hunting is an activity involving the tracking, chase, and sometimes killing of a fox, traditionally a red fox, by trained foxhounds or other scent hounds, and a group of unarmed followers led by a \\"master of foxhounds\\" (\\"master of hounds\\"), who follow the hounds on foot or on horseback. - Scent hounds (or scenthounds) are a type of hound that primarily hunts by scent rather than sight. These breeds are hunting dogs and are generally regarded as having some of the most sensitive noses among canines. - The Russell Terrier is a predominantly white working terrier with an instinct to hunt prey underground . The breed was derived from the Reverend John Russell 's working terrier strains that were used in the 19th century for fox hunting . The Reverend 's fox working strains were much smaller than the Show Fox Terrier and remained working terriers . The size of the Russell Terrier ( 10 \`\` to 12 '' ) combined with a small flexible , spannable chest makes it an ideal size to work efficiently underground . Their unique rectangular body shape with the body being of slightly longer length than the leg makes them distinctly different from the Parson Russell Terrier and the JRTCA Jack Russell Terrier .

The text has several references to different breeds of terriers, including the Jack Russell Terrier and the Parson Russell Terrier. The Russell Terrier is described as a working terrier and a predominantly white working terrier with an instinct to hunt prey underground. It is explicit from its description that the Russell Terrier is a specific breed of terrier. A breed, in the context of dogs, refers to a line of descendants descending from a recognized common ancestry and selected for particular attributes or characteristics. Each breed is distinguished by specific physical and behavioral traits that make it unique from other breeds. In the case of the Russell Terrier, its size, color, physical shape, and instinct to hunt underground are significant characteristics that distinguish it from other terrier breeds. The breed was derived from the Reverend John Russell's working terrier strains used for fox hunting in the 19th century. The Russell Terrier is distinct from both the Parson Russell Terrier and the JRTCA Jack Russell Terrier, largely due to its unique rectangular body shape and size. Moreover, the Russell Terrier is mentioned to have originated in England, but its development took place in Australia. This reference further substantiates its categorization as a specific breed, as breeds often evolve and are further developed in specific geographical locations, usually due to adaptations to local climates, terrains, or working needs. Changes such as these result in distinct breeds, such as the Russell Terrier. Thus, the most fitting answer to the question is 'breed'."},{"question":"Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: Who is full of hallucination?

Later, Disraeli receives the welcome news that the spendthrift Khedive of Egypt is in dire need of money and is willing to sell the controlling shares in the Suez Canal. The purchase of the canal would secure control of India, but Michael Probert, head of the Bank of England, makes it clear to Disraeli that he is vehemently opposed to any such plan. Disraeli then summons Hugh Myers, a leading Jewish banker. Meanwhile, Lord Charles Deeford proposes to Lady Clarissa Pevensey. Although she is in love with him, she turns him down. He is content to enjoy his wealth and high social standing, and lacks the ambition she wants in a husband; further, she is a great admirer of the Prime Minister and Charles has no strong opinion about him. Disraeli, seeing promise in the young man and wanting Clarissa to be happy, convinces Charles to come work for him, and tells him about the canal purchase. But he does not tell him about the spies. Russia, eager to seize India for itself, has assigned two spies to watch Disraeli: Mrs. Travers, who has entree to the highest social circles, and Mr. Foljambe. Disraeli was not fooled; he has hired Foljambe as his personal government secretary, the better to deceive him. When Foljambe asks Charles if Myers is there to provide financial backing for the purchase of the canal, Charles says nothing, but his manner makes it clear that Foljambe has guessed correctly. Mrs. Travers orders Foljambe to leave the country and warn their masters. Disraeli soon discovers what has happened. When he decides to send an agent to the khedive immediately, Clarissa suggests he send Charles. Charles persuades the khedive to accept Myers' cheque in exchange for the shares, also proving his own worth to Clarissa., can you guess it ? The answer to this question is:","response":"Lady Clarissa Pevensey. In the article, it mentions that Lady Clarissa Pevensey is a great admirer of the Prime Minister (Disraeli)."},{"question":"Sentence 1: For example, in the case of, aPromote Organizational Credibility,- both principles rely on the collaboration of senior executives and division heads for success and have as their target the senior management of the enterprise.

One of the following sentences is nonsensical. Which one is it? Options: - Sentence A: \\"I took off my coat in the cold wind\\" - Sentence B: \\"I put up my coat in the cold wind\\"","response":"To determine which sentence is nonsensical, let's analyze the meaning of each sentence step-by-step: Sentence A: \\"I took off my coat in the cold wind\\" 1. 'I' refers to the person speaking. 2. 'took off' implies the action of removing something. 3. 'my coat' is the object being removed. 4. 'in the cold wind' provides context for when the action takes place. Based on these steps, this sentence could be interpreted as a person removing their coat while it is cold and windy. This might not be a logically sensible action, but the sentence does make grammatical and semantic sense. Sentence B: \\"I put up my coat in the cold wind\\" 1. 'I' refers to the person speaking. 2. 'put up' typically means to hang or display something, or to tolerate something. 3. 'my coat' is the object being put up or tolerated. 4. 'in the cold wind' provides context for when the action takes place. In this sentence, the combination of 'put up' and 'my coat' can be confusing, as the meaning of 'put up' doesn't fit well with the context of cold wind. It could either be interpreted as a person hanging or displaying their coat, or tolerating their coat, in a cold wind. Neither interpretation makes much sense compared to sentence A. Thus, Sentence B is the nonsensical sentence."},{"question":"What are the keywords in the following sentence: gothic structure and the church was built in the period .","response":"The keywords in the given sentence are \\"Gothic,\\" \\"structure,\\" \\"church,\\" \\"built,\\" and \\"period.\\" These words are significant because they provide essential information about the subject matter discussed. 1. Gothic: This keyword indicates the architectural style of the structure in question. Gothic architecture is a style that originated in the 12th century, characterized by elements such as pointed arches, ribbed vaults, and flying buttresses, and was prevalent in the construction of cathedrals, churches, and abbeys in Europe. 2. Structure: This keyword highlights the focus on the physical building or edifice being discussed in the sentence. In this case, it refers to a church. It signifies the importance of the architectural and engineering aspects of the construction when analyzing the subject. 3. Church: This keyword identifies that the structure is a religious building, specifically a Christian place of worship. It indicates the building's function and the specific type of Gothic structure being examined. 4. Built: The keyword \\"built\\" underscores the construction and development of the church. By using the word 'built,' the sentence highlights not only the completed structure but also the process of construction and the techniques or materials used during that time. 5. Period: This keyword indicates that the sentence is discussing a specific timeframe during which the church was constructed. The term 'period' establishes a temporal context, which can help provide context about historical, architectural, and cultural aspects surrounding the church during that time."},{"question":"What most naturally follows? How to show a woman that you care Pay her compliments. One way that people feel love is through verbal expression, meaning words. Compliments definitely fall under this category, so try giving your lady a compliment.","response":"Step 1: Observe her actions, appearance, and personality traits To give sincere and meaningful compliments, begin by observing her actions, appearance, and personality traits. This will allow you to identify the aspects you genuinely appreciate and want to praise. Step 2: Choose the right moment Timing is essential when it comes to paying compliments. Choose a moment when you are both relaxed and in a good mood. Avoid giving compliments during arguments or tense situations, as they may seem insincere or manipulative. Step 3: Be specific and genuine When paying a compliment, be specific about what you appreciate. For example, instead of saying, \\"You look nice,\\" try, \\"I love the way your hair looks today.\\" Being genuine and specific shows that you are paying attention and truly care.

Smiling, leaning in, and softening your voice can also help convey sincerity. Step 6: Be mindful of her response Pay attention to her reaction after receiving the compliment. If she responds positively, continue to show your appreciation in future interactions. If she seems uncomfortable or dismissive, consider whether your compliment may have been inappropriate or ill-timed. Adjust your approach accordingly.

Paragraph: Orange JS, Du W and Falsey AR (2015) Therapeutic immunoglobulin selected for high antibody titer to RSV also contains high antibody titers to other respiratory viruses. Specific antibodies against infections most relevant to patients with primary immunodeficiency diseases are not routinely evaluated in commercial polyclonal immunoglobulin preparations. A polyclonal immunoglobulin prepared from plasma of donors having high neutralizing antibody titers to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was studied for the presence of antibody titers against seven additional respiratory viruses. While donors were not selected for antibody titers other than against RSV, the immunoglobulin preparation had significantly higher titers to 6 of 7 viruses compared to those present in 10 commercially available therapeutic immunoglobulin products (p ≤ 0.01 to p ≤ 0.001). To consider this as a donor-specific attribute, 20 random donor plasma samples were studied individually and identified a significant correlation between the RSV antibody titer and other respiratory virus titers: donors with high RSV titers were more likely to have higher titers to other respiratory viruses. These findings suggest either some humoral antiviral response bias or more frequent viral exposure of certain individuals.

It contrasts with citizenship acquired in other ways, for example by naturalization. Birthright citizenship may be conferred by jus soli or jus sanguinis. Under United States law, U.S. citizenship is automatically granted to any person born within and subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. This includes the territories of Puerto Rico, the Marianas (Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands), and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and also applies to children born elsewhere in the world to U.S. citizens (with certain exceptions). Based on the above text, what's the best answer to this question: are you a us citizen if born in the us? Options: A). no; B). yes;","response":"B). yes; Birthright citizenship in the United States is acquired by virtue of the circumstances of birth. Under United States law, U.S. citizenship is automatically granted to any person born within and subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. This means that if you are born in the US, you are a US citizen. This principle is based on the concept of jus soli, which grants citizenship to individuals born on the soil of a country, regardless of their parents' citizenship status. In addition to the continental United States, this also applies to those born in the US territories, including Puerto Rico, the Marianas (Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands), and the U.S. Virgin Islands. It's important to note that the United States is not unique in its implementation of birthright citizenship; many other countries also grant citizenship based on jus soli. However, some nations rely on a different principle called jus sanguinis, in which citizenship is primarily determined by the nationality of one's parents, rather than the location of birth. In some cases, a combination of both jus soli and jus sanguinis may be applied. In the United States, birthright citizenship is established under the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, which states that \\"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\\" This amendment was adopted in 1868 to nullify the Supreme Court's Dred Scott decision, which held that people of African descent could not be considered citizens, whether they were born free or into slavery. The 14th Amendment thus clarified and expanded the founding principles of the United States to ensure that citizenship would be granted without regard to race or origin. Beyond jus soli, children born abroad to US citizens may also acquire citizenship at birth through the principle of jus sanguinis. This means that even if a child is not born on US soil, they can still become a US citizen if at least one of their parents is a US citizen. However, there are certain exceptions and requirements that must be met, depending on the parents' marital status, the citizen parent's physical presence in the United States, and the relevant legislation in place at the time of the child's birth. In conclusion, if you are born in the United States, you are granted US citizenship by virtue of birthright citizenship, making option B the correct answer. This principle is based on the constitutional provision found in the 14th Amendment, which ensures that all persons born within the jurisdiction of the United States are considered citizens, regardless of their parents' nationality or origin."},{"question":"Is this product review positive?

L'utilisation de la force en tant que dernière option reflète l'importance accordée à la résolution pacifique des conflits et au respect des principes du droit international qui régissent les relations entre les États. L'Article 2, paragraphe 4 de la Charte des Nations Unies établit clairement que les membres de l'Organisation doivent s'abstenir dans leurs relations internationales de recourir à la menace ou à l'emploi de la force contre l'intégrité territoriale ou l'indépendance politique de tout État, ou de toute autre manière incompatible avec les buts des Nations Unies. Il existe cependant des circonstances dans lesquelles l'utilisation de la force peut être considérée comme légitime et justifiée, notamment en réponse à une agression armée, avec l'accord préalable du Conseil de sécurité des Nations Unies ou en exercice du droit inaliénable de légitime défense individuelle ou collective. Dans ces cas, les États doivent agir conformément aux principes du droit international humanitaire et respecter les normes établies en matière de proportionnalité, de nécessité et de précaution.

Kansas City would trail in the first quarter with quarterback Eli Manning completing a 3-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Steve Smith. Afterwards, the Chiefs would get on the board with rookie kicker Ryan Succop's 34-yard field goal. In the second quarter, New York would answer with Manning hooking up with Smith again on a 25-yard touchdown pass. Then, the Giants would close out the half with former Chiefs kicker Lawrence Tynes making a 25-yard field goal. After Tynes' 40-yard field goal in the third quarter, New York would finish their scoring in the fourth quarter with quarterback Eli Manning's 54-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Hakeem Nicks. Kansas City tried to rally with quarterback Matt Cassel completing a 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end Sean Ryan (followed by a failed 2-point conversion) and a 2-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Bobby Wade. What are the two shortest touchdown passes made?","response":"Okay kiddo, a touchdown pass is when a player throws the ball and their teammate catches it in the end zone to score points.

Chickadee, as she's called by family, told E! News in a revealing interview that she checked with the bank on a hunch and discovered the money had somehow dwindled to just 17.90. 'I have a feeling mama used that to buy a car and buy him what he wants,' 20-year-old Cardwell said, referring to Mark McDaniel, who served 10 years behind bars for child molestation. Scroll down for video. Speaking out: Anna 'Chickadee' Cardwell sat down with E! News Monday (pictured) for an interview in which she revealed her belief her mother Mama June took her 30,000 trust fund to buy Mark McDaniel, who molested Cardwell for months in 2002, a car. Shocking reveal: Cardwell also claimed that Mama June's recent outing with ex Sugar Bear is just a ruse to take the heat off her amid public outcry over her allegedly rekindled relationship with her daughter's abuser. Cardwell also claimed Monday that the 'united front,' as TMZ calls it, that Mama June and ex Sugar Bear are putting on in the face of claims they could lose custody of star Alana is just that: a front. 'Mama's using sugar bear to cover her ass,' claimed Cardwell. Meanwhile, Mama June denied claims about the car completely to E! News, saying, 'I never bought him a car.' Abuser: Mama June's ex Mark McDaniel, 53, served 10 years after repeatedly molesting Anna Cardwell in 2002. With Mama June having separated from long-time partner Mike 'Sugar Bear' Thompson just last month after she allegedly discovered the 42-year-old actively trolling for women on various dating websites, her daughter says the mom-of-four is enjoying the single life. 'She is all about the kids. She only needs us girls, no-one else,' Pumpkin stated. 'We are all sticking together as one happy family with us four girls.' However, TMZ reported October 26 that Mama June was spotted at a Georgia car dealer, where she plunked down 25,000 cash to purchase two used Nissan Altimas. One was for a family member, while the other was delivered to a 'friend' in Decatur--to the very address McDaniel listed on his sex offender registry, TMZ claimed. Cardwell, who is now married with a two-year-old daughter, said that she just goes 'day by day' in the aftermath of the abuse she says she suffered at the hands of McDaniel eight years ago. She added that she encourages her nine-year-old sister Alana not to get too close 'because you never know what will happen'. Living the single life? Cardwell claims her mother's recent outing with ex Sugar Bear was just to keep up appearances. TMZ claimed in late October that Mama June had plunked down 25,000 for two Nissan Altimas (file photo pictured), one for a family member and another for a 'friend.' The site claimed that friend is Mark McDaniel. Mama June has denied the claims that she has been seeing McDaniel, 53, despite damning photographs that show them house hunting together and him hanging out with Alana. After the images emerged, TLC canceled the show, which has had four seasons. Anna claimed he abused her for months in 2002 at the trailer he shared with Mama June - sometimes while Pumpkin, then three, was forced to watch. Mark only got out of prison in March after he was convicted in 2004 of aggravated child molestation, which is 'when such person commits an offense of child molestation which act physically injures the child or involves an act of sodomy'. The three youngest girls still live at home in MacIntyre, Georgia, while Anna - who has a two-year-old daughter, Kaitlyn - has since moved to Alabama after marrying baby daddy Michael Cardwell.

A small group of Sonderkommandos, prisoners assigned to dispose of the bodies of other dead prisoners, are plotting an insurrection that, they hope, will destroy at least one of the camp's four crematoria and gas chambers. They are receiving firearms from Polish citizens in the nearby village and gunpowder from the UNIO munitions factory; the female prisoners who work in the UNIO are smuggling the powder to the menâs camp amid the bodies of their dead workers. When the women's activity is eventually discovered by the Germans they are savagely tortured, but they don't reveal the plot. Meanwhile, a Hungarian-Jewish doctor, MiklÃ³s Nyiszli (Allan Corduner), who works for the Nazi scientist Josef Mengele in an experimental medical lab, has received permission from Mengele himself to visit his wife and daughter in the womenâs labor camp. Nyiszli is concerned about the safety of his family and believes that Mengeleâs orders will keep them from the gas chambers. A new trainload of Hungarian Jewish prisoners arrives, and all are immediately sent to the gas chambers. As the group is given instructions about \\"delousing\\", a fearful, angry man in the group begins shouting questions at one of the Sonderkommandos, Hoffman (Arquette), who has been issuing the instructions. Hoffman beats him to death in an outburst of frustration, in an attempt to make the man stop talking. After the gassing of this same group, a badly shaken Hoffman finds a young girl alive beneath a pile of bodies. He removes her from the chamber, and, after informing the leader of the insurgency, Schlermer (Daniel Benzali), takes her to a storage room and summons Nyiszli, who revives her. The group decides to hide her in the childrenâs camp. While the prisoners hide her in a dressing room, SS-OberscharfÃ¼hrer Eric Muhsfeldt (Keitel) suddenly walks in.

Lawrence offered to make another one. Although Lawrence was initially upset that his meticulously crafted piece had been shattered into pieces, he couldn't help but pay attention to the genuine remorse etched on Randy's face. He knew that accidents happen and everyone makes mistakes, so he decided to take this unfortunate event as a learning experience and an opportunity to bond over creating something new. Lawrence, determined not to dwell on the mishap, graciously offered to make another bowl, this time with Randy's help. He thought that embarking on the pottery journey together would serve as a means to foster their friendship further, develop mutual understanding, and encourage personal growth. Randy, relieved by Lawrence's composed reaction, gratefully accepted the offer and expressed his earnest eagerness to try his hand at pottery to make sure that the final product would be as close to perfect as possible in an attempt to make up for the loss. Together, they returned to the pottery store and Lawrence, being the more experienced one, started guiding Randy through the process. From selecting the clay to preparing it for molding, Lawrence shared every little detail and technique he had learned during his previous visits to the store. Randy, carefully listening to each instruction, found a deep appreciation for the art itself and quickly grew to admire Lawrence's patience and dedication. As they settled in front of the spinning pottery wheel, Lawrence demonstrated the importance of maintaining the right pressure and motion while molding the clay. Randy mimicked his movements and soon immersed himself in the art of pottery-making, his hands moving as one with Lawrence's to create a new, unique piece. With every smooth turn and successful technique, they felt a sense of achievement and satisfaction grow within them. The initial frustration and disappointment were now a distant memory as the two friends worked diligently together. As the bowl gradually took shape, Lawrence and Randy bonded over not just the creative process, but also shared stories, dreams, and laughter – just as if they were weaving tangible threads of connection and understanding between them. Once the bowl was completed and painted, both Lawrence and Randy were incredibly proud of their collaborative effort. This seemingly unfortunate event had brought them closer and unveiled hidden talents, as well as immense mutual respect for one another. As they left the pottery store, cradling their newly crafted piece, they knew that it was more than just a bowl – it was a symbol of patience, understanding, and the ability to turn a negative situation into a positive learning experience. A true testament to the strength of their friendship, Lawrence and Randy would never forget the story behind this simple but meaningful artifact that now held a special place in their hearts."},{"question":"I read this background article the other day: Mantle melting can come about three ways: (1) when the temperature rises, (2) if the pressure lowers (which lowers the melting point), and (3) if water is added, which lowers the melting point. Two of these (1 and 3) might explain why there are volcanoes at convergent plate boundaries: the temperature of the subducting plate increases as it sinks into the hot mantle (1). Sediments lying on top of the subducting plate contain water. As the sediments subduct, the water rises into the overlying mantle material. This lowers the melting temperature of the mantle (3). When the mantle above the subducting plate melts, volcanoes form above it. This leads to volcanoes in an island arc or continental arc. I am facing a new situation today: Two researches studied the Earth's mantle. Clint studied mantle melting, and his pal Uri decided to study other mantle related phenomena. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which researcher read less about adding water to the mantle?","response":"Based on the information provided, Uri read less about adding water to the mantle.

Avoid answers that are incorrect or provides incomplete justification for the question. Passage: Starting in the late 1950s, American computer scientist Paul Baran developed the concept Distributed Adaptive Message Block Switching with the goal to provide a fault-tolerant, efficient routing method for telecommunication messages as part of a research program at the RAND Corporation, funded by the US Department of Defense. This concept contrasted and contradicted the theretofore established principles of pre-allocation of network bandwidth, largely fortified by the development of telecommunications in the Bell System. The new concept found little resonance among network implementers until the independent work of Donald Davies at the National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom) (NPL) in the late 1960s. Davies is credited with coining the modern name packet switching and inspiring numerous packet switching networks in Europe in the decade following, including the incorporation of the concept in the early ARPANET in the United States.

It provides complete justification for the question as it directly addresses what Paul Baran developed."},{"question":"I can use this background: Electronic ear protectors work differently. They identify high-amplitude sound waves and send sound waves through them in the opposite direction. This causes destructive interference with the waves, which reduces their amplitude to zero or nearly zero. This changes even the loudest sounds to just a soft hiss. Sounds that people need to hear, such as the voices of co-workers, are not interfered with in this way and may be amplified instead so they can be heard more clearly. This type of hearing protector is recommended for higher noise levels and situations where it’s important to be able to hear lower-decibel sounds. Now, I have a new situation: Carson is a construction worker that operates a jack hammer on the construction site for a new building. The jack hammer is often incredibly loud and generates a high amount of noise.

Whether he was escaping from a locked box or making things disappear and reappear, he surely was entertaining. People thought that he must truly have some supernatural powers, but in fact, what Harry really had was drive. Harry was born in Budapest, Hungary, in 1874. His real name was Ehrich Weiss, the third of five children. His family moved to Wisconsin not long after his birth and when he was nine, he was tying ropes all over his backyard and learning amazing tricks to show his friends and neighbors. He visited the local locksmith, and when he had reached his teens he could pick almost any lock that was made. He also learned how to do card tricks. He and his brother, Theo, would often entertain at local parties and clubs for extra money. When Ehrich was 16, he came across a book that would actually change his life: the biography of France's greatest magician, Jean Eugene Robert-Houdin. It showed Ehrich that his hobby of magic and tricks could also be a career. Immediately, he changed his name to Harry Houdini. He and Theo headed out to make a living as magicians. In 1893, they performed at the Chicago World's Fair, and after that they traveled around giving magic shows for anyone willing to listen and pay. Theo grew restless, however, as the jobs became scarce, so he left. His timing was perfect since Harry had just fallen in love with a lovely woman named Bess who was just the right size for slipping in and out of the trunk they used in their magic tricks. They married immediately and then off they went, traveling with circuses and other road shows. Harry learned more and more tricks and spent much of his time reading and studying all kinds of locks, especially handcuffs.

On the other hand, Sentence B: \\"Chicken can lay eggs\\" makes sense because chickens are birds, and they reproduce by laying eggs. Chickens, which are common domesticated fowls, belong to the family Phasianidae. They are oviparous, meaning they lay eggs that hatch outside of the body. Female chickens, called hens, have a specialized reproductive system that allows them to produce eggs, which then incubate for about 21 days before hatching into chicks. In conclusion, Sentence A doesn't make sense, while Sentence B does make sense based on the reproductive systems and classifications of the animals mentioned."},{"question":"Concepts: organism, perch, rock Write a sentence that includes all these words.","response":"The bright blue-and-yellow striped organism, commonly known as the perch, gracefully swam around the underwater rock formations, skillfully navigating its domain while voraciously searching for aquatic insects and smaller fish to sustain its energy and growth."},{"question":"What kind of task would test someone's ability to perform physical reasoning?","response":"Imagine you have a friend, and you want to see how good they are at figuring out things with their body and brain combined.

Question: How would Bailey feel afterwards? Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context? A: a person who likes to eat bear B: full C: a hunter who likes to hunt Answer:","response":"B: full In the context provided, Bailey shot and killed a bear, and then ate the bear for dinner. It is clear that Bailey engaged in hunting and consuming the bear as a source of sustenance. The question is specifically asking about how Bailey would feel afterward, and the most direct result of eating a meal is a feeling of fullness, leading us to select option B as the best answer within the given context. Answer A, \\"a person who likes to eat bear,\\" might be an accurate description of Bailey, but it does not address how Bailey would feel after eating the dinner. While the fact that Bailey ate the bear might imply that they like to eat bear meat, the question is asking for a feeling after eating, which is not covered by this answer. Option C, \\"a hunter who likes to hunt,\\" might also be an accurate description of Bailey's characteristics as someone who hunts bears. However, similarly to answer A, this description does not discuss Bailey's feeling after eating dinner. Although Bailey's hunting implies a possible preference for hunting activities, the question specifically asks for Bailey's feelings after eating the bear, which makes option C a less appropriate answer to the given question. Therefore, considering the context and the focus on how Bailey would feel after consuming the dinner, the best answer to the question is B: full."},{"question":"DriveyourcarlikecrazyandtrytogoasfaraspossibleinTraffic[...] Generate a sentence using the above characters:","response":"Delighted, Reuben and Ivy ventured, effervescently, yearning out under radiant cascading lights, intelligently keeping energetic strides, ambling zealously; people obsessed, sensing salvageable insistences beneath languid, extraordinary traffic scenes, cemented reflections in tireless yards."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: Generate a question which can yield the answer mentioned in the input.

Step 2: Describe specific issues Firstly, the service was substandard. Our waiter took a long time to greet us, and throughout the meal, we had to frequently flag them down for service. Additionally, our drinks arrived halfway through our main course, which is unacceptable for a restaurant of this caliber. Step 3: Highlight aspects of the product or service that were particularly bothersome The food was a major letdown. Our appetizer, the Crab Stuffed Mushrooms, were cold and lacked flavor.

Did Native American tribes teach Spaniards how to cultivate maize? If the answer is 'yes'; explain the reasoning:","response":"Yes, Native American tribes did teach Spaniards how to cultivate maize. The reasoning is as follows: 1. Maize, also known as corn, was first domesticated in Mexico by indigenous peoples around 10,000 years ago. The Native American tribes had a deep understanding of the cultivation process, as they had been growing maize for thousands of years. 2. The Spaniards first arrived in the Americas in the late 15th century through various expeditions, such as Christopher Columbus' 1492 voyage. In their encounters with Native American tribes, the Spaniards began to learn about local agricultural practices, including maize cultivation. 3. The transfer of knowledge about maize cultivation was part of the Columbian Exchange, the exchange of goods, ideas, and practices between the Old and New Worlds following European explorations in the Americas. This exchange had lasting impacts on both continents, including the introduction of new crops and foods. 4. By learning how to grow maize from Native American tribes, the Spaniards were able to adopt this valuable crop into their own agricultural systems. This knowledge was later spread to other European nations, which eventually led to maize becoming an essential crop around the world. In conclusion, Native American tribes did teach the Spaniards how to cultivate maize, contributing to its global spread and importance in agriculture today."},{"question":"Generate a question about the following movie plot: Rocky V begins with Rocky and his trainer Tony \\"Duke\\" Evers in their dressing room after the Drago fight.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which colleague studied less about the development of antiretroviral drugs? Hint: While people have been able to prevent certain viral diseases by vaccinations for many hundreds of years, the development of antiviral drugs to treat viral diseases is a relatively recent development. Antiviral drugs are medications used specifically for treating the symptoms of viral infections. The first antiviral drug was interferon , a substance that is naturally produced by certain immune cells when an infection is detected. Over the past twenty years the development of antiretroviral drugs (also known as antiretroviral therapy, or ART) has increased rapidly. This has been driven by the AIDS epidemic. A:","response":"Based on the information provided, it appears that Liam would be the colleague who studied less about the development of antiretroviral drugs. This is because Bob focused on drugs administered to people with viral diseases—such as antiviral drugs—while Liam decided to study other types of drugs, like antibiotics and anticoagulants. The hint given—regarding the development of antiviral drugs and the AIDS epidemic—further supports this conclusion. As antiretroviral drugs are a type of antiviral medication, and since they have been playing a significant role in treating HIV and AIDS, it is more likely that Bob's studies on drugs for viral diseases would have included antiretroviral drugs, as well. Meanwhile, Liam's focus on antibiotics highlights his interest in drugs for non-viral infections, such as bacterial infections, rather than viral diseases. Antibiotics—unlike antiviral or antiretroviral drugs—are not effective against viruses and would not be used to fight conditions like HIV or AIDS. In turn, anticoagulants are primarily used to prevent blood clotting, not viral infections. Neither of these drug categories would have involved antiretroviral medication in Liam's studies. Ultimately, considering their respective areas of focus, it can be concluded that Liam studied less about the development of antiretroviral drugs than Bob."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot and a question. You need to provide the correct answer for it. Short answers containing words that are present in the passage are preferred. Problem:One morning, hit men Charlie (Lee Marvin) and Lee (Clu Gulager) enter a school for the blind and terrorize the principal until she reveals the whereabouts of a teacher, Johnny North (John Cassavetes). As the hitmen walk toward North's upstairs classroom, the teacher receives a call warning him of their arrival. Johnny sadly responds, \\"It's okay. I know them.\\" As he calmly waits at his desk, Charlie and Lee enter and shoot him multiple times.As they depart by train, Charlie is bothered that North refused to flee, and that they were paid an unusually high fee for such a simple hit. He and Lee run through what they know about the man they have just killed. Johnny was once a champion race car driver whose career ended in a violent crash. Four years before his death, he was involved in a million-dollar robbery of a mail truck. Tempted by the missing million, Charlie and Lee visit Miami to interview Johnny's former mechanic.Earl Sylvester (Claude Akins), who considers himself Johnny's only friend, is devastated to learn of his death. In between sobs and gulps of whiskey, he tells the story as he remembers it. Johnny North was at the top of his profession when he met the beautiful Sheila Farr (Angie Dickinson). Johnny fell in love and planned to propose marriage after winning his next big race. However, Johnny's late nights with Sheila had left him disoriented from lack of sleep. His racing career ended with a fiery crash.At the hospital, Earl revealed to Johnny that Sheila was the mistress of mob boss Jack Browning (Ronald Reagan). Known for her extravagant taste, Sheila has already cheated on Browning with several other sports figures, all of whom met bad ends. Enraged and heartbroken, Johnny rebuffed Sheila's attempts to explain and cut his ties to her.Intrigued, Charlie and Lee approach a former member of Browning's crew, who also reveals his memories. After the crash, Sheila found Johnny working as a pit mechanic. She says a much better job might soon be his for the taking. Browning was planning the robbery of a U.S. postal truck. On Sheila's recommendation, he agreed to Johnny as his getaway driver.Although Johnny still felt betrayed, Sheila said that she had always regretted losing him. Johnny forgave her. He also helped Browning by souping up the getaway car. Browning, however, was enraged when he learned that Sheila had returned to Johnny. In a deliberate provocation, Browning brutally slapped Sheila in front of Johnny, after she defied him. Johnny punched Browning and threatened to kill him if he ever hurt Sheila again. They agreed to \\"settle this\\" after the robbery.Browning and North placed a phony detour sign to send the mail truck onto an isolated mountain road. When the truck stopped, the gang held it up at gunpoint, loading more than 1 million into the getaway car. Johnny then forced Browning out of the moving car, driving off alone with the money.After listening to this story, Charlie and Lee pay a visit to Browning, who is now a real estate developer in Los Angeles. Browning insists he is now an honest businessman and has no idea what happened to the money. He reveals that Sheila is staying at a hotel and arranges a meeting with her.To deprive Browning of time to plan an ambush, Charlie and Lee call at Sheila's hotel several hours earlier than agreed. At first Sheila denies all knowledge of Johnny or the money. Charlie and Lee beat her and dangle her by the ankles out a seventh-story window. Terrified, she tells them the truth.The night before the robbery, she told Johnny his life was in danger. Browning, she said, was planning to kill him and pocket his share. Johnny wanted to kill Browning on the spot. Sheila insisted she had a better idea. On her advice, Johnny threw Browning out of the car and drove the money to Sheila.As the two lovers met in a hotel room, Browning showed up. Sheila asked Browning to \\"do it quickly,\\" and the gangster shot Johnny, severely wounding but not killing him before Johnny escaped. It turned out Sheila and Browning were husband and wife. Sheila expressed fear that Johnny would seek revenge, so Browning hired Charlie and Lee to murder him.Charlie now understands at last why Johnny refused to flee. The only man who refuses to run is a man who considers himself to be already dead. Sheila's betrayal had already killed Johnny long before the bullets ever touched him.Charlie and Lee, with Sheila in tow, intend to confront Browning, but he is waiting nearby with a sniper rifle. He kills Lee and wounds Charlie.Browning and Sheila return home, where they prepare to flee with the money. A mortally wounded Charlie makes it there in time. Sheila, at last revealing her sociopathic nature, frantically denies any role in Johnny's death, insisting that her husband alone was responsible. Charlie calmly shoots Browning dead. He turns his revolver toward Sheila. When she again pleads for her life, Charlie snarls, \\"Lady, I don't have the time!\\" He kills Sheila with a single bullet and staggers out the door. Charlie falls dead on the lawn while still gripping the money, as a police car in the background makes its way towards the house., Question: Who kills Sheila?

Q: Lecturer Dave Harte, from Birmingham City University, has published the findings as the use of social media surges because of widespread snow disruption. His report shows Birmingham has 28 hyperlocal sites, which is more than any other council area in the UK. Birmingham blogger Sas Taylor said: \\"The snow brings everyone together to share information.\\" 'Grass-roots way' Her website, B31 Voices, which covers the B31 postcode area of the city, received its highest ever number of hits on Sunday while the site's hashtag #B31Snowwatch gathered 2,588 Twitter followers in just eight days. Mr Harte added: \\"It came into its own on Friday with Sas and Marty juggling getting their own kids ready for school whilst tweeting (2,464 followers) and facebooking (2,324 likes) school closure updates.\\" He defines hyperlocal news sites as \\"online local news or content pertaining to a town, village or single postcode area\\". So is travel information the main reason people use hyperlocal websites? Blogger Jon Bounds said: \\"Birmingham started at the forefront of blogging because the council was so bad at communicating. That's not so much the case now, but people are still blogging in a grass-roots way and no one's trying to make money out of it. \\"Maybe because Brummies are down-to-earth people, or maybe they're just sensible enough to know there's not a lot of money to be made.\\" Dan Slee, from Walsall Council, said: \\"My focus as a local government press officer is how councils can get the information out in a timely and effective way so that they can be read, shared, talked about and discussed by a whole range of people.\\" Will Perrin, from Talk About Local, a national organisation promoting hyperlocal sites, added: \\"Birmingham has a fabulous digital culture of people using quite straightforward technology to express themselves. \\"It's not [economical] for big media companies to cover areas so locally, they'd never be able to do it, so hyperlocal sites are a very good thing.\\" Clive Edwards, editor of monthly local Castle Vale paper The Tyburn Mail, said: \\"We don't have the technology, staff or status of large news organisations.

Two rival groups of Acromyrmex heyeri ants, group A and group B, are battling each other to gain territory. The goal is to attack the rival group when they have more openings in their nest thatch. In battle day one group A territory had 5 °C temperature. In battle day two group A territory had 22 °C temperature. In battle day three group A territory had low air humidity. In battle day four group A territory had high air humidity. and a hint : Acromyrmex heyeri is a species of leaf-cutter ant, a New World ant of the subfamily Myrmicinae of the genus Acromyrmex. Acromyrmex heyeri workers construct the colonies nest by thatching together cut grass. At temperatures ranging from 20–30 °C, workers created more openings in the nest thatch as the internal nest temperature goes up as a method of temperature regulation for the colony. The workers will close openings in the nest thatch as the air humidity surrounding the nest decreases to reduce water loss for the colony. Please answer this question : In which battle day group A would have more openings in their nest thatch, battle day three or battle day four? Answer:","response":"To answer this question, let's analyze the given information step by step: 1. Acromyrmex heyeri ants create more openings in the nest thatch when the internal nest temperature goes up, specifically within the range of 20-30°C. 2. They close openings in the nest thatch when the air humidity decreases to reduce water loss. Now, let's examine the conditions on battle day three and battle day four: Battle day three: Group A territory had low air humidity. - Low air humidity would prompt the ants to close openings in their nest thatch to reduce water loss. Battle day four: Group A territory had high air humidity. - High air humidity implies that the ants don't need to worry about water loss due to evaporation. Consequently, they could potentially have more openings in their nest thatch for other purposes (for example, temperature regulation). From the given information, it's not clear what the exact temperature is on battle day three and battle day four. However, we can infer that due to high air humidity on battle day four, the ants might be more likely to have more openings in their nest thatch compared to battle day three, when they might close openings to reduce water loss due to low air humidity.

He categorized the certain sections of his county's population. First he categorized boys and girls between nine and thirteen years as cat A. Then he put girls between fourteen and eighteen years in cat B, and boys of the same age in cat C. Lastly, he categorized pregnant women as cat D. He needs to recommend healthy diet, especially iron intake, for each group. But I can use this background: Boys and girls between the ages of 9 and 13 should get 9 mg of iron every day. Girls between the ages of 14 and 18 should get 15 mg of iron every day. Boys between the ages of 14 and 18 should get 11 mg of iron every day. Pregnant women need the most iron—27 mg daily. Good sources of iron include shellfish, such as clams and oysters. Red meats, such as beef, are also a good source of iron. Non-animal sources of iron include seeds, nuts, and legumes. Breakfast cereals often have iron added to them in a process called fortification. Some good sources of iron are listed below ( Table below ). Eating vitamin C along with iron-containing food increases the amount of iron that the body can absorb. What is an answer for this question: Would cat B need less or more iron than cat A? A:","response":"Category B, which consists of girls between the ages of 14 and 18, would need more iron than Category A, which comprises boys and girls between the ages of 9 and 13. Based on the provided background information, Cat B requires a daily iron intake of 15 mg while Cat A needs 9 mg of iron per day. So Cat B requires more iron than Cat A. The increased need for iron in girls in this age range is generally due to menstruation, which can lead to iron loss. Hence, an increase in iron intake is required to compensate for this."},{"question":"Please answer this question: when does the last episode of once upon a time air?","response":"To find the information about the last episode's air date for the television show \\"Once Upon a Time,\\" I will follow these steps: 1.

Based on the preceding passage, answer the following question Why might they be going to Atlanta for the fourth ?","response":"They might be going to Atlanta for the fourth for several reasons based on the given information: 1. Celebrate Independence Day: The mention of the Fourth implies that they're planning to celebrate the Fourth of July, which is the United States' Independence Day. Atlanta, being a major city, is likely to have various festivities and events organized for this occasion, which they would like to be a part of. 2. Watch the fireworks: The passage explicitly mentions they're heading to a friend's house in downtown Atlanta to watch the fireworks. Fireworks displays are a significant part of Fourth of July celebrations in the US, and Atlanta is known for hosting spectacular shows. Watching the fireworks from a friend's house could offer a more private and comfortable experience, compared to being in a crowded public space. 3. Socialize with friends: Since they are heading to a friend's house, it can be inferred that the event also presents an opportunity for them to spend time with their friends. Celebrating an occasion with people you care about can make it even more special, and in this case, it appears that they are looking forward to spending time with their friends in Atlanta. 4. Familiarity with the area: It's possible that they have spent previous Fourth of July celebrations in Atlanta and are familiar with the city's festivities. Having had positive experiences in the past, they might be keen on returning to relive those memories and enjoy their preferred events. 5. Babysitting duties: It's also mentioned that they will be babysitting their nieces on the 5th. This could suggest that they are visiting Atlanta to be with family members who live there and combining their social obligations with the opportunity to celebrate the Fourth of July. In conclusion, the primary motivator for going to Atlanta for the fourth is likely a combination of the desire to celebrate Independence Day, attend a fireworks display, and socialize with friends and family. The fact that they will be babysitting on the 5th further emphasizes the importance of family connections in their plans, and Atlanta has likely been chosen for its festive atmosphere and familiar surroundings."},{"question":"Q:Context: Bailey decided to rob a bank and got caught right after he robbed the place.

Options: 1). No; 2). Yes; The answer is:","response":"1). No;"},{"question":"Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Murray Bookchin (January 14, 1921 - July 30, 2006) was an American social theorist, author, orator, historian, and political philosopher. A pioneer in the ecology movement, Bookchin formulated and developed the theory of social ecology within anarchist, libertarian socialist, and ecological thought. He was the author of two dozen books covering topics in politics, philosophy, history, urban affairs, and ecology. Among the most important were Our Synthetic Environment (1962), Post-Scarcity Anarchism (1971) and The Ecology of Freedom (1982). Bookchin was critical of class-centered analysis of Marxism and simplistic anti-state forms of libertarianism and liberalism and wished to present what he saw as a more complex view of societies. In The Ecology of Freedom: The Emergence and Dissolution of Hierarchy, he says that: My use of the word hierarchy in the subtitle of this work is meant to be provocative. There is a strong theoretical need to contrast hierarchy with the more widespread use of the words class and State; careless use of these terms can produce a dangerous simplification of social reality. To use the words hierarchy, class, and State interchangeably, as many social theorists do, is insidious and obscurantist. This practice, in the name of a \\"classless\\" or \\"libertarian\\" society, could easily conceal the existence of hierarchical relationships and a hierarchical sensibility, both of which-even in the absence of economic exploitation or political coercion-would serve to perpetuate unfreedom. Bookchin also points to an accumulation of hierarchical systems throughout history that has occurred up to contemporary societies which tends to determine the human collective and individual psyche: The objective history of the social structure becomes internalized as a subjective history of the psychic structure. Heinous as my view may be to modern Freudians, it is not the discipline of work but the discipline of rule that demands the repression of internal nature. This repression then extends outward to external nature as a mere object of rule and later of exploitation. This mentality permeates our individual psyches in a cumulative form up to the present day-not merely as capitalism but as the vast history of hierarchical society from its inception. was this a book he had written?","response":"Yes, the quote mentioned is taken from a book written by Murray Bookchin titled \\"The Ecology of Freedom: The Emergence and Dissolution of Hierarchy.\\""},{"question":"- caption is major general herbert b. loper - battles is world war ii : - death date is 25 august 1989 - allegiance is united states of america - commands is armed forces special weapons project - rank is 35px major general - awards is distinguished service medal legion of merit -lrb- 2 -rrb- - birth date is 22 october 1896 - serviceyears is 1918 -- 1955 - branch is 25px united states army - laterwork is chairman of the military liaison committee - image is herbert loper.jpeg - death place is palm bay , florida - birth place is kansas Given the details above, guess who could this information be about.

Answer:","response":"Aksharit is the game that was invented in India and is played more by children compared to Pay Day. To provide a comprehensive understanding, let's delve into the origins, rules, and significance of both games. Aksharit: Aksharit is an Indian board game, specifically designed for young children to learn and engage with the Hindi language. The game was developed by IIT Bombay alumni Rajat Dhariwal, Manuj Dhariwal, and Mohit Gupta, and was launched in 2006. Aksharit is often referred to as the Hindi version of Scrabble, as it borrows some of its gameplay aspects from the English word-building game. In Aksharit, the playing board consists of a grid with cells, and players are given lettered tiles. The aim is to form Hindi words by placing tiles on the board. Each letter tile has a specific point value assigned to it, depending on the frequency of the letter's usage in the language. Players score points based on the letter tiles they use to create words, and bonuses are given when a word is created on special cells (such as double/triple letter scores or double/triple word scores). The game has been widely embraced in India, particularly among children. Aksharit serves an educational purpose, as it helps kids learn the Hindi alphabet, enhance their vocabulary, and improve their language skills. Moreover, it is crafted in such a way that it caters to both native Hindi speakers and those learning Hindi as a second language, hence making it easily accessible for a more diverse group of players. Its popularity in India is a testament to its successful blend of education and entertainment, making it a favored pastime among young learners. Pay Day: On the other hand, Pay Day is an American board game that was created by Paul J. Gruen and first published by Parker Brothers (now a subsidiary of Hasbro) in 1975. Pay Day focuses on teaching children and adults basic financial skills and money management concepts through an engaging, simulation-based gameplay experience. In Pay Day, players move around a board representing a month, where each space corresponds to a specific day. The goal of the game is to have the most money at the end of the month after accounting for various expenses, deals, and transactions that occur throughout the game. Players receive a monthly salary, assume financial responsibilities, and make decisions aimed at increasing their wealth. While Pay Day is designed for players of all ages, it is not as widespread in Indian families. The game's content, including its monetary system and financial themes, is centered around the Western way of life, making it less relatable for Indian children. Moreover, given its focus on financial skills, the game is not primarily aimed at teaching or enhancing language skills, making it less pertinent for children in an Indian context. In conclusion, Aksharit is the game that was invented in India and played more by children, as compared to Pay Day. This can be attributed to Aksharit's relatability to the Indian culture, its educational focus on language learning and vocabulary enrichment, and its accessibility to a diverse group of players, irrespective of their linguistic background."},{"question":"Data: Delta II, launchSite, Vandenberg Air Force Base; Antares (rocket), comparable, Delta II; Delta II, countryOrigin, United States Sentence about the following data:","response":"The Delta II rocket, originating from the United States, has been launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base and is considered comparable to the Antares rocket."},{"question":"Q:Question: how old is sybil vane in the picture of dorian gray I found the following answer on Google: Dorian meets Lord Henry Wotton, a friend of Basil's, and becomes enthralled by Lord Henry's world view.

Administration of Nuffield's donation was the responsibility of the University, as the college did not become an independent body until after the Second World War. A sub-committee, consisting of three heads of Oxford colleges (Sir William Beveridge from University College; Alfred Emden from St Edmund Hall; and Linda Grier from Lady Margaret Hall), was appointed to choose the architect; Emden appears to have played the major part in the group's work. Eight architects were initially asked to compete, including Louis de Soissons, Vincent Harris, Austen Harrison, Charles Holden, Edward Maufe, and Hubert Worthington. All but Holden and Maufe submitted photographs of their work, and the sub-committee then recommended Harrison, a decision confirmed after he was interviewed on 17 June 1938. At that time, Harrison had never worked in Britain: although he had qualified there, he had practised in Greece and Palestine. Indeed, the college seems to have been his only project in the country, and remains his best known work, along with his later University of Ghana. Harrison was not given any restrictions or limitations on style; Nuffield agreed to Harrison's appointment, but was not consulted on the architectural style of the college before Harrison started work. When Nuffield's donation was announced, it was reported that the \\"general idea\\" was that the college buildings should be sited behind gardens, similar to the memorial gardens at Christ Church, Oxford, so that those entering Oxford from the west would be faced with a \\"beautiful vista of well-planned gardens seen through railings\\"; this idea did not form part of Harrison's designs. After Harrison's preliminary studies, it became clear that the proposed site could not contain a college and an institute for social science research as planned; Nuffield agreed to provide an additional plot of land on the opposite side of Worcester Street. Harrison proposed to build the college on the main site, with the institute on the second site. The hall was to be at the east end...

What is the use of banning 500 and 1000 rupee notes and introducing new 500 and 2000 rupee notes? Choose your answer. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? OPTIONS: [a]. no [b]. yes","response":"[a]. No Let me explain both questions and their respective answers below: 1. What are the ill effects of demonetization of 500 and 1000 rupee notes in India? The Indian Government’s sudden announcement of demonetization of the existing ₹500 and ₹1000 currency notes on the night of November 8, 2016, came as a shock to many. The purpose of demonetization was to curb black money, counterfeit notes, and funding of terrorist activities. But, despite the positive intentions, demonetization had multitude ill effects on the Indian economy and its citizens: a. Economic slowdown: The abrupt withdrawal of 86% of the country's currency value in circulation caused a severe cash crunch, leading to a drop in consumer spending, reduced demand for goods and services, and consequently slowing down the economic growth. b. Unemployment: The short-term liquidity crunch impacted labor-intensive sectors like agriculture, textiles, and construction, which caused job losses and reduced income for daily wage earners. c. Disruption of informal sector: The informal sector, accounting for almost half of India's GDP and the majority of employment, was disproportionately affected. Workers in this sector rely heavily on cash transactions, and the lack of available cash disrupted their businesses. d. Impacts on agriculture: Farmers faced difficulties in buying seeds, fertilizers, and other essential agricultural inputs due to the cash crunch, leading to delays in sowing crops and overall agricultural productivity. e. Inconvenience and hardship for the general public: The sudden withdrawal of notes led to long queues outside banks and ATMs, causing severe inconvenience to citizens in their daily economic activities. The elderly and those living in remote areas were particularly hard hit. f. Strain on banking system: The massive demand for cash exchanges and withdrawals burdened banks with increased workload, leading to extended work hours and stress on employees. 2. What is the use of banning 500 and 1000 rupee notes and introducing new 500 and 2000 rupee notes? Demonetization in India involved the replacement of old ₹500 and ₹1000 notes with new ₹500 and ₹2000 notes. The Indian Government cited the following reasons for this decision: a. Curbing black money: By making the older notes illegal tender and requiring the exchange or deposit of old notes into bank accounts, the government aimed to flush out unaccounted wealth and reduce the stock of black money in the economy. b. Combating counterfeit currency: The older notes were more prone to counterfeiting, and the new ₹500 and ₹2000 notes featured better security measures, making it more difficult to fake. c. Striking at terrorist financing: Counterfeit notes were also often used to fund terrorist activities. By rendering the old notes worthless, the government hoped to disrupt the financing of such illegal activities. d. Encouraging digital transactions: With a cash crunch following demonetization, more people had to rely on digital payments and non-cash transactions. This eventually helped promote digital transactions and reduce the economy's reliance on cash. In conclusion, while both questions are related to the same event of demonetization, they are not paraphrases of each other, as the first one asks about the negative consequences, and the second one seeks clarification regarding the purpose and use of this policy."},{"question":"Summarize this article: Dale Heenan, Swindon Borough Council's cabinet member for Highways and Transport, faced a court summons after disputing the amount he owed. In his resignation letter to council leader David Renard, Mr Heenan admitted he \\"should not have allowed the issue to proceed so far\\". Mr Renard described the matter as \\"embarrassing\\" and \\"difficult\\". In a statement, Mr Heenan said he believed he was \\"entitled to raise questions about the amount being incorrect\\" and confirmed he has since paid it \\"in full\\". He added the public \\"is entitled to expect high standards from their elected representatives\\" and believes \\"the most honourable course of action\\" open to him is to \\"set an example\\" and resign as a cabinet member. David Renard agreed that Mr Heenan was right to resign and said: \\"It's quite clear that the situation isn't one that our councillors should get themselves into. \\"We expect all our residents to pay their tax on time and in full and Dale unfortunately fell below the standard that I and most people would expect.\\" Mr Heenan will remain a councillor for the borough's Covingham and Dorcan ward. His resignation came about after Private Eye released details gleaned from Freedom of Information requests of councillors across the country who failed to pay council tax. Only one summons was issued to a member of a Swindon Borough Council, for arrears of Â£981.62. Although the councillor is not named, in his resignation letter Mr Heenan said he was the councillor who \\"recent media coverage\\" concerned. Summary:","response":"So, you remember when you didn't clean up your toys and mommy told you that you must do it because it's your responsibility? This is like that, but for grown-ups. A man named Dale Heenan, who helps to make decisions about roads and buses in a place called Swindon, got in trouble because he didn't pay enough of something called council tax. This is money that adults have to give to help pay for things in their town, like schools and police. Dale said he thought he paid enough, but some people disagreed and took him to court. When more people found out about it, it was very embarrassing. Resulting from this, Dale decided to quit his job helping with the roads and buses, but he's still going to be in another role where he helps make decisions for the town. The boss of the council, David, said Dale did the right thing by stepping down because it's important for people in these roles to do everything properly and pay their taxes on time. A news report told everyone about this, and that's how we know Dale was the one who didn't pay his taxes right."},{"question":"Use evidence from the fact that cold temperatures cause animals to shiver to answer the following question.

Step 2: Understand the question - The question asks what Sydney might do next after scraping the cage with a piece of metal. Step 3: Evaluate the options - We have three options to choose from: A: cover their ears - While it's possible the sound of the piece of metal scraping against the cage could be loud, this option doesn't seem to be directly related to Sydney's action of scraping the cage. B: walk away from Sydney - This option could indicate that Sydney is trying to get someone's attention by scraping the cage or attempting to escape and would want to distance themselves from the action. It seems more reasonable compared to option A. C: talk to their captors - The context does not provide any indication that Sydney has access to or a desire to communicate with their captors.

Nature reserves may be designated by government institutions in some countries, or by private landowners, such as charities and research institutions, regardless of nationality. Nature reserves fall into different IUCN categories depending on the level of protection afforded by local laws. - Cousin Island is a small granitic island of the Seychelles, lying west of Praslin. It is a nature reserve protected under Seychelles law as a Special Reserve. It is managed by Nature Seychelles, a national nonprofit organization and Partner of BirdLife International, by which it has been identified as an Important Bird Area. - Constantine Walter Benson OBE (England, 2 February 1909 Cambridge, England, 21 September 1982) was a British ornithologist and author of over 350 publications. He is considered the last of a line of British Colonial officials that made significant contributions to ornithology. - A wildlife refuge, also called a wildlife sanctuary, is a naturally occurring sanctuary, such as an island, that provides protection for species from hunting, predation or competition; it is a protected area, a geographic territory within which wildlife is protected. - Hunting is the practice of killing or trapping animals, or pursuing or tracking them with the intent of doing so. Hunting wildlife or feral animals is most commonly done by humans for food, recreation, to remove predators that are dangerous to humans or domestic animals, or for trade. Lawful hunting is distinguished from poaching, which is the illegal killing, trapping or capture of the hunted species. The species that are hunted are referred to as game or prey and are usually mammals and birds. - The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) is a British public service broadcaster. It is headquartered at Broadcasting House in London, is the world's oldest national broadcasting organisation, and is the largest broadcaster in the world by number of employees, with over 20,950 staff in total, of whom 16,672 are in public sector broadcasting; including part-time, flexible as well as fixed contract staff, the total number is 35,402. - Corals are marine invertebrates in the class Anthozoa of phylum Cnidaria.

At the United Kingdom Census 2011, its population was 123,867, including 24,488 students. - A research university is a university that expects all its tenured and tenure-track faculty to continuously engage in research, as opposed to merely requiring it as a condition of an initial appointment or tenure. Such universities can be recognized by their strong focus on innovative research and the prestige of their brand names. On the one hand, research universities strive to recruit faculty who are the most brilliant minds in their disciplines in the world, and their students enjoy the opportunity to learn from such experts. On the other hand, new students are often disappointed to realize their undergraduate courses at research universities are overly academic and fail to provide vocational training with immediate \\"real world\\" applications; but many employers value degrees from research universities because they know that such coursework develops fundamental skills like critical thinking. - The Comoros ('), officially the Union of the Comoros (Comorian: \\"Udzima wa Komori,\\" , '), is a sovereign archipelago island nation in the Indian Ocean located at the northern end of the Mozambique Channel off the eastern coast of Africa between northeastern Mozambique and northwestern Madagascar.

The religion of the majority of the population is Islam. - A television licence or broadcast receiving licence is an official record of payment required in many countries for the reception of television broadcasts, or the possession of a television set where some broadcasts are funded in full or in part by the licence fee paid. The licence is sometimes also required to own a radio or receive radio broadcasts. A TV licence is therefore effectively a hypothecated tax for the purpose of funding public broadcasting, thus allowing public broadcasters to transmit television programmes without, or with only supplemental, funding from radio and television advertisements. However, in some cases the balance between public funding and advertisements is the opposite - the Polish TVP broadcaster receives more funds from advertisements than from its TV tax. - A royal charter is a formal document issued by a monarch as letters patent, granting a right or power to an individual or a body corporate. They were, and are still, used to establish significant organisations such as cities (with municipal charters) or universities and learned societies. Charters should be distinguished from warrants and letters of appointment, as they have perpetual effect. Typically, a Royal Charter is produced as a high-quality work of calligraphy on vellum. The British monarchy has issued over 980 royal charters. Of these about 750 remain in existence. The earliest was to the town of Tain in 1066, making it the oldest Royal Burgh in Scotland, followed by the University of Cambridge in 1231. Charters continue to be issued by the British Crown, a recent example being that awarded to the Chartered Institute for the Management of Sport and Physical Activity, on 7 April 2011. - Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha is a British Overseas Territory located in the South Atlantic and consisting of the island of Saint Helena, Ascension Island and the archipelago of Tristan da Cunha. - Post-nominal letters, also called post-nominal initials, post-nominal titles or designatory letters, are letters placed after a person's name to indicate that that individual holds a position, academic degree, accreditation, office, military decoration, or honour, or is a member of a religious institute or fraternity. An individual may use several different sets of post-nominal letters, but in some contexts it may be customary to limit the number of sets to one or just a few. The order in which post-nominals are listed after a name is based on rules of precedence and what is appropriate for a given situation. Post-nominal letters are one of the main types of name suffix. In contrast, pre-nominal letters precede the name rather than following it. - Broadcasting House is the headquarters of the BBC, in Portland Place and Langham Place, London.

Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - Mainz is the capital and largest city of the state of Rhineland-Palatinate in Germany. It was the capital of the Electorate of Mainz at the time of the Holy Roman Empire. In antiquity Mainz was a Roman fort city which commanded the west bank of the Rhine and formed part of the northernmost frontier of the Roman Empire; it was founded as a military post by the Romans in the late 1st century BC and became the provincial capital of Germania Superior. The city is located on the river Rhine at its confluence with the Main opposite Wiesbaden, in the western part of the Frankfurt Rhine-Main; in the modern age, Frankfurt shares much of its regional importance. - An island country is a country whose primary territory consists of one or more islands or parts of islands. As of 2011, 46 (approximately 24%) of the 193 UN member states are island countries. - In an ecosystem, predation is a biological interaction where a predator (an organism that is hunting) feeds on its prey (the organism that is attacked). Predators may or may not kill their prey prior to feeding on them, but the act of predation often results in the death of the prey and the eventual absorption of the prey's tissue through consumption. Thus predation is often, though not always, carnivory. Other categories of consumption are herbivory (eating parts of plants), fungivory (eating parts of fungi), and detritivory (the consumption of dead organic material). All these consumption categories fall under the rubric of consumer-resource systems. It can often be difficult to separate various types of feeding behaviors. For example, some parasitic species prey on a host organism and then lay their eggs on it for their offspring to feed on it while it continues to live in or on its decaying corpse after it has died. The key characteristic of predation however is the predator's direct impact on the prey population.

Answer:","response":"\\"Sforza Castle\\" belongs to the category of a \\"building\\". Specifically, it is a historical building and a prominent landmark located in Milan, Italy. Constructed in the 15th century by Francesco Sforza, who was then the Duke of Milan, the castle served as the residence of the Sforza dynasty and subsequently witnessed a succession of occupants which included notable political and military figures. Initially built as a fort, this structure has undergone several renovations and modifications over the centuries. The castle now stands as a testament to the grandeur of Renaissance architecture. The structure boasts several towers, courtyards, and the surrounding walls which were traditionally used for defense purposes. It is surrounded by Parco Sempione, one of the largest parks in the city. In the early 20th century, the castle was transformed into a museum complex, housing collections of art, furniture, and artifacts from different periods. These galleries and museums include the Museum of Antique Art, the Museum of Musical Instruments, the Egyptian Museum, and the Pinacoteca del Castello Sforza containing an art collection. Its architectural beauty, historical significance, and extensive art collection make Sforza Castle a popular tourist destination and a cultural symbol of Milan. Despite the various uses it has seen over the years, the building's primary function is as a museum, making it not only a site of historic interest but also a significant player in the cultural and educational landscape. Therefore, while Sforza Castle is indeed a building, the multi-faceted roles it plays in Milan's cultural, historical, and educational sectors are what make it truly remarkable. The castle perfectly encapsulates the spirit of its city, representing both the rich history of Milan and its status as a vibrant center of Italian culture and arts."},{"question":"News article: At first blush, Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer seemed to be defying the federal government once again on Wednesday night. The Republican governor signed an executive order saying Arizona had no plans to give government benefits, including drivers licenses, to the tens of thousands of young, undocumented immigrants in that state who would be getting work permits and immunity from deportation under President Obama’s new immigration policy. But while the order sounded harsh, at least one high-ranking Democrat in Arizona quickly threw cold water on it, saying Brewer’s declaration appears to be little more than hot air. “It doesn’t seem to really do anything,” state Senate Democratic Leader David Schapira told TPM. “I see it as her once again trying to grandstand on the issue of immigration.” The order came the same week that the Obama administration began rolling out a program to bring undocumented young people out of the shadows and give them the ability to work and do things like pay taxes. Known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the program had youths lining up throughout the nation to find out how to apply for it. Brewer, who signed Arizona’s harsh immigration law known as SB 1070 and who has butted heads with Obama on immigration multiple times, said her executive order was a direct response to the president’s program. But whether that response actually changes the way Arizona will deal with the program is another matter. Schapira pointed out that Arizona already had a number of strict immigration laws in place, including one that barred illegal immigrants from getting drivers licenses or state issued identification cards. The law may have already been interpreted to bar any newly immune immigrants from getting those state IDs, Schapira said. That means Brewer’s order effectively carried no weight at all. Even the governor admitted at a news conference late in the day that nothing really changed because of her order. “It actually is no different than what was already in place,” Brewer said. She also struggled to describe her action on a conservative talk radio show in Phoenix, saying it was only meant to guide state workers on how to handle the situation. “It was an order to clarify where Arizona stands on this position so there would be no confusion for the directors of my agencies,” the governor said in the phone interview with KFYI’s Mike Broomhead. Later in the same conversation, she stumbled when describing what role the state would play under the president’s new program. “We will issue an employment authorization card to these people,” Brewer said, then paused as if listening to somebody in the background. “The feds will, yeah, the feds will.” After the order was issued, Alessandra Soler, the Arizona director of the American Civil Liberties Union, said the whole thing made it look as if Brewer didn’t really understand the law in the first place. “This is yet another reason why Arizona has no business trying to regulate immigration matters,” Soler said in a written statement. Yet she also added that the ACLU believes neither Brewer’s order nor the current Arizona laws will bar the newly documented young immigrants from getting state issued IDs. “This order conflicts with state and federal law because people who are granted deferred action will, in fact, have authorized presence in the United States and under Arizona law people who have authorized presence are eligible to apply for Arizona state identification,” Soler said. Regardless, other immigration activists and people involved in politics told TPM it was too soon to know for sure whether Brewer’s order would change anything. They said immigration attorneys would be looking at the language in the coming days to figure out what, if anything, comes next. Listen to Brewer’s appearance on KFYI in Phoenix. ||||| Bloomberg News Young immigrants authorized to work in the U.S. under a new federal program won’t be able to get driver’s licenses in Arizona. Republican Governor Jan Brewer issued an executive order saying state law bars benefits or state-issued identification for those in the country illegally -- including those who qualify for the deferred-enforcement program announced by President Barack Obama in June, which kicked off yesterday. She directed agencies to block access for an estimated 80,000 immigrants in Arizona who may qualify. Brewer’s order came as thousands of young illegal immigrants lined up around the U.S. seeking information about work permits and a possible two-year deferment of deportation, including 11,000 who came to Navy Pier in Chicago to meet with volunteer lawyers, the Chicago Tribune reported. The program is open to those who were brought to the U.S. before age 16, have been in the country at least five years and who graduate from high school or serve in the military, among other criteria. The policy may benefit as many as 1.7 million people age 30 and under, according to estimates from the Pew Hispanic Center. The report said that 950,000 people would be eligible immediately and another 770,000 people in the future as they meet the criteria set by the president. Defend Arizona Obama’s policy bypassed Congress, where legislation known as the Dream Act designed to give a path to legal status for younger illegal immigrants has been stalled. It also pushed the issue back into Obama’s campaign with presumptive Republican nominee Mitt Romney, who has opposed the measure. Romney has said he would “put in place my own long-term solution.” In her executive order, Brewer said federal documents issued under the new program won’t prove lawful status and permitting state-issued identification or benefits to recipients would “have significant and lasting impacts on the Arizona budget.” The governor’s spokesman, Matthew Benson, said Brewer is seeking to defend her state. “The governor can’t undo what the president has done, but she can take a stand for state law,” Benson said. “By no definition are these individuals lawfully present or lawfully authorized to be in the United States. All they have received is a deferral from being prosecuted or deported.” Into Court The American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona disagrees with the governor, said Executive Director Alessandra Soler. State law allows driver’s licenses for others authorized by the federal government to be in the U.S., including people here on political asylum, she said. “The definitive action on this will be decided in a courtroom,” Senate Democratic Leader David Schapira said at a press briefing. In other states, officials are evaluating whether young people admitted under the program qualify for driver’s licenses or identification. Michigan will accept the federal documentation, said Fred Woodhams, spokesman for the secretary of state. California will treat those in the new program as “temporary legal residents” and issue licenses, according to the San Jose Mercury News. Driver’s licenses aren’t the only issue. In Florida, students in the program will pay out-of-state tuition, Florida State University System spokeswoman Diane McCain said. Benson, Brewer’s spokesman, said Arizona law prohibits in-state tuition for undocumented immigrants, including those in this program. Waiting to Drive At Arizona’s Capitol, a few dozen young immigrants and supporters today held signs such as “Brewer, why the hate?” Carla Chavarria, a 19-year-old illegal immigrant from Scottsdale, remembers feeling left out in high school when friends started getting driver’s licenses. She was hoping to get one if she is admitted to the new program. “They don’t let us have a victory,” said Chavarria, who runs an advertising and graphics design business and was brought to the country at age 7. She said that Brewer was “like a bully -- you got up from the playground and I am going to push you down again.” The program’s inception has created a flurry of action in immigrant communities. Amanda Bergson-Shilcock, director of outreach and program evaluation at the Welcoming Center for New Pennsylvanians, a Philadelphia-based organization, said immigrant groups have been holding information sessions for two months. “There’s a lot of trepidation,” she said. People wonder, “How do I get this exactly right so I don’t lose my once in a lifetime chance?” Answering Questions In Florida, a two-hour phone bank answering questions yesterday received about 500 calls, said Natalia Jaramillo, spokeswoman for Miami-based Florida Immigration Coalition. The Ohio chapter of the American Immigration Lawyers Association is setting up a free clinic in Cleveland on Aug. 18, said David Leopold, an immigration attorney. “People are saying, ‘I can stand up and be somebody in this society now,’” Leopold said in a telephone interview. “It’s just wonderful to see such hope.” Eduardo Resendez said he was 16 when he, his mother and younger sister left their home in Mexico City, crossed the Texas border and made their way to the Bronx in New York City, where his father was already living. Resendez, now 22, is on a path to get working papers, he said in a telephone interview today. Already in the midst of getting a bachelor’s degree in music from the City University of New York, being allowed to work legally would mean fulfilling his dream of being a high- school music teacher. “Before this, I knew I wouldn’t be able to teach in the U.S., so my plan was to go back to Mexico when I graduated,” Resendez said. “Now, that plan has changed. I’ll be able to stay with my family. That’s one of the greatest things that will happen.” To contact the reporters on this story: Amanda J.

We can teach boys and girls based on what we now know.\\" Male and female eyes are not organized in the same way,he explains. The composition of the male eye makes it sensitive to motion and direction. \\" Boys interpret the world as objects moving through space,\\" he says. The male eye is also drawn to cooler color1s like silver and black. It's no accident that boys tend to create pictures of moving objects instead of drawing the happy color1ful family,as girls do in class. The female eye,on the other hand,is drawn to warmer color1s like red, yellow and orange. To attract girls, Chadwell says, the teacher doesn't need to move as much as in boys' class. Using descriptive phrases and lots of color1s in presentations or on the blackboard gets their attention. Boys and girls also hear differently. \\" When someone speaks in a loud tone,girls interpret it as yelling, \\" says Chadwell. \\" They think you're mad and can shut down. \\" Girls are more sensitive to sounds. He advises girls' teachers to watch the tone of their voices. Boys' teachers should sound more forceful, even excited. A boy's nervous system causes him to be more cautious when he is standing, moving, and the room temperature is around 6.Stress in boys,he says, tends to increase blood flow to their brains, a process that helps them stay focused. Girls are more focused when they are seated in a warmer room around 75degF. Girls also respond to stress differently. When exposed to threat and conflict, blood goes to their guts ,leaving them feeling nervous or anxious.

Ten nuclear warheads are loaded onto a train and sent to a separate site for dismantling. However, a high-ranking Russian general, Aleksander Kodoroff, has other plans. Along with a rogue tactical unit, he kills all the soldiers onboard the train and then transfers nine of the warheads to another train. He also sets the timer on the one remaining warhead, then switches tracks to send his train out of harm's way and the transport train on a collision course with a passenger train. Inside a mountain tunnel, Kodoroff kills one of his high-ranking lieutenants who'd had reservations about the mission. A few minutes later the trains collide. The thermonuclear warhead goes off moments later, yielding a blast about 500 kilotons in intensity.

Then Suzanne pointed out, \\"It's good, but how can you clear away the fear of height?\\" \\"I've got it worked out, \\" I replied bravely. \\"We're going to the indoor climbing center. \\" While I was going up the high wall, I was afraid to look down as if a terrible animal was after me. Some time later, as I reached the ground, I sat down heavily on the floor. Later that night, as I lay in bed, I encouraged myself, \\"You've climbed the wall! You'll certainly make it! \\" We set off with our packages to the Grand Canyon. When we reached it, I found the canyon was a huge black hole--far deeper than I had imagined. As the guide clipped me onto the rope, _ . Time lost all meaning as I pushed my body forward. Only the strong rope kept me from losing hope. I began to think it would never end when everyone had stopped. \\"This is as far as we go, and we can climb out after a few steps, \\" the guide said finally. Two and a half hours later, we returned to the car park at last. I began to shake, one hard step after another. Getting onto the bus, I fell into the seat I had left so confidently a lifetime before. Then, while I was in the seat catching my breath, a feeling of happiness spread through me. I had done it, at the age of 66. ,. Options: A Supportive. B Doubtful. C Confident. D Satisfied.

A) Supportive B) Doubtful C) Confident D) Satisfied"},{"question":"Sentence: \\"The president appointed press secretary to Smith.\\" Would a linguist rate this sentence to be acceptable linguistically? Select from: (I) unacceptable (II) acceptable","response":"I would rate this sentence as (II) acceptable from a linguistic standpoint, but it may require clarification for some listeners or readers. The sentence possesses the necessary components to demonstrate a complete thought, including a subject (the president), verb (appointed), direct object (press secretary), and indirect object (Smith). The parts of speech are used correctly, and the sentence adheres to typical subject-verb-object (SVO) word order in the English language. Moreover, there is no glaring issue with grammar, syntax, or semantics. However, it is essential to note that this rating does not preclude any ambiguity in the sentence. The primary concern here is the usage of \\"press secretary\\" and \\"Smith.\\" The phrasing could imply that the president appointed Smith as the press secretary or that they assigned one press secretary to Smith, who might have another position. The sentence's ambiguity could be clarified by adding the appropriate preposition or rephrasing the sentence structure. If the sentence is meant to convey that the president appointed Smith as the press secretary, it could be revised to: \\"The president appointed Smith as the press secretary\\" or \\"The president made Smith the press secretary.\\" Alternatively, if the sentence aims to express that the president assigned a press secretary to Smith, who holds another position, it could be restructured as: \\"The president appointed a press secretary for Smith\\" or \\"The president assigned a press secretary to Smith.\\" In conclusion, while a linguist may rate the sentence as acceptable, it may still benefit from additional context or revision to avoid any potential confusion or misinterpretation."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: - Some scientists believe that releasing too much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere is one of the causes of global warming - This upsets the balance of the carbon cycle - The ozone layer helps protect us from harmful rays from the sun - It is getting damaged from air pollution such as methane gas from livestock and CFCs from spray cans - Acid rain is created when gasses such as sulfur dioxide get high into the atmosphere - The wind can blow these gasses for miles and then they get washed out of the air when it rains - This rain is called acid rain and can damage forests and kill fish.

Using skeletal muscle in this way increases its size and strength. In exercises such as running, the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more blood. Using cardiac muscle in this way increases its strength and efficiency. Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles. If you don’t use a muscle, it will get smaller and weaker—so use it or lose it. Paragraph: Two groups of soldiers started different training programs. Blue group did weight training for 3 months, while Brown group ran 3 miles a day for three months. The Captain observed different results on each group. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which group didn't increase the efficiency of their cardiac muscle as much as the other group? A:","response":"Based on the background information provided, the Blue group, which focused on weight training for 3 months, did not increase the efficiency of their cardiac muscle as much as the Brown group, which ran 3 miles a day for three months. This is because running is an aerobic exercise that specifically involves the use of the cardiac muscle, leading to its increased strength and efficiency, while weight training primarily targets the skeletal muscle."},{"question":"Teacher:In this task you are given a sentence with one coordinating conjunction (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, and so).

To find out how many bars Aleena has, subtract 2 from Legacy's number of bars: 5 (Legacy's bars) - 2 = 3 (Aleena's bars) Aleena has 3 gold bars. Step 2: Determine the total combined number of gold bars. Since Legacy has 5 gold bars and Aleena has 3 gold bars, to find the total number of gold bars, add the number of bars each person has together: 5 (Legacy's bars) + 3 (Aleena's bars) = 8 (Total bars) Together, they have a total of 8 gold bars. Step 3: Calculate the total value of their combined gold bars. Now, we know that each gold bar is worth 2200. To find the total value of the 8 combined gold bars, multiply the number of bars by the value of each bar: 8 (Total bars) × 2200 (Value per bar) = 17,600 The total value of the gold bars is 17,600."},{"question":"despite improvements, there are still units that affect the group's result negatively.

Claiming a person can't do their job because of their race is sort of like the textbook definition of racism.\\" But he did not retract his endorsement of Trump, made last week, and he said he does not believe Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton is \\"the answer.\\" Ryan made his comments during an appearance at a women's shelter in Washington, D.C. In a New York Times interview, Graham, also a former presidential candidate, said Trump's remarks were \\"the most un-American thing from a politician since Joe McCarthy,\\" referring to the ultra-conservative senator of the 1950s who fueled fears of widespread communist subversion in the United States. Graham also suggested that Republicans who have endorsed Trump reconsider their choice. \\"If anybody was looking for an off-ramp, this is probably it,\\" he said.

In Spain at the time, when there was nudity involved, the filmmakers shot two versions, one with clothes and one with out. The fully uncut English dubbed export print was titled WEREWOLF NEVER SLEEPS and seems to have been released to home video only in Sweden back in the 80's. It can be found on Ebay and the likes and comes highly recommended. My guess is Avco cut the film down for a R rated release that never happened. In 1974 it was released by Avco to television titled FURY OF THE WOLFMAN and the clothed version was used for this TV print. Cut to 12 years later and FURY OF THE WOLFMAN pops up on home video on the Charter label. This version appears to be what Avco was going to release back in '73. It's the uncovered version, with some nudity that would never pass on TV or in a PG movie. There are several scenes on the Charter tape that play out with nudity that are clothed in the TV print ( the source for all those dollar Dud's and VHS editions ). But a comparison to the fully uncut WOLFMAN NEVER SLEEPS reveals that 2 scenes are cut on this version! ( spoilers in next paragraph ) The scene where Ilona has Waldermar chained to the wall and whips him after he transforms into the werewolf is incomplete. After whipping him into submission, she starts to remove her clothes and begins making love to the werewolf!!! The werewolf responds positively to these sexual shenanigans too. This scene certainly ranks as one of the most unusual in the history of horror films and is a delirious treat. It's not graphic but the implied bestiality was too much for US audiences, or more likely the MPAA. Ilona is desperately in love with Waldemar and could not possess him, hence her whole scheme to mind control Waldermar's wife and involve her in an affair. She wanted to wreck his marriage, and she accomplishes this while Waldemar is in Tibet. Unfortunately he returns a werewolf, but this does not slow her down a bit. If she can't physically have him as a man, she loves him enough to have sex with him as a werewolf. This also helps explain the later scene where the werewolf beds down with a woman he spots getting naked before bedtime while peeping through her window. This scene is presented sans nudity in the covered version and really makes no sense. In the uncut version, it would seem Ilona's affections have made the werewolf horny and in need of release, so he rapes the first woman he can after escaping. The other cut is a complete scene of Waldemar in bed with Karen and she is seen naked. A very similar bedroom scene was cut out of the US version of WEREWOLF SHADOW ( WEREWOLF VS THE VAMPIRE WOMAN ) as well. The film does have it's problems though, for certain. The director was drunk, the bad stand in for the werewolf at points, the atrocious English dubbing, the inclusion of sequences from the first Waldemar film MARK OF THE WOLFMAN aka FRANKENSTEIN'S BLOODY TERROR and the grotesque overuse of that film's music score throughout etc, but seen in it's original widescreen format and uncut ( ie: WEREWOLF NEVER SLEEPS ) it is one of the wildest and most outrageous of the Daninsky werewolf series, with a plot line unmatched in it's everything but the kitchen sink approach. The cut / clothed pan and scan full screen copies of this film do it no favors, and unfortunately that's the version almost everyone commenting on the film have seen. The film carries a 1970 copyright, and I'd bet the 1972 release date on the IMDb is incorrect. The film precedes WEREWOLF SHADOW ( aka WEREWOLF VS THE VAMPIRE WOMAN ) in the series and was certainly released before WEREWOLF SHADOW. The ending of WEREWOLF NEVER SLEEPS / FURY OF THE WOLFMAN dovetails directly into the opening of WEREWOLF SHADOW, offering concrete evidence of this. Sadly a complete version of this may never get a decent release. A perfect release would be the uncut English version but in Spanish with English subtitles. The English dubbing severely hurts the movie. But any Spanish language version would reflect the covered version as shown in Spain during the Franco era, where nudity was verboten. What is the sentiment of this review?","response":"The sentiment of this review is mixed. The reviewer acknowledges the movie's flaws, such as the drunk director, poor dubbing, and overuse of music score from another film, but they also express appreciation for the uncut version (WEREWOLF NEVER SLEEPS) and its wild and outrageous plot line. The reviewer seems to suggest that any negative reception the film has received is mainly due to the release of the cut and covered versions, which do not do justice to the original film. They appear to wish for an ideal release with the uncut English version but in Spanish with English subtitles, which might not ever happen."},{"question":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

In this case, it implies that there are people who are not part of the stall's staff, but rather are there to look around, explore, or engage with the display in some manner. 2. Browse: This word is a verb that denotes the action being performed by the subject. It emphasizes the casual and exploratory nature of the interaction between the visitors and the books. Browsing indicates that the visitors are not necessarily there with a specific purpose or looking for a certain item, but instead are taking their time as they flip through and examine various books. 3. Books: This word serves as the object of the action (browsing) and provides context by specifying what exactly the visitors are engaged with. In this sentence, the books represent the primary focus of interest for the visitors at the stall. 4. Stall: This word adds essential spatial information to the sentence, describing the location where this interaction between the visitors and the books takes place. It suggests an informal and temporary setup, which could be part of a larger event such as a market, fair, or exhibition. 5. Friday: This word indicates the time when this event takes place. Including the day, \\"Friday\\" establishes a temporal context, but it could also imply that this event is part of a weekly or regular occurrence, or perhaps that it takes place during a special event held on that day in a particular venue or locale.

To snap a whip. The pipe snapped.","response":"First, let's examine the meaning of the word \\"snap\\" in both sentences: 1. To snap a whip: In this context, the word \\"snap\\" refers to the action of making the whip move quickly, causing a cracking sound. This is the result of the whip's tip breaking the sound barrier. The definition of \\"snap\\" in this case can be considered as \\"to make something produce a sharp cracking sound by moving it quickly\\". 2. The pipe snapped: In this context, the word \\"snap\\" refers to the action of the pipe suddenly breaking or fracturing. This definition can be considered as \\"to break or cause something to break suddenly and completely, typically with a sharp cracking sound\\". Now, let's compare the two meanings: In both cases, the word \\"snap\\" conveys some level of suddenness and is associated with a sharp cracking sound. However, there is a difference in the nature of the action in both sentences. In the first sentence, \\"snap\\" refers to the action of deliberately causing a sound by manipulating an object (the whip). In the second sentence, \\"snap\\" refers to an unintended or unexpected breakage of the object (the pipe). In conclusion, even though the word \\"snap\\" shares some similarities in both contexts, it has a slightly different meaning in each sentence. Therefore, it does not have the exact same meaning in these two sentences."},{"question":"Translate \\"Background issues\\" to French?","response":"In French, \\"Background issues\\" can be translated as \\"Problèmes d'arrière-plan\\".

Let's begin by adding the numbers -328 and 273: -328 + 273 = -55 Now our equation looks like this: -5 * h - 55 = 0 Next, we need to get rid of the -55. To do that, we'll add 55 to both sides of the equation: -5 * h - 55 + 55 = 0 + 55 This simplifies to: -5 * h = 55 Now we are almost there! We just need to find out what h is. To do that, we'll divide both sides of the equation by -5: (-5 * h) / -5 = 55 / -5 This will give us the value of h: h = -11 So the answer to the math problem is h = -11."},{"question":"Generate a question that has the following answer: To find her father with only a photo of him. for the following movie plot: Mexico[edit] Priciliano, the first boy introduced in the story, has a very strong bond with his father.

Stream-of-consciousness explanation: When thinking about allergies, especially nut allergies, it's essential to understand how they work and the dangers associated with exposure to allergens. Nut allergies, such as peanut allergies, are one of the most common types of food allergies. They occur when the immune system mistakenly identifies specific proteins in nuts as harmful and mounts a defense against them. This reaction can lead to mild symptoms such as hives, itching, or digestive issues and can even cause severe, life-threatening reactions referred to as anaphylaxis. As peanuts are one of the most common triggers for nut allergies, it is crucial to take this into consideration. While some people may have a higher tolerance for peanuts than others, it's generally risky for individuals with a nut allergy to consume peanuts. This is due to the potential severity of the allergic reaction that could occur. Moreover, the reactions can worsen over time, and small amounts of peanuts can pose danger. Various alternatives to peanuts are available for those suffering from a nut allergy, such as seeds and certain types of non-nut butter. However, one should always check the ingredients and labels on food items to ensure they are free from allergens, as cross-contamination can occur during production. Furthermore, it's highly recommended for individuals with a nut allergy to carry an epinephrine auto-injector (EpiPen) in case of accidental exposure to nuts and to consult with medical professionals for proper guidance on managing their allergy. In conclusion, the answer to the question of whether it's safe for a person with a nut allergy to consume peanuts without any risk of an allergic reaction is \\"no.\\" The risk of severe and potentially life-threatening complications is substantial, and avoiding peanuts and other nut-containing foods is the ideal solution for someone with a nut allergy."},{"question":"Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: How to Turn a Gliding Car into a Flying Car","response":"Alright, little buddy! Imagine you have a car that can glide, like a paper airplane, and you want to make it fly high in the sky like a bird. To do this, you can choose between two ideas: 1) Add wings and propellers: You can give your gliding car big wings like an airplane and put spinning propellers (like fans) on it. These will help keep the car high in the sky as it moves forward. Then you add a strong engine to make the propellers really fast, so they can lift the car off the ground and help it fly just like an airplane. It's a cool idea, right? 2) Add powerful jets: You can add strong, super-fast jet engines to your gliding car, kind of like a rocket. These big engines will push your car through the air with a lot of force, making it soar high in the sky like a superhero. This way your car can go really fast and high, even though it doesn't have wings like an airplane. Both of these ideas can help your car fly, but the first one with wings and propellers is probably a little safer and more practical. The second idea, with powerful jets, might be faster, but it needs a lot more energy and could be more difficult to control. So, I think the first option is better for turning your gliding car into a flying car. You can imagine it like giving your favorite toy car wings and a super-fast fan to make it fly in the air.

The statement in question is: \\"The meeting isn't meant to confirm any information.\\" Step 3: Compare the purpose of the closeout meeting to the statement in question. The purpose of the closeout meeting, as described earlier, is to ensure a full understanding of the gathered information and its relevance.

Rankin's creation is now being celebrated in Rebusfest, a weekend of events including an exhibition at the Writer's Room in Edinburgh. As well as the agent's letter, the exhibition also features the original manuscript for Knots and Crosses, which was typed in his Edinburgh student flat when he was a 24-year-old PhD student. Rankin told BBC Scotland the plot came before the character of Rebus. He had the idea for a novel in which someone was being sent picture puzzles but the character's memory had blocked out what they were supposed to mean. \\"I wrote in my notes 'the main character may be a cop',\\" Rankin says. \\"He pretty much sprung from that. I gave him the name Rebus because it means picture puzzle and he is being sent picture puzzles. \\"I thought that was a clever thing to do. \\"It's not really a Scottish name. I found out later it is a Polish name. He's got Polish roots. I didn't find that out until book 15.\\" Rankin says he never set out to be a crime writer. \\"I didn't read much crime fiction, I just got the idea for a story when I was 24 years old and I had to write the story. \\"I had an agent and she sent the book to six, mainly London, publishers and five immediately turned it down. \\"In the letter I have got here at the exhibition she is waiting to hear from the sixth and thank goodness they took it. \\"If they hadn't then Knots and Crosses would have gone into the bottom drawer and stayed there and Rebus would have gone in to the bottom drawer as well.\\" Rebus was not only fortunate to make it into print but he was also lucky to survive the first novel. Rankin originally killed him off. \\"At the end of the first book, because I thought I was only going to write one book about this guy, in the first draft he was shot and killed. \\"Spoiler alert - for whatever reason I brought him back. I thought I'll injure but I won't kill him.\\" Rankin says he can't find the original ending of Knots and Crosses, he thinks it might have been eaten by mice when he stored all his records in his attic. After the first Rebus novel, Rankin wrote a spy novel and a thriller. He only came back to the curmudgeonly detective after his editor said there was more that could be done with him. Rankin says: \\"I thought 'yes I want to explore Edinburgh in more depth and I want to use Edinburgh as a way of exploring Scotland'. A detective is a pretty good way of exploring society from top to bottom so he came back and he stayed.\\" The Rebusfest weekend will include all his favourite things - music, pubs and walking around Edinburgh. There will be a pub quiz and walking tours as well as discussion about the creation of the character. Rankin, who has just got back from book tours in the US, Germany, Australia and New Zealand, says wherever he goes people are interested in coming to the festival and seeing Rebus' Edinburgh. He says: \\"When Knots and Crosses was first published 30 years ago one of the first reviews said 'it is unlikely to be recommended by the Scottish tourist board'. \\"We have gone from that to there being an official Rebus walking tour and people coming to Edinburgh looking for his city. \\"We have come to realise now that tourists don't just come to Scotland looking for the traditional older cultural elements, they are looking to see what is the country now? \\"The Rebus books have always been about contemporary Scotland, reflecting back on the past but also looking at the country it could become.\\" Rankin says his famous detective would not have enjoyed a celebration of his life but the writer says it has been interesting to look back on the changes over the past 30 years. He says: \\"The extraordinary thing about looking back at that first novel is that it seems like an historical document, nobody has computers. \\"If Rebus wants to make a phone call he stops the car and finds a phone box that has not been vandalised. \\"The fax machine is a wee god that sits in the corner of then office and if a fax comes chugging out you immediately go over because it must be important.\\" He says the whole structure of the way police investigate crimes has changed, especially since the progress of DNA evidence. \\"The only thing that has not changed is Rebus,\\" Rankin says. What was that article about?","response":"The article is about the 30th anniversary of the publication of \\"Knots and Crosses,\\" the first book in the Inspector Rebus series by author Ian Rankin. The character of the no-nonsense cop, Rebus, is being celebrated in Rebusfest, a weekend of events and an exhibition in Edinburgh.

Here is a hypothesis: The Chinese new year is less significant that the Hindu new year. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","response":"When examining the given premise and hypothesis, it is important to first understand the context of each cultural celebration. Chithirai Vishu, the Hindu New Year, is celebrated primarily by Tamil Hindus, while the Chinese New Year is observed by the Chinese community worldwide. Each celebration maintains its unique customs, traditions, and significance within their respective cultures. The premise states that Chithirai Vishu (Hindu New Year) is more of a religious affair than the Chinese New Year, involving worship and prayers. On the other hand, the hypothesis suggests that the Chinese New Year holds less significance than the Hindu New Year. To evaluate the validity of this conclusion, we must analyze both celebrations in terms of their religious, cultural, and social importance. Chithirai Vishu (Hindu New Year): 1. Religious Significance: The festival marks the beginning of a new year in the Tamil calendar, and it is believed that Lord Brahma, the Hindu creator god, began the creation of the universe. The day is filled with religious rituals, prayers, and visits to temples. 2. Cultural Significance: Chithirai Vishu signifies the onset of spring and has strong cultural significance due to the importance of agriculture in ancient India. The day is celebrated with traditional food, music, and entertainment related to the Tamil culture. Chinese New Year: 1. Religious Significance: Though Chinese New Year has roots in ancient Chinese myths and legends, it is not primarily recognized as a religious festival. It is a mix of folk beliefs, customs, ancestor-worship, and Taoist and Buddhist practices. Its religious aspect is not as central as that of Chithirai Vishu, which revolves around worshiping specific gods. 2. Cultural Significance: Chinese New Year holds tremendous cultural importance for the Chinese as it signifies the beginning of a new lunar year, abundance, and is associated with the reunion of family members. Various traditions, such as cleaning homes, exchanging red envelopes (gifts), and elaborate decorations, are followed, reflecting Chinese customs and aesthetics. From the analysis, we gather that while Chithirai Vishu indeed largely focuses on religious aspects, the Chinese New Year incorporates a mix of religion, tradition, and social celebrations. As a result, religious significance may not be the most appropriate metric to evaluate the overall importance of these festivals in their respective communities. In conclusion, asserting that the Chinese New Year is less significant than the Hindu New Year as a whole, based solely on the context of religion, might not be accurate. It is crucial to recognize that cultural aspects, social interactions, and historical roots all contribute to a celebration's significance. Therefore, comparing their importance by merely considering their religious aspect may not lead to a comprehensive understanding or an accurate conclusion."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Information: - The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Toamasina ( Latin : Toamasinen ( sis ) ) is an archdiocese located in the city of Toamasina .

Which language is this?","response":"This text is in Finnish, a Uralic language primarily spoken in Finland and by Finnish communities in neighboring countries such as Sweden, Norway, Estonia, and Russia. Finnish is one of the two official languages of Finland, alongside Swedish, and has approximately 5 million native speakers. The text you provided, \\"Viittaan erityisesti myös tarkistukseen 16,\\" can be translated to English as \\"I especially also refer to amendment 16.\\" In this context, it appears that the speaker is referencing a specific amendment, numbered 16, within a document or proposal. Finnish language uses the Latin script, just like English, but features letters such as ä and ö, which are not part of the standard English alphabet. It has a unique grammar structure and does not belong to the Indo-European language family, which makes it quite different from other widely spoken European languages such as English, German, and French. The Finnish language's main features include vowel harmony, a case system, and the absence of a grammatical gender. Finnish has fifteen grammatical cases for nouns, which denote various relationships between words within a sentence. Vowel harmony is a feature where vowels in a word influence the choice of vowels in suffixes attached to the word, restricting them to a specific harmonic group. As there is no grammatical gender, Finnish uses a neutral pronoun \\"hän\\" to express both \\"he\\" and \\"she.\\" This characteristic makes Finnish a rather egalitarian language when it comes to gender. Finnish is not only a heritage language of about 5 million Finns but also a crucial aspect of their national and cultural identity. Finland's cultural treasures, such as the national epic poem Kalevala, are written in Finnish and have greatly influenced the country's literature, arts, and music. As a visitor or foreign learner, gaining even a basic understanding of Finnish can considerably enhance your appreciation of the vibrant culture, customs, and history of Finland."},{"question":"Q:I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

The crowd below sees him and calls the police. They isolate the area, with Dante Marcus (Titus Welliver) controlling the crowd, while Jack Dougherty (Edward Burns) tries to talk with Nick. However, Nick says he will only speak to negotiator Lydia Mercer (Elizabeth Banks), who is on a leave of absence after failing to convince a depressed policeman not to jump from the Brooklyn Bridge a month earlier.Lydia arrives at the hotel room and manages to acquire Nick's fingerprints from a cigarette they share. Dougherty has them analyzed and discovers that Nick is an ex-policeman who was arrested for stealing a 40-million diamond from businessman David Englander (Ed Harris). Nick has escaped from prison, where he was serving 25 years for the heist, after being allowed to attend his father's funeral a week earlier. Nick, however, says he is innocent and reveals that Englander used to employ cops to protect his multi-floor jewelry business. One day, while Nick was escorting Englander and the diamond, he was knocked unconscious by two men in ski masks. He awakened to find that Englander had framed him for stealing the diamond in order to get the insurance money, as he had lost his fortune during the stock market crisis.Unbeknownst to the police, Nick is merely distracting them while his brother Joey (Jamie Bell) and Joey's girlfriend Angie (Genesis Rodriguez) break into Englander's upper floor jewelry vault in the building across the street to steal the diamond and prove Nick's innocence.

Recording sessions began in New York in October 1965 with numerous backing musicians, including members of Dylan's live backing band, the Hawks. Though sessions continued until January 1966, they yielded only one track that made it onto the final album--\\"One of Us Must Know ( Recognizing Dylan's dissatisfaction with the progress of the recordings, producer Bob Johnston suggested that they move the sessions to Nashville. Johnston lived there and had extensive experience working with Nashville session musicians. He recalled how Dylan manager Albert Grossman, was hostile to the idea: \\"Grossman came up to me and said 'If you ever mention Nashville to Dylan again, you're gone.' I said, 'What do you mean?' He said, 'You heard me. We got a thing going here'\\". Despite Grossman's opposition, Dylan agreed to Johnston's suggestion, and preparations were made to record the album at Columbia's A Studio on Nashville's Music Row in February 1966. In addition to Kooper and Robertson, who accompanied Dylan from New York, Johnston recruited harmonica player, guitarist and bassist Charlie McCoy, guitarist Wayne Moss, guitarist and bassist Joe South, and drummer Kenny Buttrey. At Dylan's request, Johnston removed the baffles--partitions separating the musicians so that there was \\"an ambience fit for an ensemble\\". Buttrey credited the distinctive sound of the album to Johnston's re-arrangement of the studio, \\"as if we were on a tight stage, as opposed to playing in a big hall where you're ninety miles apart\\". Dylan had a piano installed in his Nashville hotel room which Kooper would play to help Dylan write lyrics. Kooper would then teach the tunes to the musicians before Dylan arrived for the sessions. On the first Nashville session, on February 14, Dylan successfully recorded \\"Visions of Johanna\\", which he had attempted several times in New York. Also recorded was a take of \\"4th Time Around\\" which made it onto the album and a take of \\"Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat\\" which did not. On February 15 the session began at 6 p.m. but Dylan simply sat in the studio working on his lyrics while the musicians played cards, napped and chatted. Finally, at 4 a.m., Dylan called the musicians in and outlined the structure of the song. Dylan counted off and the musicians fell in, as he attempted his epic composition \\"Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands\\". Kenny Buttrey recalled, \\"If you notice that record, that thing after like the second chorus starts building and building like crazy, and everybody's just peaking it up 'cause we thought, Man, this is it ... This is gonna be the last chorus and we've gotta put everything into it we can. And he played another harmonica solo and went back down to another verse and the dynamics had to drop back down to a verse kind of feel ... After about ten minutes of this thing we're cracking up at each other, at what we were doing. I mean, we peaked five minutes ago. Where do we go from here?\\" The finished song clocked in at 11 minutes, 23 seconds, and would occupy the entire fourth side of the album. The next session began similarly--Dylan spent the afternoon writing lyrics, and the session continued into the early hours of February 17, when the musicians began to record \\"Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again\\". After several musical revisions and false starts, the fourteenth take was the version selected for the album.

You must pick a flower.","response":"From the perspective of a linguist, the sentence \\"You must pick a flower.\\" is indeed a valid English sentence, both grammatically and syntactically. Let's analyze the sentence in detail to understand why it is considered valid. 1. Sentence structure: The sentence follows the Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) structure, which is one of the most common and acceptable sentence structures in the English language. The subject (\\"you\\") appears first, followed by the modal verb (\\"must\\") and then the main verb (\\"pick\\"). Finally, the object (\\"a flower\\") comes at the end of the sentence. 2. Pronoun: The subject of the sentence is the pronoun \\"you,\\" which can refer to either a singular person or a group of people. The use of the pronoun is appropriate, and it plays a significant role in conveying the meaning of the sentence. 3. Modal verb: The modal verb \\"must\\" modifies the main verb \\"pick.\\" It adds a sense of obligation or necessity to the action of picking a flower. Modal verbs are essential in the English language, as they enable the expression of various nuances such as obligation, permission, ability, probability, and others. 4. Verb: The verb in this sentence is \\"pick.\\" It is in the base form, which is commonly used after modal verbs. The verb \\"pick\\" is a transitive verb, meaning it takes an object (in this case, \\"a flower\\") to complete its meaning. The use of the verb \\"pick\\" is appropriate here. 5. Article: The indefinite article \\"a\\" precedes the noun \\"flower.\\" The article \\"a\\" is used because the noun refers to a non-specific flower, that is, any flower. When used this way, the indefinite article is grammatically correct and adds specificity to the noun. 6. Noun: The noun \\"flower\\" is the object of the verb \\"pick.\\" It is a common countable noun, which is why it can be preceded by the indefinite article \\"a.\\" The noun \\"flower\\" is appropriate in this context and correctly functions as the object of the sentence. In conclusion, when considering the basic components of the English language, such as sentence structure, pronouns, verbs, articles, and nouns, the sentence \\"You must pick a flower.\\" is judged to be a grammatically valid English sentence. It follows standard English sentence construction rules and effectively conveys a clear message to the reader or listener."},{"question":"Parents Mull Flu Vaccines Amid Shortage DENVER - While officials across the nation are urging healthy adults and schoolchildren to skip their annual flu shot, parents are mulling their options.

Given that f(x) = x^3 / (x^5 - 1), let's substitute 1/x for x: f(1/x) = (1/x)^3 / ((1/x)^5 - 1) Now, we need to simplify this expression: f(1/x) = (1^3 / x^3) / ((1^5 / x^5) - 1) f(1/x) = (1 / x^3) / ((1 / x^5) - 1) In order to combine the terms in the denominator, let's find a common denominator. Since the denominators are x^5 and 1, the common denominator is x^5: f(1/x) = (1 / x^3) / ((1 - x^5) / x^5) Now we can simplify by inverting the denominator and multiplying: f(1/x) = (1 / x^3) * (x^5 / (1 - x^5)) f(1/x) = x^2 / (1 - x^5) Now let's express f(1/x) in terms of f(x). We know that f(x) = x^3 / (x^5 - 1), so: f(1/x) = x^3 / (1 - x^5) * -1 Multiplying both numerator and denominator by -1, we get: f(1/x) = -x^3 / (x^5 - 1) Now, we can see that f(1/x) = -f(x), which corresponds to option (A).

Sometimes, the juries in local and state courts get it wrong, and the Justice Department must step in and make it right.

In","response":"response to the growing concerns surrounding jury decisions in high-profile cases, legislators and legal experts in Southern California are considering implementing new measures to ensure fair and unbiased trials. Potential changes may include more rigorous juror screening processes, additional jury instruction, and alternating the locations of high-profile trials to avoid potential influences from local communities. Critics argue that such measures may only slow down the already lengthy legal process and potentially infringe on defendants' rights to a fair trial. However, proponents believe that addressing the apparent discrepancies in juror deliberations, particularly in high-stakes cases, is necessary to maintain public faith in the justice system and to prevent further incidents of civil unrest. As the debate continues, several committees have been established to review recent high-profile acquittals and analyze juror behavior. These committees aim to identify patterns, biases, and areas for improvement in the current jury system. Their findings and recommendations will ultimately guide future policy changes in the legal system. In conclusion, while jury decisions in high-profile cases in Southern California have sparked various concerns, governments and legal experts are now actively working on potential solutions to address these issues. Whether these changes will improve the quality of jury decisions and restore public confidence in the justice system remains to be seen."},{"question":"How does the sentence end? See options at the end When Tanya asked Emily questions about the dead cat found at the corner of the park, Select from: 1. Tanya had strong evidence already.; 2. Emily had strong evidence already.;","response":"When Tanya asked Emily questions about the dead cat found at the corner of the park, Tanya had strong evidence already. From the beginning, Tanya had suspicions about Emily's possible involvement in the death of the cat. With her deep-seated belief in animal rights and her experience with investigating similar cases, Tanya started building a case against Emily. She began by collecting evidence, speaking with various eye-witnesses, and analyzing the crime scene. The witnesses at the park had given consistent accounts of seeing Emily near the dead cat. Some of them even claimed they saw her carrying a suspicious bag at the time the cat went missing. However, Tanya knew she needed concrete proof before confronting Emily. Tanya then sought help from a local veterinarian, who was able to examine the deceased cat and give more information about the cause of death. The veterinarian explained that the cat had ingested some form of poison. Suddenly, the pieces started falling into place, and Tanya wondered if the suspicious bag Emily was carrying contained the lethal substance. Further investigation led Tanya to discover Emily's motive for poisoning the cat. Tanya found out that Emily had a long-standing feud with the cat's owner, which fueled her theory that Emily could have committed the act as an act of revenge stemming from this unresolved dispute. With this newly found evidence, Tanya decided to confront Emily. She began by asking her questions about the dead cat, hoping to gain insight into her motives and actions. However, Tanya was cautious not to expose the extent of her findings at the outset, instead opting to observe Emily's responses to her questions. Initially, Emily feigned ignorance and claimed to have no knowledge about the cat's death. However, as Tanya continued to inquire and subtly hinted at her knowledge of the feud with the cat's owner, Emily's confidence waned, and her responses became more evasive. While Emily never directly admitted to her involvement in the death of the cat, her reactions and responses to Tanya's questions only served to solidify Tanya's initial suspicions. Encouraged by the evidence she had amassed, Tanya planned to present her findings to the authorities, with the hope that they would launch a formal investigation into the matter. In summary, Tanya's thorough inquiry and strong evidence led her to confront Emily about the dead cat found at the corner of the park. This confrontation brought to light Emily's potential involvement, motives, and actions, ultimately paving the way for an eventual investigation by the proper authorities. The sentence perfectly encapsulates Tanya's preparedness and determination to uncover the truth behind the cat's tragic demise."},{"question":"Create a set of triples that describes the content in the following sentence.

Ever since the Islamist regime came to power in Khartoum, the United States and other Western governments had pressed it to stop providing a haven for terrorist organizations. Other governments in the region, such as those of Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and even Libya, which were targets of some of these groups, added their own pressure. At the same time, the Sudanese regime began to change. Though Turabi had been its inspirational leader, General Omar al Bashir, president since 1989, had never been entirely under his thumb. Thus as outside pressures mounted, Bashir's supporters began to displace those of Turabi. The attempted assassination in Ethiopia of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in June 1995 appears to have been a tipping point. The would-be killers, who came from the Egyptian Islamic Group, had been sheltered in Sudan and helped by Bin Laden. When the Sudanese refused to hand over three individuals identified as involved in the assassination plot, the UN Security Council passed a resolution criticizing their inaction and eventually sanctioned Khartoum in April 1996. A clear signal to Bin Laden that his days in Sudan were numbered came when the government advised him that it intended to yield to Libya's demands to stop giving sanctuary to its enemies. Bin Laden had to tell the Libyans who had been part of his Islamic army that he could no longer protect them and that they had to leave the country. Outraged, several Libyan members of al Qaeda and the Islamic Army Shura renounced all connections with him. Bin Laden also began to have serious money problems. International pressure on Sudan, together with strains in the world economy, hurt Sudan's currency. Some of Bin Laden's companies ran short of funds. As Sudanese authorities became less obliging, normal costs of doing business increased. Saudi pressures on the Bin Laden family also probably took some toll. In any case, Bin Laden found it necessary both to cut back his spending and to control his outlays more closely.

They wanted to cause trouble and hurt people. They stayed in a place called Sudan, where the leaders there let them stay. But other countries, like the United States, didn't like that and asked Sudan to stop letting them stay there. Sudan started to change and listen to those other countries. One day, when some people from Bin Laden's group tried to hurt Egypt's leader, lots of countries got angry with Sudan. The United Nations, which is like a big group of countries that work together, told Sudan they were doing something wrong. Sudan then realized they needed to make Bin Laden and his group leave. Bin Laden also started to run out of money and had to spend less. This made it hard for him and his group to stay in Sudan or keep doing bad things.

Edmund Sharpe was born on 31 October 1809 at Brook Cottage, Brook Street in Knutsford, Cheshire, the first child of Francis and Martha Sharpe. His father, a peripatetic music teacher and organist at Knutsford parish church, came from Stamford in Lincolnshire. At the time of marriage his wife, Martha Whittaker, was on the staff of an academy for young ladies, Belvedere House, in Bath, Somerset. During his childhood in Knutsford, the young Edmund played with Elizabeth Stevenson, the future Mrs Gaskell. In 1812 the Sharpe family moved across town from Over Knutsford to a farm in Nether Knutsford called Heathside, when Francis Sharpe then worked as both farmer and music teacher. Edmund was initially educated by his parents, but by 1818 he was attending a school in Knutsford. Two years later he was a boarder at a school near Runcorn, and in 1821 at Burney's Academy in Greenwich. Edmund's father died suddenly in November 1823, aged 48, and his mother moved to Lancaster with her family, where she later resumed her teaching career.Edmund continued his education at Burney's Academy, and became head boy. In August 1827 he moved to Sedbergh School (then in the West Riding of Yorkshire, now in Cumbria), where he remained for two years. In November 1829 he entered St John's College, Cambridge as a Lupton scholar. At the end of his course in 1832 he was awarded a Worts Travelling Bachelorship by the University of Cambridge, which enabled him to travel abroad for three years' study. At this time his friend from Lancaster at Trinity College, William Whewell, was Professor of Mineralogy. John Hughes, Edmund Sharpe's biographer, is of the opinion that Whewell was influential in gaining this award for Sharpe. Edmund graduated BA in 1833, and was admitted to the degree of MA in 1836. During his time abroad he travelled in Germany and southern France, studying Romanesque and early Gothic architecture. He had intended to travel further into northern France, but his tour was curtailed in Paris owing to \\"fatigue and illness\\"....

The process of assembling furniture necessitates an understanding of various physical components and their respective purposes, as well as the ability to recognize and manipulate these objects effectively to construct a functional item. To illustrate this, let's consider the assembly of a flat-pack bookshelf. The following steps outline the detailed process of completing this task, showcasing the requisite knowledge of physical objects and how to use them. 1. Identify and prepare all necessary components: First, you must lay out all the parts included in the assembly kit, such as the side panels, shelves, back panel, and hardware, like screws, dowels, and brackets. You will also need tools like a screwdriver, hammer, and a possible hex key for securing the various components. 2. Understand the assembly instructions: Carefully read the accompanying instruction manual, which provides a step-by-step guide for properly assembling the bookshelf. Recognize the parts and corresponding part numbers referenced in the manual to ensure the correct pieces are used throughout. 3. Securing dowels: Begin by inserting the dowels into the pre-drilled holes positioned on the edges of the shelves and side panels. The dowels act as support pegs and help align the components when attaching them together. 4. Assemble the frame: Connect the side panels to the shelves by aligning the dowels and corresponding holes in both parts. Make sure that you position the shelves at the appropriate height based on the design. Once you have connected the shelves to one side panel, repeat this process on the other side panel. 5. Secure the frame: Insert screws into the pre-drilled holes or use cam-lock nuts and bolts to further secure the shelves onto the side panels. Tighten the screws or cam locks, ensuring the structure is stable and secure. 6. Attach the back panel: Align the back panel with the rear edges of the side panels and the top and bottom horizontal shelf components. Use small nails or specific hardware provided in the kit to fasten the back panel to the frame of the bookshelf. A hammer will be useful for this task. 7. Mount any supplementary structures: Lastly, attach additional elements like a wall-mounting bracket if required. This bracket is essential to prevent the bookshelf from tipping over and improve overall stability. Throughout this task, knowledge of various physical objects, such as panels, dowels, screws, and the utilization of tools like screwdrivers and hammers, is crucial to accomplish the assembly effectively and safely."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Question: what is black swan about I found the following answer on Google: He and Portman first discussed the project in 2000, and after a brief attachment to Universal Studios , Black Swan was produced in New York City in 2009 by Fox Searchlight Pictures . Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","response":"The provided answer from Google is partially correct in that it describes the production details of \\"Black Swan.\\" However, it does not explain the plot or the main themes of the film. \\"Black Swan\\" is a psychological thriller film directed by Darren Aronofsky, which premiered in 2010, starring Natalie Portman, Mila Kunis, Vincent Cassel, and Barbara Hershey. The film follows the story of a young, aspiring ballet dancer, Nina Sayers (played by Portman), who is cast as the lead role in a production of Tchaikovsky's \\"Swan Lake.\\" Nina's character is a perfectionist, whose entire life revolves around ballet. She is eager to impress the demanding artistic director, Thomas Leroy (Cassel), who casts her in the dual role of the White Swan and the Black Swan. While Nina is a natural fit for the delicate and innocent White Swan, she struggles to embody the sensual, dark character of the Black Swan. As the pressure of the performance grows, Nina starts to lose her grip on reality and battles her inner demons in her pursuit of perfection. Throughout the film, Black Swan explores themes of obsession, duality, ambition, and perfectionism. It delves into the world of ballet, showcasing the intense physical and emotional challenges faced by professional dancers. Furthermore, the movie offers a powerful exploration of mental health, delusions, and the destructive nature of uncontrolled obsessions. The artistic direction, powerful acting, and compelling story make \\"Black Swan\\" a highly acclaimed film.

With no fresh creative inspiration, he worked in the British Museum to transcribe the music of English composer Cipriani Potter, and made a solo version of \\"Bethlehem Down\\" with organ accompaniment. On the evening of 16 December Heseltine met with Van Dieren and his wife for a drink and invited them home afterwards. According to Van Dieren, the visitors left at about 12:15 a.m. Neighbours later reported sounds of movement and of a piano in the early morning. When Peache, who had been away, returned early on 17 December, she found the doors and windows bolted, and smelled coal gas. The police broke into the flat and found Heseltine unconscious; he was declared dead shortly afterwards, apparently as the result of coal gas poisoning.An inquest was held on 22 December; the jury could not determine whether the death was accidental or suicide and an open verdict was returned. Most commentators have considered suicide the more likely cause; Heseltine's close friend Lionel Jellinek and Peache both recalled that he had previously threatened to take his life by gas and the outline of a new will was found among the papers in the flat. Much later, Nigel Heseltine introduced a new theory—that his father had been murdered by Van Dieren, the sole beneficiary of Heseltine's 1920 will, which stood to be revoked by the new one. This theory is not considered tenable by most commentators. The suicide theory is supported (arguably), by the (supposed, accepted) fact that Heseltine/Warlock had put his young cat outside the room before he had turned on the lethal gas.Philip Heseltine was buried alongside his father at Godalming cemetery on 20 December 1930. In late February 1931, a memorial concert of his music was held at the Wigmore Hall; a second such concert took place in the following December.In 2011 the art critic Brian Sewell published his memoirs, in which he claimed that he was Heseltine's illegitimate son, born in... answer the following question: What is the last name of the person whose death could not be determined to be accident or suicide?

Punjab was part of the Indus Valley Civilization, more than 4000 years ago. The main site in Punjab was the city of Harrapa. The Indus Valley Civilization spanned much of what is today Pakistan and eventually evolved into the Indo-Aryan civilisation. The Vedic civilisation flourished along the length of the Indus River. This civilisation shaped subsequent cultures in South Asia and Afghanistan. Although the archaeological site at Harappa was partially damaged in 1857 when engineers constructing the Lahore-Multan railroad used brick from the Harappa ruins for track ballast, an abundance of artefacts have nevertheless been found. Punjab was part of the great ancient empires including the Gandhara Mahajanapadas, Achaemenids, Macedonians, Mauryas, Kushans, Guptas, and Hindu Shahi.

Context: Weight gain is a complex issue. But there is little doubt that the current food environment in Western countries – heavy in highly processed salty, sugary, and fatty food – has a big role to play. Most of the salt eaten in our diet has been added to food in the manufacturing process. This is in contrast to the small amount of salt naturally present in most foods or what is added at the table or at home in cooking. Salt can be a desirable taste, increasing the palatability of foods in addition to helping preserve it; that’s why it is commonly added in processed foods. Combining salt and fat together is thought to be a potent combination in helping to promote passive over-consumption foods. Just think of how moreish salty chips can be. Having a greater liking for salty and fatty foods is associated with eating more kilojoules overall, uncontrolled eating, and overweight in children. This link between overconsumption of food and its degree of saltiness is considered stronger than having a liking for sweet and fatty foods. Teasing out further how salt may influence the over-consumption of fatty foods, sensory researchers from Deakin University recruited 48 healthy adults to take part in a tasting panel. Over four lunchtime sessions (following on from a standardised breakfast that morning), each person ate a meal of macaroni and cheese where the fat and salt content had been manipulated. The four meal combinations were low-fat/low-salt, low-fat/high-salt, high-fat/low-salt and high-fat/high-salt. Participants were encouraged to eat as much as they wished until feeling full. Eating rate, meal agreeability, and subjective ratings of hunger and fullness were also taken. Salt promotes over-eating Eleven percent more kilojoules were consumed when the meals eaten were high in salt. And this was irrespective of if the fat content was high or low. The fat content of the meal didn’t result in people eating more food by weight, but because of its greater energy density, that meant more kilojoules were eaten.

A: Select from the following. A). seismic B). molecular C). particle D). electromagnetic A:","response":"Light is a form of energy that travels in the form of electromagnetic waves. So, the correct answer from the given options is: D). Electromagnetic To provide a more detailed explanation, light, specifically visible light, is a small portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. The electromagnetic (EM) spectrum encompasses a broad range of wavelengths and frequencies, which include radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays, and gamma rays. Electromagnetic waves are generated when an electric charge (such as an electron) oscillates or accelerates. This oscillation creates a disturbance in the electric and magnetic fields surrounding the charge, causing the fields to propagate through space in the form of waves. These waves are called electromagnetic waves because they consist of both electric and magnetic fields oscillating perpendicular to each other and the direction of travel. Unlike other types of waves, such as seismic and molecular waves, electromagnetic waves do not require a medium to propagate. They can travel through empty space (vacuum), which is why light emitted by the Sun can reach Earth across the vacuum of space. The speed of electromagnetic waves, including light, in a vacuum is approximately 299,792 kilometers per second - commonly known as the speed of light. Visible light has a specific range of wavelengths, roughly between 380 and 750 nanometers. Our eyes can detect these wavelengths, allowing us to perceive the world around us. Outside of this range, other forms of electromagnetic radiation, such as radio waves, microwaves, or X-rays, remain invisible to our eyes but can be detected by specialized equipment. Each type of EM radiation has its distinct properties and applications, depending on its wavelength and frequency."},{"question":"Q:I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

Recently the in vitro anti-cancer effect of isorhamnetin on human esophageal squamous carcinoma cell line Eca-109 was investigated in our lab. When Eca-109 cells were in vitro exposed to the graded doses of isorhamnetin (0-80 microg/ml) for 48 h, respectively, isorhamnetin exhibited cytostatic effect on the treated cells, with an IC(50) of 40+/-0.08 microg/ml as estimated by MTT assay. Inhibition on proliferation by isorhamnetin was detected by trypan blue exclusion assay, clone formation test, immunocytochemical assay of PCNA and (3)H-thymidine uptake analysis. Cell cycle distribution was measured by FCM. It was found that the viability of Eca-109 cells was significantly hampered by isorhamnetin. Compared with the negative control group, the treated group which was exposed to isorhamnetin had increased population in G(0)/G(1) phase from 74.6 to 84 while had a significant reduction in G(2)/M phase from 11.9 to 5.8. In addition to its cytostatic effect, isorhamnetin also showed stimulatory effect on apoptosis. Typical apoptotic morphology such as condensation and fragmentation of nuclei and blebbing membrane of the apoptotic cells could be observed through transmission electron microscope. Moreover, the sharp increase in apoptosis rate between the control and treated group were detected by FCM from 6.3 to 16.3. To explore the possible molecular mechanisms that underlie the growth inhibition and apoptosis stimulatory effects of isorhamnetin, the expressions of six proliferation- and death-related genes were detected by FCM. Expressions of bcl-2, c-myc and H-ras were downregulated whereas Bax, c-fos and p53 were upregulated. However, the in vivo experiments were required to further confirm the anti-cancer effects of isorhamnetin. In conclusion, isorhamnetin appears to be a potent drug against esophageal cancer due to its in vitro potential to not only inhibit proliferation but also induce apoptosis of Eca-109 cells.

We have a math problem that looks like this: -203 * v + 98 * v - 15755 = 580 * v Let's think about what this means. We have some number (v) and we need to find out what it is. First, let's look at 'v' on the left side of the equation. We have -203 * v and 98 * v. We can combine them by adding -203 * v and 98 * v. It's like having a group of -203 v's and a group of 98 v's and putting them together. So, let's calculate that: (-203v) + (98v) = -105v Now, our problem looks like this: -105v - 15755 = 580v Next, we need to get all the 'v' terms on one side of the equation. Let's move the -105v from the left side to the right side by adding 105v on both sides: (-105v + 105v) - 15755 = 580v + 105v This simplifies to: -15755 = 685v Now, we just have one 'v' left, and we need to find out what number it stands for. We can do this by dividing both sides by 685: -15755 ÷ 685 = 685v ÷ 685 -23 = v So, the number we were searching for, or 'v', is -23. That's our answer!"},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Information: - An abbey is a complex of buildings used by members of a religious order under the governance of an abbot or abbess. It provides a place for religious activities, work and housing of Christian monks and nuns. The concept of the abbey has developed over many centuries from the early monastic ways of religious men and women where they would live isolated from the lay community about them. Religious life in an abbey may be monastic. An abbey may be the home of an enclosed religious order or may be open to visitors. The layout of the church and associated buildings of an abbey often follows a set plan determined by the founding religious order. Abbeys are often self-sufficient while using any abundance of produce or skill to provide care to the poor and needy, refuge to the persecuted or education to the young. Some abbeys offer accommodation to people who are seeking spiritual retreat. There are many famous abbeys across Europe. - Tides are the rise and fall of sea levels caused by the combined effects of the gravitational forces exerted by the Moon and the Sun and the rotation of the Earth. - Yr Wyddfa commonly known as Snowdon in English, is the highest mountain in Wales, at an elevation of above sea level, and the highest point in the British Isles south of the Scottish Highlands.

Plans were probably first made to construct the castle in 1284, but this was delayed due to lack of funds and work only began in 1295 following the Madog ap Llywelyn uprising. A substantial workforce was employed in the initial years under the direction of James of St George. Edward's invasion of Scotland soon diverted funding from the project, however, and work stopped, only recommencing after an invasion scare in 1306. When work finally ceased around 1330 a total of £15,000 had been spent, a huge sum for the period, but the castle remained incomplete. - Great Britain, also known as Britain , is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe.

As anyone who has experienced occasional — or even chronic — constipation can tell you, it can really put a damper on quality of life and well-being. Constipation can also cause more substantial problems, such as: * Severe abdominal pain, which can lead to emergency room visits * Hemorrhoids, which can bleed or be painful * Increased irritability, agitation, or even aggression, in people with Alzheimer’s disease or other forms of dementia * Stress and/or pain that can contribute to delirium (a state of new or worse confusion that often happens when older adults are hospitalized) * Fecal incontinence, which can be caused or worsened by having a hard lump of stool lodged in the lower bowel * Avoidance of needed pain medication, due to fear of constipation Fortunately, it’s usually possible to help older adults effectively manage and prevent constipation. This helps maintain well-being and quality of life, and can also improve difficult behaviors related to dementia. The trouble is that constipation is often either overlooked or sub-optimally managed by busy healthcare providers who aren’t trained in geriatrics. They are often focused on more “serious” health issues. Also, since many laxatives are available over-the-counter, some providers may assume that people will treat themselves if necessary. Personally, I don’t like this hands-off approach to constipation. Although several useful laxatives are indeed available over-the-counter (OTC), I’ve found that the average person doesn’t know enough to correctly choose among them. Also, although in geriatrics we often do end up recommending or prescribing laxatives, it’s vital to start by figuring out what is likely to be causing — or worsening — an older person’s constipation. For instance, many medications can make constipation worse, so we usually make an attempt to identify and perhaps deprescribe those. In short, if you’re an older adult, or if you’re helping an older... Question: What are some side effects of constipation in the elderly? Options: A. nausea, increased heart rate B. decreased irritability and bleeding C. pain, irritability, bleeding D. not enough information === The correct answer is A:","response":"C. pain, irritability, bleeding Constipation in the elderly can lead to several side effects, including: 1. Severe abdominal pain: This can result in emergency room visits if the pain becomes unbearable. 2. Hemorrhoids: Swollen veins in the rectal area that can cause bleeding or pain, often as a result of straining during bowel movements. 3. Increased irritability, agitation, or aggression: These symptoms are particularly common in people with Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia, as they may be less able to express their discomfort. 4. Stress and/or pain that can contribute to delirium: Delirium is a state of new or worse confusion that often occurs when older adults are hospitalized, and constipation-related stress or pain can worsen this condition. 5. Fecal incontinence: A hard lump of stool lodged in the lower bowel can cause or exacerbate fecal incontinence, as the body might struggle to contain loose stool that leaks around the hardened mass. 6. Avoidance of needed pain medication: Some older adults may refuse to take certain pain medications due to fear of constipation, subsequently impacting their overall comfort and well-being."},{"question":"Write a sentence not in English.","response":"\\"Le soleil brille et les oiseaux chantent dans le ciel du petit matin, annonçant une journée pleine de promesses et de nouvelles expériences à partager.\\" This French sentence can be translated to English as: \\"The sun shines and the birds sing in the early morning sky, announcing a day full of promises and new experiences to share.\\" This sentence illustrates the beauty of nature and the excitement that a new day can bring, highlighting the importance of appreciating everyday moments."},{"question":"Generate a descriptive sentence about a restaurant using the following words: name = Taste of Cambridge, eatType = restaurant, priceRange = moderate, customer rating = 3 out of 5 Sentence:","response":"Step 1: Identify the key information given to be included in the sentence, which is the name of the restaurant, the eatType, the price range, and the customer rating.

Well, evidently a lot of people now, thanks to Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives. We've been twice (we're only in Phoenix twice a year, or we'd probably be here once a week, at least!) The BF had his fave, chile relleno. It comes coated with crunchy Panko crumbs, which he loved. This time I had the emerald chicken, with a sauce like a ginger-green onion pesto that rocked my taste buds. I also had the jen-red pork; the meat was a little dry.

What type of authors are Alfred Bester and Iain Banks? A:","response":"Alfred Bester and Iain Banks can be classified as science fiction authors who have made significant contributions to the genre through their imaginative and thought-provoking works. Both of these authors have carved their own niche within the vast realm of science fiction, leaving a lasting impact on readers and inspiring countless other authors and creators in the science fiction community. Alfred Bester (1913-1987) was an American science fiction author, best known for his novels \\"The Demolished Man\\" (1953) and \\"The Stars My Destination\\" (1956). Bester's writing is characterized by his unique storytelling style and innovative narrative techniques. He was a pioneer in exploring themes such as telepathy, dystopian societies, and the psychological aspects of identity and consciousness. His work often featured complex, deeply flawed characters engaged in morally ambiguous situations and showcased a mastery of blending speculative concepts with elements of noir and mystery. Iain Banks (1954-2013) was a Scottish author who wrote both mainstream fiction and science fiction, the latter under the name Iain M. Banks. In the realm of science fiction, he is best known for the Culture series, which includes novels such as \\"Consider Phlebas\\" (1987), \\"Player of Games\\" (1988), and \\"Use of Weapons\\" (1990). Banks' work is known for its intricate world-building, skillful blend of political and social commentary, and exploration of artificial intelligence and post-human civilizations. The Culture series presents a utopian post-scarcity society made possible by advanced technologies, where humans and machine intelligences coexist in a complex and fascinating universe. Both authors share a common interest in developing intricate plots, exploring engaging ideas, and pushing the boundaries of science fiction. As genre innovators, they have left a profound impact on the evolution of science fiction and have inspired generations of authors who came after them. Alfred Bester and Iain Banks can, therefore, be considered influential, imaginative, and introspective science fiction authors who offer profound insights into human nature and push the frontiers of what is possible within the space of speculative fiction."},{"question":"The exercise is to decide whether the question accepts the proposed suggestion as a correct answer.

In fact, your independence is reinforced with good friends. When your friend needs someone to talk to, be there for them. Be trustworthy. Do not gossip or tell anyone about your friends' secrets or personal matters. Even if they didn't say anything about it. Be a strong person for your friends and loved ones. It not only shows you're selfless, but pretty soon you'll learn how to deal with any situation that comes your way because of your friends' experiences. It will be difficult because parents have a natural instinct to provide for us. Just politely decline when they offer financial help. It is tempting to depend on others financially, but before you experience independence, you must be independent. Secure your finances. True independent living relies on financial freedom. Pay your own bills, drive your own car, sign a personal check for your rent. If you don't have the money for these expenses, save aggressively. Not only will you gain financial freedom with your savings, but the money you keep to yourself will give you an incredible feeling of independence and motivation. Work hard at everything you do. Defend your opinions. And, for you girls, don't let a man feel he has to pamper you and for you boys, vice versa. If you're capable of doing something good, do it. So long as it doesn't have a bad effect, you should do it. That doesn't mean do absolutely everything, but you shouldn't feel it's necessary for people to do things for you that you could do for yourself. Work your best and hardest to leave people saying \\"That person doesn't rely on anyone to do things for them. What a strong, independent person.\\" This is a difficult step on the journey to independent living, but you must start doing things on your own. You do not need to drive with someone to the restaurant, because you can meet them there. Go shopping alone, spend at least one or two evenings a week by yourself. Work on activities that force you to lead, not follow. If you're used to always having a buddy when you go hiking or go to the mall, see how it feels to rough it on your own. Don't break friendships unless absolutely necessary. Learn to keep a healthy distance. Even if those friends are \\"totally cool,\\" they may only hold you back from breaking out on your own. \\"Weed out your garden\\"; some people make you shine, while others will stunt your growth and draw all your energy. If you have a friend who is trying to make you do things that make you uncomfortable, whether it's stealing or just being a meaner person, then it's time to cut the cord. Avoid any friends who really like building a following and having people worship them. These people will want you to only do what they say and will keep you from being independent. Save as much as reasonably possible. This will help you create an emergency fund, since life can be unpredictable at times. You don't plan accidents. Improve the quality of your life by putting aside a set amount of money each month. There are such things as accidents, health problems, or even natural disasters, which can occur when you least expect it. You may not think that you have the capacity to save money, but even doing small things, like making your own coffee instead of going to Starbucks once a day, can save you over 30 a week -- that's over 1,500 a year! Most banks offer a checking and savings account together, in one convenient package. Some companies, institutions, and organizations will require you to have at least a checking account (some only pay employees via direct deposit). Money you earn that isn't necessary for your own expenses should be put into a savings account until you're ready to be independent. Having your own bank account will keep you from depending on others for money, and will help you stay away from reckless spending. Experiment with different careers and find the one that you enjoy most. If money makes you happy, be an investment banker or start a small business. If you like kids, be a teacher. If you like being an expert, be a lawyer, professor or consultant. If you enjoy talking to people, be a salesperson or go into the services industry. If knowing how things work is more your game, try engineering, or Psychology and sociology. The majority of students end up in careers unrelated to their major. Some people do not get far in formal education and end up millionaires. Working in a career that you enjoy is a part of becoming a mature person. Something you are devoted to, whether it is a sport, girlfriend/boyfriends, music, a band, a form of art/dance, religion. Something that you do constantly that takes up some time. Video games and playing Barbie all day aren't the best value out there. (This includes wasting your time on the Internet). Finding a passion will make your life feel more meaningful and will make you feel more like you know what you really want out of life. People who are most dependent on others allow their worlds to revolve around the needs of other people or other things. Plan your day according to your own schedule--make a list of what you want to do, what you need to do and what you should have already done. If a friend really needs a favor, fine, but don't let that friend dominate the plan you had made so carefully. Treat your alone time like it's a date with Brad Pitt. That is, guard it carefully and don't let anyone stop you from spending time with yourself. You don't have to be stubborn to be independent. If someone has really helped you out, then thank that person by giving him a sincere \\"thank you,\\" writing a card, or giving him a big hug if he's a close friend. There's nothing wrong in admitting that you do need help sometimes and it won't make you any less independent to acknowledge the times when you need help. Just because somebody wants to pay 60 for a shirt doesn't mean you have to. Dress how you want to dress, and say what you want to say. If you like to act crazy, by all means go for it! A good thing to remember is that good taste and style does not have to cost money - it is something that is innate or learned but can make good of anything with a little know-how. Hanging out with people who are just like you won't inspire you to be any more independent. Making an effort to be friends with a variety of people who all have different perspectives and occupations can give you more of a sense of what's out there and to see that there's no one way to do it right. It can be refreshing to hang out with a lawyer if you're a yoga instructor, or to spend time with a chef if you're a student. This can make you more open-minded and more willing to do something completely new on your own.

Read more about how police found Ayvani Hope Perez and the suspects in the case. ORIGINAL STORY: Ayvani Hope Perez remained missing early Wednesday, more than 24 hours after being kidnapped by armed men who barged into her family’s home. When the two gunmen burst into the Ellenwood home early Tuesday, the mother tried unsuccessfully to hide her two teenage children to protect them. Tuesday evening, family members wre trying to raise a 10,000 ransom to give the men who kidnapped her youngest, 14-year-old Ayvani, after their demand for cash and jewelry went unmet in the robbery attempt. Rarely heard of kidnap ransom demands came from two people who law enforcement officials say were strangers to the family before the home invasion. There remained a heavy police presence Wednesday in the neighborhood just east of I-675 where Tuesday’s home invasion and kidnapping occurred. Two Clayton County police officers stationed at the end of Brookgate Drive were stopping all vehicles and only allowing residents to proceed up the street and closer to the victim’s home. Media, which included crews from Good Morning America and the Today show, were being kept well away from the home by officers. Additional police vehicles, including a mobile command center, were parked in front of the victim’s home. A few neighbors on their way to catch the school bus spoke briefly to reporters about Ayvani. “We talked once or twice,” 11-year-old Zakar McCullough said. “I would see her in her driveway, playing with her brother and her dog. We talked about normal kid stuff.” He said he didn’t talk to Ayvani much “because she was real shy.” “I hope she gets home safe,” he said. “I will pray for her family.” Griselda Torres, 15, called Ayvani “a sweet girl” who loves horses. “Hopefully she’s okay,” she said. “She’s too young and I know she’s scared right now.” Clayton County police Lt. Marc Richards issued the following statement late Wednesday morning: “The Clayton County Police Department would like to express its sincere appreciation for the outpouring of support we have received as we steadfastly work toward bringing Ayvani home safely to her family. Our efforts have not waned. We are committed to the task at hand. To our law enforcement family, remain vigilant. To our media partners, continue to put the message out. To the community, the Tip Line to call with information is 770-477-3513. To the perpetrators of this heinous act, release Ayvani unharmed.” Tuesday evening, more than 150 people gathered in a circle and held hands in prayer at the candle-light vigil at Dutchtown High School in Hampton. Many teens there – holding posters with Ayvani’s name and pictures of them with her – were her class mates from Dutchtown Middle School. “I possibly have a chance to never see her again,” former classmate Nina Richardson told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. “On so many levels, it just feels so unreal.” Ayvani’s aunt, Suky Guerrero, told the AJC Tuesday that family members were trying to get the money together to secure the teen’s release. The AJC confirmed the ransom demand with a law enforcement official close to the investigation who was unauthorized to speak publicly. Guerrero said she understood the family was still waiting for the money to be delivered late Tuesday. Guerrero took her brother, Ayvani’s father, Alberto Perez, 47, to the airport in El Paso, Texas, to fly to Atlanta on Tuesday morning. “My brother doesn’t have a clue. He doesn’t have any money like that.” Perez, she said, wanted to be by the side of his ex-wife, Ayvani’s mother Maria Perez. “He was devastated, not knowing what to do,” Guerrero said. Clayton County Police said the home invasion and subsequent abduction seemed random. “It didn’t appear that they knew each other,” police spokesman Officer Phong Nguyen said of the suspects and victims. “They just moved in about a month ago.” The FBI and GBI are aiding in the search for Ayvani, and authorities are asking for the public’s help to locate the men who drove away in a gray Dodge. The GBI has released sketches of the suspects. Anyone with information on the girl or the suspects should call a special tips hotline at 770-477-3513 or Clayton County police at 678-610-4781. “This is the time for the Clayton community and the community as a whole to come together,” Clayton County Police Chief Gregory Porter told reporters. “We’re trying to make sure that we bring her some safely.” Late Tuesday afternoon, a quiet buzz took over the Brook Gate subdivision just off I-675 where Ayvani lives. As residents and youth who would be Ayvani’s class mates returned home from school, they were greeted by a phalanx of police and law enforcement and representatives from both local and national media. Some said they were stunned and frightened. “It’s very scary,” said Breyana Walker, a 16-year-old junior at Morrow High School. “I’m so terrified,” said Walker, who lives just down the street from Ayvani. “I feel like I need someone here with me,” she said. “It could happen to anybody. I don’t know what to do.” Maties Otalis, a father of four, who has lived in the neighborhood for two years said he was stunned by the kidnapping. “We always have police around this area,” he said. “I don’t expect such to happen in my neighborhood. I feel like moving out of this area.” Toni Hill, another resident, said neighbors stay to themselves in the area but Tuesday morning’s incident will make her more vigilant. “This situation is just terrifying. We thought we lived in the same neighborhood but we don’t know what’s going on here,” Hill said. - Staff writers Mike Morris, and Rhonda Cook and staff photographer John Spink contributed to this article. ||||| As law enforcement agencies all around Georgia search for 14-year-old kidnapping victim Ayvani Perez, one of her best friends is praying for her safe return. \\"I want to tell her that I love her,\\" said Perez's friend and classmate Ariana Soeun. \\"I hope that she comes home because she knows everybody misses her.\\" A Levi’s Call alert has been posted for Perez, who authorities said was abducted from her family’s Ellenwood home Tuesday about 2 a.m. Police released sketches of the two armed men they believe took her during the home invasion on Brookgate Drive. Police said the mother tried to hide her two children, but the suspects found the family, along with the family’s dog, and demanded money and jewelry. Family members and law enforcement officials said suspects are now demanding a ransom for Perez's safe return, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. A friend of Perez told Channel 2's Richard Elliot she's praying for the teen's safe return. Channel 2 Action News has a team of reporters speaking with law enforcement about every possible lead in this case. Despite the fact that she lives in Clayton County, Henry County School officials confirmed Perez is enrolled at Stockbridge High School. Officials also confirmed to Channel 2 Action News that police detectives visited the school Tuesday morning hoping to find some information that might help them locate Perez. I just got this pic of kidnapping victim Ayvani Perez. She's on the right. #wsbtvpic.twitter.com/4nu761WSRY — Richard Elliot (@RElliotWSB) September 17, 2013 Soeun said she and Perez have been friends for years, and just graduated middle school together. She described her friend as a typical teenager who likes to talk a lot and get together to do each other's hair and makeup. \\"She was a sweet girl,\\" said Soeun's grandmother Doris Kinsey. \\"She came over to our house during prom season, and her and Ariana got dressed for the prom. We took pictures. She seemed like a very sweet girl.\\" Other Stockbridge students described school Tuesday as anxious, tense and emotional for many of Perez's friends. \\"I saw people coming out of the counselor's office crying,\\" said classmate Brittany Draughton. \\"I've seen a lot of people crying and depressed,\\" said classmate Shareena Grenan. \\"Sad like.\\" Draughton and Grenan said students were taking to social media sites like Instagram to spread the word about their missing friend.

Article:","response":"Title: Scottish Labour Members Undecided on New Leader Choice: Contender Ken Macintosh Reveals Introduction: The race for Scottish Labour's new leader is heating up, as reports suggest that the majority of the party's members remain undecided on who they should elect to the lead the party. Scottish Parliament member and leadership contender Ken Macintosh has revealed this interesting piece of information, which highlights the uncertainty and the divided opinions among the party's members. Body: Ken Macintosh, a long-serving and well-known member of the Scottish Parliament, has thrown his hat into the ring to become the next leader of Scottish Labour. However, despite his political experience, Macintosh admits that a significant number of party members haven't yet decided on who they should vote for in the impending leadership contest. This revelation sheds light on the state of the party, which has been struggling to maintain its identity and political footing in recent years. The Scottish Labour has faced numerous challenges, including strong competition from the Scottish National Party (SNP) and the continuous shifts in the UK's political landscape. The party is in dire need of a strong and unifying leader to guide them through these challenging times. Macintosh, along with other contenders for the leadership role, will be fighting to convince the undecided members of the party to support their vision for Scottish Labour. The new leader must strive to reinvigorate the party, championing policies and initiatives that resonate with the Scottish electorate, and working to regain the trust of voters. While the decision on who will be elected the party's new leader remains to be seen, it's evident that the contenders will have to present well-articulated plans and demonstrate their capabilities to the undecided members. The importance of the leadership race cannot be overstated, as the person who emerges victorious will be responsible for charting the future course of the party. It is essential for both the party's internal unity and its external influence to ensure that the right candidate takes the helm, someone who can bring stability to Scottish Labour while also being able to address the concerns of the Scottish public. Whoever wins will face the momentous task of rebuilding and revitalizing the party's image and fortunes for the future. Conclusion: The uncertain path ahead for Scottish Labour is representative of the broader challenges that political parties are facing in these turbulent times. As the majority of its members remain undecided on who to elect as the new leader, it highlights the importance of a strong, unified, and visionary candidate who can successfully lead the party through these challenges. In the coming weeks, contenders like Ken Macintosh will be making their case for why they should be chosen to lead Scottish Labour into a new era of prosperity and unity."},{"question":"Article: Why do 33% of the households in the USA have cats?

There are confusing legal terms to learn, strict procedures to follow and volumes of case law that often need to be understood to prepare a case. Lake County officials and a private agency that assists indigent litigants in Illinois want to make the practice easier by creating a self-help center for people who choose to represent themselves in legal matters. The center, which will be housed in the law library at the main courthouse in Waukegan, could open later this summer. \\"I think it's going to be extremely helpful,\\" Court Administrator Bob Zastany said. \\"There is a population out there that will take advantage of this resource.\\" The self-help center will be the only one of its kind in the county. Only a few operate nationwide, officials said. The project is the work of Lake County circuit court officials and Prairie State Legal Services, a statewide agency with an office in Waukegan that provides information and legal assistance to poor and elderly Illinois residents. The organization has received a 25,000 grant from the Illinois Equal Justice Foundation, a nonprofit group that funds programs designed to increase access to legal information and assistance, to help pay for the effort. Prairie State will share the money with the county. The county's law library is on the first floor of the governmental center at 18 N. County St. The new self-help center will be designed to help litigants find the information they need to properly represent themselves in court, an undertaking that can be complicated and confusing. \\"Some people can do OK on their own, and some people can do OK with some help,\\" said Linda Rothnagel, the managing attorney for Prairie State Legal Services. \\"But other people can't do it. It's not always easy.\\" Self-representation is a right affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court. The practice is far more common in civil matters than in criminal cases. In fact, self-represented litigants - formally called \\"pro se\\" in Latin, or \\"for oneself\\" - in criminal defenses are so rare that statistics about the practice generally are not kept, legal experts say. After reading the above, is \\"The presence of the self-help center\\" the correct answer to the question \\"What does Court Administrator Bob Zastany think is going to be extremely helpful?\\"?

The Ph.D. in Fine Arts at the University of Hertfordshire provides students with opportunities to expand their creative practices in various areas such as painting, sculpture, photography, graphic arts, multimedia, and performing arts. Alongside the development of creative capabilities, the programme also emphasizes the importance of critical thinking, research, and communication skills in the context of contemporary art and culture. To be admitted to the Ph.D. in Fine Arts programme, students must have a relevant master's degree in fine arts or a demonstrable professional experience in their chosen field of practice. Throughout the programme, students are expected to engage with their creative projects under the supervision of experienced faculty members, providing them with valuable guidance and support in developing their research skills and artistic practice. In addition to the coursework and creative projects, students are encouraged to participate in conferences, exhibitions, and other events to enrich their academic experience and build a network within the arts community.

What is the solution?","response":"Let's break down the math problem step-by-step. The given equation is: -222*j + 8901 + 16276 - 4071 = -3980 First, let's simplify the equation by combining the constant terms. The constant terms are 8901, 16276, and -4071. 8901 + 16276 - 4071 = 12177 Now, the simplified equation becomes: -222*j + 12177 = -3980 Next, let's isolate the term with the variable (j) by moving the constant term to the other side. To do this, we'll subtract 12177 from both sides of the equation: -222*j + 12177 - 12177 = -3980 - 12177 This simplifies to: -222*j = -16157 Now, to solve for j, we'll divide both sides of the equation by -222: -222*j / -222 = -16157 / -222 This simplifies to: j = 72.75 So, the solution to the math problem -222*j + 8901 + 16276 - 4071 = -3980 is j = 72.75."},{"question":"What happens next in this paragraph?

Now let's see why the other options are incorrect: (a) Riding sleds under a blue croquet course does not make sense in this context, as the paragraph is talking about people kayaking at a lakeside. Also, sleds and croquet are unrelated activities. (b) Rowing a kayak in action would be a repetition of what is already happening with the people on the lake, so it would not be a progression of events.

Although I am generally pleased with wb.receiptspro, there are a few areas in which improvements could be made. Occasionally, the app can become slightly sluggish, particularly when scanning multiple receipts in a row or operating with a large data set. Also, it would be great if the developers could expand the app's compatibility with additional currencies and regional expense-tracking norms for a more seamless international experience. In summary, wb.receiptspro provides a robust and reliable solution to expense tracking and receipt management, with a few minor performance issues. Despite these drawbacks, I highly recommend this app to anyone in search of an efficient means to facilitate better control of their finances."},{"question":"Given a document, find the main entity about whom the author is writing.

Choices: - spongin - collagen - scleroprotein - osteon A: The answer to this question is:","response":"- osteon The functional unit of compact bone is called the osteon (also known as the Haversian system). An osteon is a cylindrical structure that consists of concentric layers of lamellae (concentric rings of bone matrix) surrounding a central Haversian canal. The Haversian canal contains small blood vessels and nerves that provide nutrients and signals to the bone cells. Osteocytes, the mature bone cells, are located in small cavities called lacunae within the lamellae. They are interconnected by tiny canals called canaliculi, which allow for the exchange of nutrients and waste between osteocytes and the Haversian canal. The arrangement of osteons in compact bone provides strength and stability to the bone while allowing for efficient transportation of nutrients and waste products."},{"question":"Q:Generate a 4-star review (1 being lowest and 5 being highest) about an app with package net.androgames.level.

The Rokeby Venus (; also known as The Toilet of Venus, Venus at her Mirror, Venus and Cupid, or La Venus del espejo) is a painting by Diego Velázquez, the leading artist of the Spanish Golden Age. Completed between 1647 and 1651, and probably painted during the artist's visit to Italy, the work depicts the goddess Venus in a sensual pose, lying on a bed and looking into a mirror held by the Roman god of physical love, her son Cupid. The painting is in the National Gallery, London. Numerous works, from the ancient to the baroque, have been cited as sources of inspiration for Velázquez. The nude Venuses of the Italian painters, such as Giorgione's Sleeping Venus (c. 1510) and Titian's Venus of Urbino (1538), were the main precedents. In this work, Velázquez combined two established poses for Venus: recumbent on a couch or a bed, and gazing at a mirror. She is often described as looking at herself on the mirror, although this is physically impossible since viewers can see her face reflected in their direction. This phenomenon is known as the Venus effect. In a number of ways the painting represents a pictorial departure, through its central use of a mirror, and because it shows the body of Venus turned away from the observer of the painting.The Rokeby Venus is the only surviving female nude by Velázquez. Nudes were extremely rare in seventeenth-century Spanish art, which was policed actively by members of the Spanish Inquisition. Despite this, nudes by foreign artists were keenly collected by the court circle, and this painting was hung in the houses of Spanish courtiers until 1813, when it was brought to England to hang in Rokeby Park, Yorkshire. In 1906, the painting was purchased by National Art Collections Fund for the National Gallery, London. Although it was attacked and badly damaged in 1914 by the suffragette Mary Richardson, it soon was fully restored and returned to display.

Question: who did not have departmental power Context: Slack (2003) compares three groups that conducted biological research at Yale during overlapping periods between 1910 and 1970. Yale proved important as a site for this research. The leaders of these groups were Ross Granville Harrison, Grace E. Pickford, and G. Evelyn Hutchinson, and their members included both graduate students and more experienced scientists. All produced innovative research, including the opening of new subfields in embryology, endocrinology, and ecology, respectively, over a long period of time. Harrison's group is shown to have been a classic research school; Pickford's and Hutchinson's were not. Pickford's group was successful in spite of her lack of departmental or institutional position or power. Hutchinson and his graduate and postgraduate students were extremely productive, but in diverse areas of ecology rather than one focused area of research or the use of one set of research tools. Hutchinson's example shows that new models for research groups are needed, especially for those that include extensive field research. Answer:","response":"Grace E.

But whether potassium intake could prevent stroke or death wasn't clear,\\" said Smoller, professor of the department of population health at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY. Researchers studied 90,137 women, aged from 50 to 79 for an average 11 years. They looked at how much potassium the women consumed, as well as if they had strokes, including ischemic strokes , or died during the study period. Women in the study were stroke-free at the start and their average dietary potassium intake was 2,611 mg/day. Results of this study are based on potassium from food, not supplements. The researchers found: Women who ate the most potassium were 12 percent less likely to suffer stroke in general and 16 percent less likely to suffer an ischemic stroke than women who ate the least. Women who ate the most potassium were 10 percent less likely to die than those who ate the least. Among women who did not have high blood pressure, those who ate the most potassium had a 27 percent lower ischemic stroke risk and 21 perc ent reduced risk for all stroke types, compared to women who ate the least potassium in their daily diets. Among women with high blood pressure, those who ate the most potassium had a lower risk of death, but potassium intake did not lower their stroke risk. \\"Our findings suggest that women need to eat more p otassium-rich foods.

It suggests that there are private homes, apartments, or condos in the area, which immediately raises concerns about the well-being of the residents living there. This word adds a human element to the situation and amplifies the importance of the event described. 4. Neighborhood: Lastly, the word \\"neighborhood\\" is vital as it describes the setting where the event is taking place. It relates to the community and consequently brings local implications to the scene. The context of the sentence underlines that the situation affects the lives of the people residing in the area, directly or indirectly.

CAIRO — When the prime minister of Egypt stepped down on Thursday, Shereen Diaa, 32, was cooking lunch for her two young sons in a suburb on Cairo’s outskirts. A veiled woman who molds her life around her children, Ms. Diaa had promised herself she would stop attending political protests and focus on her boys, ages 6 and 8. But when she saw on Facebook that the new prime minister himself would address the protesters the next day, in an unprecedented act, she could not resist. “I will leave you only two hours,” she said she told the children, dropping them off with her mother and then heading downtown to Tahrir Square. In the raucous crowd, she stepped on a water jug to catch a glimpse of the prime minister, Essam Sharaf, who had stood with the demonstrators before Hosni Mubarak was ousted as president. “I see him! I am really happy!” she exclaimed, beaming, one voice among thousands. “Raise your head high, you are Egyptian!” they chanted. Egypt’s popular revolution was the work of men and women, bringing together housewives and fruit sellers, businesswomen and students. At its height, roughly one quarter of the million protesters who poured into the square each day were women. Veiled and unveiled women shouted, fought and slept in the streets alongside men, upending traditional expectations of their behavior. The challenge now, activists here say, is to make sure that women maintain their involvement as the nation lurches forward, so that their contribution to the revolution is not forgotten. “Things have not changed, they are changing,” said Mozn Hassan, 32, the executive director of the organization Nazra for Feminist Studies. She barely returned home during the 18 days it took to topple Mr. Mubarak, but that is not enough, she said. “Revolution is not about 18 days in Tahrir Square and then turning it into a carnival and loving the army,” she said. “We have simply won the first phase.” It is an indication of the place of women here that Ms. Hassan was referring to the need for political gains and true equality, rather than some more basic rights denied to women in parts of the Arab world. Even as this country has become more devout, experts say roughly 25 percent of Egyptian women work outside their homes. And they are allowed to mix more freely in public with men than in some other Arab countries. But a recent report by the World Economic Forum ranked Egypt 125th out of 134 countries when judging the equality between men and women, in good part because so many women do not work, 42 percent of women cannot read or write and almost no women are political leaders. (In 2010, only 8 of the 454 seats in Parliament were held by women.) Genital cutting of women is still widely practiced in Egypt, especially in rural areas. Women here also suffer a level of sexual harassment that would not be tolerated in many countries. They are often verbally harassed on the street in Cairo and sometimes groped in crowded spaces whether they are veiled or not, leading many wealthier women to simply abandon walking downtown. Egypt is a step ahead of other popular uprisings in the region, which have had similar bursts of female participation, accompanied by a recognition from men that their support is vital. In Bahrain, hundreds of women wrapped in traditional black tunics stood up to the authorities in the demonstrations against the government, but in a nod to their conservative culture, they slept and prayed outside during protests in a roped-off women’s section. In Yemen, only in the past few days have significant numbers of women started to protest in Sana, the capital, but their numbers were dwarfed by the crowds of men. Ms. Diaa, whose husband works for a multinational corporation, said the role of housewives in Egypt’s revolution has been critical because they often have more time to protest than their husbands. The importance of wives has long been clear to the Muslim Brotherhood; women are active in the charitable groups that form the organization’s backbone. “We feel this is our country now,” said Abrar Mousad, 15, a Brotherhood supporter who stood in the square with her mother, aunt and cousin. They had come from the northern city of Tanta to take part. “Everything has changed. I can say what I think and what I need without any fear from anyone.” That assessment may be overly optimistic; feminists acknowledge that the battle for equality will not be easy. Still, women here are energized, and say perhaps the greatest change so far has been internal. They came to be convinced that the traffic-choked streets of downtown Cairo, long a male-dominated space, could be equally theirs despite years of rampant sexual harassment. A study in 2008 by the Egyptian Center for Women’s Rights found that a vast majority of the women surveyed had been harassed. And the harassers, who are often members of the state security forces, are almost never punished, said Nehad Abu El Komsan, the director of the organization. Laura Kasinof contributed reporting from Sana, Yemen, and Andrea Bruce from Manama, Bahrain.

Would \\"A thorough history and assessement of pre-existing systemic problems and possible sites of dental infection are required to help prevent the condition, especially if bisphosphonate therapy is considered.\\" be a reasonable answer? Pick your answer from: I. No; II. Yes; Answer:","response":"I. No; Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) is a rare but severe bone disease that affects the jawbones, particularly the maxilla and the mandible. It occurs when the bones in the jaw die due to lack of blood supply or infection. This condition can lead to the exposure of the underlying bone, severe pain, ulceration, infection, and even fracture of the jawbone. ONJ is commonly associated with the use of certain medications, such as bisphosphonates, which are primarily used for treating osteoporosis and preventing bone complications in patients with cancer. Other risk factors for ONJ include radiation therapy, dental surgery, systemic diseases, and poor oral hygiene. While a thorough history and assessment of pre-existing systemic problems and possible sites of dental infection are necessary steps in the prevention and management of ONJ, stating it as the answer to the question \\"What is the disease osteonecrosis of the jaw?\\" is not accurate. The statement you provided explains one of the preventive measures to minimize the risk of developing ONJ, especially if bisphosphonate therapy is being considered, but it does not define or describe the disease itself. A more reasonable and detailed answer to the question would be: Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) is a debilitating bone disorder characterized by the death of jawbone tissues due to insufficient blood supply, infection, or both. It commonly affects the maxilla and mandible bones, leading to symptoms such as exposed bone, pain, swelling, loose teeth, and bone fractures. Risk factors for ONJ include the use of medications like bisphosphonates, dental surgery, radiation therapy, systemic diseases, and poor oral hygiene. To help prevent ONJ, especially in patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy, it is crucial to take a thorough medical history and assessment of pre-existing systemic problems and potential sites of dental infection. This information aids in identifying and managing risk factors that can contribute to ONJ development, allowing for early intervention and proper preventive measures."},{"question":"Question: how many ncaa basketball championships has indiana won??

This mystical treasure has been safeguarded by the royal family for generations. The story begins when ambitious King Darius learns that securing the complete domination of the Aegean Sea is the key to making Persia the ultimate world empire. To achieve this, he needs the power of Ta Nto to grant him control over the seas and vanquish his enemies. Meanwhile, Farid, a young but skilled Persian naval officer, harbors a deep love for his kingdom and an unshaken loyalty to his ruler. Farid is bestowed with the honorable task of leading the Persian fleet to conquer the islands of the Aegean Sea. Little does he know that this journey will put him on a collision course with destiny. While sailing across the azure waters, a fierce storm unexpectedly hits the Persian fleet, threatening to destroy the ships. Farid decides to unleash the power of Ta Nto, defying the ancient rule of never using its power over nature. The storm subsides, but as Farid learns more about Ta Nto, he uncovers the tale of an ancient curse threatening the lives of all those who dare to manipulate and wield its power. With each use, the curse rapidly advances, threatening to unleash chaotic devastation upon the world. As they sail from island to island, overcoming adversities and winning battles, Farid struggles with the burden of wielding Ta Nto.

There are a number of variations of parliamentary republics. Most have a clear differentiation between the head of government and the head of state, with the head of government holding real power, much like constitutional monarchies. Some have combined the roles of head of state and head of government, much like presidential systems, but with a dependency upon parliamentary power. - Mustafa Bülent Ecevit (28 May 1925 5 November 2006) was a Turkish politician, poet, writer, scholar, and journalist, who served as the Prime Minister of Turkey four times between 1974 and 2002. He served as prime minister of Turkey in 1974, 1977, 197879, and 19992002. He was the leader of the Republican People's Party (CHP) between 1972 and 1980, and in 1989 he became the leader of the Democratic Left Party (DSP). - The 15th Turkish general election was held on 3 November 2002 following the collapse of the DSP - MHP - ANAP coalition led by Bülent Ecevit . It was the 15th general election to be held in Turkey . All 550 members of the Grand National Assembly were up for election . The election was held during an ongoing economic crisis which followed the 2001 financial crash , which resulted in a deep resentment of coalition governments which had governed the country since the 1980 military coup . The Justice and Development Party ( AKP ) , which had only been formed in 2001 by Recep Tayyip Erdoan , won the election with nearly two - thirds of the seats . The protest vote was such that every sitting party previously represented in parliament was ejected , with the AKP winning 363 seats with just 34.3 % of the vote . The only other party which passed the 10 % threshold to gain representation was the Republican People 's Party , which came second with 19.38 % of the vote and 178 seats . The election produced Turkey 's first single party government since 1987 and the country 's first two - party parliament since 1960 . The moderate Islamism advocated by the AKP was at odds with the secular establishment of the Republic of Turkey . While serving as the Mayor of Istanbul , Erdoan was sentenced to a 10 month prison term in 1998 for reciting a poem in Siirt which incited racial intolerance . This barred him from initially seeking a seat in parliament , meaning that the AKP 's co-founder Abdullah Gül became Prime Minister following their election victory . With the help of the CHP , the government overturned Erdoan 's political ban in 2003 , after which he was able to seek a seat in a controversial by - election in the Province of Siirt . Erdoan became Prime Minister in March 2003 , with Abdullah Gül concurrently assuming the role of Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister . - Turkey, officially the Republic of Turkey (Turkish: ), is a transcontinental country in Eurasia, mainly in Anatolia in Western Asia, with a smaller portion on the Balkan peninsula in Southeast Europe.

The Aegean Sea is to the west, the Black Sea to the north, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. The Bosphorus, the Sea of Marmara, and the Dardanelles, which together form the Turkish Straits, divide Thrace and Anatolia; they also separate Europe and Asia.
