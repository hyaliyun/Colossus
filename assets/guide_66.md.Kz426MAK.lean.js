Cops said 24-year-old Lisa Gritzmaker, 34-year-old Amy Merrill, as well as their mother were shot at about 11:40pm on Friday in Blissfield, Michigan, about 20 miles northwest of Toledo, Ohio. Police found the women at the home after responding to a 911 call from one of the victims.

Many wars, and especially the Thirty Years' War, disrupted the university landscape throughout Europe at different times. War, plague, famine, regicide, and changes in religious power and structure often adversely affected the societies that provided support for universities. Internal strife within the universities themselves, such as student brawling and absentee professors, acted to destabilize these institutions as well. Universities were also reluctant to give up older curricula, and the continued reliance on the works of Aristotle defied contemporary advancements in science and the arts. This era was also affected by the rise of the nation-state. As universities increasingly came under state control, or formed under the auspices of the state, the faculty governance model (begun by the University of Paris) became more and more prominent. Although the older student-controlled universities still existed, they slowly started to move toward this structural organization. Control of universities still tended to be independent, although university leadership was increasingly appointed by the state. Which university is said to have started faculty governance?","response":"The University of Paris is said to have started the faculty governance model. This model later became more prominent as universities increasingly came under state control or formed under the auspices of the state, leading to a shift from student-controlled universities towards a more structured organization with university leadership being increasingly appointed by the state."},{"question":"Generate a sentence that includes all the following words: burn, candle, glass","response":"A candle can burn inside a glass to give us light."},{"question":"Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What areas were the introduction of the raccoon a success?, using the article: As a result of escapes and deliberate introductions in the mid-20th century, the raccoon is now distributed in several European and Asian countries. Sightings have occurred in all the countries bordering Germany, which hosts the largest population outside of North America. Another stable population exists in northern France, where several pet raccoons were released by members of the U.S. Air Force near the Laon-Couvron Air Base in 1966. Furthermore, raccoons have been known to be in the area around Madrid since the early 1970s. In 2013, the city authorized \\"the capture and death of any specimen\\". It is also present in Italy, with one reproductive population in Lombardy.About 1,240 animals were released in nine regions of the former Soviet Union between 1936 and 1958 for the purpose of establishing a population to be hunted for their fur. Two of these introductions were successful—one in the south of Belarus between 1954 and 1958, and another in Azerbaijan between 1941 and 1957. With a seasonal harvest of between 1,000 and 1,500 animals, in 1974 the estimated size of the population distributed in the Caucasus region was around 20,000 animals and the density was four animals per square kilometer (10 animals per square mile)., what would be the answer ? Answer:","response":"The areas where the introduction of the raccoon was a success include: 1. Germany: As the article states, Germany hosts the largest population of raccoons outside of North America, which indicates a successful introduction. 2.

The main culprits are those using the rivers for disposing of their waste. The rivers then empty into the ocean, often also bringing chemicals used as fertilizers in agriculture. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals in the water leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, also known as marine litter, is human-created waste that has ended up floating in a lake, sea, ocean, or waterway. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter.In addition, the Pacific Ocean has served as the crash site of satellites, including Mars 96, Fobos-Grunt, and Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite.

Ice ocean had few submarine volcanoes, while Tropical ocean had thousands of active volcanoes on the ocean floor. Which ocean had fewer hydrophones on the ocean floor? Answer:","response":"It is not possible to directly determine which ocean had fewer hydrophones on the ocean floor based solely on the information provided about the number of submarine volcanoes. Hydrophones are underwater microphones used to detect and record underwater sounds, and their presence is not directly related to the number of submarine volcanoes. However, we can attempt to infer a potential explanation. If researchers and scientists are more interested in monitoring the activity of underwater volcanoes, then they may place more hydrophones in the Tropical Ocean since it has thousands of active volcanoes on the ocean floor. This would mean that the Ice Ocean, with fewer submarine volcanoes, might have fewer hydrophones. However, this assumption is based on the premise that hydrophones are installed primarily for tracking volcanic activity, and without more information, we cannot definitively answer the question regarding hydrophone quantity in each ocean. Other factors, such as scientific research interests, accessibility, and budgetary constraints, could also influence the number of hydrophones installed in each ocean."},{"question":"Salı günü meclise seslenen Çvetanov, GERB'nin yolsuzlukla mücadele yönündeki seçim vaadini yerine getireceğini ve Bulgar halkının ülkenin yargı sistemi ve meclisine olan güvenini tekrar sağlamak için çalışacağını söyleyerek, yasaları delme yönündeki her türlü girişimin cezalandırılacağını da vurguladı.

A young man is in a bathroom attempting to shave his legs. he","response":"carefully positions himself on the edge of the tub, firmly gripping an ergonomically designed razor in his right hand. The smell of shaving foam fills the small, steamy room as he sprays an ample amount onto his hand and begins to methodically apply it to his left calf. He thoughtfully chose a fragrance-free foam, as he was always mindful of the sensitivity of his skin – a trait he inherited from his mother. Tiny droplets of water from the fogged-up mirror above the sink gradually roll down the glass, making an almost rhythmic sound as they splash onto the porcelain below. Drawing a deep breath, the young man braced himself for the first stroke of the blade. He recognized that to some, this might seem like a trivial or odd endeavor, yet for him, it was a right of passage in a personal journey towards self-discovery and acceptance. Memories of childhood filled his mind, as he recalled countless naïve questions his younger self had asked his father regarding why only his mother got to shave her legs. His father's dismissive laughter reverberated in his ears, echoing the conventional attitudes that had weighed on him like a heavy burden throughout his adolescence. With a renewed sense of determination, he slowly guided the razor along the contour of his calf muscles, being extra cautious not to nick his delicate skin in the process. Once the first shave was completed, he couldn't suppress a victorious smile as he rinsed the razor under the warm water, and the now detached hairs swirled down the drain. That smile was an affirmation of his ownership in defining his identity – a silent rebellion against the societal norms that tried to confine him. Upon completing the first leg, he carefully repeated the process on his right, remembering important tips he had learned from reading articles on the subject. With each slide of the razor, his confidence grew, and gradually, he saw his vision of himself – the person he truly wanted to be – materialize before his very eyes. For the first time in his life, he felt an unparalleled sense of freedom, as if he had finally unlocked a secret that set him apart from the rigid expectations placed upon him by others. With both legs now smoothly shaved, he marveled at the transformation he had accomplished in the confines of his own bathroom. Although it was only the first step in his journey, he knew that it signified to him a fundamental break from the constraints of his past. Wrapped in a newfound sense of empowerment, he vowed to embrace the aspects of himself that others questioned or misunderstood, and to never doubt his right to explore who he truly was. Meanwhile, outside the bathroom door, his sister waited impatiently, knocking loudly and complaining about how long he was taking. But inside that small, steamy space, a young man was reshaping his destiny, embarking on a path that would redefine his life and carve an uncharted trail for others who dared to challenge convention and forge their futures on their own terms."},{"question":"Off-roading<br>Sam bought a new four wheel drive truck.

According to the Chinese zodiac, Lee was born in both the hour and the year of the Dragon, which according to tradition is a strong and fortuitous omen. Lee and his parents returned to Hong Kong when he was three months old. Bruce's father, Lee Hoi-chuen, (Li Hai Quan ) was Han Chinese, and his mother, Grace Ho (He Ai Yu ), was of Eurasian ancestry. After attending Tak Sun School (De Xin Xue Xiao ) (several blocks from his home at 218 Nathan Road, Kowloon), Lee entered the primary school division of the Catholic La Salle College at the age of 12. In 1956, due to poor academic performance (or possibly poor conduct as well), he was transferred to St. Francis Xavier's College (high school), where he would be mentored by Brother Edward, a teacher and coach of the school boxing team. In 1958 Bruce won the Hong Kong schools boxing tournament, knocking out the previous champion in the final. In the spring of 1959, Lee got into another street fight and the police were called. Until his late teens, Lee's street fights became more frequent and included beating the son of a feared triad family. Eventually, Lee's father decided his son should leave Hong Kong to pursue a safer and healthier life in the United States. His parents confirmed the police's fear that this time Lee's opponent had an organised crime background, and there was the possibility that a contract was out for his life. The police detective came and he says \\"Excuse me Mr. Lee, your son is really fighting bad in school. If he gets into just one more fight I might have to put him in jail\\". In April 1959, Lee's parents decided to send him to the United States to stay with his older sister, Agnes Lee (Li Qiu Feng ), who was already living with family friends in San Francisco.

Solve -2033 = -3171*o + 3064*o for o.","response":"To solve -2033 = -3171*o + 3064*o for o, we begin by rewriting the equation in a more manageable form. -2033 = -3171*o + 3064*o We can combine the terms with the variable o: -2033 = (-3171 + 3064)*o Now, we'll sum the numbers inside the parenthesis: -2033 = (-107)*o Now, we need to isolate o by dividing both sides of the equation by -107: (-2033) / (-107) = (-107)*o / (-107) 19 = o Therefore, the value of o is 19.

(CNN) -- Now on the waiting list for a heart transplant, Anthony Stokes had a procedure Friday to insert a device to support the failing heart he has, a family spokesman said. The 15-year-old had a ventricular assist device, or VAD, implanted on Friday at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta at Egleston, family friend Mark Bell told CNN. A VAD is a mechanical pump that's used to support heart function and blood flow in people who have weakened hearts, according to the National Institutes of Health. It includes a small tube that carries blood out of the heart into a pump, and another tube carries blood from the pump to blood vessels. The vessels deliver the blood to the body.

The other options are incorrect because: 1. Anthony Stokes: He is the patient and wouldn't be providing medical information about his eligibility. 2. Atlanta, Egleston, Georgia: These are places and can't provide information. 3. CNN: CNN is reporting the news, not providing medical information about the patient. 4. Mark Bell: He is the family friend, not the medical professional in charge of the case. 5.

Choices: - victory - being ahead - winning prize - new option - fall The rationale to choose \\"being ahead\\" as the answer is that: The answer is:","response":"Being ahead. Step 1: Analyze the question The question asks about the result of having a reaching advantage in a race. This implies a situation where a competitor has a longer reach or an ability to cover more distance compared to others. Step 2: Examine each choice 1. Victory: While having a reaching advantage may increase the chances of winning, it does not guarantee victory. Other factors, such as skill, strategy, and stamina, also play a crucial role in determining the winner of a race. 2. Being ahead: Having a reaching advantage in a race implies that the competitor with the advantage will likely be ahead of the others. This is because the longer reach or ability to cover more distance means they will make more progress in each stride or movement. 3. Winning prize: Winning a prize is a possible outcome of winning a race, but it doesn't relate directly to the reaching advantage. 4. New option: This choice is vague and doesn't provide a clear answer. 5. Fall: This choice is unrelated to having a reaching advantage in a race and does not explain the result of such an advantage. Step 3: Choose the most suitable answer Based on the analysis of each choice, \\"being ahead\\" is the most suitable answer as it directly relates to having a reaching advantage in a race and explains the outcome of such an advantage."},{"question":"Determine the sentiment: Once when I was in college and we had an international fair, the Russian section had a Soviet-era poster saying \\"Ne boltay!\\", meaning \\"Don't gossip!\\". I \\"translated\\" it for the \\"generation\\" of TV watchers as \\"Don't be Gladys Kravitz!\\" (in reference to the nosy neighbor on \\"Bewitched\\"). However, when you see the result of gossip in the Pvt. Snafu short \\"Rumors\\", you see that it's not quite a laughing matter. In this case, the perpetually witless soldier overhears something about bombing and immediately assumes that the Axis Powers have attacked the United States. So, he tells it to someone, who tells someone else, who tells someone else, and it continues. As in \\"The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming\\", the story gets blown more and more out of proportion each time, so that when it gets back to Snafu...well, you know what I mean! Yes, it's mostly WWII propaganda - complete with a derogatory term for the Japanese - but I have to say that the Pvt. Snafu shorts were actually quite funny. Of course, since they had Dr. Seuss writing and Mel Blanc providing the voices, it's no surprise that these came out rather cool. Worth seeing.","response":"The sentiment in your description can be interpreted as a mix of humor, nostalgia, and a critical outlook towards the consequences of gossip. Initially, you reminisce about a college memory and share a lighthearted connection between the Russian poster and a TV character reference, indicating an amusing and nostalgic sentiment. Then, you transition into a more serious tone, discussing the negative outcome of gossip as portrayed in the Pvt. Snafu short \\"Rumors\\", which demonstrates a more critical outlook. While acknowledging that Pvt. Snafu shorts were intended as WWII propaganda and contained some derogatory terms, you also appreciate and praise the humor and creativity of the content, mentioning the notable contributors like Dr. Seuss and Mel Blanc. This suggests that your overall sentiment towards the Pvt. Snafu shorts is positive and appreciative, recognizing them as \\"worth seeing\\" and \\"rather cool\\". In summary, your sentiment can be seen as a blend of humor, nostalgia, and critical insight into the consequences of gossip, demonstrating a balance between lighthearted memories and addressing sensitive topics."},{"question":"Q:Information: - East Asia is the eastern subregion of the Asian continent, which can be defined in either geographical or ethno-cultural terms.

However, the preposition \\"on\\" and the second object \\"painting\\" do not form a coherent idea. It seems there's either a grammatical error or a missing word which is causing the sentence to not make sense. A possible correction would be: \\"He put an electric fan near the painting.\\" Based on this analysis, Sentence B doesn't make sense in its current form, whereas Sentence A does.

The great neighborhood crow war at Portage Bay has not ended, and not surprisingly, it’s lawsuit time. Say, 200,000? Lisa and Gary Mann, and their young daughter, for a couple of years have been feeding the birds at their home in the 1000 block of East Shelby Street. Says the lawsuit, “As many as six times per day Defendants refilled and continue to refill the emptied troughs of food with peanuts and other bird foods for the seagulls, crows, and pigeons to feast upon.” Neighbors said that anywhere from 30 to 100 crows would hover during the feedings. You bet that they brought up the swarming, attacking avian images from Hitchcock’s 1963 horror film, “The Birds.” The civil lawsuit, filed Monday in King County Superior Court, was brought by Christine Yokan, a pension-fund investment manager who lives on one side of the Manns, and Matt Ashbach, an ear, nose and throat doctor, who lives on the other side of the Manns. Gary Mann is a surgical oncologist. The 200,000 sought in the lawsuit includes claims of property damage exceeding 75,000 for cleaning, painting and replacing permanently damaged property on houses, decks, yard lights, walkways, sheds. Crow facts There are 40 species of crows, and they live everywhere except Antarctica. They have numerous calls. A distress call brings other crows to their defense. Crows will eat practically anything — roadkill, fast food, mice. An adult crow needs nearly ¾ of a pound of food daily. The origin of “eating crow” has been lost. In one version, during the War of 1812, a British officer made an American soldier eat part of a crow he had shot in British territory. It also includes a non-specified amount for loss “of enjoyment of property, inconvenience, and emotional distress.” And attorney’s fees. Back in April, the neighbors had high hopes quiet would be restored. In an email, Lisa Mann wrote that “we are moving to Houston this summer as my husband accepted a faculty surgical position … ” But an online search doesn’t show the Mann residence up for sale, nor having been sold. Lisa Mann did not return voice-mail and email messages for comment. Janice Palm, a psychotherapist who lives across the alley from the Manns, says she gave up putting flowers in her planters because the crows pulled them. She’s not part of the lawsuit. She says about the Manns moving, “Only in our dreams.” Meanwhile, the lawsuit says, “Large numbers of birds swarm the feeding operations daily, leaving behind dirt, feathers, peanut particles and shells, feces, and urine on the surrounding properties … Neighbors with family members who have severe peanut allergies have pled with Defendants … ” That lawsuit describes a litany of illnesses carried by rodents, crows and pigeons. And more, “ … there are also frequent periods of excessive noise from dozens of birds squawking from dawn until dusk. “While some periods of time are quiet, there are periods of time — which sometimes exceed two hours in duration and occur multiple times per day — in which the cawing of crows and the noises from other birds continues unabated and can be heard at a high volume even when one is inside the home.” And more, “Plaintiffs had never before observed a single rat on their properties. After defendants began feeding the wildlife, Plaintiffs observed a noticeable rat population … ” It has been Lisa Mann who has had the most dealings with the neighbors. She also was the one quoted in a BBC News story (then reprinted in Crosscut, an online Seattle publication) that described in glowing terms the feeding of the crows. It was titled, “The girl who gets gifts from birds.” It told how the Manns’ 8-year-old daughter originally began sharing her school lunch with crows, and how that led to the birds leaving her gifts such as an earring or polished rock. Katy Sewall, author of the BBC piece, never mentioned the neighborhood hassles over the crows in the story, which went worldwide. “The neighborhood tensions were never my focus,” she wrote in an email. But the tensions certainly escalated. At one point, Lisa Mann called the cops after an argument with a neighbor up the hill. The previous night, Mann told the cops, she had heard what sounded like rifle shots. The neighbors, meanwhile, contacted the City Council and Public Health — Seattle & King County with a petition signed by 51 of them, asking for help. Public Health did issue a notice of violation to the Manns for bird food accessible to rats. The Manns took the necessary measures, such as raising the feeder above ground and on smooth poles. The confrontations continued. In one email, Lisa Mann said that Matt Ashbach, her neighbor to the east who now is suing, took a dead crow “and illegally hung it in effigy off of his third-floor balcony of his million-dollar mansion.” Ashbach says he did find a dead crow and hung it from his balcony, a method he learned growing up on a farm to warn off other crows. (Not illegal, according to Seattle Animal Shelter.) Anna Johnsen, who represents Ashbach and Yokan, says a trial date has been set for a year from now — Aug. 6, 2016. A long time in crowing time. “My clients hope the feeding will stop before then,” she says. Meanwhile, Johnsen is asking the Manns to not feed the birds more than a quarter-pound of food a day. “My clients don’t want to limit anyone’s freedom,” she says. “We think that’s very reasonable.” Of course, that all depends on what your definition of reasonable is. ||||| By David Ham and KIRO 7 STAFF Earlier this year a story about an 8-year-old Seattle girl’s relationship with crows went viral. Gabi Mann started feeding crows daily two years ago and the birds would leave her trinkets. However, her Portage Bay neighbors said the murder of crows would caw and leave droppings throughout the neighborhood. “The neighbors went to her and said please this is causing a problem,” said neighbor Janice Palm. >> KIRO 7 reported that the neighbors signed a petition to get Gabi’s family to stop feeding the crows. “People are having rat problems in their houses with the waste from the crows and the peanut shells are all over the place,” said Palm On Monday, two of those neighbors filed a lawsuit against Gabi’s parents Lisa and Gary Mann. “The case is against two adults. The scope and scale of the feeding is not the work of a minor child. The mother, Lisa Mann, is responsible for the vast majority of the bird feeding. Gary and Lisa Mann have also constructed extraordinarily large feeding stations and hired employees to help carry out the feedings. The feeding and related activities have run nearly every day, year-round, from the morning hours to as late as midnight,” said Anna Johnsen, attorney for the two homeowners that filed the lawsuit. In the lawsuit, other neighbors tried to talk with and write letters to Lisa and Gary Mann requesting “they stop or seriously downsize their mass wildlife feeding operation.” However the situation escalated. “I can't imagine living in a neighborhood and ignoring what my neighbors are asking me to do, what's very very reasonable that's affecting us so much,” said Palm who is also considering joining the lawsuit. Neighbors contacted city and state officials, stated in the lawsuit. But no significant action was done. According to the lawsuit, neighbors say they're owed 200,000 for damage caused by the birds The Manns have not responded to the lawsuit and a trial date has not been set.

One young girl in Seattle is luckier than most. She feeds the crows in her garden - and they bring her gifts in return. Eight-year-old Gabi Mann sets a bead storage container on the dining room table, and clicks the lid open. This is her most precious collection. \\"You may take a few close looks,\\" she says, \\"but don't touch.\\" It's a warning she's most likely practised on her younger brother. She laughs after saying it though. She is happy for the audience. Inside the box are rows of small objects in clear plastic bags. One label reads: \\"Black table by feeder. 2:30 p.m. 09 Nov 2014.\\" Inside is a broken light bulb. Another bag contains small pieces of brown glass worn smooth by the sea. \\"Beer coloured glass,\\" as Gabi describes it. Each item is individually wrapped and categorised. Gabi pulls a black zip out of a labelled bag and holds it up. \\"We keep it in as good condition as we can,\\" she says, before explaining this object is one of her favourites. There's a miniature silver ball, a black button, a blue paper clip, a yellow bead, a faded black piece of foam, a blue Lego piece, and the list goes on. Many of them are scuffed and dirty. It is an odd assortment of objects for a little girl to treasure, but to Gabi these things are more valuable than gold. Image copyright Katy Sewall Image copyright Katy Sewall She didn't gather this collection. Each item was a gift - given to her by crows. She holds up a pearl coloured heart. It is her most-prized present. \\"It's showing me how much they love me.\\" If you want to form a bond with a crow, be consistent in rewarding them John Marzluff, Prof of wildlife science Gabi's relationship with the neighbourhood crows began accidentally in 2011. She was four years old, and prone to dropping food. She'd get out of the car, and a chicken nugget would tumble off her lap. A crow would rush in to recover it. Soon, the crows were watching for her, hoping for another bite. As she got older, she rewarded their attention, by sharing her packed lunch on the way to the bus stop. Her brother joined in. Soon, crows were lining up in the afternoon to greet Gabi's bus, hoping for another feeding session. Gabi's mother Lisa didn't mind that crows consumed most of the school lunches she packed. \\"I like that they love the animals and are willing to share,\\" she says, while admitting she never noticed crows until her daughter took an interest in them. \\"It was a kind of transformation. I never thought about birds.\\" In 2013, Gabi and Lisa started offering food as a daily ritual, rather than dropping scraps from time to time. Each morning, they fill the backyard birdbath with fresh water and cover bird-feeder platforms with peanuts. Gabi throws handfuls of dog food into the grass. As they work, crows assemble on the telephone lines, calling loudly to them. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Gabi feeding birds in her garden It was after they adopted this routine that the gifts started appearing. The crows would clear the feeder of peanuts, and leave shiny trinkets on the empty tray; an earring, a hinge, a polished rock. There wasn't a pattern. Gifts showed up sporadically - anything shiny and small enough to fit in a crow's mouth. One time it was a tiny piece of metal with the word \\"best\\" printed on it. \\"I don't know if they still have the part that says 'friend',\\" Gabi laughs, amused by the thought of a crow wearing a matching necklace. When you see Gabi's collection, it's hard not to wish for gift-giving crows of your own. \\"If you want to form a bond with a crow, be consistent in rewarding them,\\" advises John Marzluff, professor of wildlife science at the University of Washington. He specialises in birds, particularly crows and ravens. Image copyright Lisa Mann What food is best? \\"A few peanuts in the shell,\\" he says. \\"It's a high-energy food… and it makes noise when you throw it on the ground, so they hear it and they quickly habituate to your routine.\\" Marzluff, and his colleague Mark Miller, did a study of crows and the people who feed them. They found that crows and people form a very personal relationship. \\"There's definitely a two-way communication going on there,\\" Marzluff says. \\"They understand each other's signals.\\" The birds communicate by how they fly, how close they walk, and where they sit. The human learns their language and the crows learn their feeder's patterns and posture. They start to know and trust each other. Sometimes a crow leaves a gift. But crow gifts are not guaranteed. \\"I can't say they always will (give presents),\\" Marzluff admits, having never received any gifts personally, \\"but I have seen an awful lot of things crows have brought people.\\" Not all crows deliver shiny objects either. Sometimes they give the kind of presents \\"they would give to their mate\\", says Marzluff. \\"Courtship feeding, for example. So some people, their presents are dead baby birds that the crow brings in.\\" Image copyright Lisa Mann Gabi has been given some icky objects. Her mother threw out a rotting crab claw, for example. Gabi points out a heavily rusted screw she prefers not to touch. It's labelled \\"Third Favorite.\\" Asking her why an untouchable object is in the favourites, she answers, \\"You don't' see a crow carrying around a screw that much. Unless it's trying to build its house.\\" Lisa, Gabi's mom, regularly photographs the crows and charts their behaviour and interactions. Her most amazing gift came just a few weeks ago, when she lost a lens cap in a nearby alley while photographing a bald eagle as it circled over the neighbourhood. Image copyright Lisa Mann She didn't even have to look for it. It was sitting on the edge of the birdbath. Had the crows returned it? Lisa logged on to her computer and pulled up their bird-cam. There was the crow she suspected. \\"You can see it bringing it into the yard. Walks it to the birdbath and actually spends time rinsing this lens cap.\\" \\"I'm sure that it was intentional,\\" she smiles. \\"They watch us all the time. I'm sure they knew I dropped it. I'm sure they decided they wanted to return it.\\" Writer and broadcaster Katy Sewall is co-host of The BitterSweet Life podcast.\\" She's been a journalist and radio professional for 12 years.

This opera, created by the Italian composer Giacomo Puccini, is based on the short story \\"Madame Butterfly\\" written by John Luther Long in 1898, which in turn, was inspired by Pierre Loti's 1887 novel \\"Madame Chrysanthème.\\" \\"Madama Butterfly\\" is a three-act opera that premiered on February 17, 1904, at La Scala opera house in Milan, Italy. It is widely regarded as one of the most famous and tragic love stories in the world of opera. The story is set in the early 20th century in Nagasaki, Japan, and revolves around a young Japanese geisha named Cio-Cio San (also known as Butterfly) and a U.S. Navy officer, Lieutenant Benjamin Franklin Pinkerton. In the opera, Lieutenant Pinkerton is stationed in Japan and becomes infatuated with Cio-Cio San. He enters into a temporary marriage with her, viewing it as a casual, short-term relationship before returning to the United States. Unbeknownst to Pinkerton, Butterfly wholeheartedly believes in their love and the permanency of their marriage. She even converts to Christianity and renounces her own religion, further isolating herself from her family and community. After their wedding night, Pinkerton leaves Butterfly and returns to the United States, promising to return soon. In his absence, Butterfly gives birth to their son, but she suffers greatly as she faithfully awaits his return. When Pinkerton finally returns after three years, he is accompanied by his American wife, Kate. They discover that Butterfly has had a child and now hope to take the boy back to the United States with them. Realizing that Pinkerton never truly loved her and that he intends to take their son away from her, Butterfly is unable to bear the pain and humiliation. In a heart-wrenching climax, she resolves to spare her son from disgrace and preserve her honor. In a final act of sacrifice, Butterfly chooses to end her life, allowing her son to have a better future with Pinkerton and Kate.

Felipe Calderon's party loses lead in Mexico's lower house. Mexican president held responsible for economic downturn, analysts say. PRI has 36.8 percent of vote to 27.9 percent for Calderon's PAN, news agency says. Write an article based on these highlights.","response":"Title: PAN President German Martinez Resigns as Party Faces Defeat in Lower House Amid Economic Crisis Introduction: The recent economic downturn in Mexico has led to a significant shift in the political landscape. As a result, German Martinez, the president of the National Action Party (PAN), has announced his resignation, with the party also losing its lead in the country's lower house. In this article, we will delve into the factors that led to Martinez's resignation and explore the possible ramifications for Mexican politics. Step 1: Elaborate on German Martinez's resignation and PAN's electoral loss German Martinez, the president of PAN, Mexico's center-right political party, has resigned in the aftermath of the party's defeat in the recent elections. The resignation comes as Felipe Calderon's PAN party lost its majority in the Chamber of Deputies, Mexico's lower house of Congress. This reflects a significant blow to the ruling party and showcases a loss of public support. Step 2: Discuss the Mexican economic downturn and its impact on the PAN party The economic downturn in Mexico has been a major contributing factor to the PAN party's decline in popularity. Analysts argue that Mexican President Felipe Calderon is held responsible for the country's economic crisis, which has seen the country face rising unemployment rates and increased poverty levels. Concerns over the government's economic policies and handling of the situation have led to a loss of public trust and political backlash. Step 3: Highlight the PRI's success in the recent elections As PAN loses its lead, the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) has emerged as the new political heavyweight, garnering 36.8 percent of the vote in comparison to the PAN's 27.9 percent, according to news agency reports. The PRI's success can be attributed to its promises of addressing the economic crisis and bringing stability to the Mexican political environment. Step 4: Explore the potential ramifications of the change in political power The change in political power and the resignation of German Martinez have broader implications for the Mexican political spectrum. A strengthened PRI poses a challenge to the PAN's future political endeavors, as does the loss of public trust in Calderon's administration. His party may find it increasingly difficult to regain its foothold within the Mexican populace, especially if the economic situation doesn't improve. Conclusion: The resignation of PAN President German Martinez, the loss of the party's lead in the lower house, and the rise of the PRI signify a pivotal shift in Mexico's political landscape. These recent developments are emblematic of the public's dissatisfaction with the government's handling of the economic crisis, resulting in a potential power shift that will have lasting implications for the country's future political direction."},{"question":"Generate a short summary this sentence: romania and uruguay want to develop and diversify their cooperation , stressed on thursday romanian president traian basescu .

Harrison after Laughrea pushes a table on him, spoofing the famous \\"Han Solo in Carbonite\\" prop from The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi The next evening he finds a note from Lauren in his car which summons him to the Goodhue residence. When he goes to the Goodhue mansion, he bumps into Sean Laughrea (Aaron Pearl), who has just killed Goodhue (together with an unknown accomplice). A violent fight follows, during which Harrison discovers that Sean is missing an eye, an arm, and a leg, and he overhears the preparations for an operation with the codename \\"Highlander\\" before he is knocked out. When he wakes up, Harrison finds himself arrested and convicted for the murder of Goodhue. Desperate to prove his innocence, Harrison escapes from his prison transport following an accident. Lieutenant Fergus Falls (Richard Crenna) arrives on the scene, takes charge, barks out orders and vows to do whatever it takes to capture the fugitive. Harrison returns to the Goodhue mansion where he encounters Cass, who is trying to retrieve something from behind a portrait. She tells him she knows he is innocent and believes Lauren is the killer, but refuses to say anything to the police because Lauren is her sister. She provides him with a place to hide and helps him shake his pursuers, but Harrison's opportunities to rest are short and fleeting: Falls seems to find him wherever he goes, and Cass behaves suspiciously, increasing Harrison's doubts of whom to trust. Harrison gradually begins to piece together the puzzle; he remembers that Sean was present at the party as the bartender and was given a great... My question: What is the name of Goodhue's wife?

Apple can run at a rate of 3 miles per hour. Mac can run at a rate of 4 miles per hour. In minutes, how much faster will Mac run a 24 mile race?","response":"To determine how much faster Mac will run a 24-mile race compared to Apple, we need to first calculate the time it takes for each of them to finish the race individually, then compare their finish times. Here is a step-by-step reasoning process: 1. Determine the formula to calculate time: Time = Distance/Speed 2. Calculate the time it takes for Apple to run the 24 miles: - Speed: 3 miles per hour - Distance: 24 miles - Time for Apple: 24 miles / 3 mph = 8 hours 3. Calculate the time it takes for Mac to run the 24 miles: - Speed: 4 miles per hour - Distance: 24 miles - Time for Mac: 24 miles / 4 mph = 6 hours 4. Determine the difference in time taken by Apple and Mac to find out how much faster Mac will run: - Time difference: Time of Apple - Time of Mac - Time difference: 8 hours - 6 hours = 2 hours 5.

Your task is to generate the question for the answer based on the given article. Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Article: (CNN)-China will sometimes say \\"no\\" and the world should get used to it. That message came through when China joined Russia in blocking action on Syria. \\"Do not mistakenly think that because China takes a careful and responsible position on the Syria issue, China will not use its veto power or will always abstain ,\\" said Cui Tiankai, China's vice foreign minister, \\"When China must use its veto power to say no, it will surely use it.\\" On Saturday, Susan Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, called the vetoes \\"disgusting and shameful.\\" He Wenping, director of African Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said the veto shows China's confidence in foreign affairs. \\"A country expressing its true opinion - that's progress. China opposes the use of threat or force to achieve regime change in other countries. This agrees with China's long-standing diplomacy principle. It is also not acceptable for China to rush a U.N. vote without sufficient discussion.\\" So why did China use its veto this time? China's critics say China's veto of the U.N. draft proposal was in part due to Beijing's fear that allowing a regime change in Syria could encourage the spread of the Arab revolution and eventually threaten China. He Wenping disagrees, \\"China has a completely different political system and economic development path. If someone in the international community thinks that the Arab Spring will happen in China, then I think they misjudge the situation in China, exaggerate some problems in the Chinese society and underestimate the ability of the Chinese government to control the situation in China.\\" Answer: China should not have veto power in the U.N.

Boasting superb performances and a thought-provoking story, Interstellar stands tall amongst other space exploration movies as it dares to tackle big scientific ideas while remaining firmly grounded in its portrayal of human relationships and survival. Set in a dystopian future where Earth is no longer able to sustain human life due to crop failures and food shortages, the story follows Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a former NASA pilot and engineer, who is now a farmer. When Cooper stumbles upon a hidden NASA facility led by Professor Brand (Michael Caine), he learns about a plan to search for a potentially habitable planet where humanity can relocate. Cooper is then tasked with leading an expedition through a wormhole to explore these new worlds, leaving behind his two children, Tom and Murph. One of Interstellar's greatest strengths is its impeccable storytelling. Nolan's script, co-written with his brother Jonathan, weaves hard scientific concepts with a deeply emotional narrative. The film explores complex theories like time dilation, wormholes, and black holes, without becoming bogged down in complicated jargon. Instead, the audience is treated to a thrilling adventure as the characters traverse the depths of space and the limits of human understanding. The visual aspect of Interstellar is a magnificent achievement. The film takes viewers across stunning landscapes, from the vast cornfields of Earth to the icy tundras and turbulent oceans of alien planets. The CGI is spectacular and convincing, particularly when it comes to the visually arresting black hole, Gargantua. The combination of practical effects with CGI creates a seamless suspension of disbelief. Another standout feature of Interstellar is the exceptional acting. Matthew McConaughey delivers an Oscar-worthy portrayal of Cooper, a man torn between his love for his family and his duty to save humanity. Anne Hathaway, as the determined and intelligent Dr. Amelia Brand, proves once again she's more than capable of handling weighty and complex roles. The supporting cast, including Jessica Chastain and Michael Caine, further elevates the movie with their stellar performances. Hans Zimmer's magnificent score complements the visuals wonderfully, drawing viewers even deeper into the film's atmosphere. From the haunting organ theme to the soaring, emotional crescendos, Zimmer's score is truly a character all its own, heightening the intensity of some scenes while emphasizing the solace and isolation of others. However, Interstellar is not without its flaws. The film requires a significant suspension of disbelief, especially when it comes to certain scientific aspects and plot twists. There are occasional moments where the film's pace seems to slow down, and a running time of nearly three hours may feel long to some viewers. Despite these minor issues, the impact of the film's overall message and the sheer brilliance of the filmmaking make these concerns almost inconsequential. In conclusion, Interstellar is a mind-bending, heart-wrenching, and visually stunning masterpiece that goes beyond the stars to delve into the depths of human emotion and resilience. With its incredible cast, awe-inspiring visuals, and thought-provoking narrative, Interstellar is not just a movie about space exploration but a testament to human spirit and ingenuity. Christopher Nolan once again solidifies his reputation as a visionary filmmaker, delivering a movie experience that will undoubtedly resonate with viewers long after the credits roll.

Sadly, my experience there was far from impressive and, frankly, left me wondering how on earth it has garnered so much attention. Upon entering the establishment, I immediately noticed the cluttered and disorganized layout of the venue. There seemed to be a significant lack of thought put into the arrangement of the furniture and decor, leaving an unpleasant impression that persisted throughout my visit. The noise level was another major issue. A live band was performing, and while I appreciate the inclusion of music in a dining experience, the volume was ear-shatteringly loud, drowning out any attempts at conversation with my friends. A good restaurant knows how to strike a balance between ambiance and allowing patrons to enjoy their company, but The Trendy Spot clearly struggled with this. Moving on to the service, it was nothing short of abysmal. It took nearly 15 minutes just to be greeted by our server, who proceeded to be inattentive and offered minimal help throughout the meal. We had to repeatedly flag them down to place orders, ask for refills on our drinks, and request missing cutlery. Of course, one can forgive subpar atmosphere and service if the food is outstanding. Regrettably, The Trendy Spot failed to deliver on that front as well. The menu, which claimed to showcase a diverse range of innovative dishes, in reality, turned out to be an overpriced mishmash of culinary cliches. I ordered the \\"signature\\" dish, a supposedly delectable fusion cuisine-based entrée, only to find that it utterly lacked flavor and was poorly executed. To make matters worse, the portions were surprisingly small given their exorbitant price tags. We had to order multiple appetizers and side dishes just to feel somewhat satisfied, further inflating our already unreasonably high bill. Lastly, the overall cleanliness of the place was concerning. From the dingy lighting to the sticky table surfaces, it was clear that little effort was put into maintaining hygiene and an inviting atmosphere. This put a significant damper on the entire experience, as I found myself worrying about the state of the kitchen and the cleanliness of my meal. In conclusion, my visit to The Trendy Spot was undoubtedly a major letdown. The lackluster atmosphere, poor service, mediocre food, small portions, high prices, and questionable cleanliness are all reasons enough to not recommend this establishment to others. With so many exceptional venues in the area, I urge you to consider alternative options for your dining and entertainment needs. Save your time, money, and taste buds from an extremely disappointing experience, and skip The Trendy Spot."},{"question":"Article: Orthodox Judaism holds that on Mount Sinai, the Written Law was transmitted along with an Oral Law.

In everyday usage, temperature indicates a measure of how hot or cold an object is. Temperature is an important parameter in chemistry. When a substance changes from solid to liquid, it is because there was an increase in the temperature of the material. Chemical reactions usually proceed faster if the temperature is increased. Many unstable materials (such as enzymes) will be viable longer at lower temperatures. Now, I have a new situation: Alexander is conducting reactions in his college chemistry class. In his first reaction, reaction A, he uses a high strength burner so the temperature of the reaction is high. In the second reaction, reaction B, he uses a weaker model of burner, so the temperature of the reaction is low. Answer this question please: Which reaction will proceed slower? A:","response":"In the given situation, reaction B will proceed slower. This is due to the fact that it is being conducted at a lower temperature compared to reaction A. As mentioned in the background information, chemical reactions usually proceed faster if the temperature is increased. This increase in temperature allows the particles in the reacting substances to have more kinetic energy, leading to more frequent and energetic collisions between the particles. This, in turn, increases the rate at which the reaction occurs. In contrast, when the temperature is lowered, the particles in the reacting substances have less kinetic energy, resulting in fewer and weaker collisions between particles. As a consequence, the reaction rate decreases. Therefore, in Alexander's college chemistry class, reaction A will proceed faster due to the higher temperature provided by the high strength burner, while reaction B will proceed slower due to the lower temperature from the weaker model of burner. It is important to note that other factors like the concentration of the reactants and the presence of catalysts can also influence the rate of the reactions, but in this specific example, temperature is the main factor causing the difference in reaction speeds."},{"question":"Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the single mother's older son? , can you please find it? A NASA spacecraft lands on an unknown planet and begins to take rock and soil samples. Four aliens discover it and are sucked into the craft through its vacuum tube, after which it makes its way back to Earth. The aliens are able to escape from a government base by using their powers (with which they can destroy or heal anything they touch). During the escape, the youngest one hides in a passing van, occupied by a boy named Eric Cruise who uses a wheelchair, his older brother, Michael, and their single mother, Janet, who are moving to California from Illinois. Shortly after the Cruise family arrives at their new home, Eric becomes suspicious of the alien's presence. The next morning, he finds that the creature has trashed most of the house and learns its identity, but is blamed alongside his brother by their mother for what has happened. After seeing the creature again, Eric tries to catch up to him, but ends up sliding down a hill and falls into a lake, where he nearly drowns, but is rescued by the alien. Eric is not believed at all when he tries to tell his family about the creature's actions. Later that night, he sets a trap with the help of his new friend, Debbie, who had also seen the alien. The two trap him inside a vacuum cleaner, which malfunctions and causes the entire neighborhood to suffer a power surge.

Their job was to tell stories about people running in a race. This wasn't a running race like you see in school, but a race for an important job, like being a leader of a country or a city. The race was called an election. Now, you might be wondering why these campaign reporters are behind the curve. No, they didn't fall behind in a game of tag. \\"Behind the curve\\" means that they're not doing their job as well as they could or keeping up with changes that make it easier to do their job better. Here are some reasons why campaign reporters might be behind the curve: 1. Too Much Noise: Imagine you're trying to listen to your favorite song, but there are lots of people talking at the same time. That would make it hard to listen, right? Just like that, campaign reporters have to listen to many people talking about the election. Sometimes, they miss important information because there's just too much noise. 2. Old Ways of Telling Stories: Remember when grandma told you how she used to listen to stories on the radio? Well, back then, they didn't have TVs or the internet to watch videos or get news instantly like we do now. Some reporters still use old ways of telling stories, like newspapers and long articles, instead of fun videos or interactive ways that help people understand better. 3. They Like to Guess: You know how sometimes you guess which colors will be in the rainbow, but you're not always right? Campaign reporters do that too! They try to guess who will win the election or which ideas people like best. But, sometimes, they're wrong, just like we can be wrong about rainbow colors. 4. Talking to the Same Friends: Let's say you want to know if everyone in school likes ice cream. If you only ask your best friends, you won't know what others think, right? Campaign reporters sometimes talk to the same people over and over again, so they might not build a clear picture of what everyone believes. 5. Forgetting to Ask Us: We're kids, but we're still a part of the world, aren't we? Sometimes, campaign reporters forget to ask kids and other people who are different from them about their thoughts on the election. That can make their stories feel incomplete, like a puzzle with missing pieces. So, that's why campaign reporters might be behind the curve. They're not in trouble or doing anything wrong, like forgetting to eat their veggies. They just need to learn new ways to listen better, tell stories, and ask more people, including kids like us, about their thoughts on that important job race, the election!"},{"question":"Triple: Barny Cakes COUNTRY France; France LANGUAGE French language What is a sentence that describes this triple?","response":"The Barny Cakes, a delightful and renowned baked treat originating from the picturesque country of France, are deeply steeped in the nation's culture and best enjoyed by appreciators of the exquisite French language."},{"question":"Dear Jeff, I just wanted to let you know that you will be greatly missed here.

Liam started reading about apex predators, while Fox read about grazers and large herbivores. Which cousin learned less about wildlife management? Hint: An apex predator, also known as an alpha predator or top predator, is a predator at the top of a food chain, with no natural predators.Apex predators are usually defined in terms of trophic dynamics, meaning that they occupy the highest trophic levels. Food chains are often far shorter on land, usually limited to being secondary consumers – for example, wolves prey mostly upon large herbivores (primary consumers), which eat plants (primary producers). The apex predator concept is applied in wildlife management, conservation and ecotourism. Answer:","response":"Based on the information provided, it is likely that Fox learned less about wildlife management compared to Liam. The reason behind this is that the apex predator concept is directly applied in wildlife management, conservation, and ecotourism. Since Liam was reading about apex predators, he would naturally learn more about these related topics. On the other hand, Fox was reading about grazers and large herbivores, which are lower down in the food chain. While these animals also play an important role in ecosystems, their study might not encompass wildlife management to the same extent as apex predators. Therefore, it can be inferred that Fox learned less about wildlife management during his research in comparison to Liam."},{"question":"Translate \\"Tama Polska Ltd. is an independent division of Tama Plastic Industry, the world's largest manufacturer of agricultural nets for press balling.\\" to Russian?","response":"Тама Польска Лтд. - это отдельное подразделение Тама Пластик Индастри, крупнейшего в мире производителя сельскохозяйственных сеток для прессования шаров.

Explosions have long-lasting negative implications for both individual organisms and entire ecosystems. By understanding the ways in which explosions can cause harm to an organism, we can gain a deeper appreciation for the delicate balance that exists within nature and the importance of minimizing our impact on the environment. The destructive forces of an explosion can affect organisms in various ways, including physical damage, habitat destruction, pollution and contamination of food sources, and psychological distress. 1. Physical damage: The shockwave and concussive force generated from an explosion can cause severe physical trauma to an organism's body structure. This may include crushed or shattered bones, tissue damage, or indirect injuries resulting from being thrown or hit by debris. Additionally, high temperatures and the release of energy from an explosion can cause burns and cellular damage to an organism, which could have immediate or long-term health consequences. 2. Habitat destruction: Explosions can cause widespread destruction of an organism's habitat, such as forests, wetlands, or grasslands, making it impossible for them to survive in those areas. This destruction severely reduces or eliminates the availability of essential resources such as food, water, and shelter, which can lead to decreased population sizes or even species extinction. The loss of a species from a habitat can have cascading effects on other species within the ecosystem, as each organism plays a specific role in maintaining the balance and dynamics of the environment. 3. Pollution and contamination of food sources: The by-products and toxic substances released during an explosion may contaminate the environment, impacting the quality and safety of food sources. These contaminants can then enter the food chain, exposing organisms to dangerous levels of harmful substances. In turn, this can have detrimental effects on an organism's overall health, reproductive success, and ability to find and consume sufficient food resources. 4. Psychological distress: Explosions can also cause fear and distress for organisms sensitive to sudden loud noises and environmental changes. For example, a sudden loud noise can scare animals and cause them to flee their habitats, which can leave them vulnerable to predation or unable to find essential resources in their new location. Furthermore, the loss of a habitat and disruption to social structures can affect an organism's ability to reproduce and maintain their population, leading to long-term consequences for the entire ecosystem. In summary, explosions have the potential to cause significant harm to organisms through a variety of mechanisms, including direct physical damage, habitat destruction, pollution and contamination of food sources, and psychological distress. By understanding the diverse ways in which explosions can impact organisms and their ecosystems, we can strive to minimize our actions that contribute to such destruction and work towards a more sustainable and harmonious relationship with the natural world."},{"question":"See the multi-choice question below: Sentence 1: It's probably safe to say Clinton's real feelings for Lewinsky actually go in another direction; see the Anne Boleyn theory, above.) Sentence 2: Clinton has alternate feelings for Lewinsky. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true? OPTIONS: (1). yes; (2). it is not possible to tell; (3). no;","response":"(1). Yes The answer is yes. To understand this, let's break down both sentences and analyze their meaning. In Sentence 1, there are two important aspects to consider. Firstly, the statement is based on the premise of \\"probably safe to say.\\" This implies that there is strong reason to believe what follows, but it is not absolute certainty. Secondly, the sentence mentions that Clinton's real feelings for Lewinsky actually go in another direction, referencing the Anne Boleyn theory. While the specific details of the theory are not provided, it is evident that the sentence implies some alternative feelings that Clinton might have for Lewinsky. Now consider Sentence 2, which explicitly states that Clinton has alternate feelings for Lewinsky. This sentence is essentially a simplified version of the first one, without any reference to the Anne Boleyn theory. Considering the two aspects of Sentence 1, we can see that Sentence 2 is in line with the information presented in Sentence 1. Both sentences suggest alternate feelings from Clinton towards Lewinsky. While Sentence 1 is expressed with slight uncertainty, it does provide a basis for believing that there are, in fact, alternate feelings involved. Therefore, if we accept Sentence 1 as true, it is reasonable to conclude that Sentence 2 is true as well since it essentially conveys a similar meaning without the added context of the Anne Boleyn theory."},{"question":"Generate a 1-star review (1 being lowest and 5 being highest) about an app with package com.frostwire.android.

Unfortunately, I find myself compelled to leave a 1-star review as my experience with this app has been nothing less than disappointing and frustrating. First off, the app's interface is highly disorganized and not user-friendly. Basic features are hidden among cluttered menus, and navigating through the app takes longer than it should. It's evident that the design team did not prioritize user experience whatsoever. Performance-wise, the app is severely lacking. It drained my phone's battery at an alarming rate, even when running in the background. In addition to that, it caused my phone to overheat and become sluggish while using the app. One major complaint I have is the overwhelming amount of intrusive ads that constantly pop up. Not only do they interrupt whatever process I'm engaged in, but the ads are also highly inappropriate and not suitable for all audiences. This reflects poorly on the app developers and creates an unpleasant overall experience for users. Moreover, the app failed to deliver on its promise of fast downloads. Whether it was sharing files or downloading torrents, the app was incredibly slow, often causing my phone to freeze up. With the amount of time it took to get anything done, it simply wasn't worth the hassle. In conclusion, I cannot recommend com.frostwire.android to anyone based on my experience.

The dielectric is used in very thin layers and so absolute breakdown voltage of capacitors is limited. Typical ratings for capacitors used for general electronics applications range from a few volts to 1 kV. As the voltage increases, the dielectric must be thicker, making high-voltage capacitors larger per capacitance than those rated for lower voltages. The breakdown voltage is critically affected by factors such as the geometry of the capacitor conductive parts; sharp edges or points increase the electric field strength at that point and can lead to a local breakdown. Once this starts to happen, the breakdown quickly tracks through the dielectric until it reaches the opposite plate, leaving carbon behind and causing a short (or relatively low resistance) circuit. The results can be explosive as the short in the capacitor draws current from the surrounding circuitry and dissipates the energy. Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Of what order is the breakdown field strength for mica dielectric capacitors?","response":"The breakdown field strength for mica dielectric capacitors is between 100 to 300 MV/m (MV is mega volts and m is meters).

They played a game against another team, Everton, in something called the \\"fourth-round replay\\". This means the two teams had already played once before, and they needed to play again to find out who's the best. But this time, Chelsea didn't win. Instead, Everton beat them, and they will now move on to the \\"last-16\\" of the competition.

These examples were pointed out by Carl Gustav Hempel. Hempel came to acknowledge that Logical Positivism's verificationism was untenable, but argued that falsificationism was equally untenable on logical grounds alone. The simplest response to this is that, because Popper describes how theories attain, maintain and lose scientific status, individual consequences of currently accepted scientific theories are scientific in the sense of being part of tentative scientific knowledge, and both of Hempel's examples fall under this category.

The radiation in two or three CT scans triples brain cancer risk for a kid under 15, while five to 10 scans is enough to triple the risk of leukemia, NPR reports. While those numbers sound big, however, they only amount to \\"one excess brain tumor and one leukemia per 10,000 head CT scans,\\" a researcher says. \\"There was debate about whether the risks were real, and this study shows pretty unequivocally that they are,\\" an expert tells ABC News. But CT scans can still be well worth it, researchers say. \\"Providing the scan is clinically justified and performed properly with a child size dose of radiation, the benefits should easily outweigh the risks.\\" The scans are used increasingly often, with some 4 million kids a year receiving them, the New York Times notes. But a third of those may not be needed; radiation-free MRIs and ultrasounds could be a better bet. Article:","response":"Title: Study Finds Link Between CT Scans and Increased Cancer Risks in Children A recent study has found that the radiation from CT scans can increase a child's risk of brain cancer and leukemia, with the risk escalating alongside the amount of radiation exposure. According to the research, the radiation in two or three CT scans can triple the risk of brain cancer for children under 15. Furthermore, receiving five to ten scans can triple the risk of leukemia. However, this only amounts to \\"one excess brain tumor and one leukemia per 10,000 head CT scans,\\" as a researcher mentioned in an NPR report. The debate over whether the risks were real has been ongoing, but this study provides strong evidence supporting the claims. An expert speaking to ABC News said, \\"There was debate about whether the risks were real, and this study shows pretty unequivocally that they are.\\" Nevertheless, researchers argue that CT scans can still be a valuable tool when used appropriately. \\"Providing the scan is clinically justified and performed properly with a child-sized dose of radiation, the benefits should easily outweigh the risks.\\" CT scans have become an increasingly popular diagnostic tool, with about four million children a year receiving them, according to the New York Times. However, it is believed that about a third of those scans may be unnecessary. In many cases, radiation-free options such as MRIs and ultrasounds could provide a safer alternative. In conclusion, this study sheds light on the potential risks of CT scans for children but emphasizes the importance of using the scans responsibly and when clinically justified. Parents and physicians should carefully consider the potential risks and benefits before opting for a CT scan and, if possible, explore radiation-free alternatives such as MRIs and ultrasounds."},{"question":"Buzz Aldrin, birthPlace, Glen Ridge, New Jersey; Buzz Aldrin, mission, Apollo 11; Buzz Aldrin, status, \\"Retired\\"; Buzz Aldrin, birthDate, \\"1930-01-20\\"; Buzz Aldrin, nationality, United States; Apollo 11, operator, NASA What is sentence that verbalizes this data?","response":"Buzz Aldrin, born on January 20, 1930, in Glen Ridge, New Jersey, is a retired American astronaut who is famously known for his mission on Apollo 11, which was operated by NASA."},{"question":"FYI - John's only issue was \\"inhouse\\" vs \\"outside\\" counsel legal opinion.

Two such modes, carpooling and cycling, were popular for their environmental friendliness and health benefits. In this article, we examine the percentage of commuters who reported carpooling and cycling as their primary means of transportation in Dallas in 2009 to determine which group was smaller. Methodology To accurately compare the percentages of carpoolers and cyclists, we referred to the 2009 American Community Survey (ACS) data. The ACS is a reliable source of demographic information conducted annually by the United States Census Bureau. The dataset provides insights into the transportation habits of the population, including commuting modes and the percentage of people utilizing each mode. Analysis In 2009, according to the ACS data, Dallas had a working population of 592,725 individuals who commuted to work daily. Of these commuters, carpooling accounted for 11.7%, equating to 69,349 individuals, while cycling accounted for 0.5%, which translates to approximately 2,963 people. Carpooling in Dallas attracted a larger percent of the population due to several reasons: 1. It combats traffic congestion by reducing the number of individual vehicles on the road. 2. It reduces vehicle emissions, promoting better air quality for the city. 3. It allows for cost-sharing among commuters, leading to financial savings in gasoline, tolls, and vehicle maintenance costs. 4. It may provide access to High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes where available, allowing for faster and more efficient commutes. On the other hand, cycling as a means of transportation in Dallas faced several challenges: 1. The city's infrastructure might not be as accommodating to cyclists regarding bike lanes, bike-friendly roads, and safe storage areas at work. 2. Commuters may perceive cycling as less convenient and time-efficient compared to other modes of transportation, especially for longer distances. 3. Weather conditions may not always be conducive to cycling. Conclusion Based on the 2009 ACS data, the percentage of cyclists among Dallas commuters (0.5%) was smaller than that of carpoolers (11.7%). Although both modes of transportation offer various benefits, it appears that carpooling was the more prevalent choice for Dallas commuters in 2009. However, it's essential to recognize the city's ongoing efforts to promote and support alternative transportation options, including increasing bike lanes and improving cycling infrastructure."},{"question":"Here is an article: YORKTON, Canada – The bus is full as it rumbles southwest on SK 10 from Yorkton, Saskatchewan. L.A. Kings center Jarret Stoll and his family surround the Stanley Cup as it sits smack dab in the middle of the bus. It’s still early in the morning and his day with Lord Stanley’s trophy is just starting as he gulps down a five-hour energy drink. He knows it will be a long haul until midnight, when it’s packed up and shipped off to another small Canadian town. Sitting with him in the Cup’s chariot is Barry “Trapper” Trapp, onetime scout for Hockey Canada and mentor to Stoll when he was a young player. “Everybody wonders how a 70 year-old guy and a 30-year-old guy can be such good friends,” says Trapp, one arm draped on Stoll’s shoulder, the other resting on the spine of the Cup. “When you’re a part of Hockey Canada, you’re family forever. And I mean that,” he says. “He’s a special young man.” Barry and Jarret cradle the Cup as the bus speeds toward his boyhood home of Neudorf, Saskatchewan, population nearly 300. A son of the Canadian prairie, Stoll is an anomaly. He has Hollywood looks and charisma but is known as a gritty, two-way player. His first stop is with his grandmother, Doreen. “To take the Stanley Cup to my grandma’s house and to her garden was one of the best things I’ve done my entire life,” Stoll said as he talks about his grandparents at a banquet later in the day. “They were with us all the way growing up in a lot of the rinks watching us play hockey. Grandma sitting in her chair every game. She puts on that 28 jersey and she sits in grandpa’s old chair and she watches, and she watches, and she watches. A lot of times by herself. I really, really appreciate that grandma, and I love you very much.” People numbering more than double Neudorf’s population lined up to see the Stanley Cup. It wasn’t clear if they were there for Stoll, the Cup or both. For Krystal Luther of Regina, it was clear as the country air of south central Canada. After waiting a few hours in line at the Weger Sports Complex field, she blows past Stoll on her way to a tearful hug of the trophy. “It was a dream come true; I can’t believe I’ve finally seen it,” she said as tears streamed down her face. “I’ve been a hockey fan since I was 4 years old, and I’m 32. It’s amazing.” Hours later and an hour out of Neudorf, Stoll and the Cup sit atop a vintage fire engine in Yorkton, parading along Broadway Street with dozens of other floats, cars and revelers. The midday sun shines brightly on the silver chalice as he enthusiastically raises it over his head — over and over again. Past Tim Horton’s, past Sears, past K.W. Men’s Wear, slowly making their way to the Gallagher Center. The sports hall is filled with hundreds of friends, family, former coaches, teammates, teachers and seemingly anyone else whom Stoll has touched in his lifetime. Rambling speeches filled with passion and platitudes echo throughout the immense building. Beaming with pride, Trapper slips on a Team Canada Jersey, calls the audience to its feet. “I want everyone to sing this song,” he commands the crowd. “We’re going to sing ‘O Canada.’” Write a title for it.","response":"\\"Jarret Stoll Brings the Stanley Cup Home: A Day of Celebration and Emotion in Neudorf and Yorkton\\""},{"question":"Summarize this article: To keep your feet clean and make the nail pliable, you will need to soak your affected foot in warm water. You may want to soak both feet to make this process a bit more relaxing. Soak your feet four to five times per day for 10 to 15 minutes each time. You can add two tablespoons of Epsom salts to the foot bath or just use plain water. Tea tree oil may help to fight off infections.After each time that you soak your feet, put a drop or two of tea tree oil on the affected nail. The tea tree oil may help to prevent infection and keep the nail a bit softer. After the tea tree oil soaks in, you can also put a dab of Vicks VapoRub to the sore area of your nail. The menthol and camphor may help to reduce the pain and will also keep your nail soft for the next part of the treatment. Keep the menthol/camphor on for 12 to 24 hours using a bandage or a small piece of gauze. The following day soak your feet for about 20 minutes. Then, take a small piece of cotton (gauze or cotton ball) and roll it between your fingers so that it forms a cotton “tube” that is about ½ inch long. Tape one end of the cotton tube to the top of your toe. Then, gently lift the corner of the ingrown nail up a little bit with one hand. With the other hand, work the free end of the cotton tube under the corner of the nail and out the other side so that the cotton is between the skin and the nail. This might be a little painful or strange at first, but it is necessary to lift the nail away from the skin to prevent it from growing deeper into the skin. Keep the cotton in place and replace it every day after soaking your foot. You will need to repeat this process for two weeks or until the toenail grows out a bit, but you should notice some improvement after a few days.

Answer: Semester exams must be taken at college, not a hotel. Reasoning: There are several important factors that contribute to the reasoning behind conducting semester exams at college rather than in a hotel. 1. Exam environment: Colleges provide a suitable and controlled environment for exams, with adequate facilities and a setting that promotes concentration and focus. Hotels are not specifically designed to create such an environment and may not have suitable, dedicated spaces for exams. 2. Proctoring and supervision: In order to maintain academic integrity, exams must be properly proctored to prevent cheating or other violations of test-taking protocols. College staff are trained and experienced in proctoring exams, while hotel staff may not have the same qualifications or background. 3. Security: College campuses have established security measures in place for the protection of exams and the integrity of the testing process. Hotels typically lack these specific measures and may not be as secure when it comes to preventing unauthorized access to examination materials or spaces. 4. Resources: Colleges have access to resources such as administrative staff, faculty, IT support, and other infrastructure needed for a smooth exam process. Conducting exams in a hotel may require additional resources and coordination, which could be inefficient and could lead to additional costs and logistical challenges. 5. Availability and accessibility: Not all students may have easy access to a hotel, especially if it is located far from the campus or if they rely on public transportation. College campuses are generally more accessible for students, ensuring equal opportunity for all students to participate in exams. In summary, the reasoning behind the question and answer pair is that colleges provide a more suitable, secure, and controlled environment for conducting semester exams, ensuring academic integrity and equal opportunity for all students."},{"question":"Randy Evan Barnett (born February 5, 1952, in Chicago) is an American lawyer, law professor at Georgetown University Law Center, where he teaches constitutional law and contracts, and legal theorist. He writes about the libertarian theory of law and contract theory, constitutional law, and jurisprudence. After attending Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, and Harvard Law School in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Barnett worked as a prosecutor in Chicago, Illinois. Barnett's first academic position was at the Chicago-Kent College of Law of the Illinois Institute of Technology. Section 1. All persons are equally free and independent, and have certain natural, inherent and unalienable rights which they retain when forming any government, amongst which are the enjoying, defending and preserving of their life and liberty, acquiring, possessing and protecting real and personal property, making binding contracts of their choosing, and pursuing their happiness and safety.Section 2. The due process of law shall be construed to provide the opportunity to introduce evidence or otherwise show that a law, regulation or order is an infringement of such rights of any citizen or legal resident of the United States, and the party defending the challenged law, regulation, or order shall have the burden of establishing the basis in law and fact of its conformity with this Constitution. The amendment is a direct cousin of the Tenth Amendment, but it applies to the people of the U.S. and not the states. Section 1 puts the Declaration of Independence into coded law. That includes its preamble, which allows for people to live their lives the way they see fit. The proposed right of \\"making binding contracts of their choosing\\" would appear to resurrect the legal doctrine of economic due process, which during the Lochner era, was used by the Supreme Court to strike down a wide variety of state and federal laws affecting business, including child-labor and minimum-wage laws. Section 2 allows all legal persons of the United States to challenge any law that restricts their rights, and puts the burden of proof (fact) on federal, state, and local governments to argue otherwise. Any attempt to establish the constitutionality of any law is thus rested within the government. Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","response":"Yes, there are several interesting aspects related to both Randy Barnett and the proposed constitutional amendment in discussion. 1. Randy Barnett's Academic Career and Publications: Barnett has written numerous articles and books focusing on the subjects of constitutional law, contracts, and libertarianism. Some of his notable publications include \\"Restoring the Lost Constitution: The Presumption of Liberty\\" (2004), \\"The Structure of Liberty: Justice and the Rule of Law\\" (1998), and \\"Our Republican Constitution: Securing the Liberty and Sovereignty of We the People\\" (2016). Apart from his academic roles, Barnett is also a highly sought-after speaker who has made appearances at conferences and educational institutions across the country. 2. Barnett's Involvement in Supreme Court Cases: Barnett has played a significant role in several major Supreme Court cases, including his representation of the plaintiffs in the landmark case of Gonzales v. Raich (2005), which questioned the federal government's power to regulate medical marijuana under the Commerce Clause. He also played a crucial role in the legal challenges to the Affordable Care Act, particularly in the area of the individual mandate. 3. Potential Ramifications of the Proposed Amendment: If the proposed amendment were to be adopted, it could have profound effects on the American legal landscape. By placing a strong emphasis on individual rights and liberties and shifting the burden of proof to the government, this amendment could enable citizens to challenge a wider array of laws and regulations that they believe infringe on their rights. This could result in courts striking down or limiting existing laws that might be seen as out of step with this new constitutional direction. 4. Controversies and Criticisms of Barnett's Views: Barnett's libertarian approach to the law has received both praise and criticism. Some argue that his ideas support limited government and greater individual rights, while others believe that his theories could undermine important social and economic regulations that protect vulnerable populations. Critics have particularly challenged his support for economic due process and his interpretation of the Constitution, arguing that it could lead to the undoing of essential reforms and regulations that have improved public health, safety, and general welfare. 5. Impact on Future Constitutional Debates: The discussion surrounding Barnett's proposed amendment and his legal philosophy exemplify the complex and ongoing debates related to constitutional interpretation and individual rights. Barnett's work highlights the importance of continuing to engage in these discussions, and the manner in which they can shape our understanding of the Constitution and its role in our lives. The proposed amendment, as well as Barnett's broader scholarship, have the potential to significantly influence future legal and political debates on the scope of government power and individual liberty."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Information: - Modern Standard Hindi (Devanagari: , \\"Mnak Hind\\") or simply Hindi (Devanagari: , \\"Hind\\"), is an Indian language and a standardised and Sanskritised register of the Hindustani language.

Along with Krishna, Rama is considered to be one of the most important avatars of Vishnu. In Rama-centric sects, he is considered the Supreme Being, rather than an avatar. - Ramanand Sagar (29 December 1917 12 December 2005) (born Chandramauli Chopra) was an Indian film director. He is most famous for making the \\"Ramayan\\" television series, a 78-part TV adaptation of the ancient Hindu epic of the same name, starring Arun Govil as Lord Ram and Deepika Chikhalia as Sita. The Government of India awarded him the civilian honour of Padma Shri in 2000. - Suriname (or , also spelled Surinam), officially known as the Republic of Suriname, is a sovereign state on the northeastern Atlantic coast of South America.

The country includes the island of Mauritius, Rodrigues [ east], and the outer islands (Agaléga, St. Brandon and two disputed territories). The islands of Mauritius and Rodrigues (southwest) form part of the Mascarene Islands, along with nearby Réunion, a French overseas department. The area of the country is 2,040 km. The capital and largest city is Port Louis. Mauritius was a British colonial possession from 1810 to 1968, the year of its independence. The government uses English as the main language. - Sanskrit (English pronunciation:; written in Devanagari script ; : or ', originally ', \\"refined speech\\") is the primary sacred language of Hinduism and \\"Mahyna\\" Buddhism, a philosophical language in Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism. It was also a literary language that was in use as a \\"lingua franca\\" in ancient and medieval South Asia. It is a standardised dialect of Old Indo-Aryan, originating as Vedic Sanskrit and tracing its linguistic ancestry back to Proto-Indo-Iranian and Proto-Indo-European. Today it is listed as one of the 22 scheduled languages of India and is an official language of the state of Uttarakhand. As one of the oldest Indo-European languages for which substantial written documentation exists, Sanskrit holds a prominent position in Indo-European studies. - Krishna (Sanskrit: , \\"\\" in IAST, pronounced ) is a major Hindu deity worshiped in a variety of different perspectives. Krishna is recognized as the Svayam Bhagavan in his own right or as the absolute incarnation of Lord Vishnu. Krishna is one of the most widely worshiped and popular of all Hindu deities. Krishna's birthday is celebrated every year by Hindus on the eighth day (Ashtami) of the Krishna Paksha (dark fortnight) of the month of Shraavana in the Hindu calendar. - An avatar (Sanskrit: , IAST: \\"\\") is a concept in Hinduism and it means \\"descent\\", and refers to the appearance or incarnation of a deity on earth.

It is an Indo-Aryan language, deriving primarily from the Khariboli dialect of Delhi, and incorporates a large amount of vocabulary from Sanskrit, Persian, Arabic and Chagatai. It is a pluricentric language, with two official forms, Modern Standard Hindi and Modern Standard Urdu, which are its standardised registers, and which may be called Hindustani or Hindi-Urdu when taken together. The colloquial registers are mostly indistinguishable, and even though the official standards are nearly identical in grammar, they differ in literary conventions and in academic and technical vocabulary, with Urdu adopting stronger Persian, Turkic and Arabic influences, and Hindi relying more heavily on Sanskrit. Before the Partition of the British Indian Empire, the terms \\"Hindustani, Urdu,\\" and \\"Hindi\\" were synonymous; all covered what would be called Urdu and Hindi today. The term \\"Hindustani\\" is still used for the colloquial language and \\"lingua franca\\" of North India and Pakistan, for example for the language of Bollywood films, as well as for several quite different varieties of Hindi spoken outside the Indian Subcontinent, such as Fiji Hindi of Fiji and the Caribbean Hindustani of Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, Jamaica, Barbados, and the rest of the Caribbean.

It is written from left to right, has a strong preference for symmetrical rounded shapes within squared outlines, and is recognisable by a horizontal line that runs along the top of full letters. In a cursory look, the Devanagari script appears different from other Indic scripts such as Bengali, Oriya, or Gurmukhi, but a closer examination reveals they are very similar except for angles and structural emphasis. - Guyana (pronounced or ), officially the Co-operative Republic of Guyana, is a sovereign state on the northern mainland of South America. It is, however, included in the Caribbean Region due to its strong cultural, historical, and political ties with the Caribbean Community (CARICOM).

For this review, I'll choose the movie \\"The Room\\" (2003), directed by Tommy Wiseau. This film has gained a cult following due to its poor quality and has been regarded as one of the worst movies ever made. Step 2: Provide basic information about the film As a part of the introduction, I'll provide the general information about the film, including the title, year of release, director, and lead actors. Title: The Room Year: 2003 Director: Tommy Wiseau Lead Actors: Tommy Wiseau, Greg Sestero, and Juliette Danielle Step 3: Describe the main plot and themes I will give a brief summary of the plot and any central themes that the movie tries to convey, making sure to highlight areas where the movie falls short. Plot: Johnny, a successful banker, is madly in love with his fiancée, Lisa. However, Lisa starts to have an affair with Johnny's best friend, Mark, leading to a series of disastrous consequences. Step 4: Criticize specific aspects of the movie Here, I'll examine the significant issues with the film, such as the script, acting, direction, and production. Script: \\"The Room\\" suffers from an underdeveloped and confusing script with multiple plot points introduced and then suddenly dropped, creating a disjointed narrative that lacks clarity. Acting: The performances, particularly by Wiseau, who also directed the film, are often unintentionally comedic due to their wooden and unsophisticated nature, which detracts dramatically from the intended drama. Direction: With Wiseau both directing and starring in the film, the overall pacing and scene structure fall apart, leading to a movie that can only be enjoyed as an unintentional comedy rather than the serious drama it was meant to be. Production: The use of low-quality sets, poor lighting, and dated visual effects, matched with a repetitive and uninspired soundtrack, adds to the amateurish overall feel of the film. Step 5: Offer counterarguments or praise where it may be due While the primary goal is to write a negative review, it's also essential to mention any redeeming qualities or positive aspects that the movie may offer. Despite its numerous shortcomings, \\"The Room\\" has gained a cult following for its so-bad-it's-good charm. The shared experience of watching and laughing at the film's plethora of mishaps has forged a unique bond among its fans. Step 6: Conclude the review To wrap up, I'll reiterate the significant issues with the film and make a final statement on the movie's overall quality. In conclusion, \\"The Room\\" is a perfect example of a movie that is so riddled with flaws in its writing, acting, and production that it is often considered one of the worst films ever made. Worth watching only as an unintentional comedy or a case study in bad filmmaking, \\"The Room\\" remains a prime example of how not to make a film."},{"question":"Create a set of triples that describes the content in the following sentence.

Question: suppose more trucks take coal to the power station happens, how will it affect LESS coal arriving at the power station. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","response":"When more trucks are utilized to transport coal from the mine to the power station, it is reasonable to assume that the amount of coal being transported would increase, resulting in more coal arriving at the power station. However, the question asks how this change might affect \\"LESS coal arriving at the power station.\\" To answer this, we need to consider various factors that may potentially reduce the amount of coal reaching the power station despite the increase in the number of trucks. First, let's consider the transportation capacity of the trucks. If the trucks used have different capacities, it's possible that using more trucks may not equate to an increase in overall coal transportation. For instance, smaller trucks transporting coal may result in less coal reaching the power station when compared with fewer larger-capacity trucks. In this scenario, the increase in the number of trucks would have a negative effect on the transportation of coal. Second, consider the maintenance and operational efficiency of the trucks. If more trucks are to be added to the transportation fleet, it might result in the lowering of the overall operational efficiency. This could be due to increased wear and tear or a lack of timely maintenance for all the trucks. Less efficient trucks could break down more often, causing delays and reducing the amount of coal arriving at the power station. In this case, the effect would be less coal reaching the power station than expected. Third, when employing more trucks, traffic congestion and potential bottlenecks along the route could arise. An increase in truck traffic could lead to higher chances of accidents or slower transport due to the inability to overtake slower vehicles. In addition, traffic congestion may result in increased fuel consumption and air pollution on the road between the mine and the power station. This situation may cause delays and result in less coal being delivered overall. Furthermore, the working conditions of the mine and the miners' productivity should be taken into account. If the actual extraction of coal at the mine doesn't increase or even decrease, having more trucks for transportation wouldn't compensate for the reduced amount of coal being mined. In such a situation, more trucks would not positively impact the transportation process. Considering all these factors, it can be concluded that the supposed perturbation of using more trucks does not necessarily guarantee that less coal will arrive at the power station. Although it could potentially lead to some negative effects, such as less efficient transport or increased traffic congestion, these issues may or may not significantly impact the overall coal supply. As such, the effect of the perturbation on the second effect mentioned - less coal arriving at the power station - cannot be definitively labeled as more, less, or no effect without considering various context-specific factors and corresponding data analysis."},{"question":"Read the text and determine if the sentence is true: The United Nations last night elected eight judges for the international war crimes tribunal that will try those accused of murders and other atrocities in former Yugoslavia since 1991.

There is no easy answer. For Wolff - as for any F1 team boss - the golden rule is always that team-mates must not crash into each other. Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg have now broken it twice in the last five races. In Austria on Sunday, a collision on the last lap cost Mercedes what would have been a one-two finish. Hamilton successfully - in the end - passed Rosberg for the lead, and Rosberg slipped back to finish fourth with no front wing. In Spain back in May, another one-two went begging - this time when they crashed out on the first lap. The incidents were very different. But what they shared was that Hamilton was trying to pass Rosberg after the German had made a mistake, and Rosberg refused to let it happen. Or at least tried to, in the case of Austria. The drivers, unsurprisingly, blamed each other. Wolff said he \\"had an opinion\\" but refused to say what it was, while Mercedes non-executive chairman Niki Lauda said initially that the fact they hit each other was \\"I think, Nico's fault - although I have to see it again\\". Outside Mercedes, virtually all pundits and ex-drivers who expressed an opinion on the incident were unanimous - Rosberg was to blame this time. Crucially, so did the stewards. Why? Because Rosberg had not turned in when he should have. On-board camera shots were clear. Hamilton was on the outside and marginally ahead when they reached the turn-in point for the corner. But Rosberg kept going straight on. When he did finally turn - way beyond where he would normally - he does not attempt to make the full corner, but turns the wheel considerably less than that. The issue is that Rosberg did not look to be trying to make the corner - he seemed intent only on keeping Hamilton on the outside. Yes, the initial collision comes as Hamilton finally tries to turn in, but most ex-drivers and experienced observers would say that he had no choice at that point. Again, the stewards agreed. Parallels will inevitably be drawn with two incidents between the two last year - in the Japanese and US Grands Prix. In both, Hamilton was on the inside and ran Rosberg out of road on the exit of the corner. But that is an accepted - if hard - tactic in racing. Whereas what Rosberg did was not acceptable, by the standards by which these incidents are judged. Rosberg contended that he had \\"always left him track space\\". But the key was in the phrase the stewards used - Rosberg did not allow Hamilton \\"racing room\\", they said. Hamilton was \\"in front - i.e. more than fully alongside and could have clearly made the turn, if not for the resultant collision.\\" The phrase \\"racing room\\" does not appear anywhere in the regulations but the decision was based on an understanding of which all drivers are aware. That is that when a driver is attempting to pass on the outside, if he is fully alongside he has the right to be given room on the exit. In this case, they never even got that far - Rosberg did not even allow him room on the entry. Although the problem for Mercedes is not so much who was at fault as why it keeps happening and what to do about it, the two things may well be interlinked. Wolff said he was \\"fed up with trying to analyse it - I just don't want any contact.\\" He added that \\"all options\\" were on the table. \\"One option is to freeze the order at a certain point in the race, which is unpopular and makes me (want to) puke myself but if the racing is not possible without contact that is a consequence,\\" said Wolff. \\"I have to cool down a little bit and in the next couple of days figure it out.\\" In doing so, he will have to consider what role is being played by the raised stakes compared to last year and even 2014. In 2015, Hamilton got a flying start to the season and never looked back. The way things worked out, he and Rosberg were hardly ever racing together. It was a similar situation in 2014, with two exceptions - in Bahrain, when they raced cleanly and brilliantly and Hamilton came out on top, and Austin, when Hamilton chased his team-mate down and passed him fairly to win. This year is different. Hamilton finds himself playing catch-up again, but this time he seems to be facing a more formidable and resolute competitor. Until this year, Hamilton always seemed to come off better when the two were battling closely and he remains the more instinctive natural racer. Austria showed once again that Rosberg does not have the same instinctive feel for wheel-to-wheel duels - if he was going to give Hamilton the choice of going wide or colliding, it was not a great idea to do it in a way that ensured his car would be the one that was damaged. But Rosberg seems to have coupled it with a harder edge to his approach. It is impossible to get him to admit it, but the loss of the title so comprehensively last year seems to have had an effect on his mindset. He seems tougher and more determined than before, less willing to give in to the inner demons that tell him - correctly - that, all things being equal, Hamilton will be faster than him more often than not. And less willing to back down on the track, too. Rosberg brushes off questions about it, says he is focused only on the now. But it looks from the outside as if he has realised that he may never have a better chance to win the world title than this year when, lest we forget, he was 43 points clear after just four races. Spain was the next race after Rosberg established that formidable lead, and he started it by taking the lead with an audacious and highly skilled move around the outside of Hamilton at the first corner. Two corners later, after he had been delayed by being in the wrong engine mode, his defence against Hamilton trying to re-take the lead was aggressive in the extreme. Technically, it could be argued he broke in Barcelona the rule that demands drivers leave a rival a car's width of space on the approach to a corner if they have a \\"significant\\" part of their car alongside. The move was adjudged just within the letter of the regulations, on the basis of how quickly events had unfolded, and the crash filed as a \\"racing incident\\", in which neither driver was specifically to blame But now there is Austria, and another incident in which Rosberg has gone right out to the very edges of ruthlessness - and beyond, the stewards say, in this case. Meanwhile, Hamilton is already nursing a sense of injustice about this year - as a result of the engine problems that wrecked his races in China and Russia and have left him likely to suffer grid penalties down the line for using too many engine parts. In Austria, Hamilton should never have been behind Rosberg in the race, having led the first stint so comprehensively. When Hamilton emerged behind Rosberg from his first pit stop - thanks to a problem with the left-rear wheel - he was surprised but was reassured that his team-mate had to stop again. So it was little wonder that Hamilton admitted to finding it \\"a little bit disturbing initially\\" to be switched to a two-stop and find Rosberg was still in front once the stops were completed. Three hours after the race, he said: \\"I didn't understand it and I still don't - I'm sure they will explain it later.\\" When they do, they will tell him that only a problem with his left-rear wheel at his first stop prevented him rejoining in the lead - and that they organised it so he would pass Rosberg at the second stops with the so-called 'undercut', only for another slow stop and a subsequent error from Hamilton in running wide at Turn Two on his out lap to scupper the plan. Hamilton did not know that in the race, so what was his mindset out on track at the time? \\"I let it go over my head,\\" he said, \\"and kept pushing, thinking: 'If I am going to win this world title, I am going to have to dig deep.' I gave everything I had today. I feel proud I didn't leave any stone unturned.\\" As for Rosberg, even after his penalty he was still protesting his innocence. So Mercedes are faced with a dominant character who believes in his own fundamental superiority and another, hard-headed to the point of stubbornness, who is determined to take the best chance he has ever had. Wolff clearly does not want to impose team orders on the drivers but somehow he has to create some rules of engagement to ensure they don't keep crashing into each other. Painless it won't be, but handling the fall-out of Austria and containing it over the remaining 12 races might be that bit easier because there is an obviously guilty party.

An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

The Hellenistic period may be seen to end either with the final conquest of the Greek heartlands by Rome in 146 BC following the Achean War, with the final defeat of the Ptolemaic Kingdom at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC, or even the move by Roman emperor Constantine the Great of the capital of the Roman Empire to Constantinople in 330 AD. \\"Hellenistic\\" is distinguished from \\"Hellenic\\" in that the first encompasses the entire sphere of direct ancient Greek influence, while the latter refers to Greece itself.\\" Answer: A:","response":"If we consider the end of the Hellenistic era to be less than a century before the common era, we can focus on the final defeat of the Ptolemaic Kingdom at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC. This event marked the end of the last independent Hellenistic state, as the Ptolemaic Kingdom was conquered by the Romans and eventually incorporated into the Roman Empire. To justify this choice, consider the following steps: 1. Identify the time frame given in the question: less than a century before the common era (1-99 BC). 2. Examine the context provided for various potential end points of the Hellenistic era, which are: a. Conquest of the Greek heartlands by Rome in 146 BC following the Achaean War b. The Battle of Actium in 31 BC c. The moving of the Roman Empire's capital to Constantinople in 330 AD 3. Eliminate options outside of the given time frame: a. 146 BC is more than a century before the common era, so this option is eliminated. c. 330 AD is long after the common era began and thus not relevant to the given time frame, so this option is eliminated. 4. The remaining option, the Battle of Actium in 31 BC, falls within the given time frame and marks a significant event in the decline of the Hellenistic world, as it resulted in the fall of the Ptolemaic Kingdom and further expansion of the Roman Empire over the Greek-influenced territories. Therefore, if we take the view that the Hellenistic era ended less than a century before the common era, the most suitable event to mark its end would be the Battle of Actium in 31 BC."},{"question":"Math Problem Solve -967*r = -1317*r - 7700 for r.","response":"To solve the given equation -967*r = -1317*r - 7700 for r, follow these steps: Step 1: Add 1317*r to both sides of the equation to isolate the r terms on one side. -967*r + 1317*r = -1317*r - 7700 + 1317*r This simplifies to: (1317 - 967)*r = -7700 Step 2: Calculate the difference between 1317 and 967. 1317 - 967 = 350 So the equation becomes: 350*r = -7700 Step 3: Divide both sides of the equation by 350 to solve for r. r = -7700 / 350 Step 4: Calculate the division. r = -22 So the solution is r = -22."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Good tips, but glaring misconceptions ruin it Review: This book had some tips that sounded pretty good (and that I'll probably use in the future), but this book had two big problems that caused me to stop reading the book, despite the former good tips that I had enjoyed.

Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death. Now, I have a new situation: Jake and his son Ryan just had their yearly physical examination by the doctor. As part of this year's examination, both men had their arterial walls examined to identify the presence of plaques.

He sent them to the doctor's for a routine check up. Dan, his dad, had very high cholesterol, while Mary, his mom , had normal levels in her blood. and a hint : Cholesterol has been implicated in heart disease for decades. Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death.

Increasing our knowledge of diverse aspects of life such as film, music, television, socio-political movements, and environmental sustainability provides us with a richer and more fulfilling life experience. By understanding these various fields, we become more confident and independent individuals who can contribute more meaningfully to our social circles and society at large. Pop Culture and Art: Affecting Everyday Lives Pop culture and art play a significant role in shaping our perspectives, beliefs, and values. Films, through their focus on diverse topics and unique storytelling techniques, help us navigate complicated emotions, empathize with others, and highlight essential global issues. For instance, films like \\"12 Years a Slave\\" have depicted the horrors of slavery, sparking essential public conversations on race and civil rights. In addition, music transcends linguistic and cultural boundaries, allowing us to connect with the emotions and stories of those from different backgrounds. From Afrobeat rhythms to K-pop anthems, music offers a world of diverse soundscapes that can unite us under a shared appreciation for artistic expression. Television has evolved over the past few decades, shifting from being purely for entertainment purposes to exploring complex characters and narratives in thought-provoking shows. Series like \\"Breaking Bad\\" and \\"House of Cards\\" demonstrate the versatility of television as a medium, keeping audiences engaged and promoting critical thinking about societal issues. Social and Political Movements: Inspiring Change Knowledge of social and political movements in one's area plays a crucial role in promoting awareness, empathy, and active participation in our society. From the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s to the contemporary Black Lives Matter and LGBTQ+ rights movements, understanding social dynamics and historical context helps us appreciate the strides society has made, while also acknowledging the work that remains to be done. Participating in local social and political movements – whether it be attending rallies, volunteering, or engaging in informed conversations – allows us to stay informed and shape the future we wish to see. It demonstrates our commitment to the betterment of our communities and cultivates a sense of responsibility towards the world we live in.

Ann was normal. But I can use this background: Another example of incomplete dominance is with sickle cell anemia, a disease in which a blood protein called hemoglobin is produced incorrectly. This causes the red blood cells to have a sickle shape, making it difficult for these misshapen cells to pass through the smallest blood vessels. A person that is homozygous recessive ( ss ) for the sickle cell trait will have red blood cells that all have the incorrect hemoglobin. A person who is homozygous dominant ( SS ) will have normal red blood cells. What is an answer for this question: Which sister had incomplete dominance? The answer is:","response":"Neither Mary nor Ann displays incomplete dominance in this situation. Incomplete dominance occurs when an individual inherits one dominant allele and one recessive allele (Ss), resulting in an intermediate phenotype. In the case of Mary and Ann: - Mary has sickle cell anemia, which means she is homozygous recessive (ss) for the sickle cell trait. All of her red blood cells have the incorrect hemoglobin, and there is no presence of the dominant allele in her genotype. - Ann is normal, which means she is either homozygous dominant (SS) or heterozygous (Ss). If Ann is homozygous dominant (SS), she has normal red blood cells and does not display incomplete dominance. If Ann is heterozygous (Ss), she carries the sickle cell trait but does not have the disease or any symptoms, as the dominant allele (S) completely masks the effects of the recessive allele (s). In either case, incomplete dominance is not present."},{"question":"Does the sentence \\"This figure, however, accounts for solely the first year of the Genocide and does not take into account those who died or were killed after the report was compiled on the 24th May 1916.\\" answer the question \\"When was Toynbee's report put together?\\"","response":"Yes, the sentence provided does answer the question \\"When was Toynbee's report put together?\\".

The sentence also informs us that the report specifically discusses events that occurred in the first year of the Genocide but does not account for subsequent deaths or killings that happened after the report's compilation date. To provide more context, Arnold Toynbee was a British historian who documented the Armenian Genocide through his work during the early 20th century. The Armenian Genocide refers to the systematic extermination of around 1.5 million Armenians by the Ottoman Empire during World War I, specifically between 1915 and 1923. Toynbee's report is considered a crucial and influential primary source that shed light on the atrocities committed during this period. The sentence in question indicates that the figure mentioned only accounts for the first year of the Genocide and does not include any additional information on the subsequent years and consequences that followed.

While interrogating Hart, the Germans coerce him to divulge intelligence by taking away his boots, causing his feet to become frostbitten and badly injured, and leaving him, naked, in a very cold cell. He is then transferred by train to Stalag VI-A prisoner of war camp at Hemer, Germany. While en route, a P-51 Mustang attacks (the letters POW were painted on the top of the train, but got covered by thick snow). To save themselves, the POWs leave the train and spell P-O-W with their bodies and prevent further strafing. After arriving at the new POW camp, Lt. Hart is interviewed by the ranking American officer, Colonel William McNamara (Willis). When McNamara asks if he cooperated with the Germans after he was captured, Hart denies it. McNamara knows this to be a lie when Hart says he only endured three days of interrogation. McNamara does not reveal this to Hart, but sends him to bunk in a barracks for enlisted men, rather than allow him to bunk with the other officers. Two black pilots are brought to the camp and assigned to Hart's barracks. They are the only blacks in the camp, and their situation is compounded by their status as officers. Staff Sgt. Vic W.

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - woodlands - rivers - ontario - canada - zoo Answer:","response":"Canada is the most suitable option to answer the question about a country that is known for a high population of beavers. As the national animal of the country, beavers play an essential role in Canada's identity, environment, and economy. Beavers (Castor canadensis) are native to North America, and they can be found across a vast majority of the Canadian landscape, from the central region to the northern boreal forest and the Atlantic to the Pacific coasts. These large, semi-aquatic rodents are well-adapted to the various ecosystems that span across Canada, including forests, wetlands, rivers, and lakes. Beavers prefer locations with a combination of trees and water sources to create their ideal habitats. One of the main reasons for Canada's high beaver population is the abundance of suitable environments the country provides. Large expanses of forests and numerous freshwater ecosystems found throughout the country supply beavers with resources to build their lodges and dams, as well as providing a steady supply of food. Beavers primarily feed on the bark, leaves, and twigs of trees such as aspen, birch, willow, and maple, which are plentiful in Canada's vast and diverse environments. Moreover, the significant cultural and historical relevance of beavers in Canada cannot be understated. Beavers have played a significant role in the nation's history, particularly during the fur trade era (17th to 19th centuries), where beaver fur was in high demand for making stylish and warm hats, thereby bolstering Canada's economy during those times. As a result of their historical significance, beavers were proclaimed as the official emblem of Canada in 1975, further highlighting their connection to the country. Additionally, beavers contribute to Canada's ecological system through their dam-building activities. By constructing dams, they help create wetlands and alter waterways, allowing various plant and animal species to thrive. Wetlands formed by beavers facilitate biodiversity and offer essential ecosystem services such as nutrient cycling, water purification, and flood control. These positive ecological impacts further solidify beavers' integral relationship with Canada and its diverse environments. In conclusion, Canada is the most suitable option to answer the question about a country known for a high population of beavers.

It was a three person show, and one of the roles was written specifically for me. Many of the lines were written after we improvised the scenes in my living room as she wrote the piece. Took it to Scotland, where it was quite well received. A year or so later, it was being produced in New York in a much more prestigious setting. I auditioned, was called back a couple times, and got to the play the role again. Fantastic! THEN, it was produced by an even larger theatre. Different producer, different casting director, etc. I went to the open call for it, and the casting director treated me really poorly. It was odd. She looked at my resume and said, “It says you have already played this role.” I said, “Yes, I was fortunate enough to workshop it and originate the role.” She looked at me like I was lying. I mean, shuttled me out the door like I was a crazy woman. Needless to say, I was not called back. And that was okay—(I mean, of course I wanted to do the show with this group of people, but hey, we can’t always get what we want). Fast forward to opening night: my playwright friend invites me to see the show. The actress playing “my” role was fantastic, but they had to change lines in the script that indicated what she looked like, because she was of Hawaiian descent. Again, no big deal…and she was great! What was strange was meeting the director that evening. My friend introduced me as the originator of the role, and the director asked me why I hadn’t auditioned…Overall, it wasn’t a harsh rejection or a terrible story, it was just weird to have been treated like a liar when I was not lying… Question: How long is the play in Edinburgh? === The answer to the above question is OPTIONS: [1]. 8 hours; [2]. 10 hours; [3]. a few hours; [4]. not enough information; The answer is:","response":"[4]. not enough information."},{"question":"Find the right ending to this passage.

Al-Shabab, however, still controls many southern and central areas of the country. However, correspondents say al-Shabab's policy of banning many foreign aid agencies from areas it controls during the region's worst drought in 60 years has lost the group some of its popular support.

During the Cold War it was adopted by many North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries, with the notable exception of the United States. It is one of the most widely used rifles in history, having been used by more than 90 countries. - The CAL ( Carabine Automatique Légère ) was a Belgian weapon manufactured by Fabrique Nationale . It was the first 5.56 mm rifle produced by the Fabrique Nationale . It resembled the company 's highly successful FN FAL , but was an original design . Unlike the FAL , it was a market failure , although its development led to the reasonably successful FN FNC . - Fabrique Nationale d'Herstal (French for: National Factory of Herstal) self identified as FN Herstal and often referred to as Fabrique Nationale or simply FN is a leading firearms manufacturer located in Herstal, Belgium, and is owned by the holding company Herstal Group which is owned by the regional government of Wallonia. It is currently the largest exporter of military small arms in Europe. - The Cold War was a state of political and military tension after World War II between powers in the Eastern Bloc (the Soviet Union and its satellite states) and powers in the Western Bloc (the United States, its NATO allies and others). Historians do not fully agree on the dates, but a common timeframe is the period (the second half of the 20th century) between 1947, the year the Truman Doctrine (a U.S. policy pledging to aid nations threatened by Soviet expansionism) was announced, and 1991, the year the Soviet Union collapsed. - The FN FNC (French: \\"Fabrique Nationale Carabine\\") is a 5.56×45mm NATO assault rifle developed by the Belgian arms manufacturer FN Herstal and introduced in the late 1970s. - The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO '), also called the North Atlantic Alliance, is an intergovernmental military alliance based on the North Atlantic Treaty which was signed on 4 April 1949.

A:","response":"No, it is highly unlikely that you would find the Almond plant (Prunus dulcis) and Aloinopsis in Alaska. The Almond plant is native to the Mediterranean climate region, specifically in southwestern Asia and the Middle East. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and typically thrives in warm, dry climates with mild winters, ranging between USDA hardiness zones 7 to 9. These conditions are essential for the plant's successful growth, pollination, and fruit production. Alaska, on the other hand, is characterized by its cold, wet climate, with average winter temperatures ranging from -15°F (-26°C) to 20°F (-6°C), and a short, cool growing season. This environment would be detrimental to the almond trees, as they would not be able to survive the freezing temperatures, and the lack of a proper growing season would hinder their fruit production. Additionally, the high humidity levels in Alaska promote diseases that can negatively affect the health of various plants, including almond trees. Aloinopsis is a genus of succulent plants belonging to the Aizoaceae family, which are primarily native to southern Africa. These plants are adapted to the arid conditions found in semi-desert regions, including rocky and sandy terrain, and are not frost-tolerant. Aloinopsis species require well-draining soil and plenty of sunlight to thrive, and they can survive long periods of drought. Alaska's climate and soil conditions are unfavorable for the growth of Aloinopsis. The succulent would struggle to survive in the cold, wet environment that Alaska presents. To grow Aloinopsis in Alaska, you would require specialized greenhouse environments where the temperature, humidity, and light exposure could be controlled to simulate the plant's native habitat. In conclusion, you would not find the Almond plant or Aloinopsis in Alaska due to the vastly different climate conditions compared to their native habitats. Both plants require specific environments to grow and thrive, which Alaska's climate and soil conditions cannot provide. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that these plants could be found or cultivated successfully in the wild in Alaska."},{"question":"Question: What two tools are the gang going to use to make Spanky flop?

At that point, Gutierrez said it was transformed into an invitation-only affair, and he was asked to leave by an aide to House Speaker Paul Ryan. \\"In 20-plus years, I have never heard of the Republicans controlling what meetings Democrats can have with officials of the Executive Branch and never had a staffer ask me to leave a meeting to which I am entitled to attend,\\" Gutierrez said in a statement following the incident.

(Photo: Scott Olson, Getty Images) CHICAGO — U.S. Rep. Luis Gutierrez and several immigrant advocates were briefly placed in restraints by federal officers after they staged a sit-in at the regional office of the Immigration Customs and Enforcement agency on Monday to protest the Trump administration’s increased targeting of undocumented immigrants for deportation. Gutierrez, D-Ill., and activists began their sit-in at the Chicago office after a contentious meeting with ICE officials. The lawmaker said that he stood ready to be arrested when he started the protest late Monday morning, but ended the sit-in more than four hours later without incident. Federal Protective Service officers gave the congressman and seven immigration advocates taking part-in the sit-in three warnings to leave the facility or face arrest, according to Gail Montenegro, an ICE spokeswoman. At one point, Gutierrez posted on social media that he was even placed in handcuffs but agents changed their mind and allowed the sit-in to continue. Montenegro said federal agents removed the flex cuffs within approximately two minutes, after ICE officials relayed to the FPS officers that they no longer wanted the congressman and others removed from the building. \\"They threatened us with arrest. We said 'We're ready to go to jail,'\\" Gutierrez told reporters after ending the protest. \\"We stood up to the bullies here...Unfortunately, tonight and tomorrow they will continue to prey on very vulnerable, defenseless people in their homes in the darkness of the night.\\" The congressman said he decided to start the sit-in after he felt he received unsatisfactory or incomplete answers from ICE officials about whether they would carry out enforcement raids in churches and other sensitive locations. Gutierrez also said he did not receive clear answers on whether the agency would target young undocumented immigrants living in the US under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy started under the Obama administration. The agency said in a statement that the sit-in began after the \\"Congressman sought actions and assurances that ICE officials couldn't provide.\\" Last week, ICE wrote on its Twitter that “DACA is not a protected legal status, but active DACA recipients are typically a lower level of enforcement priority.” The program provided hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants—commonly referred to as DREAMers— brought to the U.S. as children certain protections.

They also make clear that ICE agents should also arrest and initiate deportation proceedings against any other undocumented immigrant they encounter. Gutierrez said he also questioned ICE officials about the scheduled deportations of several immigrants living in the Chicago area. One, Miguel Perez, is a Mexican-born legal permanent resident and Army veteran and is facing deportation after a felony drug conviction. Perez served two tours in Afghanistan. Last month, Gutierrez and several other members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus were barred by staffers from House Speaker Paul Ryan's office from attending a meeting in Washington with acting ICE director Thomas Homan.

Analyzing the phrase on its own doesn't clearly imply a positive or negative connotation. However, we can discuss some of the scenarios where it may carry a positive or negative connotation. 1. Positive Connotation: When talking about a well-crafted narrative in literature, film, or any other storytelling medium, the phrase \\"so integrated with the story\\" may be used to describe elements that are seamlessly woven into the narrative. In this context, it carries a positive connotation as it suggests that various components of the story are well-structured and connected. For instance, let's take the example of a character's backstory. If the character's history is so well-integrated with the story that it provides depth and enhances the emotional engagement of the audience, then the phrase carries a positive meaning. Similarly, when describing an engaging plot or world-building elements, \\"so integrated with the story\\" would indicate a high level of skill and effort on the part of the author or creators in shaping a coherent and absorbing narrative. 2. Negative Connotation: It is possible to use the phrase \\"so integrated with the story\\" with a negative connotation, though it may not be as common. In this case, it would suggest that a certain element is so deeply entrenched in the story that it becomes difficult to separate it from the narrative, leading to potential issues like confusion or complexity. For example, if someone were to say that a particular subplot is \\"so integrated with the story\\" that it becomes hard to follow the main plot, then this phrase would have a negative implication. This implies that the subplot may potentially distract the audience or detract from the overall experience due to its overly entrenched nature. In conclusion, it's essential to be aware of the context in which the phrase \\"so integrated with the story\\" is used to understand its complete meaning and implications. It can carry both positive and negative connotations based on the situation and the speaker's intention."},{"question":"Write an article based on this summary: Britain's Marcus Willis has been awarded a wildcard into qualifying for Wimbledon after his fairytale run at last year's tournament.","response":"Title: Marcus Willis Receives Wildcard Entry for Wimbledon Qualifying Following Last Year's Fairytale Run Introduction: Marcus Willis, from Great Britain, will be granted a wildcard entry for Wimbledon qualifying, following his astounding performance in last year's tournament.

Maya weaponry was not sufficiently powerful to justify the discomfort of wearing European armour. Quilted cotton armour, although still uncomfortably hot, was flexible and weighed much less.

(Elaine Thompson, Associated Press / ) SAN DIEGO — Football star Junior Seau had no alcohol or illicit drugs in his system when he committed suicide, and an initial examination of his brain showed no apparent damage from his years of football, according to the autopsy and toxicology reports released Monday by the San Diego County medical examiner. Also, his girlfriend, Megan P. Noderer, told police that Seau, 43, had given no indication he planned to kill himself, according to the investigative narrative attached to the autopsy report. When Noderer returned to the home in Oceanside on May 2 after a morning workout at a gymnasium, she found Seau in bed, dead of a gunshot to the chest from a .357 magnum revolver. No note or \\"documents that were suicidal in nature\\" were found. The San Diego County medical examiner declared Seau's death a suicide the next day. The 6-foot, 3-inch, 275-pound Seau, a star at Oceanside High, USC and the NFL, was taking prescription medicines for orthopedic problems and insomnia, and was under the care of Chargers physician Dr. David Chao, according to the documents. The football star drank only \\"socially [and] did not smoke, and there was no history of illicit drug use,\\" according to the report. Seau \\"had an unremarkable medical history\\" and had shown no \\"suicidal ideation or confirmed suicide attempt,\\" Deputy Medical Examiner Dr. Craig Nelson wrote. At the request of the Seau family, brain tissue was sent to the National Institutes of Health for more advanced investigation. Brain damage among football players due to concussions has become a controversial issue in the National Football League, where Seau was a star for the San Diego Chargers and other teams. Nothing in the autopsy report lists concussions or brain damage as related or contributory to the manner or cause of death. Nor is there anything that suggests the mood changes and irritability often associated with concussions and brain damage. In its description of the central nervous system, Nelson wrote that features of the brain were symmetrical, showed no signs of injury or lesions, and that the arteries at the base of the brain \\"have no atherosclerotic changes or aneurysms.\\" The autopsy and toxicology results were released after San Diego news agencies requested them as public documents. Officials at the county medical examiner's office, citing respect for the Seau family, declined to discuss the findings. Seau's suicide stunned the public and left many seeking desperately for an explanation. He was widely praised as a local hero, known for his upbeat spirit, charismatic personality and community involvement. In the news stories that followed, it was learned that Seau's restaurant in Mission Valley had financial problems; the restaurant has since closed. Also, suspicion turned to an incident in October 2010, when Seau drove his sport-utility vehicle off the road and down a steep cliff to the beach. He was hospitalized with minor injuries but denied any suggestion that it was a suicide attempt, asserting instead that he had fallen asleep in the wheel.

On political and policy matters, we publish opinions from across the political spectrum. Roughly half of our columns come from our Board of Contributors, a group whose interests range from education to religion to sports to the economy. Their charge is to chronicle American culture by telling the stories, large and small, that collectively make us what we are. We also publish weekly columns by Al Neuharth, USA TODAY's founder, and DeWayne Wickham, who writes primarily on matters of race but on other subjects as well. That leaves plenty of room for other views from across the nation by well-known and lesser-known names alike. There's a reason we have portion control when it comes to alcohol. The more we drink, the more likely we are to get drunk. Drinks are standardized to serve us no more than 0.6 ounces of pure alcohol. That's why a shot of spirits is 1.5 ounces, a glass of wine is 5 ounces and a mug of beer is 12 ounces. When I got my driver's license, I was handed a chart that accounted for my weight and gender, so I could calculate how many drinks I could have before my blood alcohol level would get me in serious trouble. Because I am a small woman, I don't have to count beyond one to know when I shouldn't drive. That easy understanding of portions has likely contributed a great deal to the USA's success in curbing alcohol-related morbidity and mortality. Alcohol-related traffic fatalities are down more than 60% over the past three decades. Obesity rates, meanwhile, have skyrocketed. A big reason is because most people underestimate volume, especially for soft drinks and foods that take the shape of their containers, according to research. We can't accurately judge quantity in three dimensions. And if people eat too much at one meal, they do not naturally compensate by eating less at the next. Menu labeling aims to help people figure out how much they eat. But consumers also need to know algebra, geometry and what calories mean to figure what portion of the meal they should consume. The result: Labeling menus is not helping most of us eat fewer calories. That's why portion control should be considered as an aid to support consumers who are interested in reaching or maintaining a healthy weight. Restaurants use a form of portion control when they serve customers, but there is no consistency. For example, in one restaurant a serving of soda might be in a 12-ounce cup; another might use a 20-ounce glass. The real amounts vary based upon how much ice is in the glass. As for portions labeled small, medium and large, one restaurant's small order of French fries might be 3 ounces, while another's is 7 ounces. Setting the medium size as the standard portion for an average person, small for someone who wants to lose weight, and large for someone who wants to gain weight (or who runs marathons) would provide benchmarks for people to figure out how much to eat. Take it from me, it's easy if you don't have to count beyond one. Research has also shown that people are generally as satisfied when they are served a standard portion as when they are served larger portions. Systems of portion control have already been developed and can be adopted at any time. The Agriculture Department has established serving sizes for every type of food available — although there are no regulations applying portion sizes to restaurants. Wouldn't it be great if we could go back to the time when the conditions of the food environment helped limit the percentage of the population who were obese to half of the current rate? Regulations requiring the restaurant industry to serve standardized portion sizes should be mandated and enforced by the same authorities responsible for checking hygienic conditions in food outlets. The only requirements would be measuring cups and a kitchen scale. And maybe some New York City chutzpah to make it happen.

Menu labeling, which displays the number of calories in a meal, has not been effective in helping people eat fewer calories, as it requires knowledge of algebra, geometry, and an understanding of portion sizes. 4.

Secondly, the intricate and complex nature of scientific processes necessitates an extensive understanding of the materials and procedures used. Misunderstandings or carelessness can lead to accidents in a learning environment, which can be detrimental to the learning process and impede the overall pursuit of scientific knowledge. Also, accidents in the study of science can have far-reaching consequences. Mistakes or accidents during an experiment can negatively impact not just the individual, but also the environment and the community. Being careless with chemicals, for example, might lead to water and air pollution, posing health risks to people and animals alike. Moreover, accidents can lead to mistrust and fear of science. When accidents occur, it can create a negative image of scientific research, hindering the growth and development of scientific knowledge. This ultimately impedes the forward movement of science, which society heavily relies upon to solve existing problems and improve the quality of life. Lastly, accidents caused by negligence can also be costly in terms of time, money, and effort. Scientific research is often expensive, and accidents may lead to delays in research progress, wastage of valuable resources, and potential loss of funding or support. In summary, a human would choose \\"accidents\\" as the answer to this question because it directly relates to the practical aspects of learning and conducting scientific research. Being careful about accidents plays a significant role in ensuring the safety of researchers, the community, and the environment while advancing the knowledge and understanding of science."},{"question":"I went to bed each night with the sheets pulled high above my head , and the sweat of fear mingled with the sweat of poor ventilation .

In the Stargate universe, humans were enslaved and transported to habitable planets by the Goa'uld such as Ra and Apophis. For millennia, the Goa'uld harvested humanity, heavily influencing and spreading human cultures. As a result, Earth cultures such as those of the Aztecs, Mayans, Britons, the Norse, Mongols, Greeks, and Romans are found throughout the known habitable planets of the galaxy. Many well-known mythical locations such as Avalon, Camelot, and Atlantis are found, or have at one time existed. Presently, the Earth stargate (found at a dig site near Giza in 1928) is housed in a top-secret U.S. military base known as the SGC (Stargate Command) underneath Cheyenne Mountain. Col. Jack O'Neill (Anderson), Dr. Daniel Jackson (Shanks), Capt. Samantha Carter (Tapping) and Teal'c (Judge) compose the original SG-1 team (a few characters join and/or leave the team in later seasons). Along with 24 other SG teams, they venture to distant planets exploring the galaxy and searching for defenses from the Goa'uld, in the forms of technology and alliances with friendly advanced races. The parasitic Goa'uld use advanced technology to cast themselves as Egyptian Gods and are bent on galactic conquest and eternal worship. Throughout the first eight seasons, the Goa'uld are the primary antagonists. They are a race of highly intelligent, ruthless snake-like alien parasites capable of invading and controlling the bodies of other species, including humans. The original arch-enemy from this race was the System Lord Apophis (Peter Williams). Other System Lords, such as Baal and Anubis, play pivotal roles in the later seasons. In the ninth season a new villain emerges, the Ori. The Ori are advanced beings with unfathomable technology from another galaxy, also bent on galactic conquest and eternal worship. The introduction of the Ori accompanies a departure from the primary focus on Egyptian mythology into an exploration of the Arthurian mythology surrounding the Ori, their followers, and their enemiesthe Ancients. Is the sentiment of this review positive or negative? OPTIONS: + negative. + positive.","response":"This isn't really a review, dear. It's more of a summary or a description about a show called \\"Stargate SG-1.\\" It tells us what happens in the show, who the characters are, and what they do. It does not really tell us whether the person writing this likes or dislikes the show, which is what we would need to know to decide if the sentiment is positive or negative. So, we really cannot say if it's a positive or negative sentiment."},{"question":"Q:Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: I once went out to have fun with a friend of a different nationality, and she wanted to go to a place that featured the music of her culture. Since I have always been interested in other cultures, I was happy to go along. While we were sitting at a table together, an older man came up and asked to buy me a drink. I told him “no thank you, I do not drink”. My arm was laying on top of the booth because I was sitting sideways since my big old pregnant belly would not fit under the table. He reached over and took my hand and said “ Come dance with me then”. I again told him I was not interested in dancing. He began to squeeze my hand and insisting I get up and dance with him. I kept telling him no, and pointing to my belly and saying I would not be dancing with anyone. He just kept squeezing my hand harder and trying to pull me out of the booth. I got angry when I felt something break in my hand and screamed at him “Get your effing hands off me!” The bar owner came over to see what the problem was. I explained that “this jerk just hurt my hand because I would not drink or dance with him!” The owner looked at me crying, and the man laughing, and kicked my friend and I out of the place! Seems the rude SOB was his best friend. I got a bad taste for places of that culture (although I do love the cuisine) and a broken bone in my left hand for my trouble. She and I never went out again because she was so embarrassed about what the guy did to me, but she did take me to the ER on the way home. Question: Who engaged in conversation in a booth at the bar? Options: - not enough information - the pregnant woman and the rude man - the pregnant woman and the bar owner - the pregnant woman and her friend A:","response":"The correct option is \\"the pregnant woman and the rude man\\". The context clearly states that the pregnant woman was sitting at a table (or booth) with her friend when the older man came over and began to insistently engage her in conversation, first offering her a drink, then pressuring her to dance with him. This shows that the man and the pregnant woman were the ones engaging in conversation at the booth. The bar owner and the pregnant woman only interacted when the situation escalated and the owner came to inquire about the problem, which happened a bit later and is not a part of the conversation at the booth. Thus, the pregnant woman and the friend even though initially seated together, it didn't mention they had been in a conversation at the booth when the incident happened. Hence, \\"the pregnant woman and the rude man\\" is the most accurate reply."},{"question":"Question: Given this review: \\"It is loved it\\" Would you recommend this app to a friend?

Hypothesis: You should stick to the streets with traffic because there's nothing worth seeing outside of them. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","response":"Step 1: Understand the premise and hypothesis. Premise states that if you take the time to see beyond streets filled with traffic, you will be rewarded. Hypothesis states that you should stick to the streets with traffic because there's nothing worth seeing outside of them. Step 2: Compare the premise and hypothesis. The premise suggests that exploring beyond traffic-filled streets leads to rewards, while the hypothesis implies that staying on traffic-filled streets is more beneficial because nothing of value exists beyond them. Step 3: Determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis. The premise and hypothesis essentially express opposite ideas. The premise indicates that there are potential rewards beyond traffic-filled streets, while the hypothesis maintains that there is nothing worth seeing outside of them. Conclusion: No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis, as they convey opposing concepts."},{"question":"Premise: Charlie Chaplin, Gloria Swanson, Rudolph Valentino, and others also flocked in to establish one of the most concentrated celebrity enclaves in the world. Hypothesis: Lots of celebrities went to the hotel to be seen. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","response":"Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis as it acknowledges that numerous celebrities, including Charlie Chaplin, Gloria Swanson, and Rudolph Valentino, gathered in this particular location. It is reasonable to infer that they went there to be seen and be part of the prominent celebrity enclaves. The premise suggests that this enclave was one of the most concentrated in the world, which could mean that it was not only a place where celebrities lived but also a place where they interacted, socialized, and participated in activities related to their fame. The area might have been a hub for entertainment-related events, parties, and gatherings of artists, directors, producers, and other influential individuals. The fact that these celebrities ‘flocked’ into the enclave shows that there was likely a strong hive mentality in this environment—they might have been drawn to this location to join the ranks of other famous individuals, benefit from the prestige of being in such a high-profile area and increase their chances of being noticed. Furthermore, celebrities often gather and live in close proximity to maintain their social networks and professional connections, especially in the entertainment industry. In this case, the high concentration of celebrities would result in more opportunities to be seen and recognized, further supporting the hypothesis. In addition, celebrities thrive on public attention and visibility, as it helps boost their careers and maintain their relevancy in the industry. Being in the midst of other celebrities increases the chances of attracting media attention, which is vital in the entertainment world. Therefore, it is likely that many of these celebrities went to the hotel or location mentioned in the premise with the intent to be seen and maintain their social and professional connections. To sum up, the premise entails the hypothesis that lots of celebrities went to the hotel to be seen. The high concentration of celebrity enclaves mentioned in the premise suggests that it attracted prominent figures who wanted to be in the spotlight and be part of a thriving entertainment community."},{"question":"Quoc: The 100 is a series of young adult science fiction novels by Kass Morgan.

Choices: - liquid nitrogen - steam room - tidal waves - ocean - crushed ice The rationale to choose \\"crushed ice\\" as the answer is that: The answer to this question is:","response":"\\"Crushed Ice\\" The rationale to choose \\"crushed ice\\" as the answer is based on several key factors: 1. Effectiveness: Crushed ice is extremely effective in making your cup of water colder. This is because ice, being a solid form of water, has a lower temperature than liquid water. As you add crushed ice to your cup of water, the ice transfers its cold energy to the water, effectively lowering its temperature. 2. Availability: Crushed ice is readily accessible for most people. Many households have ice trays or ice makers in their refrigerators, making it easy to obtain crushed ice. In contrast, liquid nitrogen requires specialized handling and is not commonly found in homes. 3. Safety: Using crushed ice to cool down a cup of water is a safe method. In contrast, using liquid nitrogen can be dangerous due to its extremely cold temperature (-320°F/-195.8°C). Direct exposure to liquid nitrogen can cause severe frostbite, and it requires specific safety precautions during handling. 4. Simplicity: Adding crushed ice to a cup of water is a simple and straightforward process. Conversely, using a steam room, tidal waves, or an ocean to cool down your water would likely be both impractical and inefficient. In conclusion, the best option for making your cup of water colder is to use crushed ice. Its effectiveness, availability, safety, and simplicity make it the most suitable choice among the options provided."},{"question":"At a public health summit in Washington, she hit back after the Trump administration loosened nutritional standards aimed at making US school lunches healthier. \\"Think about why someone is OK with your kids eating crap,\\" she said.

A person with understanding is aware of the consequences of their actions and the implications of the decisions they make. As a result, they are able to navigate their life's journey in a straight manner, avoiding any pitfalls or detours that may lead to failure or disappointment. In the Bible, the book of Proverbs contains several references to the importance and benefits of having understanding and wisdom. Proverbs 15:22 underscores the significance of counsel and guidance in one's life. When you have proper guidance, you are able to make informed decisions, which in turn result in success. This verse explains that without counsel, plans are more likely to fail. In other words, if an individual tries to accomplish something on their own, without seeking the advice of others who may have experience or knowledge in the matter, their endeavors may prove unsuccessful. Counsel takes many forms, such as seeking the guidance of trusted friends, consulting experts in a particular area, or even turning to God through prayer and scripture. It is important to remember that wisdom and understanding do not only come from one's own experiences or intelligence. Oftentimes, they can be gained from the insights and perspectives of others. Surrounding oneself with wise, experienced, or knowledgeable people and being open to their advice can significantly increase a person's chances of success. In conclusion, the passage \\"But a man of understanding keeps his way straight. 15:22 Where there is no counsel, plans fail,\\" highlights the importance of having guidance and seeking advice from others to ensure success. By fostering wisdom and understanding in one's life, it becomes easier to navigate the complexities of this world and achieve a straight path toward one's goals and aspirations."},{"question":"Mobile Stickstofferzeugerstation / Reifengas Erzeuger der neusten Generation.

Let's analyze both statements for better understanding. In the first statement, we have three men who are involved in a construction-related activity. They are working together to build something using bricks as the primary building material. This scenario focuses on a physical task that requires skills and effort related to construction or masonry. On the other hand, the second statement talks about a group of men watching a football game. This scenario involves people gathered together, possibly in a house, stadium, or public venue to enjoy a sporting event. Their primary activity is the passive observation of the game rather than actively working or constructing something. As we can see, these statements describe distinct situations that serve different purposes and involve unique activities. Thus, we cannot conclude that one is true simply based on the other being true. There is no given information or context that allows us to link the two statements or imply causality, relation, or connection between the building activity mentioned in the first statement and the football-watching scenario described in the second statement. In conclusion, while both statements contain groups of people engaging in an activity, the nature of the activities themselves and the given information prevents us from assuming any connection between them. Therefore, the presence of three men working on building something with bricks does not allow us to conclude that a group of men is watching a football game."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Information: - \\"Dancing with Myself\\" is a song written by singer Billy Idol and bassist Tony James, first recorded by their band Generation X in 1979.

'' \`\` in theory , yes . it would certainly be quicker and neater , except for two things . one : i do n't have access to the","response":"morgue anymore. As you may recall, my previous connection to the morgue was severed after that unfortunate incident during our last procurement attempt. The authorities have tightened security, and even the most skilled hacker would struggle to bypass their updated protocols. It would be too risky, and the resulting fallout would undoubtedly draw attention to our activities - not to mention the severe legal consequences we would face if caught. So, for now, acquiring a body through the morgue is no longer a viable option. Two: morality. Yes, we have been known to bend or break the rules in the pursuit of our goals. However, tampering with the dead is not a path I'm willing to tread lightly. Desecrating a corpse goes against the fundamental understanding of respecting the deceased and their grieving loved ones. Although our intentions may not be malicious, we must always weigh the ethical implications of our actions and strive to maintain a certain standard when it comes to the treatment of the departed. That being said, we must find an alternative solution to secure the body we need. Our most promising possibility is to establish connections with medical research centers and institutions that conduct anatomical studies. By presenting ourselves as legitimate researchers or scientists looking to further our understanding of a specific field, we might be able to obtain a donated cadaver without arousing suspicion. Of course, this approach will require meticulous planning and attention to detail. First, we'll have to create credible backgrounds and credentials for ourselves. This could involve forging degrees, certifications, and even creating a comprehensive online presence that showcases our fake professional histories. We'll also need to establish connections with influential individuals in our target research institutions, which may be achieved through networking events, conferences, or even online forums relevant to our chosen field of study. Once we have successfully infiltrated the medical research community, we'll need to identify a suitable body donor. Ideally, we want someone in relatively good health, with minimal physical abnormalities or injuries. In addition to reviewing the public donor registry, we might also consider contacting oncology wards, palliative care facilities, or organ transplant centers to inquire about potential donors who have recently passed away. Once we've secured a suitable cadaver, we must be cautious in our transportation and handling of the body to avoid any breaches in protocol or biohazard containment. We would have to make arrangements for a sterile and secure environment to carry out our plan, ideally an abandoned warehouse or secluded laboratory. Proper protective measures, such as wearing hazmat suits and employing air filtration systems, will also be essential to ensure our safety and prevent contamination. In conclusion, although obtaining a body from the morgue is no longer possible, we still have options on the table. By meticulously planning our infiltration into the medical research community and securing a legally and ethically sourced cadaver, we will be able to continue on our path without abandoning our principles. Our path may be more difficult, but ultimately it will ensure we maintain our integrity and avoid unnecessary trouble with the law."},{"question":"Write the last sentence in this story.

Movie title: Frost/Nixon Movie plot: After the Watergate scandal of 1972 and his subsequent resignation in 1974, 400 million worldwide watch Nixon leave the White House. Among them is British journalist David Frost, currently recording a talk show in Australia, who decides to interview Nixon. Nixonâs literary agent, Irving \\"Swifty\\" Lazar, believes the interview would be an opportunity for Nixon to salvage his reputation, and to make some money. Nixon ultimately demands 600,000, and Frost accepts. After persuading his friend and producer John Birt that the interviews would be a success, Frost and Birt travel to California to meet with Nixon. On the plane to California, Frost flirts with a young woman called Caroline Cushing, and they begin a relationship. Frost struggles to sell the interviews to U.S. networks, and decides to finance the project with private money and syndicate the broadcast of the interviews. He hires two investigators â Bob Zelnick and James Reston Jr. â to help him prepare, along with Birt. Frost is not clear on what he wants from the interview, and Reston encourages him to aim for a confession from Nixon. Under the watchful eye of Nixon's post-presidential chief of staff, Jack Brennan, Frost and Nixon embark on the first three recording sessions. Restricted by an agreed-upon timeframe and under pressure from his own team to ask the tough questions, Frost struggles to get a word in as Nixon dominates with lengthy and self-serving monologues, fencing ably on Vietnam and boasting about his achievements in foreign policy. Behind the scenes, Frost's editorial team is nervous about his interviewing technique, and angry that Nixon appears to be exonerating himself. Four days before the final session, which will center on Watergate, Frost receives a phonecall from an inebriated Nixon.

However, recent years have seen a surge in competition, giving customers a plethora of options to choose from. It is becoming evident that Apple's exclusive claim on consumer loyalty may no longer endure. This article will discuss the major reasons as to why Apple's free run for our smartphone hearts and minds is over and what challenges lay ahead for the tech giant. The Rise of Competitors One of the primary reasons that Apple enjoyed a significant run for so long was its status as the primary innovator in the smartphone industry. With the launch of the first iPhone back in 2007, Apple changed the world of communication forever. However, as time went on, various brands seized the opportunity to build on and improve upon Apple's innovations. 1. The Android Invasion: Arguably the most prominent challenger for Apple's throne has been Google's Android operating system (OS), which powers a majority of the world's smartphones today. The Android platform has provided Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) with a robust and developer-friendly environment to craft their own unique experiences. This versatility and openness of Android have led to an increase in OEMs and resulted in a diverse array of devices catering to various price ranges and preferences. 2. Quality Devices at Affordable Prices: Companies like Samsung, Huawei, OnePlus, and Xiaomi have significantly raised the bar for smartphone hardware and features. By offering premium-quality devices at competitive prices, they have managed to chip away at Apple's perceived exclusivity and superiority. 3. The Growth of Chinese Smartphone Makers: Chinese companies such as Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo, and Vivo have managed to rapidly expand their global footprint, often providing feature-packed devices at significantly lower costs than their competitors. Taking Notice of Consumer Needs Listening to customer demand and preferences plays a vital role in maintaining market dominance, and competitors have stepped up their game in this aspect. For instance, Apple's decision to remove the headphone jack in the iPhone 7 faced considerable backlash from users. Brands such as Samsung benefitted from public discontent by including the headphone jack in their flagship devices alongside other innovative features such as expandable storage, which offers flexibility and choice to its users. Software Innovation Apple's iOS has enjoyed a streamlined and cohesive user experience for years, but the Android OS has matured and improved exponentially in terms of performance, design, and overall user experience. As part of Android's evolution, regular feature updates, improved security, and a host of customization choices have narrowed the gap between iOS and Android, providing users more reasons to consider alternatives to Apple's products. Conclusion The days when Apple had a free run for our smartphone hearts and minds are indeed over. While Apple remains a dominant player in the smartphone market, an open battleground has emerged, with a multitude of options and features for customers to choose from. As the competition continues to intensify, it will be interesting to see the strategies adopted by Apple in the coming years in response to these challenges. We can expect innovation and evolution in both hardware and software, ultimately benefiting consumers as they become the driving force in an open and exciting smartphone landscape."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given an answer, and your task is to generate a reasonable question for that answer.

Crawford's Poultry breeding and genetics, squabs are omitted but Japanese quail and common pheasant are added to the list, the latter frequently being bred in captivity and released into the wild. In his 1848 classic book on poultry, Ornamental and Domestic Poultry: Their History, and Management, Edmund Dixon included chapters on the peafowl, guinea fowl, mute swan, turkey, various types of geese, the muscovy duck, other ducks and all types of chickens including bantams. In colloquial speech, the term \\"fowl\\" is often used near-synonymously with \\"domesticated chicken\\" (Gallus gallus), or with \\"poultry\\" or even just \\"bird\\", and many languages do not distinguish between \\"poultry\\" and \\"fowl\\". Both words are also used for the flesh of these birds. Poultry can be distinguished from \\"game\\", defined as wild birds or mammals hunted for food or sport, a word also used to describe the flesh of these when eaten.

Notice in particular the curves for NH4NO3 and CaCl2. The dissolution of ammonium nitrate in water is endothermic (ΔHsoln = +25.7 kJ/mol), whereas the dissolution of calcium chloride is exothermic (ΔHsoln = −68.2 kJ/mol), yet Figure 13.9 \\"Solubilities of Several Inorganic and Organic Solids in Water as a Function of Temperature\\" shows that the solubility of both compounds increases sharply with increasing temperature. In fact, the magnitudes of the changes in both enthalpy and entropy for dissolution are temperature dependent. Because the solubility of a compound is ultimately determined by relatively small differences between large numbers, there is generally no good way to predict how the solubility will vary with temperature. The variation of solubility with temperature has been measured for a wide range of compounds, and the results are published in many standard reference books. Chemists are often able to use this information to separate the components of a mixture byfractional crystallization, the separation of compounds on the basis of their solubilities in a given solvent. For example, if we have a mixture of 150 g of sodium acetate (CH3CO2Na) and 50 g of KBr, we can separate the two compounds by dissolving the mixture in 100 g of water at 80°C and then cooling the solution slowly to 0°C. According to the temperature curves in Figure 13.9 \\"Solubilities of Several Inorganic and Organic Solids in Water as a Function of Temperature\\", both compounds dissolve in water at 80°C, and all 50 g of KBr remains in solution at 0°C. Only about 36 g of CH3CO2Na are soluble in 100 g of water at 0°C, however, so approximately 114 g (150 g − 36 g) of Saylor URL: http://www. saylor. org/books.

Bravo denied bond by Florida court. Article:","response":"Title: Pedro Bravo Denied Bond in Florida Court for Attacking Christian Aguilar Hey kids, have you ever heard about Pedro Bravo and Christian Aguilar? Well, let me tell you a story that might help you understand why it's important to be kind and gentle with others. Once upon a time, there were two young men named Pedro Bravo and Christian Aguilar. These two didn't get along very well. One day, Pedro got very angry with Christian. Instead of talking to Christian or asking for help, Pedro did something very wrong. He beat Christian until he was hurt really badly and covered in ouchies. You see, this is not the way we should behave with one another. When someone makes us angry, we should talk about it or ask for help from a grown-up like our parents or teachers. Now, back to the story. After Pedro hurt Christian, the grown-ups who work at a place called the \\"court\\" found out about it. The court is a special place where grown-ups called judges help decide what to do when someone breaks the rules or does something wrong. The judge at the Florida court decided that Pedro should not be allowed to leave the court until his actions were properly looked at. This is called \\"denying bond.\\" The judge said Pedro broke very important rules called \\"laws\\" when he hurt Christian. Denying bond means Pedro has to stay in a place called \\"jail\\" until the court can decide what to do with him. Jail is a place where people who break the rules have to stay to learn their lesson and hopefully not break the rules again. They do not get to be with their family or friends during this time. So, the next time someone makes you angry or upsets you, remember Pedro and Christian's story, and do your best to talk about it or ask a grown-up for help. That way, we can all learn to treat each other with kindness and respect. And remember, it's always important to follow the rules and be gentle with others. That's how we can all be better friends and make the world a happier place."},{"question":"In the first round of bowling, Patrick knocked down a total of 70 pins and Richard knocked down 15 more pins than Patrick.

How many more pins in total did Richard knock down than Patrick? Let's think first. Chain of thought:","response":"1. Identify the number of pins knocked down by Richard in the first round. We know that Richard knocked down 15 more pins than Patrick, so: Richard's first round pins = Patrick's first round pins + 15 2. Identify the number of pins knocked down by Patrick and Richard in the second round. We know that Patrick knocked down twice as many pins as Richard in the first round, and Richard knocked down 3 less than Patrick. So: - Patrick's second round pins = 2 * Richard's first round pins - Richard's second round_pins = Patrick's second round_pins - 3 3. Compute the total pins knocked down by Patrick and Richard in both rounds. 4. Calculate the difference between the total pins knocked down by Richard and Patrick to find how many more pins Richard knocked down than Patrick. Now let's apply these steps to solve the problem: 1. Richard's first round pins = 70 (Patrick's) + 15 = 85 pins 2. In the second round: - Patrick's second round pins = 2 * 85 (Richard's) = 170 pins - Richard's second round pins = 170 (Patrick's) - 3 = 167 pins 3. Total pins knocked down: - Patrick's total pins = 70 (first round) + 170 (second round) = 240 pins - Richard's total pins = 85 (first round) + 167 (second round) = 252 pins 4.

I also assume that you've seen the first movie or at least know the general gist, so if you haven't some of this might not make sense. Plot: This movie beats the audience over the head with tired philosophical ramblings again and again in an attempt to get the theme across. We are bombarded again and again by questions of purpose, and destiny, and choice, and forced to endure the long, torturous platitude sessions that contain them. Neo, awakened from a dream in the last movie, now begins a period of realization about his own existence. There are a lot of revelations in this movie, which I'll be vague about so they won't seem like spoilers. *If you're still worried vague references will spoil the movie, don't read the paragraph below.* The strength and weakness of faith is revealed. The strengths and weaknesses of love, and its temporary nature, are also revealed. The interdependence of humans and technology, and our faith in technology, are also revealed. The importance of choice and experience is revealed. Explaining further things that are revealed would go into too much detail, so I will refrain (as the guidelines for writing a commentary asks). Btw, by \\"revealed\\" I mean pounded through our ears and eyes like nails. Storyline: So how does Neo and the gang get from the end of the last movie to the beginning of the next one? In short, they keep the faith, and use and abuse overly-stylized action and bullet-time like it's going out of style (and after this display, I'm hoping movie-goers and makers alike learn to appreciate subtlety and originality a bit more). More on that later. To not spoil anything, I will say no more than the promo material already did: Neo is still trying to figure out the Matrix, and he is looking for answers while trying to save the humans, and Zion, all while baddies are going after him and his cohorts. The movie pretty much picks up where the last one left off. Action: While martial arts action and gunplay peppered its predecessor in somewhat equal parts, this movie focuses much more on martial arts than gunplay, adding swords, sais, etc. to the mix. Special effects are so often used and waved in the audience's face that it becomes really tiresome. I've discussed this movie with friends and coworkers alike, and nearly all of them found some of the action sequences--especially the \\"Smith fight\\" we all heard would be in the movie--to be too long and tedious. This is a huge red flag for action fans, because the end of an action sequence should either leave you wanting a slight bit more, or completely content with the awesomeness that just occured. These fights scenes do neither. They are over-stylized, over-the-top sequences that are wooden and uninspired. In the first movie, there was a real sense of desperation to some of the action, a sense that fighting was for survival, not just looking good (which I honestly don't think they manage in Reloaded anyway) in black and leather. Go watch Drunken Master or Iron Monkey after this movie to remind yourself of what good fighting sequences are--you won't regret it. In addition, the \\"Matrix abilities\\" people have in Reloaded is not consistent, and what they actually do is not consistent. The first movie had its inconsistencies here, but they weren't too glaring--unlike Reloaded. Special effects are poured on and on and on. Every little thing someone does, be it just jump, somersault, spin, and in many cases just pose, are slow-moed, bullet-timed, or over-accentuated by some sort of destruction. It's evident the W Bros had a ton of money to throw at this movie, and boy did they throw it, with no real restraint. Sharp editors could have really helped this, but the first movie was such a hit that free reign was obviously given, which brings us to. . . Character and dialogue: I have already more or less said the dialogue was tired and full of philosophical platitudes. Actors can't really bring a lot of depth to their character when the script and direction is shoving character progression audience's face, or neglecting it altogether. The audience is at no time given nuance and substance so they can contemplate the character on their own. Keanu's acting performance is stiff at best. Keanu is good at acting confused, and that's about all he does in this film. He makes a decent attempt to show passion between Neo and Trinity, but it falls flat. Lawrence tries to make Morpheus everything from Moses to Henry V, and be as cool as a cat throughout. With the script he is provided, he makes a noble attempt, but it also falls flat. Moss isn't very believable either. Her look of concern is always the same, much like Keanu's, and the chemistry isn't there, although in their very physical scenes they fake it well enough. Hugo once again brought his weird sense of being an Agent program, but he too suffered from the script's hand. I actually find him to be the most interesting character of the bunch, but instead of development they just make him an excuse for a huge, drawn out fight scene. All in all, this movie is beyond disappointing if you had good expectations, and on its own, as a stand-alone movie (which is not how it's supposed to be taken), it's still horrible. I don't see The Matrix as deep, but I at least see it as an enjoyable scifi romp that has some interesting ideas, good action, a few funny lines, and enough restrained symbolism and elusions to amuse the attentive. Reloaded fails on all these counts, and I really hope the W Bros will give us a better experience in the 3rd installment. Granted, I don't have a lot of hope left for that after this film.

In an interview with Der Spiegel published on Friday, Paul Wolfowitz, who served as deputy secretary of defense during George W. Bush’s presidency, said he would likely vote for Hillary Clinton—though he noted he had “big reservations” about her. Wolfowitz said he agreed with those who deemed the Republican nominee a security threat. “The only way you can be comfortable about Trump's foreign policy, is to think he doesn't really mean anything he says,” he said. “Our security depends on having good relationships with our allies. Trump mainly shows contempt for them. And he seems to be unconcerned about the Russian aggression in Ukraine. By doing this he tells them that they can go ahead and do what they are doing. That is dangerous.” Wolfowitz is only the latest in his cohort to throw his support behind Clinton, or at the very least to declare public opposition to Trump. Neoconservative intellectuals and pundits like Bill Kristol, Max Boot, and Robert Kagan have also been particularly harsh in criticizing Trump. Richard Armitage, who is less associated with the group but served under Bush, has also announced he’ll support Clinton. Meanwhile, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and President Bush himself have remained pointedly silent, declining to back the Republican nominee. There are a few notable exceptions, and they are perhaps the two highest-profile neoconservatives: former Vice President Dick Cheney, and former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. Those two men were both in Republican politics before the rise of the neocons, and found that their belligerent style was well tailored to an alliance. They are also, as Jonathan Chait notes, among the Gentile members of a movement that originated with Jewish intellectuals. There are some straightforward reasons for the alliance with Clinton. Though they may disagree with her on many issues, particularly domestically, the neocons are focused more than anything on foreign policy. In that realm, Clinton represents a fairly standard, mainstream position, and in fact she has shown herself to be somewhat more hawkish than many Democrats, backing both the war in Iraq and intervention in Libya. Trump, on the other hand, has toppled pillar after pillar of policy orthodoxy, from his praise for Vladimir Putin to his dismissal of longstanding alliances. But the wave of neocon love also makes many of Clinton’s Democratic supporters uncomfortable. As the chaotic and failed attempts to stop Trump over the last year have shown, there’s no obviously right choice for how conservatives should respond. But which choice are people making? Here’s a list of some major figures and where they stand on Trump—right now. We’ll keep it updated as other important people take stances, or as these ones change their views about Trump. Party Elders Jason Reed/ Reuters George W. Bush: ABSTAIN The former president “does not plan to participate in or comment on the presidential campaign,” an aide told the Texas Tribune. (May 4, 2016) George H.W. Bush: ABSTAIN “At age 91, President Bush is retired from politics. He came out of retirement to do a few things for Jeb, but those were the exceptions that proved the rule,” an aide told the Texas Tribune. (May 4, 2016) Barbara Bush: NAY Unlike her husband and elder son, the former first lady has publicly disavowed Trump. “I mean, unbelievable. I don't know how women can vote for someone who said what he said about Megyn Kelly, it’s terrible,” she told CBS in February. “And we knew what he meant too.” (February 4, 2016) Marc Racicot: NAY Racicot, a confidant of former President George W. Bush who chaired the RNC from 2001 to 2003, tells Bloomberg, “I cannot and will not support Donald Trump for president.” (August 3, 2016) Vin Weber: NAY A former Minnesota congressman who helped Newt Gingrich bring the Republican Party to power and is now a lobbyist, Weber has ruled out Trump. “I won't vote for Trump,” he told CNBC. “I can't imagine I'd remain a Republican if he becomes president.” (August 3, 2016) Gordon Humphrey: NAY The former U.S. senator from New Hampshire says he cannot vote for Trump, calling him “a sociopath, without a conscience or feelings of guilt, shame or remorse.” Humphrey told NBC he may reluctantly vote for Hillary Clinton, but only if it’s a close contest. (August 4, 2016) George P. Bush: YEA The scion of the Bush family, who is currently Texas land commissioner, has broken with other members of the Bush clan, who have either pointedly abstained or said they would not vote for Trump. “From Team Bush, it's a bitter pill to swallow, but you know what? You get back up and you help the man that won, and you make sure that we stop Hillary Clinton,” he said. (August 6, 2016) Chris Shays: NAY A longtime moderate Republican U.S. representative from Connecticut who lost his seat in 2008, Shays has endorsed Hillary Clinton. “I think many Republicans know Donald Trump could cause great damage to our country and the world at large, and still plan to vote for him. But not me,” Shays wrote for CNN. He said he backs Clinton not reluctantly but with “strong conviction.” (August 10, 2016) Representatives Jonathan Ernst / Reuters Paul Ryan: YEA (was UNDECIDED) The House speaker once again affirmed his backing for Trump, offering the-less-than-resounding statement, “That’s not my plan. I don’t have a plan to do that.” (June 16, 2016) has condemned Trump’s attacks on Judge Gonzalo Curiel’s as “absolutely unacceptable,” saying, “Claiming a person can’t do their job because of their race is sort of like the textbook definition of a racist comment,” but adding that he isn’t dropping his support for Trump. (June 7, 2016) Ryan previously announced that he will vote for Trump: I'll be voting for @realDonaldTrump this fall. I'm confident he will help turn the House GOP's agenda into laws. https://t.co/LyaT16khJw — Paul Ryan (@PRyan) June 2, 2016 Ryan said he had become convinced that Trump would help Ryan enact his House agenda. (June 2, 2016) Ryan initially said he intended to support the Republican nominee, but after Trump clinched the nomination, he said he was not yet prepared to back Trump. “To be perfectly candid with you, I’m just not ready to that at this point,” he told CNN’s Jake Tapper. “I’m not there. I hope to, and I want to.” He said the party needs “a standard-bearer that bears our standards.” (May 5, 2016) Kevin McCarthy: YEA The House majority leader, a Californian, has broken with Speaker Paul Ryan and will back Trump. McCarthy has signed up as a prospective delegate for Trump in the Golden State. (May 10, 2016) Steve Scalise: YEA The House majority whip, a Louisiana representative, offered Trump a tepid endorsement. (The two men share the dubious distinction of being linked politically to David Duke.) “I've always said that I will support the Republican nominee,” Scalise said. “Now is the time for for our party to unite around Donald Trump so that we can focus on defeating Hillary Clinton in November to prevent another four years of job-killing, big government policies so we can get our economy back on track.” (May 5, 2016) Cathy McMorris Rodgers: YEA (formerly UNDECIDED) The Washington representative, who is chair of the House Republican Caucus, offered Trump a tepid endorsement, pointing out that he was the choice of primary voters, but adding, “In the months ahead, he will have to earn the presidency by demonstrating that he has the temperament for the job and plans to empower every American to pursue a future of opportunity and freedom.” (May 19, 2016) McMorris Rodgers previously said she had not made up her mind. “Before I endorse him, I would like to have a conversation with him. I would like to ask him questions about some of the statements he’s made,” she told The Spokesman-Review. (May 5, 2016) Raul Labrador: YEA The Idaho congressman, a Tea Party hero, tepidly backs Trump after opposing him in the primary and backing Cruz. “There are some things he doesn’t quite understand,” Labrador told The Huffington Post. “With Trump, I have at least some hope that he’s going to make the right choice.” Ileana Ros-Lehtinen: NAY The senior member of the Florida congressional delegation says she will write Jeb Bush’s name in on the ballot in November. (August 11, 2016) Ros-Lehtinen, who was born in Cuba and emigrated to the United States, has said she will not vote for Trump. “I will work with whomever is chosen by the American people to serve as president, because I deeply respect the American constitutional system,” she said in a statement. “In this election, I do not support either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton.” (May 6, 2016) Fred Upton: ABSTAIN The longtime Michigan congressman (and, true fact, uncle of Kate) says he will not endorse Trump, though he stopped short of saying he would not vote for him. “There’s a lot of things that folks are not happy about with either of these two candidates,” he said during a radio interview. “We’re running our own race, and don’t look for me to endorse anyone in this race probably the rest of the year.” (June 16, 2016) Richard Hanna: NAY Hanna, a retiring congressman who represents a swing district in central New York, is the first House Republican to say he will vote for Hillary Clinton. “For me, it is not enough to simply denounce [Trump’s] comments: He is unfit to serve our party and cannot lead this country,” Hanna wrote in the Syracuse Post-Standard. “Secretary Clinton has issues that depending on where one stands can be viewed as great or small…. While I disagree with her on many issues, I will vote for Mrs. Clinton.” (August 2, 2016) Charlie Dent: NAY Dent, a moderate Republican who represents southeastern Pennsylvania, said he doesn’t intend to vote for Trump or Clinton. “I’m not planning to vote for either of the two major-party nominees and I’m not ready to say I’m going to vote for the libertarians either,” he told Jake Tapper. (August 2, 2016) Adam Kinzinger: NAY The Illinois representative, a former Air Force pilot hails from a district west and south of Chicago, criticized Ted Cruz when he didn’t endorse Trump at the RNC. But then after Trump suggested not supporting NATO allies, Kinzinger described the idea as “utterly disastrous,” and he now tells CNN, “I don't see how I can get there anymore.” (August 3, 2016) Mike Coffman: UNDECIDED In a new television ad, the Colorado representative says, “People ask me, 'What do you think about Trump?' Honestly, I don't care for him much. And I certainly don't trust Hillary.\\" He promises to “stand up to” Trump. A spokeswoman says he is considering other candidates, but he has not ruled out voting for the nominee. (August 4, 2016) Bob Dold: NAY The Illinois congressman, who represents the northern suburbs of Chicago, was among the first Republicans to say he would not vote for Trump. “Whether it be Mr. Trump’s comments about women, his comments about Muslims, his comments about Latinos, for me it was very personal his comments about POWs,” Dold told WLS in May, adding, “I want to make that I’m clear about this, I’m not going to support Hillary Clinton either. I would write someone in.” (May 6, 2016) Scott Rigell: NAY The Virginia congressman, who represents the Virginia Beach area, has become the first Republican member of Congress to say that he will vote for Libertarian Gary Johnson. Rigell says he long ago decided he could not back Trump. “When their own conscience is seared by some statement that Trump has made, I have encouraged them to be direct and also, in a timely manner, repudiate what he said,” he told The New York Times. (August 7, 2016) Dave Reichert: UNDECIDED The Washington congressman, who represents a district just east of Seattle, said in an interview with KIRO radio that he would “never” endorse Trump. But he also said he wouldn’t vote for Clinton, and when pressed on whether he would vote for Trump, he added, “I never said I wouldn’t vote for him, I just said I wouldn’t endorse him.” (August 11, 2016) In dropping out of the Republican race after losing to Trump, Cruz did not make any indication whether he was willing to back his rival. (May 3, 2016) Jeff Sessions: YEA The Alabama senator was Trump’s first endorser from the Senate, and he has been a high-profile backer and adviser to Trump’s campaign. Susan Collins: NAY (was UNDECIDED) The moderate Maine senator writes in a Washington Post column that she has decided she cannot vote for Trump. “I have become increasingly dismayed by his constant stream of cruel comments and his inability to admit error or apologize,” she writes. “But it was his attacks directed at people who could not respond on an equal footing—either because they do not share his power or stature or because professional responsibility precluded them from engaging at such a level—that revealed Mr. Trump as unworthy of being our president.” She has not said for whom she will vote. (August 9, 2016) Collins previously told Time that she was in wait-and-see mode. “I’ve said from the point that it became obvious that Donald Trump was going to be the Republican candidate that I’d always supported previous presidential nominees of my party but that in this case I was going to wait and see what happened and that is what I am continuing to do.” (June 7, 2016) Having previously said that her backing from Trump would be contingent upon a shift in his rhetoric, Collins then said she would support the nominee. (May 6, 2016) Collins said: “I have always supported the Republican nominee for president, and I suspect I would do so this year, but I do want see what Donald Trump does from here on out.” To win her vote, “He’s going to have stop with gratuitous personal insults,” she said, amusingly. (May 4, 2016) John McCain: YEA The Arizona senator and 2008 GOP presidential nominee, who is in a tight reelection battle, released a scorching statement criticizing Trump for his comments about Gold Star parents Khizr and Ghazala Khan, but he did not revoke his support. (August 1, 2016) McCain has said publicly that he’ll back the nominee. In a private recording obtained by Politico, however, he frets that Trump endangers his reelection effort, while his former top aide Mark Salter is backing Clinton. (May 5, 2016) Kelly Ayotte: YEA Like her friend John McCain, the New Hampshire senator attacked Trump for his feud with Gold Star parents Khizr and Ghazala Khan, pronouncing herself “appalled” but giving no indication that she will withdraw backing for Trump. (August 1, 2016) Ayotte, who is also in a tight reelection battle, previously said she plans to “support” but not “endorse” Trump, whatever that means. (May 5, 2016) Rand Paul: YEA In a fascinating interview with WDRB (via Reason), the Kentucky senator and former presidential candidate said citizens should vote their conscience, while suggesting that he was only publicly backing Trump because he had pledged during the primary to support the nominee. “I've made my complaints about our nominee quite explicit. I continue to do so, but also don't see it as my job now—the thing is, is: I do think that my word is important. I signed a document, not under duress, but I signed a document saying I wouldn't run as a third party and I will support the nominee.” (August 2, 2016) Paul has said he will support Trump. (His father, ex-congressman and presidential contender Ron Paul, says he will not.) (May 4, 2016) Lindsey Graham: NAY The South Carolina senator and former presidential candidate blasted Trump following the nominee’s attacks on Judge Gonzalo Curiel, saying fellow Republicans should withdraw their endorsements. “This is the most un-American thing from a politician since Joe McCarthy,” he said. “If anybody was looking for an off-ramp, this is probably it. There’ll come a time when the love of country will trump hatred of Hillary.” (June 7, 2016) Graham was one of Trump’s most prominent critics during the primary, even endorsing Cruz even though he’d previously likened the choice between him and Trump to a choice between poisoning and being shot. The day Trump won Indiana, Graham tweeted: If we nominate Trump, we will get destroyed.......and we will deserve it. — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) May 3, 2016 Graham says he will not vote for either Trump or Clinton. (May 6, 2016) Pat Toomey: UNDECIDED The Pennsylvania senator, another endangered incumbent, has not made up his mind. “As I have said repeatedly, I have not endorsed Donald Trump,” he said at a press conference. “There are things that he has said, a number of things he has said and done that give me great pause and I have significant concerns about, so I remain in a mode of waiting to be persuaded. I’ve not made a final decision on what I’m going to do. Hillary Clinton is completely unacceptable to me.” (August 10, 2016) Toomey previously said: “It certainly looks like Donald Trump is on his way to the nomination .… Donald Trump was not my first choice. He wasn’t my second choice or third or fourth choice. I have lots have differences with Donald Trump and lots of problems with him but I am absolutely in the ‘never Hillary Clinton’ camp.” (May 4, 2016) Mark Kirk: NAY (was YEA) The Illinois senator, one of this year’s most endangered incumbents, says he will write in Colin Powell for president. (August 11, 2016) Kirk previously announced that he is no longer supporting Donald Trump—the first Republican to rescind his backing. “After much consideration, I have concluded that Donald Trump has not demonstrated the temperament necessary to assume the greatest office in the world,” he said. (June 7, 2016) Kirk previously said he’d back Trump if nominated. Tom Cotton: YEA The rising-star Arkansas senator weakly endorsed Trump. “I’ve long said that I will support the Republican nominee because we can’t afford a third Obama-Clinton term,” he said. He had previously criticized Trump for mocking John McCain, but also said Trump would be “a more serious leader for our country” that Clinton. (May 5, 2016) Bob Corker: YEA The Tennessee senator, who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has said he is willing to help Trump. Corker praised Trump’s otherwise widely panned foreign-policy address and is reportedly talking to him about overseas matters. He’s been mentioned as VP candidate.

I will not be voting for Donald Trump for president. This is not a decision I make lightly, for I am a lifelong Republican. But Donald Trump does not reflect historical Republican values nor the inclusive approach to governing that is critical to healing the divisions in our country. When the primary season started, it soon became apparent that, much like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Mr. Trump was connecting with many Americans who felt that their voices were not being heard in Washington and who were tired of political correctness. But rejecting the conventions of political correctness is different from showing complete disregard for common decency. Mr. Trump did not stop with shedding the stilted campaign dialogue that often frustrates voters. Instead, he opted for a constant stream of denigrating comments, including demeaning Sen. John McCain’s (R-Ariz.) heroic military service and repeatedly insulting Fox News host Megyn Kelly. With the passage of time, I have become increasingly dismayed by his constant stream of cruel comments and his inability to admit error or apologize. But it was his attacks directed at people who could not respond on an equal footing — either because they do not share his power or stature or because professional responsibility precluded them from engaging at such a level — that revealed Mr. Trump as unworthy of being our president. [When it comes to Trump, a Republican Treasury secretary says: Choose country over party] The number of influential Republican officials saying that they can't vote for either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton is growing as Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) pledges she won't vote for Trump. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) My conclusion about Mr. Trump’s unsuitability for office is based on his disregard for the precept of treating others with respect, an idea that should transcend politics. Instead, he opts to mock the vulnerable and inflame prejudices by attacking ethnic and religious minorities. Three incidents in particular have led me to the inescapable conclusion that Mr. Trump lacks the temperament, self-discipline and judgment required to be president. The first was his mocking of a reporter with disabilities, a shocking display that did not receive the scrutiny it deserved. I kept expecting Mr. Trump to apologize, at least privately, but he did not, instead denying that he had done what seemed undeniable to anyone who watched the video. At the time, I hoped that this was a terrible lapse, not a pattern of abuse. The second was Mr. Trump’s repeated insistence that Gonzalo Curiel, a federal judge born and raised in Indiana, could not rule fairly in a case involving Trump University because of his Mexican heritage. For Mr. Trump to insist that Judge Curiel would be biased because of his ethnicity demonstrated a profound lack of respect not only for the judge but also for our constitutional separation of powers, the very foundation of our form of government. Again, I waited in vain for Mr. Trump to retract his words. Third was Donald Trump’s criticism of the grieving parents of Army Capt. Humayun Khan, who was killed in Iraq. It is inconceivable that anyone, much less a presidential candidate, would attack two Gold Star parents. Rather than honoring their sacrifice and recognizing their pain, Mr. Trump disparaged the religion of the family of an American hero. And once again, he proved incapable of apologizing, of saying he was wrong. I am also deeply concerned that Mr. Trump’s lack of self-restraint and his barrage of ill-informed comments would make an already perilous world even more so. It is reckless for a presidential candidate to publicly raise doubts about honoring treaty commitments with our allies. Mr. Trump’s tendency to lash out when challenged further escalates the possibility of disputes spinning dangerously out of control. [Ghazala Khan: Trump criticized my silence. He knows nothing about true sacrifice.] I had hoped that we would see a “new” Donald Trump as a general-election candidate — one who would focus on jobs and the economy, tone down his rhetoric, develop more thoughtful policies and, yes, apologize for ill-tempered rants. But the unpleasant reality that I have had to accept is that there will be no “new” Donald Trump, just the same candidate who will slash and burn and trample anything and anyone he perceives as being in his way or an easy scapegoat. Regrettably, his essential character appears to be fixed, and he seems incapable of change or growth. 1 of 14 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × These Republicans refuse to vote for Donald Trump View Photos And they’ll tell you why.

Former Secretary of State Colin Powell “General Powell said at a meeting of the Long Island Association that he would be voting for Hillary Clinton,” a spokeswoman confirmed Oct. 25. Powell added in an interview that he picked Clinton “because I think she’s qualified, and the other gentleman is not qualified.” Nikki Kahn/The Washington Post Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. At the same time, I realize that Mr. Trump’s success reflects profound discontent in this country, particularly among those who feel left behind by an unbalanced economy and who wonder whether their children will have a better life than their parents. As we have seen with the dissatisfaction with both major- party nominees — neither of whom I support — these passions are real and the public will demand action. Some will say that as a Republican I have an obligation to support my party’s nominee. I have thought long and hard about that, for being a Republican is part of what defines me as a person. I revere the history of my party, most particularly the value it has always placed on the worth and dignity of the individual, and I will continue to work across the country for Republican candidates. It is because of Mr. Trump’s inability and unwillingness to honor that legacy that I am unable to support his candidacy. ||||| Fifty of the nation’s most senior Republican national security officials, many of them former top aides or cabinet members for President George W. Bush, have signed a letter declaring that Donald J. Trump “lacks the character, values and experience” to be president and “would put at risk our country’s national security and well-being.” Mr. Trump, the officials warn, “would be the most reckless president in American history.” The letter says Mr. Trump would weaken the United States’ moral authority and questions his knowledge of and belief in the Constitution. It says he has “demonstrated repeatedly that he has little understanding” of the nation’s “vital national interests, its complex diplomatic challenges, its indispensable alliances and the democratic values” on which American policy should be based. And it laments that “Mr. Trump has shown no interest in educating himself.” “None of us will vote for Donald Trump,” the letter states, though it notes later that many Americans “have doubts about Hillary Clinton, as do many of us.” While foreign policy elites in both parties often argue among themselves — behind closed doors, or politely in the pages of Foreign Affairs magazine — it is extraordinarily rare for them to step into the political arena so publicly and aggressively. Several former midlevel officials issued a similar if milder letter in March, during the primaries. But Monday’s letter included many senior former officials who until now have remained silent in public, even while denouncing Mr. Trump’s policies over dinners or in small Republican conclaves. ||||| Focused crawls are collections of frequently-updated webcrawl data from narrow (as opposed to broad or wide) web crawls, often focused on a single domain or subdomain. |||||","response":"Hillary Clinton is receiving support from neoconservatives due to her more traditional foreign policy approach, compared to Donald Trump's dismissal of long-standing alliances and praise for Putin.

This might happen because of heavy rains. Floodplains In very flat regions, flood water may spread out on the surface of the land. It then slows down and drops its sediment. If a river floods often, a floodplain develops. A floodplain is an area where a thick layer of rich soil is left behind as the floodwater recedes. Thats why floodplains are usually good places for growing plants. They are very flat areas and they have very rich soils. The Nile River valley is a great example of a floodplain. Each year, the Nile River rises over its banks. This floodwater carries a lot of sediment. This sediment has been eroded off areas of land from upstream. This sediment is dropped as the water slows down after spreading across the land. What is left behind is a very rich soil. Thats why crops can be raised in the middle of a sandy desert. Natural Levees A flooding river often forms natural levees along its banks. A levee is a raised strip of sediments deposited close to the waters edge. Question: \\"Where does the sediment in a flooding river come from, and where does it eventually come to rest?\\" Response: \\"Eroded from land upstream\\" Select from the following. * no * yes Does the response correctly answer the question?","response":"Yes The response correctly answers the question because it states that the sediment in a flooding river comes from eroded land upstream. As the river floods, the sediment is carried downstream and eventually comes to rest on the floodplain when the water slows down. The other answer, \\"no,\\" would suggest that the response did not answer the question correctly, which is not accurate."},{"question":"I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What contains an ornately carved fireplace? ? In comparison to other rooms within the castle, Lord Bute's Bedroom, sited above the Winch Room, is relatively small and simple. The original plan had Bute's personal accommodation in the Keep but the expansion of the Drawing Room to a double-height room in 1879 required a late change of plan. The bedroom contains an ornately carved fireplace. Doors lead off the room to an internal balcony overlooking the courtyard and to the bretache over the gate arch. The furniture is mainly by Chapple and post-dates Burges, although the washstand and dressing table are pared-down versions of two pieces – the Narcissus Washstand and the Crocker Dressing Table – that Burges made for his own home in London, The Tower House.This bedroom is also less richly ornamented than many in the castle, making extensive use of plain, stencilled geometrical patterns on the walls. Crook suggested this provided some \\"spartan\\" relief before the culmination of the castle in Lady Bute's Bedroom but Floud considered the result \\"thin\\" and drab in comparison with the more richly decorated chambers. The bedroom would have been impractical for regular use, lacking wardrobes and other storage.

Waves of energy radiate out from an earthquake’s focus. These waves are called seismic waves ( Figure below ). Seismic waves go different speeds through different materials. They change speed when they go from one type of material to another. This causes them to bend. Some seismic waves do not travel through liquids or gases. They just stop. Scientists use information from seismic waves to understand what makes up the Earth’s interior. Paragraph: A team of geologists studied two islands. Large island had a lot of seismic activity, and Small island that presented almost no seismic activity. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which island displayed more seismic waves?

Identify the cause. Decide on a treatment method.","response":"Title: Understanding and Treating Inverted Nipples Hello kids! Today, we will talk about a body part called \\"nipples.\\" Nipples are those little bumps on our chest just above our belly. Some people have nipples that stick out while others have nipples that point inwards. When nipples point inwards, they are called \\"inverted nipples.\\" In this article, we will learn how to find out the \\"grade\\" of inverted nipples, figure out what caused them, and discuss different ways to treat them. Let's begin! Step 1: Determine the Grade of Your Inverted Nipples Just like how you get grades in school, inverted nipples also have grades. These grades help us know how serious or not-so-serious the inverted nipples are. There are three grades, which are like Goldilocks and the Three Bears, the first one is not too much, the second is a bit more, and the third is the most. - Grade One: Inverted nipples can come out easily if we gently squeeze or pull them, and they can stay out for a while. This grade is just like a shy turtle's head, it can come out of its shell easily and stay out too. - Grade Two: In this grade, the nipples can still come out when squeezed or pulled, but they have a harder time staying out. They go back in quickly, sort of like a scared turtle who quickly hides back in its shell. - Grade Three: These nipples are the most inverted. They are very tough to bring out and won't stay out even for a moment. It's like a very, very shy turtle who doesn't want to come out of its shell at all. Step 2: Identify the Cause of Your Inverted Nipples Inverted nipples happen because of different reasons. It's like when we get a tummy ache – sometimes, it's because we ate too much, while other times, it's because we are sick. Some common reasons for inverted nipples are: - Being born with them (Sometimes, they just come with the package, like our hair or eye color.) - Changes during our body's growth (Like how we grow taller, our chest area can change, too.) - Infections or illnesses (Just like colds that make our noses stuffy, sometimes, illnesses can cause inverted nipples.) Step 3: Decide on a Treatment Method Now that you know the grade and the cause, it's time to decide how to treat inverted nipples. Like how we get better from a cold with different medicines, there are different ways to help inverted nipples come out. - Simple exercises: For grade one and some grade two inverted nipples, gentle pinching, pulling, or massaging the nipples can help them stay out. - Nipple shields or nipple formers: These are like tiny hats for nipples that help them stick out. They can be used for grade one and two inverted nipples. - Breast pump: It's a machine that helps mothers get milk for their babies, but it can also help gently pull out inverted nipples in grade two or three. - Surgery: In the most serious cases (grade three), doctors can help the nipples come out through a small operation, just like how they fix broken bones. That's it, kids! Now you know more about inverted nipples, what grade they might have, what causes them, and how to treat them. Remember, it's important to talk to a grown-up or a doctor if you have questions or need help with your body."},{"question":"Can we conclude from \\"A man has climbed a ladder to get a good picture in a mountainous area.\\" that \\"A man is inside.\\"?

Please do chain-of-thought reasoning. Which of these sentences doesn't make sense? Options: - Sentence A: \\"My fly ate a lizard\\" - Sentence B: \\"My lizard ate a fly\\"","response":"In order to determine which sentence doesn't make sense, we must analyze the meaning of each sentence along with the plausibility of the event. Sentence A: \\"My fly ate a lizard\\" In this sentence, it is stated that a fly (presumably a common housefly) ate a lizard. Flies are typically small, winged insects that primarily feed on decaying organic matter, nectar, or blood. They are known to occasionally eat other smaller insects but generally do not have the ability or the need to consume larger animals like a lizard. Moreover, the size difference between a fly and a lizard makes this scenario highly unlikely. Therefore, this sentence does not make much sense. Sentence B: \\"My lizard ate a fly\\" In this sentence, it is stated that a lizard ate a fly. Lizards are reptiles that can have varying diets, depending on the species. Many lizards are known to eat insects, including flies. Some examples of lizards that eat insects are geckos, skinks, and chameleons. As such, it is plausible that a lizard ate a fly. This sentence, therefore, makes sense. Based on our analysis, Sentence A: \\"My fly ate a lizard\\" does not make sense, whereas Sentence B: \\"My lizard ate a fly\\" makes sense given the typical characteristics, abilities, and dietary habits of flies and lizards."},{"question":"Please add punctuation to this: 83 David struck also Hadadezer the son of Rehob king of Zobah as he went to recover his dominion at the River Punctuation version:","response":"83.

But Nicky Morgan, Minister for Women and Equalities, said the government had improved prospects for working women. The Fawcett Society's survey of 1,000 low paid women found that almost half felt worse off than five years ago and nearly one in 10 had taken out a loan from a pay day lender in the past year. The society said increasing levels of women in low paid work, along with the declining value of low pay, was contributing to a widening inequality gap between women and men. The gender pay gap rose for the first time in five years, and now stands at 19.1% for all employees, it said. Dr Eva Neitzert, deputy chief executive at the Fawcett Society, which campaigns for women's equality and rights, said: \\"The evidence is clear, after five years of decline, the UK economy is back on the upswing.

Question 2: What causes a dog to throw up white liquid? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","response":"Question 1: Why do dogs throw up yellow foam? Dogs throw up yellow foam primarily because of bile. Bile is a digestive fluid produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder, released into the small intestine when needed to help with digestion. The yellow foam in your dog's vomit is likely bile mixed with other gastric secretions and mucus. Here are some reasons why a dog might throw up yellow foam: 1. Empty stomach: If a dog's stomach is empty for too long, bile and gastric juices can irritate the stomach lining, causing the dog to vomit a yellow foam. This is common when a dog has gone a long time without eating, such as overnight or between meals. 2. Ingesting indigestible matter: If a dog consumes something that the body cannot process, such as grass, it may cause irritation in the stomach, leading to the dog throwing up bile. 3. Gastrointestinal issues: A dog may also vomit yellow foam due to irritation or inflammation within the gastrointestinal tract. Conditions such as gastritis, inflammatory bowel disease, or even pancreatitis can lead to vomiting of bile. 4. Food intolerance: Some dogs might have an intolerance or sensitivity to certain foods. This can lead to gastrointestinal upset and vomiting of yellow foam. 5. Stress: Just like humans, dogs can experience stress-induced vomiting. If a dog is extremely stressed or anxious, it can lead to vomiting of bile. Question 2: What causes a dog to throw up white liquid? When a dog throws up white liquid, it typically indicates that the dog is vomiting gastric secretions and mucus. The white liquid might be frothy or foamy in appearance. There are a number of reasons why a dog may vomit white liquid, including: 1. Empty stomach: Similar to vomiting yellow foam, a dog may vomit white liquid when its stomach is empty. This is often due to gastric secretions and stomach acid irritating the stomach lining. 2. Indigestion: A dog may vomit white liquid if it is experiencing indigestion, usually caused by consuming a new food, eating too quickly, or consuming a large meal. 3. Regurgitation: Regurgitation is different from vomiting, as it involves the expulsion of undigested food or foreign matter from the esophagus. Sometimes, regurgitated material can come up as a white liquid, which indicates that the dog has not properly digested its food. 4. Gastrointestinal issues: Inflammation, infection, or obstruction within the gastrointestinal system can cause a dog to vomit white liquid. 5. Ingesting indigestible matter: When a dog consumes something that it cannot digest properly, such as hair, grass, or plastic, it may throw up white liquid. Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing? While questions 1 and 2 both concern dogs vomiting, they are not technically asking the same thing. Question 1 is specifically about dogs vomiting yellow foam, while question 2 is about dogs vomiting white liquid. However, there is some overlap in the causes for these symptoms, such as gastrointestinal issues, empty stomach, and ingestion of indigestible matter. In both cases, it is crucial to monitor your dog's health and consult a veterinarian if symptoms persist or worsen."},{"question":"Here's a short story: Penelope kicks the ball along the grass surface of a soccer field, then later she kicks it with the same force along an artificial turf field.

Friction is a force that resists the motion of two surfaces as they rub against each other, and it is affected by the roughness or smoothness of the surfaces involved. Grass, as a natural surface, tends to be more uneven and rougher than artificial turf. Grass blades can create additional resistance against the ball, and the soft, yielding nature of the soil underneath the grass can absorb some of the energy that the ball has, causing the ball to slow down more quickly. Moreover, natural grass fields are often affected by factors such as humidity and changes in weather conditions, which can further increase the inconsistency and roughness of the playing surface. Artificial turf, on the other hand, is made from synthetic fibers designed to mimic the appearance of grass. These fibers are usually more uniform and smoother in texture, and the surface created is less prone to the inconsistencies of natural grass. This translates to lower friction between the ball and the artificial turf, allowing the ball to roll for a longer time and distance when kicked with the same force compared to when it is kicked on a grass field. In conclusion, Penelope's observation that the ball rolls longer on the artificial turf can be attributed to the smoother surface provided by the artificial turf, which results in reduced friction acting on the ball and allows it to cover a greater distance."},{"question":"In this task, you're given the title of a five-sentence story and the first four sentences.

Dedicated to honoring country music and its history, the Opry showcases a mix of famous singers and contemporary chart-toppers performing country, bluegrass, Americana, folk, gospel, and comedic performances and skits. It attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors from around the world and millions of radio and Internet listeners. The Grand Ole Opry started as the WSM Barn Dance in the new fifth-floor radio studio of the National Life & Accident Insurance Company in downtown Nashville on November 28, 1925. On October 18, 1925, management began a program featuring \\"Dr. Humphrey Bate and his string quartet of old-time musicians.\\" On November 2, WSM hired long-time announcer and program director George D. \\"Judge\\" Hay, an enterprising pioneer from the National Barn Dance program at WLS in Chicago, who was also named the most popular radio announcer in America as a result of his radio work with both WLS and WMC in Memphis, Tennessee. Hay launched the WSM Barn Dance with 77-year-old fiddler Uncle Jimmy Thompson on November 28, 1925, which is celebrated as the birth date of the Grand Ole Opry. Some of the bands regularly on the show during its early days included Bill Monroe, the Possum Hunters (with Dr. Humphrey Bate), the Fruit Jar Drinkers with Uncle Dave Macon, the Crook Brothers, the Binkley Brothers' Dixie Clodhoppers, Sid Harkreader, Deford Bailey, Fiddlin' Arthur Smith, and the Gully Jumpers. Judge Hay, however, liked the Fruit Jar Drinkers and asked them to appear last on each show because he wanted to always close each segment with \\"red hot fiddle playing\\". They were the second band accepted on Barn Dance, with the Crook Brothers being the first. When the Opry began having square dancers on the show, the Fruit Jar Drinkers always played for them.

In 2013 she announced that she would no longer be touring with the band due to her worsening hyperacusis. - Indie rock is a genre of alternative rock that originated in the United States and the United Kingdom in the 1980s. Indie rock encapsulates indie pop and lo-fi, among others. Originally used to describe record labels, the term became associated with the music they produced and was initially used interchangeably with alternative rock. As grunge and punk revival bands in the US, and then Britpop bands in the UK, broke into the mainstream in the 1990s, it came to be used to identify those acts that retained an outsider and underground perspective. In the 2000s, as a result of changes in the music industry and the growing importance of the Internet, some indie rock acts began to enjoy commercial success, leading to questions about its meaningfulness as a term. - Here 's to Shutting Up is the eighth studio album by Superchunk . Brian Paulson , who served as co-producer , previously worked with the band on 1994 's Foolish .

Formed in 1989, they were one of the bands that helped define the Chapel Hill music scene of the 1990s. Their energetic, high-velocity style and do-it-yourself ethics were influenced by punk rock. - Ralph Lee \\"Mac\\" McCaughan (born July 12, 1967) is an American musician and record label owner, based in North Carolina. His main musical projects have been Superchunk since 1989 and Portastatic since the early 1990s. In 1989 he founded the independent record label Merge Records with Superchunk bandmate Laura Ballance. - Punk rock (or simply \\"punk\\") is a rock music genre that developed in the early to mid 1970s in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \\"proto-punk\\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels.

New experiments show that may not be true, even within a vacuum. Sometimes, light slows a bit. The new research is\\"very impressive work\\", Robert Boyd toldScienceNews.An optical physicist at the University of Rochester in New York, he did not work on the study. He speaks of the new finding:\\"It's the sort of thing that's so obvious; you wonder why you didn't think of it first.\\" Light travels as particles and as waves. Photons are the name given to those particles that represent the smallest possible amount of light. At their fastest, photons travel nearly 300 million meters (almost 1 billion feet) in a single second. That's fast enough to get to the moon and back in about 2.6 seconds. Scientists had long known, though, that they could slow light photons down by shining them through a material such as glass or water. Still, light moving through a vacuum has usually been assumed to move at a peak speed. That would seem to make sense. After all, a vacuum is a space with nothing in it to slow light down. In a new study, however, scientists show that even racing through a vacuum, light can slow. So the speed of light is more of a universal speed limit than an rule for how fast photons travel, the new data suggest. Miles Padgett led the new study. As an optical physicist, he works at the University of Glasgow in Scotland. He and his colleagues showed that the key to slowing light is to change the shape of a light wave. Padgett described how they did this in a paper published online January 22 inScience. His team raced a pair of photons. One traveled unchanged through a cable made from optical fibers. The other passed through a pair of devices that acted like lenses. A lens changes light: It can focus a spread-out beam of light on a point, for instance. The second photon passed through one device that changed the shape of its waveand another that changed it back to its original form. The first photon won the race.

First he offers her an ice cream made of snow and icicle, which she accepts. Next, he tries catching her a fish, but only succeeds in catching a pufferfish. Polly accepts it graciously, but when she swallows it, she begins inflating and deflating repeatedly until Peter makes her spit out the fish, which then returns to water. Peter shrugs in embarrassment, but, feeling humiliated, Polly slaps him and leaves to swim on a small iceberg. On the shore, Peter kicks himself for letting her get away, but then notices a sharkfin moving towards Polly's iceberg. He squawks a danger warning to her, but Polly ignores him, thinking that he's just begging for forgiveness that he won't get. Soon enough, the shark attacks Polly, who swims away in panic. Needing to act, Peter picks up a stick and charges out to help. The shark chases Polly around the bay for several minutes. When it looks like he has her cornered, Peter arrives and clobbers him on the nose. Enraged, the shark starts chasing after Peter. After several minutes of fighting and swimming away from the shark, Peter tries to escape by climbing up onto a cliff with a boulder on top. Peter unintentionally dislodges the boulder, which falls into the shark's mouth, who then swallows it. Due to the boulder's weight, the shark sinks to the bottom of the bay.

Often humorous, anecdotes differ from jokes because their primary purpose is not simply to provoke laughter, but to reveal a truth more general than the brief tale itself, such as to characterize a person by delineating a specific quirk or trait, to communicate an abstract idea about a person, place, or thing through the concrete details of a short narrative. An anecdote is \\"a story with a point.\\" - Delaware is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic and/or Northeastern regions of the United States. It is bordered to the south and west by Maryland, to the northeast by New Jersey, and to the north by Pennsylvania. The state takes its name from Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr, an English nobleman and Virginia's first colonial governor. - East Coast Wrestling Association (ECWA) is an American professional wrestling promotion, founded by promoter Jim Kettner. It is home to the annual Super 8 Tournament, one of the longest-running independent wrestling tournaments in the country.it's also the home of the annual Super 8 ChickFight Tournament. In 2010, Kettner announced his retirement and turned the promotion over to Mike Tartaglia and Joe Zanolle. - A color commentator is a North American term for a sports commentator who assists the main commentator, often by filling in any time when play is not in progress. In other regions this role is variously referred to as an analyst or summariser. The color analyst and main commentator will often exchange comments freely throughout the broadcast, when the play-by-play announcer is not describing the action. The color commentator provides expert analysis and background information, such as statistics, strategy and injury reports on the teams and athletes, and occasionally anecdotes or light humor. Color commentators are often former athletes or coaches of the sport being broadcast. - The term suspension of disbelief or willing suspension of disbelief has been defined as a willingness to suspend one's critical faculties and believe the unbelievable; sacrifice of realism and logic for the sake of enjoyment. The term was coined in 1817 by the poet and aesthetic philosopher Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who suggested that if a writer could infuse a \\"human interest and a semblance of truth\\" into a fantastic tale, the reader would suspend judgement concerning the implausibility of the narrative. Suspension of disbelief often applies to fictional works of the action, comedy, fantasy, and horror genres. Cognitive estrangement in fiction involves using a person's ignorance to promote suspension of disbelief. - Professional wrestling is a dramatized athletic performance inspired by competitive combat sports. Taking the form of live events held by touring promotions, it is a unique style of combat based on a combination of adopted styles, which include classical wrestling, catch wrestling and various forms of martial arts, as well as an innovative style based on grappling (holds/throws), striking, and aerialism. Various forms of weaponry are sometimes used. The content including match outcomes is choreographed and the combative actions and reactions are performed to appear violent without injuring the wrestlers. Before the 1980s, these facts were kept highly secret, after which they were openly declared. By and large, the true nature of the content is ignored by the performing promotion in official media in order to sustain and promote the willing suspension of disbelief for the audience by maintaining an aura of verisimilitude. Fan communications by individual wrestlers and promotions through outside media (i.e., interviews) will often directly acknowledge the fictional nature of the spectacle, making the predetermined nature of the sport something of an open secret. The presentation of scripted events as legitimate is known as \\"kayfabe\\". - Open Secret is a 1948 American film noir directed by John Reinhardt, starring John Ireland and Jane Randolph. - Newark is a small city in New Castle County, Delaware, west-southwest of Wilmington. According to the 2010 Census, the population of the city is 31,454. Newark is the home of the University of Delaware. - In professional wrestling, kayfabe is the portrayal of staged events within the industry as \\"real\\" or \\"true,\\" specifically the portrayal of competition, rivalries, and relationships between participants as being genuine and not of a staged or pre-determined nature of any kind. Kayfabe has also evolved to become a code word of sorts for maintaining this \\"reality\\" within the direct or indirect presence of the general public. Though the staged nature of professional wrestling had been a frequent topic of conversation among the media and public since at least the latter years of the early 20th century, the professional wrestling industry did not formally acknowledge this until changes in the business during the 1980s professional wrestling boom prompted attitudes within the business to change. In 1989, World Wrestling Federation owner Vince McMahon testified before the New Jersey state senate that wrestling was staged. Long sanctioned by New Jersey and other states as an athletic exhibition for regulation and taxation purposes, McMahon sought to eliminate oversight, and hence taxation, on the WWF's house shows and pay-per-view events held within the state. - In general, spectacle refers to an event that is memorable for the appearance it creates. Derived in Middle English from c. 1340 as \\"specially prepared or arranged display\\" it was borrowed from Old French \\"spectacle\\", itself a reflection of the Latin \\"spectaculum\\" \\"a show\\" from \\"spectare\\" \\"to view, watch\\" frequentative form of \\"specere\\" \\"to look at.\\" The word \\"spectacle\\" has also been a term of art in theater dating from the 17th century in English drama. - Martial arts are codified systems and traditions of combat practices, which are practiced for a number of reasons: as self-defense, military and law enforcement applications, mental and spiritual development; as well as entertainment and the preservation of a nation's intangible cultural heritage. - The University of Delaware (colloquially \\"UD\\") is the largest university in Delaware. The main campus is in Newark, with satellite campuses in Dover, Wilmington, Lewes, and Georgetown. It is medium-sized approximately 18,500 undergraduate and 4,500 graduate students. UD is a privately governed university which receives public funding for being a land-grant, sea-grant, space-grant and urban-grant state-supported research institution. - A professional wrestling promotion (also federation or fed) is a company or business that regularly performs shows involving professional wrestling. \\"Promotion\\" also describes a role which entails management, advertising and logistics of running a wrestling event (\\"see promoter\\"). Within the convention of the show, the company is a sports governing body which sanctions wrestling matches and gives authority to the championships and is responsible for determining the divisions, rankings, etc. of wrestlers.

One of the least understood involves the peculiar roles of producer or \\"provider\\" and purchaser or \\"consumer\\" in the typical doctor-patient relationship. In most sectors of the economy, it is the seller who attempts to attract a potential buyer with various appealing factors of price, quality, and use, and it is the buyer who makes the decision. Such condition, however, is not common in most of the health-care industry. In the health-care industry, the doctor-patient relationship is the mirror image of the ordinary relationship between producer and consumer. Once an individual has chosen to see a physician -- and even then there may be no real choice -- it is the physician who usually makes all significant purchasing decisions: whether the patient should return \\"next Wednesday\\", whether X-rays are needed, whether drugs should be prescribed, etc. It is rare that a patient will challenge such professional decisions or raise in advance questions about price, especially when the disease is regarded as serious. This is particularly significant in relation to hospital care. The physician must certify the need for hospitalization, determine what procedures will be performed, and announce when the patient may be discharged. The patient may be consulted about some of the decisions, but in general it is the doctor's judgments that are final. Little wonder then that in the eye of the hospital it is the physician who is the real \\"consumer\\". As a consequence, the medical staff represents the \\"power center\\" in hospital policy and decision-making, not the administration. Although usually there are in this situation four identifiable participants-- the physician, the hospital, the patient, and the payer (generally an insurance carrier or government)-- the physician makes the essential decisions for all of them.

Question: what is the second to last product mentioned? Context: In 1931, RCA Victor introduced their vinyl-based Victrolac compound as a material for some unusual-format and special-purpose records. By the end of the 1930s vinyl's advantages of light weight, relative unbreakability and low surface noise had made it the material of choice for prerecorded radio programming and other critical applications. When it came to ordinary 78 rpm records, however, the much higher cost of the raw material, as well as its vulnerability to the heavy pickups and crudely mass-produced steel needles still commonly used in home record players, made its general substitution for shellac impractical at that time. During the Second World War, the United States Armed Forces produced thousands of 12-inch vinyl 78 rpm V-Discs for use by the troops overseas. After the war, the wider use of vinyl became more practical as new record players with relatively lightweight crystal pickups and precision-ground styli made of sapphire or an exotic osmium alloy proliferated. In late 1945, RCA Victor began offering special transparent red vinyl De Luxe pressings of some classical 78s, at a de luxe price. Later, Decca Records introduced vinyl Deccalite 78s, while other record companies came up with vinyl concoctions such as Metrolite, Merco Plastic and Sav-o-flex, but these were mainly used to produce \\"unbreakable\\" children's records and special thin vinyl DJ pressings for shipment to radio stations.

German:","response":"Kieser Training ist ein Franchisesystem und sucht stets nach neuen Partnern mit unternehmerischen Fähigkeiten, um als einzelne Franchisenehmer in Deutschland und als Master-Franchisenehmer weltweit zu agieren. Step-by-step explanation: 1. First, I translated \\"Kieser Training is a franchise system\\" to \\"Kieser Training ist ein Franchisesystem\\" since this is a proper noun and \\"Franchise system\\" is simply \\"Franchisesystem\\" in German. 2. I translated \\"always looking for\\" to \\"stets nach\\" to convey the constant search for new partners. 3. I translated \\"new partners\\" to \\"neuen Partnern\\". In German, \\"new\\" becomes \\"neuen\\", and \\"partners\\" is \\"Partnern\\". 4. I translated \\"with entrepreneurial skills\\" to \\"mit unternehmerischen Fähigkeiten\\". In German, \\"with\\" is \\"mit\\", \\"entrepreneurial\\" becomes \\"unternehmerischen\\", and \\"skills\\" is \\"Fähigkeiten.\\" 5. I translated \\"to act as\\" to \\"um...zu agieren\\". \\"Act as\\" can be translated to \\"agieren als\\" and combined with \\"zu\\" to serve the purpose of \\"in order to\\" in German. 6. I translated \\"single franchisees\\" to \\"einzelne Franchisenehmer\\" which means \\"individual franchisees.\\" In German, \\"single\\" becomes \\"einzelne\\", and \\"franchisees\\" is \\"Franchisenehmer\\". 7. I translated \\"in Germany\\" to \\"in Deutschland\\". The country name does not change. 8. I translated \\"and\\" to \\"und\\" to connect the phrases. 9. Lastly, I translated \\"master franchisees worldwide\\" to \\"Master-Franchisenehmer weltweit\\". The term \\"master franchisees\\" stays similar in form as \\"Master-Franchisenehmer\\" with a hyphen, and \\"worldwide\\" is translated to \\"weltweit\\" in German."},{"question":"In this task, you are given a context tweet, a question and corresponding answer of given question.

Let's analyze the options provided: 1. Move about: This is not a location but an action, so it's not the correct answer. 2. City: Cities tend to have more buildings and densely populated areas, and fewer fields and woodlands. Therefore, it is unlikely that the thoroughfare is passing through a city. 3. Country: The mention of fields and woods implies a more natural and less densely populated area, which aligns well with a rural, countryside setting. This option seems most appropriate. 4. Town: Although towns can have fields and woods, they usually have more buildings and inhabitants than the countryside. Therefore, town might not be the most accurate option. 5. New York City: This is a highly urbanized and densely populated area with very few fields and woodlands, making it an unlikely setting for the thoroughfare described.

Answer:","response":"The West Bank and Gaza Strip are two territories in the Middle East that are inhabited predominantly by Palestinians and have been subject to varying degrees of Israeli control. Step 1: Identify West Bank The West Bank, named for its location west of the Jordan River, is a landlocked territory bordered by Israel to the west, north, and south and Jordan to the east. This territory has been under Israeli occupation since the Six-Day War in 1967, although varying levels of self-administration have been granted to the Palestinian Authority. It is home to both Palestinian Arabs and Israeli settlers. The status and boundaries of the West Bank are a central issue in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with Palestinians claiming it as part of a future independent state and Israelis arguing about different solutions. Step 2: Identify Gaza Strip The Gaza Strip is a small, densely populated coastal territory bordered by Israel to the north and east, Egypt to the south, and the Mediterranean Sea to the west. Like the West Bank, it has been subject to Israeli control since 1967, although it has been governed by the Palestinian militant group Hamas since 2007. Israel withdrew its troops and settlers from the Gaza Strip in 2005 but maintains control over the territory's airspace, territorial waters and border crossings (excluding the land border with Egypt, which is controlled by Egypt). The Gaza Strip has been a frequent flashpoint of violence between Israel and Hamas. Step 3: Summarize In summary, the West Bank and Gaza Strip are two territories of geopolitical importance in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Both have been subject to Israeli control since 1967, though they are inhabited primarily by Palestinians who seek to establish an independent state in these territories. Israel maintains different degrees of control and restriction over the territories and continues to be involved in territorial disputes concerning these regions."},{"question":"Ray Trickett - Ray Trickett is a British actor.

Article: Television is a relatively stable advertising medium. In many ways, the television ads today are almost the same to those two decades ago. Most television ads still feature actors, still run 30 or 60 seconds, and still show a product. However, the different medium of the Internet causes unique challenges to advertisers, forcing them to adapt their practices and techniques. In the early days of Internet marketing, online advertisers used banner and pop-up ads to attract customers. These techniques reached large audiences, led to many sales leads, and came at a low cost. However, a small number of Internet users began to consider these advertising techniques annoying. Yet because marketing strategies relying heavily on banners and pop-ups produced results, companies invested growing amounts of money into purchasing these ad types. As consumers became more complicated, frustration with these online advertising techniques grew. Independent programmers began to develop tools that blocked banner and pop-up ads. A major development in online marketing came with the introduction of pay-per-click ads. Unlike banner or pop-up ads, which originally required companies to pay every time a website visitor saw an ad, pay-per-click ads allowed companies to pay only when an interested potential customer clicked on an ad. More importantly, however, these ads are not affected by the pop-up and banner blockers. As a result of these advantages and the incredible growth in the use of search engines, which provide excellent places for pay-per-click advertising, a great number of companies began turning to pay-per-click marketing. However, as with the banner and pop-up ads, pay-per-click ads came with their shortcomings. When companies began pouring billions of dollars into this emerging medium, online advertising specialists started to notice the presence of what would later be called click fraud : representatives of a company with no interest in the product advertised by a competitor click on the competitor's ads simply to...

Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life.

Can we infer the following? Due to its success there is another movie festival is being planned to be held in Macau","response":"Based on the information provided, the 3rd Macau International Movie Festival ceremony, which took place on December 7, 2011, celebrated the best films of 2011 in the Greater China Region. This event was held at the Venetian Macao and was organized by the Macau Film and Television Media Association and the China International Cultural Communication Center. Given the fact that it was the third edition of the festival, we could deduce that it has been successful in the past, as typically, events of this nature need a level of success and support from the community and industry to continue being held year after year. This fact alone, however, does not necessarily guarantee that another edition of the film festival is currently being planned or will be held in Macau. Several factors would need to be considered for another movie festival to take place, such as financial commitments, support from the local and international film industry, sponsorship deals, partnerships, as well as other logistical aspects. Also, the interest and growth in the local film and entertainment industry could influence the continuity of such an event in Macau. It is important to mention that the Macau International Movie Festival has, in fact, continued to take place after the 3rd edition. As of 2021, the festival completed its 11th edition in May 2021, which was organized by the Macau Arts Development Association. This shows that the event not only continued after the initial ceremony mentioned but has also demonstrated consistent success and growth, solidifying its importance in the regional and international film scenes. In conclusion, although we cannot infer directly from the information provided that another movie festival was being planned to be held in Macau after the 3rd edition in 2011, examining the festival's history and its continued occurrence through subsequent editions suggests that it indeed has been a successful event, as it has continued to be held annually in Macau, with its 11th edition in 2021."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: What is the final step of the following process: - The liver removes toxins from the blood - Liver also cleans blood that has just been enriched with vitamins and minerals during digestion - Liver processes the good stuff into forms that the rest of the body can use - Waste or stuff your body doesn't need can be carried by bile back into the intestine or into the kidneys - The liver also produces a digestive juice called bile that helps the body absorb fat into the bloodstream A:","response":"The final step of the process mentioned is the absorption of fat and fat-soluble vitamins into the bloodstream through the action of bile, a digestive juice produced by the liver. To provide a detailed summary of the entire process: 1. The liver removes toxins from the blood: As blood flows through the body, it picks up various toxins and harmful substances. The liver plays a crucial role in detoxifying the blood, by filtering out these harmful substances and converting them into less harmful compounds or removing them entirely from the body via bile or urine. 2. Liver cleanses blood enriched with vitamins and minerals during digestion: After digestion, the nutrients from the food you eat, including vitamins and minerals, are absorbed into the bloodstream. The liver helps to metabolize these nutrients and converts them into useful forms that can be easily utilized by the body's cells. 3. Liver processes the nutrients into forms that the rest of the body can use: The liver plays a significant role in the metabolism of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. It converts these nutrients into simpler compounds (e.g., glucose, amino acids), which can be readily used by the body for energy and growth. 4. Waste or substances the body doesn't need is carried by bile back into the intestine or into the kidneys: The liver produces bile, which carries waste products and unneeded substances from the liver to the intestine or kidneys for excretion. This helps maintain the body's internal balance and prevents the build-up of toxic substances. 5. The liver produces bile that helps the body absorb fat into the bloodstream: The final step in this process involves the liver's production of bile, which is stored in the gallbladder and released into the small intestine during digestion. Bile contains bile acids that emulsify fats in the digestive system, breaking them down into tiny droplets. This process enables lipase, a digestive enzyme, to effectively break down the fats into fatty acids and glycerol, which can then be absorbed through the intestinal walls and into the bloodstream. Additionally, bile aids in the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) by creating a suitable environment for their dissolution and uptake by the body. In conclusion, the final step of the process involves the production of bile by the liver, which plays a significant role in the absorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins into the bloodstream. This is a critical function, as it ensures that the body can effectively utilize the nutrients it obtains from the digestive process for various essential functions and maintain overall health."},{"question":"Short movie review: superficial humor Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","response":"In order to review the movie, I need to watch it or gather information about it.

Electricity officials in heatwave-hit Texas have warned of impending rolling blackouts from power shortages as the U.S. state struggles to cope with the relentless scorching temperatures. Texans have turned to air conditioners in huge numbers in a bid to beat one of the hottest summers on record in America's second most populous state. But bosses for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) say the soaring power demand in the face of the brutal heatwave has left the state one power plant shut-down away from rolling blackouts. Starved of water: Texas State Park police officer Thomas Bigham walks across the cracked lake bed of O.C. Fisher Lake on Wednesday as the state battles the month-long heatwave. Lifeless: The remains of an alligator are seen in Fisher Lake, San Angelo State Park, Texas on Wednesday as the much-hoped for rain from Tropical Storm Don didn't materialise. Temperatures in Texas are currently topping 100F (37.8C) and have been soaring for well over a month. Record highs have also been recorded this week in nearby states Oklahoma and Arkansas as the relentless heatwave spreads across southern America. In Forth Smith and Little Rock, Arkansas, the mercury hit 115F on Wednesday. ERCOT, which runs the power grid for most of Texas, cut power to some large industrial users after electricity demand hit three consecutive records this week alone. The grid operator now faces rolling blackouts similar to those which hit Texas during a bitter cold snap in February. In Dallas, Texas, a pensioner died from 'heat-related' causes after her air conditioning unit was stolen from her house. At risk: A map shows 'excessively dry' conditions in, among others, Texas, New Mexico,. Oklahoma, Colorado, Kansas, Louisiana and Arkansas in southern America. Delores Grissom, 79, had the unit stolen from her front yard last month and died two days later after telling neighbours, 'I'm getting so hot'. Although the electricity firm have done their best to regulate power use and prevent shortages, experts admitted a further shut-down is a possibility. Arshad Mansoor, senior vice president at the Electric Power Research Institute, said: 'You always have to expect the unexpected can happen.'A unit can shut. The wind may not blow.' Ice storms in February crippled dozens of power plants, forcing ERCOT to impose rolling blackouts for hours as electric power demand outstripped supply. The drought in San Angelo, Texas, has been so severe that this lake was left with a fraction of water left which turned red. More remains of alligator gars are left by the brutal heatwave which has dried out several lakes in Texas. Power usage in ERCOT reached its highest level ever on Wednesday at 68,294 megawatts, almost four per cent over last year's peak. The Texas grid faces at least one more day of extreme stress before temperatures cool slightly over the weekend. Temperatures in Houston, the state's biggest city, should return to near normal levels in the upper 90s over the weekend, according to AccuWeather.com. The state's biggest power generators, including units of Energy Future Holdings, NRG Energy, Calpine Corp and others, have been running flat out to cash in real-time prices that have hit the 3,000/MWh cap in recent days. But the state's reserve margins have been running razor thin. On Wednesday ERCOT came within 50 megawatts of interrupting flows to industrial customers. One megawatt powers about 200 homes in Texas during hot weather when air conditioners are running for long periods. Extreme drought: Tropical Storm Don didn't offer any respite to areas like Manor, Texas. By the time it made landfall, Don had been downgraded to a tropical depression. Preparations: A line of cars crawls over the Queen Isabella Causeway as residents of San Padre Island move inland ahead of Tropical Storm Don last week. Kent Saathoff, ERCOT's vice president of system planning and operations, said more generation supplies would help, but added that state power generators cannot be expected to prepare for every extreme in weather. He said: 'You have to determine if it is worth spending millions or billions to avoid a one in 10-year event.' With record-breaking demand came. record-breaking prices. Prices for Thursday power topped 400 per. megawatt hour, the highest in at least a decade. Friday's power prices. approached 600. Real-time prices also hit the 3,000 market cap over the past few days. ERCOT has about 73,000 MW of natural. gas, coal, oil, nuclear and wind generating facilities, but not all of. that capacity is available all the time. Texas has the most wind power in the. country, but the wind does not blow during the summer. Ercot said it got. about 2,000 MW from wind during the peak hour on Wednesday.","response":"In August 2011, Texas faced an imminent risk of rolling blackouts as the state struggled to manage the surging power demand due to the relentless month-long heatwave that saw temperatures soaring above 100°F (37.8°C). The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which manages most of the state's power grid, revealed that they were one power plant shutdown away from implementing rolling blackouts, as they had already cut power to some large industrial users due to three consecutive weekly records of electricity demand. The heatwave was not limited to Texas, as nearby states, including Oklahoma and Arkansas, experienced record high temperatures. Severe droughts gripped the region, causing lakes to dry up and leaving wildlife carcasses, such as alligators, scattered across the lake beds. ERCOT reached its peak power usage at 68,294 megawatts on the day the article was written - a 4% increase from the previous year's peak. The capacity of the power grid in Texas was highly stretched, with reserves being at a razor-thin margin. Despite power generators, including Energy Future Holdings, NRG Energy, and Calpine Corp, running at maximum capacity, there were significant concerns over the stability of the energy supply. The Texas power grid was under extreme stress and faced at least one more day of struggle before temperatures were expected to decrease slightly over the weekend. However, there were no guarantees, as an additional shutdown was still a possibility. With the record-breaking power demand also came record-breaking energy prices, which soared across the state, reaching their highest levels in at least a decade. While ERCOT had over 73,000 MW of generating facilities from various sources, wind power, which Texas had in abundance, was not effective during the summer months when the wind did not blow. Despite the challenging situation at the time, ERCOT's Vice President, Kent Saathoff, argued that power generators cannot be expected to prepare for every extreme weather event, as investing millions or billions of dollars to counter the rare one-in-ten-year events would not be feasible. The situation in Texas is a crucial reminder of the importance of preparing for fluctuating power demands and weather-related power grid disruptions, especially as climate change intensifies weather events."},{"question":"Among the early blows struck for independence was a rebellion in the town of Olhão. On 16 June 1808, the townsfolk — armed with little more than ancient swords, spears, and stones — attacked and captured the local French garrison. It's said that a party of local men then set sail from Olhão all the way to Brazil, without maps or navigational aids, to tell the king of the insurrection. The real battle, however, was waged under the leadership of the Duke of Wellington, whose coalition forces expelled the French after two years of bitter fighting. The war left Portugal further weakened, and in 1822 its major empire outpost, Brazil, declared independence. At the same time, a dispute over the crown continually raged between Pedro IV, the absentee monarch who preferred to reign as Emperor of Brazil rather than return to Portugal, and his brother Miguel. The power struggle, with strong overtones of absolutism versus liberalism, excited the interest and intervention of other powers. With British help, Pedro defeated Miguel off Cape St. Vincent in 1833, and his expeditionary force marched to Lisbon. Pedro took the throne, though armed struggle continued for months and the lingering bitterness long after that. By 1892 Portugal, racked by wars and the continuing expense of maintaining its African colonies (including those of Mozambique and Angola), declared itself bankrupt. The seeds of discontent with absolutist rule were sown. Kingdom's End Bloodshed would haunt the remaining years of the Portuguese monarchy. On 1 February 1908, the royal family was riding in an open carriage along the Lisbon river front plaza, Terreiro do Paço, when an assassin opened fire and killed King Carlos and the heir to the throne, Prince Luis Filipe. The prince's younger brother, Prince Manuel, was also hit, but he survived and was thus propelled to the throne at the tender age of 19. Amid republican agitation, a surprise uprising led by elements within the armed forces deposed Manuel in 1910. Having ruled for less than three years, Manuel died in exile in 1932 in England. The sudden end of more than seven centuries of monarchy brought confusion and crisis to the country. Presidents and prime ministers were ushered into and out of office an unbelievable 45 times between 1910 and 1926, until a military revolution suspended Portugal's problematic democracy.

Dean and Knapp record that in early 1707 Keiser surrendered the lease of the Gänsemarkt to Johann Heinrich Sauerbrey, who thus became responsible for the staging of the double opera. It may by this time have been in rehearsal, and the difficulties involved in such a complex and elaborate work may have necessitated several postponements. The consensus among experts is that the two parts were first performed on consecutive evenings in January 1708, as they are the first works in Mattheson's opera list for 1708. There are no surviving records of the public's reception, the length of the original run, or of any revivals. Whether Handel was present at any time during rehearsals or performance is uncertain; he may have returned from Italy, fresh from the opening of Rodrigo in Florence, to supervise the production of Florindo and Daphne in Hamburg. Dean and Knapp suggest the works may have been directed from the harpsichord by Christoph Graupner, although Anthony Hicks in his Grove Handel biography, says that so unusual a project would not have been attempted without the composer's presence.The theatre's management was clearly concerned that the public might find the double opera too heavy in undiluted form. Accordingly, a comic intermezzo in Low German dialect (platte-deutsch) was devised by Sauerbrey to precede the performance of Daphne. The critic and essayist Romain Rolland, in his life of Handel, termed this a \\"mutilation\\", carried out \\"for fear that the music may tire the hearers\\". Answer:","response":"The name of the composer without whose presence, according to Anthony Hicks, so unusual a project would not have been attempted is George Frideric Handel. In the given article, it is mentioned that Handel might have returned from Italy to supervise the production of Florindo and Daphne in Hamburg.

[b]. wall was too narrow.","response":"[b]. wall was too narrow. Once upon a time, in a quaint little village nestled among the rolling hills, there lived a young and accomplished carpenter named Thomas. Thomas was well-known throughout the village for his extraordinary workmanship and his architectural ingenuity. One fateful day, Thomas was commissioned to design and build a unique, custom-made fake fireplace for the elegant home of the village's most prominent perfumer, Amelia. Amelia had always felt that a cozy fireplace would be the perfect addition to her living room, providing warmth and elegance to her gatherings with friends and fellow villagers. She had long envisioned this fireplace to be the centerpiece of her home, a symbol of her success and proof of her impeccable taste. And thus, only the best carpenter in the village would suffice for such a task. Thomas had created a stunning fake fireplace composed of finely carved mahogany wood with exquisite detailing that would leave even the most critical eye in awe. The ornate mantle glistened with polished brass fixtures and the reflective interior of the hearth invited visitors to bask in the golden glow of the fire. The fireplace was a truly magnificent piece, and Thomas could not wait to present it to Amelia. Upon arriving at Amelia's home, Thomas and his team began to assess the room in which the fireplace was to be installed. To their utter surprise, they realized that the living room wall was too narrow to accommodate the size of the decorative masterpiece. While the fireplace itself was not too wide, it turned out that the intricate designs and embellishments on the surrounding frame demanded extra space on the wall. Amelia, a well-mannered and polite woman, did her best to hide her disappointment, but it was clear that Thomas's dilemma was also her own. She had eagerly anticipated the installation of the fireplace, and now had to find another solution to the unfortunate predicament. Thomas, never one to admit defeat, offered a solution to Amelia. Eager to satisfy his client's wishes and to preserve the artistic integrity of his work, he proposed to design an extension for the living room that would accommodate the stunning fireplace. This extension would be skillfully crafted to seamlessly integrate with Amelia's existing architectural style while still allowing her fantastical fireplace dream to be fulfilled. Agreeing to the proposal, Amelia entrusted Thomas to reconstruct her living room to accommodate this beautiful fixture. Over the next several weeks, as the extension took shape on Amelia's stately home, villagers and visitors alike couldn't help but marvel at the carpenter's skill. Thomas's team worked tirelessly, integrating each piece of the extension with flawless precision, ensuring the finished product would be a true reflection of their incredible abilities. At last, the day arrived when the extension was completed, and Amelia's fake fireplace was carefully installed in its rightful place of honor. The magnificent combination of Thomas's handiwork and Amelia's unwavering vision had transformed an impossible situation into something truly spectacular. The fireplace became the talk of the town, and Amelia's home quickly turned into a hub for social gatherings and festive celebrations. The young carpenter's fame rose steadily as his reputation spread far and wide, solidifying him as one of the most talented craftsmen in the region. From then on, whenever a spectacular creation was needed in the village, everyone would seek out Thomas, knowing that he could create anything, even when faced with the impossible task. And as for Amelia, she was forever grateful for the hard work and dedication that Thomas had displayed, transforming her dreams into reality, immaculately showcased by the now famous, beautiful fake fireplace."},{"question":"Question: Article: Joe is a taxi driver.

Casper later helps Smiley to complete this initiation by helping him execute a rival gang-member. Casper is romantically involved with a girl, Martha Marlen. Fearing for the girl's safety, he keeps the relationship a secret from his gang, but his double life causes his gang to doubt his loyalty. When Martha follows Casper to a gathering of his gang, the gang leader, Lil Mago, escorts her out, despite Casper's misgivings. Mago attempts to rape Martha and accidentally kills her. Later, he blithely tells Casper that he will find another. Shortly afterward, Mago brings Casper and Smiley to La Bombilla, a location along the train tracks where potential illegal immigrants stow away on passing trains on their way to the United States. Among the immigrants is a Honduran family introduced earlier consisting of the teenage girl Sayra, her father, and her uncle, who are on their way to relatives in New Jersey. Lil Mago, Casper, and Smiley rob the passengers for any money they have until Lil Mago spots Sayra and attempts to rape her. Casper intervenes, killing Mago and then sending Smiley off.

Staying Calm: This is crucial for survival in not just ocean situations, but any life-threatening situation. Panicking can cause you to swallow water, struggle unnecessarily, and quickly deplete your stamina. Stay as calm as possible to save vital energy. 2. Float on your back: Lay flat on your back in the water, spread out your arms and legs, and arch your back. With your head tilted back, your body should stay at the water's surface, allowing you to float. Your buoyancy in this position is usually enough to keep your face above water. 3. Treading Water: Develop a good treading water technique. This involves a scissoring motion with your legs and a sweeping motion with your arms to maintain buoyancy and keep your head above water. 4. Regular breathing: Even if you are not a good swimmer, you can still keep afloat by just lying on your back and kicking the water at a slow but regular pace. Remember to breathe regularly so you don't build up carbon dioxide, which could make you want to breathe faster and risk swallowing water. 5. Using a flotation device: If you are on a boat and foresee the chance of ending up in the water, it is always a good idea to have a life-vest on. Even with no experience in swimming, a life vest keeps you afloat. To summarize, the key factors in staying afloat are staying calm, knowing how to float on your back and tread water, and possessing a flotation device if possible. Every person should learn basic swimming and survival skills."},{"question":"Premise: Samples, a 2001 graduate of Lewis &amp; Clark Law School, spent the summer traveling to dozens of labor camps throughout the Willamette Valley to talk with workers about their legal rights.

The act of looking through photo albums often suggests reminiscing or reliving memories stored in these pictures. But it does not provide explicit information regarding what these photo albums contain or what the young man is indeed doing or thinking while looking at them. The following conclusion that \\"A young man is remembering his childhood as he looks through books of photos\\" is an inference rather than a logical deduction from the original statement. This inference is founded on the commonly understood association between photo albums and personal memories, particularly childhood memories. Although this conclusion might prove valid in a practical sense since many people use photo albums to store personal and family photographs, and they look at them to recollect past events or memories, it is not a guaranteed logical outcome. From a strict logical perspective, the original statement does not provide any details about the content of the photo albums, nor does it state anything about what the young man is remembering or contemplating while he looks at them. The albums could instead be filled with art, postcards, or historical photos. The young man might be studying these for academic purposes or for personal interest. He might even be looking at these photos purely for aesthetic pleasure without any personal memories tied to them. So, while the conclusion drawn could be a plausible scenario, it is not an inevitable logical conclusion based on the information given in the original statement. It is crucial to differentiate between an inference made using additional assumptions and a direct logical conclusion deriving strictly from the given input. The latter demands that information be deduced directly and exclusively from the provided data without any further assumptions or projections.

The teen was hired at Pizza Studio in the Legends but was fired an hour later after asking her boss about her wage. Friday night, metro lawyers say she could have a pretty big lawsuit on her hands. Seventeen-year-old Jensen Walcott was excited for her interview at Pizza Studio in the Legends Outlet Mall, especially after hearing one of her good friends, 17-year-old Jake Reed had just been hired the same day. “She sent me a message like omg I have an interview at 3,” Reed said. Jensen was interviewed and hired on the spot. “She said good news, you got the job,” Jensen said. Jensen left immediately and called Jake to share the news, they’d be working together. “We were excited. We were super excited.” But soon, that excitement turned to confusion after Jake told her, he was making 8.25 an hour. She was hired for 8 an hour. The two are the same age, have the same amount of experience and were hired for the same position. Jensen thought for sure it was just a mix up and called her new boss, asking why her wage differed from Jake’s. The manager put her on hold. “I was like maybe when I'm on hold right now, she will just offer me 8.25 and everything is gonna be good but... she didn't do that,” Jensen said. The manager got back on the phone and told Jensen she was fired because discussing wages is against its policy. “She said you're fired. Basically just like a 10 second phone call,” Reed said. Both teens were terminated hours after being hired, for discussing their wages. “At any point did they say to you, do not discuss this, it is our policy?” FOX 4’s Megan Brilley asked. “No. Not once,” the two teens said. “At face value it appears, that the young lady was terminated because she complained about unequal wages.

A teen, a hero, a pay-discrimination advocate before even heading off to college. When 17-year-old Jensen Walcott was hired at a pizza spot in her local outlet mall, she was excited to hear that she would be joining her friend Jake Reed on the job, who had been hired on the exact same day. When she and Reed discussed their roles, however, she discovered that Reed had been hired at 8.25 an hour, while Walcott had been hired at 8 an hour. Considering the fact that the pair had the same work experience and are the same age and were hired for the same role, this seemed like a clear case of pay discrimination. So Walcott did something about it. The teen called her new manager to ask why it would be that Reed was given a quarter more than she was. Her manager put her on hold and came back to say that she had been fired because \\"discussing wages is against policy.\\" Reed was given the same treatment. But both teens assert that this policy was never talked about with them before being hired, and it is not illegal to discuss wages. Walcott could technically take legal action in this case, but all she's interested in is some answers. The teens: They're doing okay! ||||| Editor’s note: After publishing this piece, we received the following communication from Ashleigh Siefker, Executive Director of Operations at Pizza Studio: “Pizza Studio has fully investigated the incident and we want to be clear that gender did not play a role in determination of either salary, nor for any Pizza Studio employee. […] After an in-depth review, we are confident this instance was not one of gender-bias but rather a failure to assign the correct salary and a misunderstanding of our company policies by one of our employees; it should be noted the manager in communication with Miss Walcott is also a female. Pizza Studio did not agree however with how the manager handled the situation. We pride ourselves with treating our employees and guests with respect and open communication at all times. We have extended a formal apology to both Miss Walcott and Mr. Reed and have parted ways with the responsible manager in the best interest of all parties involved. We plan to use this experience to better improve our hiring procedures and policies moving forward.” *** Wage inequality between men and women rears its ugly head again, this time for a Kansas teen that discovered her male friend was making more money than she was for the same job. When she questioned what she thought was an innocent mistake, her manager fired her. Jensen Walcott, 17, began her job at Pizza Studio for 8 an hour, excited to finally land a summer job. She was also delighted when she learned that her good friend Jake Reed, also 17, would be working with her. That is, until she learned that even with the exact same experience and skill set, he was hired at 8.25 an hour. When she asked her manager to fix the problem, her manager fired her and Jake for discussing wages, apparently against policy for Pizza Studio. This does not, however, address the question of why they were paid unequal wages in the first place. According to the National Labor Relations Board, it’s entirely appropriate for employees to discuss wages. And despite the passage of the Equal Pay Act of 1963, which requires that men and women in the same work place be given equal pay for equal work, the “gender gap” in pay continues to this day. According to the Institute for Women’s Policy Research (IWPR), there was a 21-percent wage gap between full-time male and female workers in 2014. The pay gap is even greater for African-American and Latina women, with African-American women earning .64 and Latina women earning .56 for every dollar earned by a white non-Hispanic man. Claudia Goldin recently discussed this for a Freakonomics radio session called “The True Story of the Gender Pay Gap.” Goldin is the first woman to get tenure in the Harvard economics department, so I’m going to go out on a limb and say she knows more about this than I do. Goldin cites several factors including “occupational segregation,” which essentially means men and women traditionally apply for jobs in different job sectors (i.e. more women are nurses and more men are doctors, though this gap is shrinking). Though in Jensen’s case, it appears she was simply paid less for having a vagina. Also temporal flexibility, the ability to put in hours when you can, is more important to women because of the “parent penalty,” which Goldin says can also contribute to a difference in wages. What everyone seems to be missing here is women place importance on this because we are required to be the more flexible worker in order to take care of our families. We are not doing less work. In fact, I know many women who work as much as possible in the office; take kids to activities, doctor appointments, make meals, and get them to bed; and THEN sit up until midnight finishing their day jobs. If the work is getting completed, this obligatory flexibility deserves less income why exactly? There is also an inbred belief on the part of most women that they don’t want to seem “difficult” or “spoiled” by asking for more money. When Jennifer Lawrence found out she was being paid less than her male counterparts for American Hustle, she blamed herself because she was a “bad negotiator.” This does not seem to be a problem for men because men are acclimatized from an early age to believe they deserve more. This is not an insult to men, but an observation that the opportunity exists for all of us to instill the same belief in our young girls. The fact that it is 2016 and we are still talking about this is ludicrous. Women make up nearly half of the U.S. labor force and are, in today’s society, more and more becoming the breadwinners for their families. When women are not paid equitably, everyone — including the men in their family — suffers. This is not a gender problem, this is everyone’s problem. h/t: MSN Article Posted 3 years Ago ||||| Jensen Walcott may be the new hero of the equal pay for equal work movement. The 17-year-old Kansas City, Kansas native was fired from her job at a pizza place in an outlet mall after she complained about receiving less pay than her male friend for doing the same job with the same amount of experience, according to New York magazine. Jensen told local news station WDAF that she heard about a job at Pizza Studio in Kansas City from her friend Jake Reed, who had been hired that same day, and when she applied and got the job, she called to tell him how excited she was. “We were super excited,” Jake told the news station. But as the pair compared notes about what Jensen could expect from the new gig, she found out that she had been hired for the same job as her male friend for less money: she was offered 8 an hour, while Jake was offered 8.25 an hour, according to the report. They had the same level of experience. Thinking it must be a mistake, Jensen called the Pizza Studio to ask the manager what was up, and the boss put her on hold. “I was like, maybe when I’m on hold right now she’ll just offer me 8.25 and everything’s going to be good,” Jensen WDAF. But that isn’t what happened. First, the boss fired Jensen, then she called up Jake and told him he was fired, too. Both allegedly violated the company policy of not discussing wages outside of work, which they had never been told, according to the report. It should also be noted that such a policy prohibiting employees from discussing their wages is illegal , and has been since 1935 for exactly this reason. Employees are allowed to discuss matters that pertain to their job \\"for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection,\\" according to the National Labor Relations Act. “She said you’re fired, basically, it was like a 10-second phone call,” Jake told WDAF. Attorney David White told WDAF that discussing wages is legal, according to the National Labor Relations Board, and that the case seemed to be clear-cut: Jensen was fired for complaining about unequal pay, he said. “Probably what happened — they're teenagers. They didn't think they'd complain,” White said . The incident comes just seven years after President Obama signed the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act into law, which strengthened the options for recourse available to workers who allege that their employers discriminate based on sex when it comes to wages.

She lives in Dallas, Texas with her family where she enjoys reading, roller derby, and complaining about the heat. Image: Martin Dimitrov/Getty Images Print School is officially out, which means teens everywhere will be flooding the seasonal job market, looking to make a little extra money slinging burgers, pulling shots and walking dogs. They don't expect to make a whole lot of cash at these endeavors, just a little something extra for a few fun outings or to save up for a bigger purchase, like a car. Still, every cent counts, whether you're a teenager or an adult. That's why when a Kansas teenager found out she was making a quarter less an hour than her male co-worker — even though they were the same age with the same amount of experience — she brought it to her boss's attention, thinking he'd want to fix the flub. She ended up getting fired instead, and this is extremely not OK. More: 13 funny graduation cap ideas that deserve an A+ In fact, there's tons of stuff about this story that fall squarely into the category of jacked up, beginning with the fact that the teen, whose name is Jensen Walcott, was being paid 8 an hour while her male co-worker was making 8.25. That's bad enough, because it suggests the trend of women being paid less for doing the same thing as their male co-workers begins as young as 17, which is how old both Walcott and her co-worker are. But when the teen brought the discrepancy to her employer's attention, they fired both her and her male friend, Jake Reed, for discussing wages at work. Prohibiting talk about wages is a popular practice, and it's always been an ethically murky one. Ever since 2014, however, it's also an unenforceable and illegal one thanks to an executive order from President Obama that bars employers from retaliating against employees seeking fair wages. More: I have to be honest: Other parents scare me more than pedophiles Both of those things are equally disturbing, but arguably the worst part of all of this is that we are regularly telling our children to do the right thing. That's what it appears the two friends were doing. Walcott and Reed were already friends, so it's completely natural to assume they would talk about what was going into their paychecks. That Reed was upfront with his friend about how she was getting the short stick is commendable, and it means he did the right thing. Then Walcott did what any employee with a brain would do: She stood up for her best interests and asked them to take the reasonable and ethically correct course and pay both her and her co-worker the same amount of money for exactly the same work. She also did the right thing. They both were punished for it. It doesn't have to stay that way. Pizza Studio, the teens' employer, was definitely in the wrong here, according to a labor attorney who spoke to a local news outlet after Walcott came forward. If she wanted to, she could seek recourse for herself and for her friend, and we hope she does. More: Neighbors called the cops on these parents for their unusual punishment Teaching our kids to do the right thing can sometimes seem like an uphill battle, especially in cases like this, where speaking out against inequality lands them in trouble. But we need to keep sending the message. It is seriously encouraging that Walcott at least recognizes that what her employer did was wrong. When we raise kids who understand inequity and that they're responsible for calling it out when they see it, we make it possible for them to stick up not just for themselves but for others as well. That's important. It's important that the next generation looks out both for their best interests and the interests of those who may not feel safe coming forward for a variety of reasons. It means our kids might be able to accomplish what we might not in our lifetime, which is to do away with this kind of crap. It might feel a little disheartening that the moral compass in this story were not the adults but two teens. But it shouldn't. It means that something we're saying is sticking, and if every kid speaks up the way these two did, we have a whole lot to be thankful for.

Over time, the cat will get used to your voice and scent and will be less afraid of being touched. Don’t worry if the cat won’t let you touch them very often at first, this is normal behaviour for a stray cat. If the cat won’t let you touch them, continue to talk softly to it until it is ready to let you stroke it. Many stray cats will interpret direct eye contact as threatening. Look briefly at the cat and then close your eyes or shift your gaze away. This will help the cat to feel safe and calm in its new environment. Over time, slowly increase the amount of eye contact that you give your cat. If you accidentally stare at the cat, simply shut your eyes for a few seconds and slowly turn your head away. Feed your cat at the same time each day. This demonstrates to your cat that you are a trustworthy source of food and will help it to bond with you. If the cat won’t eat the food you give it, try different cat food brands until you find one that it likes. Your cat will be calmer and less erratic with a regular feeding schedule. If you have multiple pets in your home, the stray cat may feel overwhelmed. Bring 1 animal into the cat's room at a time to allow them to slowly get acquainted. Once both animals seem comfortable, introduce another animal. Continue to repeat this process until all your pets are comfortable being in the same space together. If your other pets don’t normally respond well to new animals, place them in their carry bag for 15 minutes in the stray cat's room. This will help them to get used to each other very slowly. This time inside allows it to bond with your family and pets and will help it to remember to return home once it is let outside. Let the cat outside on a warm dry day and ensure that it is hungry. This helps to encourage the cat to come home to eat. If the cat is scared to go outside, walk beside it to help reassure it. Most vets recommend keeping the cat inside. What is a summary?","response":"A summary is a short and simple explanation of something. In this article, it tells us how to help a scared stray cat feel safe and comfortable with us.

This helps the kitty to trust us and feel happy in its new home."},{"question":"Question 1: \\"Why do Yankees say 'Math' instead of 'Maths' when the term is a contraction of 'Mathematics' (ie NOT 'Mathematic')?\\" Question 2: \\"When people say 'Maths' instead of 'Math' are they indicating plurality in some way?\\" Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","response":"The answers to the two questions would not be the same, as the questions address different aspects of the distinction between \\"Math\\" and \\"Maths\\" as contractions of \\"Mathematics\\". To fully address both questions, it is essential to explore the origins and implications of these contractions, as well as the regional differences in language usage. Question 1: \\"Why do Yankees say 'Math' instead of 'Maths' when the term is a contraction of 'Mathematics' (ie NOT 'Mathematic')?\\" Yankees, referring to Americans in this context, generally use \\"Math\\" as a short form for \\"Mathematics\\". The reason for this is rooted in the differences between British and American English. In American English, the contraction \\"Math\\" has been adopted as the standard abbreviation for \\"Mathematics\\". This stems from the use of singular and collective nouns, which varies slightly between the two forms of English. In American English, some collective nouns tend to be treated as singular and thus take singular verbs, while in British English, they are more likely to be treated as plural and take plural verbs. For example, American English would treat \\"Mathematics\\" as a singular noun with a singular verb, resulting in the contraction \\"Math.\\" It's important to note that there doesn't seem to be a universally agreed-upon answer as to why \\"math\\" was adopted in American English over \\"maths.\\" Specific historical and regional factors could have contributed to the pattern of usage, with the differing style gaining popularity across the United States over time. Question 2: \\"When people say 'Maths' instead of 'Math' are they indicating plurality in some way?\\" \\"Maths\\" is the standard contraction for \\"Mathematics\\" in British English, and other dialects, such as Australian English. Although \\"Mathematics\\" is a collective noun that refers to a field of study, it does indeed contain a plural element, as indicated by the \\"s\\" at the end of the word. British English, as mentioned earlier, tends to treat collective nouns as plural and use plural verbs with them. Thus, it is not surprising that \\"Mathematics\\" is contracted to \\"Maths\\" in British English, which retains that plural element. In essence, the use of \\"Maths\\" implies a plurality of concepts, such as the different branches or subsets of mathematical study (geometry, algebra, calculus, etc.). However, it doesn't necessarily mean that the user is referring to more than one specific calculation or process. In summary, the answers to these questions are not the same, as the first question focuses on the reasons behind the difference between American and British English's use of \\"Math\\" and \\"Maths,\\" while the second question explores the plurality aspect of the contraction \\"Maths\\". Both \\"Math\\" and \\"Maths\\" are acceptable contractions of \\"Mathematics,\\" and the choice between them is primarily determined by regional language conventions and a speaker's familiarity with those variations."},{"question":"Read the following article and answer the question.

The embattled Tesla CEO faced widespread backlash in July when he first called the diver Vernon Unsworth a “pedo” in a tweet – an unfounded claim against a man who was part of the international team that freed 12 young footballers and their coach from the Tham Luang cave complex. Musk, who had unsuccessfully attempted to assist the rescue mission, eventually apologized to Unsworth. Elon Musk's 'pedo' claim is evidence only of his grossly inflated ego | Zoe Williams Read more On Tuesday, however, BuzzFeed published two new emails from Musk, in which he called a journalist who has written about the dispute a “fucking asshole” and he launched new extraordinary claims against Unsworth, without providing documentation to support the allegations. Musk called Unsworth a “single white guy from England who’s been traveling to or living in Thailand for 30 to 40 years”, alleging that he had moved to Chiang Rai “for a child bride who was about 12 years old at the time”. He asserted that the city was “renowned for child sex-trafficking”. Ryan Mac (@RMac18) This was his first email to me after I asked him twice for comment on a legal threat from the rescuer's lawyer. He prefaced the email with \\"off the record\\" though I did not agree to that condition. Off the record is a two-party agreement. pic.twitter.com/szknfOMg0s BuzzFeed reported that it had investigated the allegations and Unsworth’s background, but could not verify any of the claims and said that it was unclear where the allegations originated. Unsworth, who said he was considering legal action after the original insults on Twitter, is now moving forward with a lawsuit, his lawyer said in an email to the Guardian on Tuesday: “Elon Musk’s campaign of publishing vile and false accusations against Mr Unsworth is inexcusable. Musk hopes to be sued and he deserves to be sued. He will be.” Musk’s email to BuzzFeed, which was a response to Unsworth’s latest legal threats, said: “I suggest that you call people you know in Thailand, find out what’s actually going on and stop defending child rapists, you fucking asshole … As for this alleged threat of a lawsuit, which magically appeared when I raised the issue (nothing was sent or raised beforehand), I fucking hope he sues me.” Musk also defended his original effort to help the rescue mission in a follow-up email. Musk confirmed to the Guardian on Tuesday that he had sent the emailbut did not immediately comment further. Tesla spokespeople did not respond to a request for comment. BuzzFeed said it could not locate any UK criminal records for Unsworth, 63, and also spoke with his girlfriend, who said she was 40 and had been with him for seven years. The controversy comes at a time when Tesla and Musk continue to battle intense negative publicity and embarrassing controversies. His seemingly impulsive tweets have repeatedly led him into trouble. Notably, Musk recently tweeted that he had “secured” funding to take his electric car company private, which prompted scrutiny from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and backlash from investors. Earlier this year, Tesla’s credit rating was downgraded to negative, with Moody’s citing a “significant shortfall” in the Model 3 production rate. The CEO also faced criticism after he slammed analysts on an earnings call in the spring, saying they should stop asking “boring, bonehead questions”. After the first attack on Unsworth, some investors demanded an apology and criticized Musk for distracting from Tesla’s mission. Julia Carrie Wong contributed reporting ||||| Elon Musk is apparently renewing his claims that a British diver who assisted in the rescue of a youth soccer team from a Thai cave earlier this year is a child molester. In a July tweetstorm, the Tesla Motors and SpaceX CEO labeled Vernon Unsworth, a diver who helped rescue 12 boys and their soccer coach from a flooded cave, a \\"pedo guy,\\" after Unsworth criticized a submarine rescue plan the billionaire had proposed. The tweet has since been deleted and Musk apologized for the comment. Musk doubled down on the accusation in an email sent last week to BuzzFeed News, calling Unsworth a \\"child rapist\\" who had moved to Thailand to take a child bride. \\"I suggest that you call people you know in Thailand, find out what's actually going on and stop defending child rapists, you f**king a**hole,\\" Musk wrote in an email that BuzzFeed published Tuesday. \\"He's an old, single white guy from England who's been traveling to or living in Thailand for 30 to 40 years, mostly Pattaya Beach, until moving to Chiang Rai for a child bride who was about 12 years old at the time.\\" Musk has offered no evidence to support his claims, and Unsworth attorney L. Lin Wood denied the latest accusation in a statement to BuzzFeed News. \\"Elon Musk can tweet his vindictive and vicious lie about Mr. Unsworth a hundred times and it will still be a lie,\\" Wood wrote in a statement. \\"After deleting the initial accusation and tweeting an apology, Mr Musk has continued to republish his false and unsupportable accusation. His conduct demonstrates that his recklessness is intentional and designed to harm Mr. Unsworth.\\" Musk's feud with Unsworth apparently began when Unsworth called Musk's involvement in the rescue effort a \\"PR stunt,\\" telling CNN his submarine wouldn't have made it 50 meters into the cave and saying Musk could \\"stick his submarine where it hurts.\\" BuzzFeed also interviewed Woranan Ratrawiphukkun, Unsworth's 40-year-old girlfriend, who said they have been dating for seven years but declined to answer questions about their relationship. Unsworth said in July he was considering legal action against Musk. Musk representatives didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. This article originally appeared on CNET. ||||| In an email to BuzzFeed News, Tesla CEO Elon Musk accused a Thai cave rescuer of moving to Thailand to take a child bride. The rescuer denied all the claims. Soe Zeya Tun / Reuters British caver Vernon Unsworth at the Tham Luang cave complex during a search for members of a soccer team and their coach in Thailand in June. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has renewed his attacks against a British man who played a key role in the rescue of a youth soccer team trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. Musk last month apologized for accusing Vernon Unsworth of pedophilia after the diver questioned the value of Musk’s contribution to the rescue, a small submarine that ultimately went unused. But in a series of emails to BuzzFeed News, Musk repeated his original attacks on Unsworth — and made new and specific claims, lambasting the rescuer as a “child rapist” who had moved to the Southeast Asian country to take a child bride. Unsworth denied Musk's accusations through his attorney. Though Musk prefaced one email with “off the record,” BuzzFeed News did not agree to that condition of the correspondence. (Per common journalistic practice, a conversation is off the record only if both parties agree to the terms. ) BuzzFeed News first emailed Musk last Wednesday to ask for comment regarding a legal threat made by Unsworth’s lawyer in August after the Tesla CEO renewed his apparently evidenceless criticism of the rescuer in a Twitter argument the day before. Musk responded without addressing the substance of the legal threat. BuzzFeed News followed up twice, once on Wednesday and once on Thursday, and Musk responded with two separate emails. “I suggest that you call people you know in Thailand, find out what’s actually going on and stop defending child rapists, you fucking asshole.” “I suggest that you call people you know in Thailand, find out what’s actually going on and stop defending child rapists, you fucking asshole,” Musk wrote in the first message. “He’s an old, single white guy from England who’s been traveling to or living in Thailand for 30 to 40 years, mostly Pattaya Beach, until moving to Chiang Rai for a child bride who was about 12 years old at the time.” “As for this alleged threat of a lawsuit, which magically appeared when I raised the issue (nothing was sent or raised beforehand), I fucking hope he sues me,” he added. It is unclear why Musk believes the allegations against Unsworth or what evidence he has to support them. Musk did not provide proof of his claims to BuzzFeed News, and BuzzFeed News could not verify any of the claims after reporting on Unsworth’s background. BuzzFeed News The Tesla CEO’s continued campaign against Unsworth offers a glimpse into the new ability of some of the world’s wealthiest and most powerful figures to directly attack private citizens who cross them — and will test the capacity of traditional legal tools against them. “Elon Musk can tweet his vindictive and vicious lie about Mr. Unsworth a hundred times and it will still be a lie,” Unsworth’s lawyer, L. Lin Wood, wrote in a statement. “After deleting the initial accusation and tweeting an apology, Mr Musk has continued to republish his false and unsupportable accusation. His conduct demonstrates that his recklessness is intentional and designed to harm Mr. Unsworth.” A spokesperson for Tesla did not immediately return a request for comment on Musk's newest allegations, and referred to a previous statement issued by the board in response to a question about its support for the company's CEO. The feud began in July when Musk tweeted that Unsworth was “a pedo guy” after the rescuer called the billionaire’s attempt to use a custom-designed submarine in the rescue effort a “publicity stunt.” Musk later apologized and deleted this tweets, but revisited the claim last week in an argument on Twitter, asking why Unsworth hadn’t sued yet if the accusations were indeed untrue. BuzzFeed News then reported that Wood had actually sent Musk a letter warning of a possible defamation suit in early August. Musk’s renewed attacks on Unsworth come after a series of erratic public gestures, notably a widely publicized suggestion that he would take Tesla private and the narration of his home life by the rapper Azealia Banks. And the new accusations leveled at Unsworth threaten to undermine a recent charm offensive intended to frame the CEO’s erratic behavior as the actions of an overworked luminary struggling to maintain his world-changing businesses. It’s been a particularly difficult summer for the billionaire, marked by Tesla’s missed production goals, clashes with reporters, and his failed attempt to take his car company private. Despite that, Musk still managed to maintain a dispute with Unsworth, a 63-year-old cave explorer and diver, whom he has now accused of taking a child bride. BuzzFeed News could find no evidence to support that claim, and Musk did not provide any documentation to support his accusations. Publicly available legal documents do nothing to support Musk’s claims: BuzzFeed News could not immediately locate any criminal records for Unsworth in the UK. Separately, a Thai immigration official named Ploy Pailin told BuzzFeed News that an individual on a visa would likely not have it renewed if they had been found guilty of criminal activity in the country. Pailin also said that while foreigners applying for visas in Thailand do not undergo mandatory background checks, those who are found guilty of serious crimes are often blacklisted by the government and can be removed from the country. BuzzFeed News BuzzFeed News also spoke with Woranan Ratrawiphukkun, a Thai woman who is Unsworth’s longtime girlfriend. She said she had been with Unsworth for more than seven years and has posted numerous photos about their relationship on social media dating back several years. Unsworth, she added, spends part of the year in Thailand and part of the time in the UK. Ratrawiphukkun, who said she is 40, declined to comment on Musk’s allegations against Unsworth, and referred a reporter to his lawyers. Among Musk’s other claims about Unsworth is that he was not part of the actual dive team in the Thailand cave rescue. While Unsworth did not dive for the mission, media reports and other people who were part of the rescue cited the Brit as instrumental to the effort, as he had previously mapped and explored some of the cave system and recruited some of the divers who went into the cave. “He may claim to know how to cave dive, but he wasn’t on the cave dive rescue team and most of the actual dive team refused to hang out with him,” Musk wrote in one email. In another email in which Musk wrote “on background” — BuzzFeed News again did not agree to these terms — the Tesla CEO said, “Never saw Unsworth at any point. Was told he was banned from the site.” A British diver on the rescue mission who had previously been in contact with Musk, Rick Stanton, denied those claims. “I've no idea what gave you those concerns about Vern,” Stanton wrote over Facebook Messenger. “They are completely unfounded. He was never kicked off site by anyone and worked continuously on the rescue for the full duration. He was pivotal to the entire operation.” Two Australian specialists who were brought in by the Thai government to aid the Thai cave rescue operation, Richard Harris and Craig Challen, also rejected Musk’s allegation. “Vern seemed like an excellent guy and absolutely vital to the mission,” said Harris, who, with Challen, helped in the sedation of the Thai boys before they were brought out of the cave by the British divers. “You must be confusing him with someone else.” “He was pivotal with his knowledge of the cave. [The] rescue wouldn’t have happened without him recommending the Brits were called,” Harris said. Photos and videos posted on Facebook by Woranan and members of the local Thai news media show Unsworth at the site through the duration of the operation, which lasted more than two weeks in the country’s Chiang Rai province. Some of those photos show Unsworth posing with other British members involved with the rescue. In his second email to BuzzFeed News, Musk commented on Unsworth’s interview with CNN. “Unsworth also said I was asked to leave by the Thai govt, which is utterly false. Thai Prime Minister thanked me personally per attached docs. I went all the way to area 3 with the Thai SEAL team, who were awesome.” Unsworth did say that Musk was asked to leave the cave in the interview, but did not specify who had asked him. Musk also supplied a letter to BuzzFeed News from the Thai prime minister thanking him for his team’s involvement in the rescue. “I wish to convey my deep appreciation to you and your engineering team for your expeditious and extraordinary efforts in constructing the Space-X mini-submarine 'Wild Boar' to assist the rescue operation of the Moo Pa Academy Football team trapped in Tham Luang Cave, Chiang Rai province,” wrote General Prayut Chan-o-cha. Elon Musk provided to BuzzFeed News In addition, Musk claimed that the mini-sub, which ultimately was not used in the rescue, was built to Stanton’s specifications, and that it was not deployed only because too much water had been drained from the cave. Stanton, however, denied that was the reason, and said he did not recall providing exact specifications to Musk. “We didn't use the tube because rescue operations were already well underway and it didn't have the necessary life support systems,” Stanton said to BuzzFeed News on Facebook Messenger. “Essentially, it wasn't developed enough. I do think it has promise in certain situations and I hope they keep working on it to get it in shape for evaluation and to be considered as a viable alternative in future underwater rescue scenarios.” In another claim, Musk noted that “the alleged threat of a lawsuit” from Unsworth “magically appeared when I raised the issue” on Twitter last week and that nothing had been sent prior to his outburst. L. Lin Wood, Unsworth’s lawyer, provided BuzzFeed News with confirmation showing that he had sent a note titled “Fwd: Defamation of Vernon Unsworth” containing the legal letter to the appropriate email address for Musk’s office at SpaceX on Aug. 6. BuzzFeed News corresponded with the Tesla and SpaceX CEO at a separate, personal email address that two sources confirmed belonged to Musk. One source, who had previously worked for Musk, noted that the email address can be accessed by the billionaire and his assistants. The source noted that it was not uncommon for Musk to personally respond to reporters and other people through that account. Wood did not respond to questions asking him to more specifically address each of Musk’s accusations, but suggested that he was moving closer to legal action. “Today the rich and powerful seem all too ready to tweet falsities in the hope and expectation that their wealth and position will protect them,” he wrote in a statement. “Pedophilia is too serious an issue to leave unchallenged. If Mr. Musk believes his wealth affords him protection from his lies and Twibels, he is sadly mistaken.” Here are the emails Elon Musk sent to BuzzFeed News reporter Ryan Mac From: Elon Musk < redacted > Date: Thu, Aug 30, 2018 at 6:43 PM Subject: RE: BuzzFeed News: Unsworth legal letter To: \\"ryan.mac@buzzfeed.com\\" Off the record I suggest that you call people you know in Thailand, find out what’s actually going on and stop defending child rapists, you fucking asshole. He’s an old, single white guy from England who’s been traveling to or living in Thailand for 30 to 40 years, mostly Pattaya Beach, until moving to Chiang Rai for a child bride who was about 12 years old at the time. There’s only one reason people go to Pattaya Beach. It isn’t where you’d go for caves, but it is where you’d go for something else. Chiang Rai is renowned for child sex-trafficking. He may claim to know how to cave dive, but he wasn’t on the cave dive rescue team and most of the actual dive team refused to hang out with him.

Thai Prime Minister thanked me personally per attached docs. I went all the way to area 3 with the Thai SEAL team, who were awesome. Never saw Unsworth at any point. Was told he was banned from the site. It is also total bs that the mini-sub wouldn’t fit through the caves. It was designed and built to specifications provided to me directly by Stanton and the actual dive team. The only reason it wasn’t used was that they were able to drain almost all the water out of the caves, so the underwater portion was very short, and the monsoon arrived later than expected. Those pumps were critical. Some of the Tesla team helped with electrical power, but major credit to whoever provided those pumps. They were amazing. I’m told they were from some company in India. ||||| Summary:","response":"Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, renewed attacks on British diver Vernon Unsworth, accusing him without evidence of being a \\"child rapist\\" and leaving Thailand with a \\"child bride\\", in an email sent to a reporter from BuzzFeed. Unsworth, who played a crucial role in the rescue of a youth soccer team trapped in a Thai cave, had previously criticized Musk's attempt to assist in the rescue mission with a mini-submarine as a publicity stunt. Musk's unsupported accusations came after he had previously insulted Unsworth on Twitter, and subsequently apologized. BuzzFeed reports it could not verify Musk's claims after investigating Unsworth’s background.

The Dutch Republic, long-time British ally, kept its neutrality intact, fearing the odds against Britain and Prussia fighting the great powers of Europe, even tried to prevent Britain's domination in India. Naples, Sicily, and Savoy, although sided with Franco-Spanish party, declined to join the coalition under the fear of British power.

The first pressing of the EP included an 88-page booklet with lyrics from every release from Float until this EP (the lyric booklet is titled The Living Human Curiosity Sideshow); later pressings of the album come without the booklet, but with an additional bonus track, \\"Facemelter\\". In addition, a limited number of albums were available direct from Def Jux with Aesop Rock's graffiti tag on them. In response to demands from his fans, Rock did less production on the EP: three songs are produced by Blockhead, three produced by Aesop, and one by Rob Sonic. During this time he was asked to join The Weathermen to replace Vast Aire. Aesop Rock was commissioned to create a 45-minute instrumental track for the Nike+iPod running system, entitled All Day. It was released in February 2007. Distributed via the iTunes Music Store and featuring his wife Allyson Baker on guitar and scratches from DJ Big Wiz, Aesop has described the release as \\"something that evolved enough that the sound was constantly fresh and attractive, as though the runner were moving through a set of differing cities or landscapes.\\" All Day was followed in August of the same year by Bavitz's fifth full-length album, None Shall Pass released in 2007.

His most famous writings are Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, its sequel Through the Looking-Glass, which includes the poem \\"Jabberwocky\\", and the poem The Hunting of the Snark - all examples of the genre of literary nonsense. In 1856, Dodgson took up the new art form of photography under the influence first of his uncle Skeffington Lutwidge, and later of his Oxford friend Reginald Southey. He soon excelled at the art and became a well-known gentleman-photographer, and he seems even to have toyed with the idea of making a living out of it in his very early years. A study by Roger Taylor and Edward Wakeling exhaustively lists every surviving print, and Taylor calculates that just over half of his surviving work depicts young girls, though about 60% of his original photographic portfolio is now missing. Dodgson also made many studies of men, women, boys, and landscapes; his subjects also include skeletons, dolls, dogs, statues, paintings, and trees. His pictures of children were taken with a parent in attendance and many of the pictures were taken in the Liddell garden because natural sunlight was required for good exposures. He also found photography to be a useful entree into higher social circles. During the most productive part of his career, he made portraits of notable sitters such as John Everett Millais, Ellen Terry, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Julia Margaret Cameron, Michael Faraday, Lord Salisbury, and Alfred, Lord Tennyson. By the time that Dodgson abruptly ceased photography (1880, over 24 years), he had established his own studio on the roof of Tom Quad, created around 3,000 images, and was an amateur master of the medium, though fewer than 1,000 images have survived time and deliberate destruction. He stopped taking photographs because keeping his studio working was too time-consuming. He used the wet collodion process; commercial photographers who started using the dry-plate process in the 1870s took pictures more quickly. Popular taste changed with the advent of Modernism, affecting the types of photographs that he produced. What is this?","response":"Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, also known as Lewis Carroll, was a famous English writer, who wrote a popular story called Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.

Rage Against the Machine broke up as a result of de la Rocha's departure, but the remaining three members of the band—Tim Commerford, Tom Morello, and Brad Wilk—decided to stay together and announced plans to continue with a new vocalist. Several vocalists jammed with the three, including B-Real of Cypress Hill, but they did not want another rapper or anybody who sounded like de la Rocha. Contrary to popular belief, Layne Staley of Alice in Chains neither auditioned nor was asked to join the new project. Tom Morello denied this claim on his Twitter account in 2015. Music producer and friend Rick Rubin suggested that they play with Chris Cornell, the ex-frontman of Soundgarden. Rubin also persuaded the three of them to go into group therapy with performance coach Phil Towle after the breakup. Rubin was confident that with the right new voice, Rage Against the Machine had the potential to become a better band; he believed \\"it could turn into a Yardbirds-into-Led Zeppelin scenario.\\" Commerford later credited Rubin for being the catalyst that brought Audioslave together.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose air is cleared in the lung happens, how will it affect a SMALLER amount of oxygen being delivered to the blood stream. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","response":"If air is cleared in the lung and a smaller amount of oxygen is being delivered to the bloodstream as a result of the perturbation, this would have an effect on the overall respiratory process. The primary function of the lungs is to provide oxygen to the bloodstream while removing carbon dioxide. When there is a smaller amount of oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream due to the perturbation, the body's cells receive less oxygen. This can directly lead to a lower overall oxygen concentration in the blood, known as hypoxemia. Indirectly, this can impact the respiratory process by triggering various physiological responses to compensate for the low oxygen levels. These may include: 1. Increased breathing rate: The body may attempt to increase the rate of breathing to take in more oxygen and exhale more carbon dioxide, leading to faster or deeper breaths. 2. Increased heart rate: To compensate for the lower oxygen levels in the blood, the heart may pump blood faster to try to distribute the available oxygen to the body's cells more rapidly. 3. Reduced energy production: As cells receive less oxygen, they may produce less adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the primary source of cellular energy. This can lead to fatigue, weakness, and reduced physical activity. Therefore, due to the perturbation of air clearance in the lung and resulting in a smaller amount of oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream, there is a direct effect on the respiratory process, which can have additional indirect effects on various physiological systems as the body tries to adapt to the change in oxygen levels."},{"question":"Write a sentence not in English.","response":"Step 1: Choose a language other than English.

They found it extremely useful as a supply and communication link between Canada (which they had taken over after their victory in the Seven Years' War) and New York. On May 10, 1775, less than one month after the American Revolutionary War was ignited with the battles of Lexington and Concord, the British garrison of 48 soldiers was surprised by a small force of Green Mountain Boys, along with militia volunteers from Massachusetts and Connecticut, led by Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold. Allen claims to have said, \\"Come out you old Rat!\\" to the fort's commander, Captain William Delaplace. He also later said that he demanded that the British commander surrender the fort \\"In the name of the Great Jehovah and the Continental Congress!\\"; however, his surrender demand was made to Lieutenant Jocelyn Feltham and not the fort's commander, who did later appear and surrender his sword.With the capture of the fort, the Patriot forces obtained a large supply of cannons and other armaments, much of which Henry Knox transported to Boston during the winter of 1775–1776. Ticonderoga's cannons were instrumental in ending the Siege of Boston when they were used to fortify Dorchester Heights. With Dorchester Heights secured by the Patriots, the British were forced to evacuate the city in March 1776. The capture of Fort Ticonderoga by the Patriots made communication between the British Canadian and American commands much more difficult. Benedict Arnold remained in control of the fort until 1,000 Connecticut troops under the command of Benjamin Hinman arrived in June 1775. Because of a series of political maneuvers and miscommunications, Arnold was never notified that Hinman was to take command. After a delegation from Massachusetts (which had issued Arnold's commission) arrived to clarify the matter, Arnold resigned his commission and departed, leaving the fort in Hinman's hands., what would be the answer ?","response":"The answer to the question, \\"What is the first name of the person who later appeared and surrendered his sword?\\" would be William.

Let's solve the equation together step by step, like a puzzle. Remember, we want to find the value of 'v.' The equation that we need to solve is: 0 = -100 * v - 40 * v - 1142 - 258 First, let's add the two numbers at the end, which are -1142 and -258. -1142 (minus one thousand one hundred forty-two) - 258 (minus two hundred fifty-eight) equals to -1400 (minus one thousand four hundred). Now, our equation looks like this: 0 = -100 * v - 40 * v - 1400 Next, let's combine the terms with 'v': -100 * v (minus one hundred times v) and -40 * v (minus forty times v) together make -140 * v (minus one hundred forty times v). Our equation now looks like this: 0 = -140 * v - 1400 We want to find out what 'v' is, so let's first move the -1400 over to the other side of the equation to make things simpler. We do that by adding 1400 to both sides of the equation: 0 + 1400 = -140 * v - 1400 + 1400 This simplifies to: 1400 = -140 * v Now, to find 'v', we need to divide both sides of the equation by -140: 1400 / -140 = (-140 * v) / -140 This simplifies to: -10 = v So the answer is v = -10, which means that the value of 'v' is '-10' (minus ten)."},{"question":"Brideshead Revisited is a 2008 British drama film directed by Julian Jarrold.

The laws were subject to fierce debate in parliament, with two opposition parties voting against castration. Human rights groups have objected to the punishments, arguing that violence will not be stopped by violence. The Indonesian Doctors Association said administering chemical castration would violate its professional ethics and said its members should not take part. The procedure entails injecting convicts with female hormones. It is used on sex offenders in Poland, South Korea, Russia, and some US states, among others. Prisoners in UK jails can volunteer for the treatment. The new laws also allow judges to sentence paedophiles to death or tag them electronically, and applies a 10-year minimum sentence for child sex crimes. Human rights groups including the National Commission for Women (NCW) criticised the laws and called for them to be re-evaluated each year to test whether they are a deterrent. Azriana, the head of the NCW, said: \\"Other countries that have chemical castration have not seen a reduction in sexual crime against children. Also it's a very expensive procedure and what we should be spending and investing our money in is services to support and help the victims.\\" Dr Yohana Susana Yembise, Indonesia's Minister for Women Empowerment and Child Protection, said the administration was \\"praying\\" that the punishments \\"will have the desired effect\\". She said: \\"Now we have the harshest punishments: the death penalty, life in prison, chemical castration, the public naming of perpetrators and the electronic chip.

Last year, a British-Canadian teacher and an Indonesian were jailed for 10 years for sexually abusing three children at a Jakarta kindergarten. And earlier this year, the body of a nine-year-old girl was found in a cardboard box in Jakarta after she had been repeatedly sexually assaulted and killed.

Debates were covered on front pages of college newspapers and emphasized in yearbooks, and team members even received the equivalent of athletic letters for their jackets. There even were rallies sending off the debating teams to matches. Yet, the debates never attained the broad appeal that athletics enjoyed. One reason may be that debates do not have a clear winner, as is the case in sports, and that scoring is subjective.

Answer:","response":"Title: Satisfactory But Needs Improvement Review: I've been using the com.google.android.gms app for quite some time now, and I think it's time to share my honest thoughts about it. This app has its merits and provides a decent experience overall, which is why I'm giving it a solid 3-star rating. Firstly, the interface is pretty sleek and modern, and it's quite easy to navigate even for a first-time user. The integration of Google services, like Maps and location services, within the app is a convenient feature. I appreciate how the app connects and syncs to my other devices; it comes in handy when I want to access my data or share my location. However, there are a few aspects of the app that could be better. The first issue is the occasional lag and slow response time, which can be frustrating, especially when using the app for navigation. Updating this app also tends to consume a significant amount of data, which may be a concern for users with limited data plans. Additionally, I've noticed that the app consumes a lot of battery life, particularly when using the location services. I find myself having to charge my device more often when using this app extensively. Lastly, the app sometimes crashes unexpectedly, leading to unsaved changes and lost data. An improved version with enhanced stability would be highly appreciated. In conclusion, com.google.android.gms is a fairly decent app with many useful features, but there's room for improvement when it comes to performance, data usage, and stability. I encourage the developers to address these issues in future updates to provide a more seamless user experience."},{"question":"Question: I know that the answer to the question \\"The university has just one building in what kind of geographical area?\\" is in \\"The University of Oklahoma has several institutions of higher learning in the city and metropolitan area, with OU Medicine and the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center campuses located east of downtown in the Oklahoma Health Center district, and the main campus located to the south in the suburb of Norman.

They also plot and combine measurements of geological structures in order to better understand the orientations of faults and folds in order to reconstruct the history of rock deformation in the area. In addition, they perform analog and numerical experiments of rock deformation in large and small settings. Output:","response":"The history of rock deformation gives information about strain within the crystalline structure of the rocks."},{"question":"Answer a question about this article: London has been the setting for many works of literature. The literary centres of London have traditionally been hilly Hampstead and (since the early 20th century) Bloomsbury. Writers closely associated with the city are the diarist Samuel Pepys, noted for his eyewitness account of the Great Fire, Charles Dickens, whose representation of a foggy, snowy, grimy London of street sweepers and pickpockets has been a major influence on people's vision of early Victorian London, and Virginia Woolf, regarded as one of the foremost modernist literary figures of the 20th century. Which author's novels painted a dismal portrait of Victorian London?","response":"Charles Dickens' novels painted a dismal portrait of Victorian London. As a prolific author, he was known for his depiction of the socio-economic challenges of the time and the grimy, foggy, and snowy conditions that dominated the cityscape during the early Victorian era. Dickens' representation of London resonated with its readers as it brought forth the struggles faced by street sweepers, pickpockets, and other members of society who were marginalized under this urban setting. His vivid portrayal of these characters and their respective environments has made a strong influence on people's vision of an often bleak and harsh early Victorian London. These portrayals can be observed in his works like \\"Oliver Twist,\\" \\"Bleak House,\\" and \\"Great Expectations,\\" among others."},{"question":"Tweet: @bmoyle was about to check it out but left for dinner will peep it tomorrow Predict the sentiment of this tweet.
